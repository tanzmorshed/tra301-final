","... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: ""Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.""<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed ""I feel a little dizzy"" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch ""I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!"" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour."

","Even if you can tolerate the shaky hand syndrome of an entire movie shot handy-cam, the poor dialog and weak, uninteresting plot will make you just as nauseous.<br/><br/>Once again, with NYC as the target, aliens invade. Not right away, first you have to bear the brunt of mindless early 20's drunken banter and the scandal that one of them slept with another. You also have to believe one of these guys is wise enough to actually be promoted to an international vice-president's position, but to the film's credit, it never did say that daddy didn't own the company.<br/><br/>Cue to the attack and as everyone is sanely leaving the city, the golden boy jeopardizes his group of friends, who stalwartly refuse to leave him, in order to rescue his scorned princess. Along their way they get plenty of reminders that they should turn around and run, but press on. Including a wildly unrealistic encounter with the military in which golden boy argues that despite countless thousands already dead, they should help him go get his girlfriend, but if they won't help him, then he must save his girlfriend and they can shoot him if they want to but he's going. Personally I wanted the military to knock him out, with drugs or by force, just so I didn't have to watch the movie any more, and perhaps the focus would change to something more interesting. The military, being the sweet, understanding people that they are known to be when under hostile fire from aliens, point him in the right direction and wish him much success.<br/><br/>The only thing amazing about the film is the battery life on the video camera. And if the battery power had to continue, I was cheering the invaders on, to find this group and devour them just so I didn't have to listen to them anymore."

","i went in expecting a scary monster movie.<br/><br/>what i got was 15 minutes of bad TV dialog, and 45 minutes of shaky-cam running through the streets. the acting was OK but the characters were really unpleasant. not only did i not care if they died, by the end of the movie i was rooting for the monster.<br/><br/>there were a lot of plot holes and the decisions everyone made were totally unrealistic. it was hard to stay in the movie because of the constant lapses of common sense and logical flaws. those kinds of things really annoy me when they could have been fixed with a line or two of dialog.<br/><br/>finally at the end of the movie there were a couple minutes of cool special effects. the rest of the movie was a waste of time."
"kanerazor","9","1056","1742","15 January 2008"," Tremendous thrills!
","Some people have derisively compared this film to The Blair Witch Project because it was all told from the point of view of someone's shaking camera. Unless you have motion sickness, I don't think that's a bad thing. What matters is who's in front of the camera. While The Blair Witch Project featured annoying people screaming at each other, this movie actually made me care about the characters. In fact if it had continued with the romantic drama tone established during the first half hour, I STILL think it would have been worth watching and that's the biggest compliment I can give it.<br/><br/>Of course people will be watching this movie for the visceral pleasure and Colverfield delivers. Many thrilling visual and sound effects wowed me (there were a few times I yelled out in shock at a sudden scare). Any horror film will also benefit from a sense of entrapment and this movie pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of making New York City seem claustrophobic because there was seemingly nowhere to hide from the monster.<br/><br/>What is the monster? Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 9/11 inflicted on New York, much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb. There are moments seemingly recreating the documentary footage from 9/11, and they give the film verisimilitude. Touching upon real life horror, plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about, and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over. Perhaps the 80 minute run time will bother some people, but on the other hand I think that's better than a film wearing out its welcome. Great job J.J. Abrams and company!"
"ilan-havinga","1","289","461","21 January 2008"," Is this a joke?
","What on earth is this movie doing with a 8.1/10 rating?<br/><br/>I think I'm being kind with a 3/10. It is just as a big a disaster for me as its trying to portray(but fails completely)<br/><br/>Now what puzzles me is why on earth would you go completely calm and focused towards an alien monster trashing the city with bombs being dropped on it? O please..to save a women who should have been dead but miraculously survives. She has a metal rod through her chest (or i think it was, with all that nauseating camera work) and should have died of loose of blood.... Now another thing i don't quite get is the camera...hmmm 10 hours of battery..yea, Captures all the good bits of an exiting adventure,HD quality and doesn't run out of battery or stop working from all the times its dropped and thrown in the movie! God i have to find a place where they sell these!<br/><br/>And now onto the acting...acting? Its not hard to scream and look really scared which is all they do..they don't even need to look convincing because half the time the camera is trying to look really really realistic and is filming the ground. Now this guys best friend that is filming...i don't think i have come across a narrator that annoying. What does he do in the movie apart from saying..omg what just happened dude?..what was that?Dude this is scary. I mean what the ****?When he finally dies after miraculously surviving a helicopter crash with his friends i rejoiced! Sorry for not knowing his name but even now i don't even know who's who?<br/><br/>Just don't bother with this movie, please I'm glad i only downloaded it first before going out to watch in the cinemas. You'll be wishing the movie to end so you can get on with your life."
"nightswatch","8","506","826","10 January 2008"," sneak peek early screen
","I attended an early screening 1/10/08 at Michigan State University. I've spoilerized in case anyone doesn't want to know anything about the film, but I will try to stay away from anything that'll be too overt.<br/><br/>Simply put, the film is an amazingly visceral experience. It's studio logo, production logo, film. No credits whatsoever, which just adds to the overall immediacy of it. If you've been following it to any degree whatsoever, you know that it's shot entirely with hand-held cameras. The characters also run. A lot. So immediately, I think this will be a love hate experience. My own reaction to it was that it again, added to the immersion, and I didn't find it to be really distracting at all. Many people I saw it with said they couldn't even watch the screen at times, so buyer beware. It also will anger those who need all the details, and need to have every loose end tied up (or even a majority of them). The entire film is the tape found after the events of the film are over. That's it. There is no set up, and no hold-your-hand-for-you resolution (or really, much of one at all). It's unconventional, and I enjoyed the ending TREMENDOUSLY. I definitely have to applaud the decision to not simply make a cookie cutter action film that is easy to watch. I think it will be interesting to watch how it does at the box office though.<br/><br/>After that...I feel like there isn't much that can be said about the acting, and that should be a credit to it. It absolutely feels like you are experiencing this with the characters, who feel more or less exactly like real people. After leaving the theater I was on edge for a good deal of time, as I tried to shake that level of immersion. The film is also surprisingly humorous, and I would say that our crowd laughed more than they screamed (although the screams were definitely there).<br/><br/>Cloverfield definitely will not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you're already excited about it, I have no doubt that you'll be satisfied. It was a relatively unique experience, and again I want to applaud the decision to make it in that manner.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended: 8/10"
"brc23","1","163","256","19 January 2008"," Duped by Excellent Marketing
","I have to hand it to JJ Abrams....we fell for this flick hook line and sinker.<br/><br/>The only downside is it COMPLETELY lacked substance. There was NO story. We went to see a monster movie only to find out NOTHING...I mean NOTHING about it. It was about stupid people who were unwilling to leave the city...and then were killed. Big deal.<br/><br/>In the end you didn't know how the monster got there, if they actually killed it, what it's powers were, what the little monsters were, where it came from, what it wanted....you never even got to see the entire shape of it or the use of all it's body parts.<br/><br/>It is the only movie I have ever wanted to walk out of. I just kept waiting for it to get better.<br/><br/>If Abrams ends Lost this way the world is going to come unglued!!!!!"
"NormalViewCasting","9","775","1301","17 January 2008"," Breath of fresh air
","It was nice to finally watch movie that didn't seem like anything I'd ever seen before. This, much like Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Children of Men"", completely immerses you in this incredible situation with absolutely no knowledge to comfort you. It's very disorienting, which adds to the experience; you never figure out what the hell is going on but you're so into survival that you put it past you. You're placed with a bunch of characters whom you get to know and eventually must join in their frenzied search for a friend while being subjected to some horrifying imagery and new threats.<br/><br/>The effects look great and realistic thanks to the hand-held camera, which isn't too bad-looking if you manage to get a seat further from the screen. The filmmakers came up with some really great creature designs that were menacing yet very much original. If you're bound to be upset over seeing a movie with a lack of music, then stay for the credits, during which a fantastic suite of music composed by Michael Giacchino titled ""Roar! (Cloverfield Theme)"" plays.<br/><br/>All in all, a fantastic time at the movies. A little more background on the monster would be nice, though the absence of this information is intentional. Everyone in the theater was rooting for a sequel; maybe a second set of footage is found elsewhere? Or perhaps there is more the the viral marketing -- what exactly were Slusho and Tagruato? Also be prepared to suspend some disbelief, but considering the movie is about a monster destroying New York City, that shouldn't be too difficult."
"Rumsfield","1","553","924","19 January 2008"," Clover-Woven-From-Other-Films
","I will admit, the marketing scheme behind this awfulness was clever. I mean, I like a good thrill ride monster movie. The Creature From the Black Lagoon piqued my curiosity as a youngster as I marveled at the brilliance of trying to understand something that has no explanation. However, it's hard to have this curiosity, no matter how intriguing the monster is, when the script is so tired its in a coma.<br/><br/>Yes, the monster is cool. No, the stupid hand-held camera gimmick didn't bother me. Yes, the special effects are great and at times I did find myself in awe of the spectacle on the screen as it does seem real, but the movie itself is so, so, so dumb. At any moment I felt comfortable to leave to use the restroom as I knew exactly what I was going to miss. The plot was a paint by numbers and I would have loved even a touch of Bob Ross to fill the blanks, but no originality whatsoever.<br/><br/>First they steal the overdone Hollywood bit about love. ""Dude, if you love her, tell her."" Response: ""I can't tell her, unless a mutant alien/ocean creature tries to expunge the city, only then will I try and make my move."" Why have this? Why not make the story the monster? Really, who cares about these characters? Who cares about Rob's job in Japan? It's flimsy? Why have it? The beginning clearly leads on that the camera is found, which means they all die. Standard operation of introducing characters that we shouldn't care about.<br/><br/>Second, they decide to steal a scene from a much better monster movie The Descent. ""Let's try night vision on the camera."" And this is in no way as scary as the movie that did it better. The Descent works better in every faction of story telling. It forces claustrophobia as it whispers the insanity and the entire film works as a metaphor for diving deep into the darkness of one's existence and summoning demons, ones we can't see coming (which is why I think those monsters were blind). Cloverfield does none of this. It's a, where can we run to next? saga. A 'B' movie. A well shot 'B' movie. <br/><br/>Third we have the comic relief one liner guy holding the camera. But in true fashion of a bad movie, he's not funny, just annoying. A few people in my viewing clapped when he was eaten. I love LOST. I think it's the best show on TV, but the writer here has proved that being a great psychological writer for the little screen does not translate to comedy. Bad Robot productions should hire one guy with a sense of humor. They may need him at some point. Hud's pinnacle of wit was ""That's terrible"" when he gets a good shot of the monster. Followed closely by, ""That's terrible too"" when we see when of its young-lings a few seconds later. Brilliant... improv? I can only guess the script consisted of locations and not so much dialogue since this boner had most of the words in the movie, words that seemed spontaneously driven from someone wait listed at community college. Horrible. I'm surprised he didn't utter, ""That's terrible cubed"" before he was engorged upon. Stupid, stupid, stupid.<br/><br/>Fourth, we have the killer/villain/monster has one last leap. Yes, we knew the helicopter was going down since they find the camera in Central Park. ""We killed him"" Hud proclaims, just before the monster elevates and slaps the helicopter to the ground. This is scary, why? Oh, it's not scary, and I find the idea of a thing like this really existing more logical than any of those bozos surviving the crash in the park. <br/><br/>Fifth, they've stolen from every Stephen King novel ever, because King should always have chapters taken out, and this movie should have been an hour long. Do we really need to see them walk up 57 flights of stairs and then back down and then bank up and then and then and then and then.... yes we do. Otherwise they don't have enough for a feature length movie. So trite and boring and not fascinating. Which is why the gimmick of a hand held camera was needed. Otherwise, they may actually need to give the characters some arc, have some purposeful shots of the monster, maybe create a reason for what it is and why it's there and, uh-oh, give it some originality. For anyone who thinks this movie is original it is probably because you are under 24 and either naive to creativity or just haven't seen any worthwhile movies. I wanted to like this I did, I really did. It just wasn't good. I can respect it, as I respect all movies that are made. It was well crafted and edited and the effects were amazing, but so what? All movies now have great effects. The Fantastic Four movies are not good, but their effects rock. War of the Worlds was awful, but I thought those things really came out of the ground. Effects and production don't make a movie. Not anymore. T-2, Jurassic Park, Men in Black, those movies were pioneers to FX being a character along with brilliant film-making. Now it is expected. Since it is expected there, I expect more from the story. This isn't it. If I were trapped in hell and I had a choice to watch either Cloverfiled or One Miss Call over and over, I'd pick One Miss Call. At least its badness is funny, which gives it some merit. Cloverfield is just bad. Textook, trite, clichéd, not smart, overdone, not scary, bad. Not as bad as Mission Impossible 2, but pretty darn close."
"tagehri","1","300","492","19 January 2008"," Very disappointing
","Well, I clicked spoiler, but the spoiler is that there are no spoilers. Nothing to the movie.<br/><br/>About 75% of the audience hung around through the end credits, and let me tell you, that was universally the most negative reaction I have ever seen to any movie in a theater.<br/><br/>Disappointment doesn't even begin to describe how these people felt (at least according to how they expressed themselves).<br/><br/>The movie is, fortunately, short; only 90 mins or so long. 20 mins of that is spent at a party you would leave after 10 minutes if you hadn't paid to get in--a going away party for some loser that looks like a guy from your company's mail room. Apparently this loser has been promoted (improbably) to be a VP for his company in Japan.<br/><br/>The party apparently is intended to set up whatever is supposed to pass for the movie's paper thin plot line. All it did for me was condition me to the intentionally awful camera-work. Yeah, I realize it is stylistic and all---but bad camera-work doesn't pass for action. No, running through a crowd jostling a camera around does not translate to movie magic on screen.<br/><br/>There will be internet fan boys that will tell you the movie is great, a must see, very intense. Whatever. They are deluding themselves. These people will have spent the last year or more pumping this movie for JJ Abrams and will be unable to admit to themselves or you that it is simply not good."

","I'm not sure why so many bad reviews. I saw this film back in 2008 and rewatched it several times after that. I still find this movie very effective, I think it aged well.<br/><br/>People complain about the shaky camera work. For me it's adds to the sheer horror of panic that characters experienced. It looks very real something I would film given the situation. I can totally suspend the disbelief.<br/><br/>As to the ending I love it like this. No explanation given and very bleak. I don't want to watch any sequels as I don't think they can improve on the story. It's always more scary when we don't know what we are actually dealing with.<br/><br/>I found that I sympathise with the characters even more at the moment during the lockdown.<br/><br/>I took only point down because of its references to Godzilla. I know it's the actual inspiration but yeah I would prefer it to have separate story to be more mysterious."
"TheXeroXone","4","97","151","28 January 2008"," This movie was such a waste of time
","I hope this isn't the new standard of movie genre. If it is, its worse than torture porn.. and I know they're working on a hand-held zombie film using this same technique. *shudder* The reality is in order for movies like this to work, the characters have to be borderline, intellectually retarded in order to validate why they would even consider getting close enough to the monsters, or whatever enemy, to make for a good film. This makes the hand-held film maker's inevitable and formulaic demise so much more anticlimactic because anyone with any common sense would not be running in the direction of a giant unknown creature dropping monster lice all over the city. This tends to ruin any sense of empathy for the character.<br/><br/>The guy shooting the majority of the film is, of course, a grand idiot. This is established very early on and it is the only character development in the entire film. His death is arguably the worst part of the movie because the guy has been saying the stupidest things throughout the entire movie, but right when his demise is looking him square in the face (for *far* too long, mind you), he picks this time to shut up. It was a waste of an already ridiculous set-up.<br/><br/>The only really good thing about this movie is that they thought about why don't the survivors just wait for the creature to pass by. The answer they came up with is man-sized, monster lice that drop off the creature and attack people. However, that doesn't stop them from making these things ridiculous because these things will make you blow up if you're bitten once. Apparently an army of aggressive, man-sized bugs with giant mandibles just isn't enough of a threat.<br/><br/>Its fairly obvious the people who made this film only wanted to use the technique to make a giant monster film and actually show the monster this time, instead of merely hinting at it like the Blair Witch Project did. The result is shoddy, predictable and obviously not well thought out.<br/><br/>Final Grade: D+"

Wait ... what was I saying? Oh yeah, there's this thing that runs rampant on Manhattan. No one knows what the hell it is, it's just there.

Alright, now picture that, filmed with your dad's handycam in the middle of a Godzilla movie. It's a big sh!te sandwich coupled on either side by two slices of moldy bread. That's how fresh and satisfying of a movie this is.<br/><br/>But hey, on the bright side, everyone died and that made me smile.<br/><br/>It's a big-budget C-movie, and while that may sound like something entertaining to fans of shlock films, trust me when I tell you that it's not.

"tommythebrit950","1","116","184","20 January 2008"," Uninspired, unoriginal, and for gods sake turn on the damn stability control!
","There were two interesting things about seeing this movie, unfortunately neither of them were things directly in the movie itself. To speak bluntly this movie was terrible. Honestly I wouldn't even call it a movie, that would imply the existence of a plot line. The movie was what it pretended to be, raw footage. The acting was lacking at best, the only way I would give them more credit is if the dialog was improvised on the spot, which it *might* have been. The cinematography would have been original had this movie been released in 1998 or anytime before the Blair Witch Project. I nearly walked out ten minutes into the movie once I realized the entire film was shot from a shaky hand held camera.<br/><br/>But even the worst visual movies can have a deeper meaning, right? So what about this one? <br/><br/>There are obvious 9/11 references/similarities, for instance, it was an attack on NYC. The imagery of terrified people running through the streets from the dust clouds of a collapsed building would conjure thoughts of 9/11 in even the most dim witted person. But as much as you pick this one apart there wasn't any purpose beyond using it as an implement to regurgitate fear. No, this movie isn't some sort of pompous social commentary on the American dream/lifestyle/people/whatever. It's actually quite empty as far as metaphor/meaning goes. But honestly, it's not like people would expect that from a monster movie anyway, right? <br/><br/>Although it was the connection this movie shared with 9/11 that brings me to my first interesting point. Almost every time a tragedy of this proportion occurs there are countless stories (books, movies or any other medium) that reference it (however vaguely) for decades to come. For example, look at post-Nagasaki/Hiroshima Japan. I'd be curious to see the list of movies that depict the mass destruction of Tokyo via atomic or nuclear bomb. Not to mention the other Japanese movies that center around the general ruining of cities... mostly by a few specific gigantic monsters... which will remain unnamed. <br/><br/>The second interesting thing happened to be something which I've never witnessed in a movie theater before. It made it worth paying the ten dollars for a ticket, wasting an hour and half of my life and enduring a headache the camera work gave me. As the ending credits started and the lights slowly came back on the audience unanimously started trash-talking the movie. There was booing from all corners of the theater, someone seated behind me said harshly ""this movie sucked!"", and the girl who was with him asked him, ""what did you drag me to??"" Their reactions were fairly amusing, and undoubtedly the best part of the whole movie experience. <br/><br/>All in all there were a couple of really cool visuals in the movie... Unfortunately this alone isn't worth the price of the movie, not even the price of the DVD, not even the price of the DVD once it goes into the ""shitty $3.99 movie bin"" at best buy. Either stay clear of this one or if your curiosity gets the best of you find a pirated version for free.<br/><br/>::SPOILER:: Oh, and before I forget. For all the reported ""realism"" in this movie I'd like someone to explain to me exactly how a plastic video tape survives the tens of millions of degrees caused by the blast of a nuclear bomb......<br/><br/>But now I'm just being nit picky."
"marlenrf","1","99","156","3 February 2008"," Terrible storytelling, horrible cinematography, poor CGI: Cloverfield is over-hyped and overdone
","I went to see this yesterday. I actually regret doing it. The moment it ended there was general booing and disappointment in the theater. Not a single applause. Throughout this film, I got to see more than 10 people walking out of the theater. I left after the credits ended with a terrible headache and the nausea of a lifetime. It got so bad that I actually had to take a Dramamine pill when I was back at my place.<br/><br/>I didn't like this clichéd film. I believe it is a flawed exercise about character perspective and documented realism. However, the special effects were poor but some of them passable; the editing kept an appropriate rhythm; the performances were regular, with the clear exception of T.J. Miller who played the obnoxious camera man, Hud. He did an awful job.<br/><br/>My main dislikes with this film were the camera movement and the argument overall.<br/><br/>First, the camera moves excessively all time. Even during the party sequence, all the scenes are horribly captured. Hud wasn't running from a monster then, was he? I get the filmmaker's intention, but I felt more nauseated than afraid because they went too far with their movement. The moment I dissociated myself from the movie and started feeling trapped inside a really expensive handy-cam, I knew the original intention had gotten lost. In that respect, the Blair Witch Project (which I also didn't like, but for other reasons) is superior by far. Its technical proposal does help convey a profound emotional impact; whereas Cloverfield's camera trembling doesn't. Consequently, the characters on Cloverfield remain mostly aloof, which really makes some silly elements in the plot to stand out.<br/><br/>SPOILERS START NOW: That brings me to my second main dislike: the argument. Were they joking? I don't even mean the monster. It's a monster movie, so I won't even go there. Everyone goes to save Beth, the romantic interest of Rob, who is beyond logical salvation. Sure, Rob's friends try to stop him from going to his certain death, but they all end up joining him anyway (!) Consequently, ""Beth"" becomes more of a cheap plot device than a character.<br/><br/>But I mean Marlena joined them? From what we know of her, she wouldn't. That's character inconsistency right there. So, let's assume she had her psychological reasons to do it. She's after all supposedly human and complex. But throughout her time on the screen nothing happens to shed any light as to why she is with them. So, there's no depth to her. No need for her, expect to save Hud's life once.<br/><br/>Also, the love story between Rob and Beth rests so much in what some people say of them and a few lines between the wretched lovers, that it becomes shallow and boring. Sure, some say he's been in love with her forever and they do share a wonderful day at Columbus Circle and Coney Island. Of course, she has got to be the love of his life. I'm not cynical, and I actually enjoy romantic themes, but this was an insult. I mean, the whole story rests so much on this supposed doomed love that it ought to have been better explored. The performances were so flat in this category, that they didn't help either. Again, the love story turned into yet another sort of plot device.<br/><br/>When the friends ""rescue"" Beth from her building, she is severely injured, and yet she can walk and even run. At the end, when they arrive to the evacuation area, despite her bleeding injury, Beth is not the first one to climb into the helicopter. In fact, she has to wait for another helicopter to take her out because the soldiers offer the only seat to Lily, who is physically well. It is ridiculous. Obviously, the real reason the filmmakers did that is so that the lovers, Rob and Beth, could remain together until the end. Have I said plot device before? Cheap and trashy plot device? And there's more, much more rubbish like that throughout the film. <br/><br/>SPOILERS HAVE ENDED. <br/><br/>Also, the fact that Hud was filming everything -even in the party- almost every private moment, is ludicrous. The filmmaker's choice of the handy-cam as the true narrator is too limited, so he naturally had to use it to an unbelievable degree. The consequence is that the purpose of capturing a sense of realism is defeated, and Cloverfield ends up being an absurdly unrealistic movie in its own monster-destroying-New-York-movie context-.<br/><br/>In Cloverfield, the filmmakers ask you to accept too many things just as they tell you they are. However, the movie consistently fails to provide you with valid reasons for doing so. They keep forcing on you a story of the poorest quality. It's almost offensive.<br/><br/>Weak screenplays do that. And when they do, one at least expects something in return, whether a feeling or a memorable moment. Something that would justify the torture. Unfortunately, with Cloverfield one ends up empty-handed, jerky camera movements aside.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this film at all, especially if you value the use of a tripod or the meaning of storytelling. In any case, if you're going to see it, please don't expect anything great and try not to eat or drink liquids for a couple of hours before and while watching it. In all honesty, it can make you feel physically (as well as mentally) nauseated."

","I have to say that I haven't had so much fun in a movie theater in such a long time. Cloverfield brought back a sense of excitement and delight for me.<br/><br/>The movie draws you in, makes you a part of the experience. It succeeds primarily because of two things; what you see and what you hear.<br/><br/>The movie does not have a major actor stealing the screen. Everyone is treaded just about equal. As the viewer you feel you are with the group as you are seeing the movie from the first person view. You feel connected to the characters as you understand that because of their loss, they have to set something right and not escape from the city. The movie draws you in and you feel like you are a part of the action.<br/><br/>There is no music. Ambient sounds such as creeks and thumps don't distract you from looking at all the finer details. You stay focused on what's important and constantly entertained.<br/><br/>One thing you must remember going into this movie. Remember the first 10 seconds of the movie (the stuff that comes right after the Star Trek teaser). If you keep that in mind everything will make sense and make the movie more pleasurable."

","First, as many have said before, don't go to this movie if you are prone to motion sickness. Or, unless you take Dramamine. I appreciate the attempt at a first-person POV film, but more than a few people in the theater were looking away from the screen as characters ran recklessly through the streets of Manhattan.<br/><br/>Second, if you choose to go to this film, check reality at the door. I know it's a monster movie, so reality isn't necessarily the point. However, some of the things the characters are able to do go far beyond their, or their technology's capabilities.<br/><br/>Third, it is short and ends abruptly. Thankfully, I went for free, but $9.00 or more for what amounts to a super-sized episode of Lost seems pricey. I enjoy going to movies for closure. I left feeling like I didn't know what happened to Manhattan. I would also like to know, if Manhattan was supposedly completely destroyed by the monster and military, how was the video recovered from Central Park. Some closure on that would have made the film much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time or money. Innovative, but predictable, nauseating, and unbelievable."

","What a waste of time and money. This movie would have been good if the camera was put down and a film was made. When the attack began the director should have the camera dropped then pan out and the movie start. Film the characters running and trying to rescue their friend. But, the way the movie was videotaped made the footage jerky and nauseating to watch. The fighting between the army and the ""monster"" was good, but again left you with too many unanswered questions. Besides, when a rescue helicopter takes off they do not fly parallel to the danger, they would fly away from danger. The ending was empty and left the viewers full of questions. Nothing was ever explained. Just stay at home and watch some home movies taped by your three year old. Might make more sense."

","This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only was it hard to watch because of the home video concept of filming, but it was horrible.<br/><br/>The Alien monster was like a giant praying mantis with babies that fell off itself and attacked people. I can deal with that, but the fact that bombs and tanks had no effect against it is ridiculous.<br/><br/>The only highlight in the entire movie was the guy behind the camera and his funny one liners. The movie was a hour and twenty-five minutes long, and ended with no questions being answered. You could not enjoy the action or suspense, because the camera was never still or clear. I have loved J.J Abrams' work in the past, but this is something he should not have put his name on.<br/><br/>Luckily I used free passes for entry and I did not have to pay for tickets, otherwise I would have demanded my money back. Don't believe any other comments that this was an intense thrilling movie, because it was not. The monster was ridiculous and laughable.<br/><br/>The love stories between 3 different couple was dull and more high schoolish. Not what one would think a Vice Pres. of a company would have, and when one of the love interests died (the main character's brother) it was like ""Oh Well"". The injury suffered by Beth (a rebar through the chest) is not something that one would get up from and then run around. And apparently if you get bit by the small ones, you spontaneously combust.<br/><br/>All I can say is just plain bad, don't waste your money.

","This has got to be the worst monster movie I have ever seen! Wait, not worst monster movie, worst MOVIE PERIOD! The whole movie is laughable. I sat there in the theater and wanted to know if and when anything was going to start. First, it take almost 25 minutes before this movie even starts to get interesting, and after all of the useless banter of party guests and drunken camera wedding style say ""hi"" to Rob before he goes to Japan B.S., things start to happen, but slowly. And let me tell you that they could have just use the footage from the trailer and skip about 20 of the most boring minutes of the whole film. That feeling of initial excitement is short lived. As you keep watching nothing happens that keeps your interest. Second, the monster, you get little glimpses of it until about 60-70 minutes into the film, and you get a very big disappointment, it's not Godzilla, a T-Rex, or anything that is even remotely familiar, fun or scary. It looks like someone put the body parts in the wrong places. And it's offspring, there are only three spots in the film that they are even used, as if an after thought. They are used to make two extremely boring parts of the movie more exciting, and it fails miserably. Obviously used to make a short film a tad bit longer. They even look like they where stolen them from Starship Troopers. Both monster and offspring are so underdeveloped, that they just don't work together. If JJ Abrams brought anything back from Japan, it wasn't how to make a monster movie. I'll tell you this, the Japanese are laughing at us all over again! There will be no Cloverfield monster for sale at every little store like all the Godzilla's all over Japan. JJ, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez called! They want their cameras back, they want to start filming Blair Witch 3! In short, I know, too late, DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM! The best part of the movie was the ride home."

","Spoilers... Really now, what's to spoil? Story lines don't come any thinner than this. Synopsis: Huge monster appears out of nowhere, destroys city, everybody dies, the end. There isn't any sense of commitment to the main characters, who after the random, gratuitous intro spend their time running around screaming. There is no suspense, no explanation, no point. Predictably, the full view of the monster is saved for last, when even the appalling camera work (yes, I KNOW it's intentional) can't disguise the mediocre CGI, nor the lack of inspiration among the monster-designers. Equally predictable, the nasty foot-soldiers it drops look like big spiders  contact with which will make you feel ill and eventually reduce you to an Alien-plagiarism. One does wonder why American filmmakers are so eager to destroy their big cities, especially after 9/11 has provided us with bone chilling imagery that will make any movie of this kind look silly in comparison for decades to come. Not just silly, actually; the way 9/11-like images are opportunistically recycled in this cinematic non-event struck me as rather tasteless. A BBC reviewer quite rightly called it 'plain 9/11 porn'. The makers have worked under the false assumption that 'live', shaky camera-work in dark surroundings will lift it all to a high level of hip artistry, but really, all it does is give you a headache. Any inexperienced klutz suffering from advanced Parkinson would get steadier handycam images than the guy supposedly holding the thing during these exasperating 75 minutes. It's all a very poor Blair Witch rip-off. Add to that the prevailing darkness and half the time you simply haven't got a clue what you're looking at: as a viewer, I felt insulted. This isn't 'intriguing' or 'artistic' or 'novel', it's just sheer, lax arrogance. Avoid at all costs."

"IamtheRegalTreatment","9","472","809","17 January 2008"," I liked it... believe it or not, I did.
","There was so much hype for this movie that you didn't need to know what it was about to see it. I'm sure many viewers this weekend are going to not know anything about the movie, just know that it's called Cloverfield and it was produced by JJ Abrams. I would think the movie wouldn't be as enthralling for someone who doesn't know much about it compared to someone who has been following message board posts for months, but I don't think it should matter.<br/><br/>So, let's begin. Cloverfield. The general plot of the movie is a home-made movie about a mans going away party that turns into a first person action thriller about a ""monster"" terrorizing the city. Well, I'm intrigued. I have been waiting for this movie for awhile since nothing exciting has come out recently. Everyone talking about the movie only made it more anticipated, so going into it I had high expectations. To be completely honest, I am satisfied. Shocked? Cloverfield is a movie like nothing I've seen before. I am sure this movie is based upon a few other films, but I haven't seen them. First of all, no it is not Godzilla. Second, I didn't get a chance to see Blair Witch Project so the first person thing was new to me. I know, I know. This however is what Made this movie what it is. It made you feel like you were in the action, on the streets running in fear alongside the citizens. It was freakin' sweet.<br/><br/>The action was intense, I expected nothing less from JJ. Once the movie got into motion with the city ""earthquake"" everything from then on was thrilling. I sat in the seat shaking in anticipation like I was sitting outside in the 20 degree weather; butterflies in my stomach for more than half the film. Awesome. The other part that was great was the sound and sights. It really felt like you were standing next to the soldiers shooting at the monster. And last but not least, the comedy... no seriously. There were many funny parts thanks to the cameraman. ""Oh My God, you know Superman too? Geez I'm feeling a connection... have you heard of Garfield?"". Classic.<br/><br/>Overall a solid, solid 9. Maybe a little high, but I thought the movie was amazing whether or not the ending was satisfying. No, I'm not telling you how it ends! To me, it was good though because it ended the film on a good note... yet kept the suspense and questions flowing. Also, no monster tips from me... I want you to be awaiting ""its"" face. Very good work, except on the title... what does Cloverfield have to do with it?<br/><br/>90 minute flick, so why not. Action/Thriller fans will love it; so go see it!"
"daveanderson1984","1","84","133","9 February 2008"," Dreadful
","It appears that the writers had the idea of the Statue of Liberty having its head roll down a street and then struggled like crazy to pad the rest of the movie. Hence it is extremely short and extremely bad.<br/><br/>The storyline that drives the characters within spitting distance of the monster at every opportunity is flimsy at best and to be honest, even though it is a movie about a monster terrorising a city it's the small things in it that make it most unbelievable. The fact that the guy talks the military into letting him risk his life (for a girl he slept with once by the way!), the exploding people, the fact that you can abuse a camera so badly and still have it work, the fact that you can buy a phone battery in a shop and not have to charge it before use, the convenient buildings propping each other up allowing for a daring rescue, the immense healing capabilities of the main characters who survive impalement and a crashing helicopter with barely a scratch, carrying the camera incessantly throughout this whole 'terrifying' ordeal, the stare out between monster and camera man at the end. I could go on but its making me feel ill thinking about this movie so much, so soon after seeing it.<br/><br/>The fact that you can barely make out what is going on doesn't help either. I think it was meant to add grit and suspense to the film, only giving you fleeting glimpses of the monster, but in the end it just helps to tarnish this train wreck of a movie even further by making sure its a blurred mess.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling cheated of my money. If it wasn't by J.J. Abrahms and the viral marketing didn't happen this film would have went largely unnoticed and would have been barely memorable. Its carrying mostly on the crest of Abrahms 'Lost' wave but anyone with a little bit of common sense and their rose tinted Lost spectacles removed can see how much of a weak movie this is.<br/><br/>Avoid."

","So, I went to a 5PM showing of Cloverfield today. It was pretty good. I found the characters to be very human and developed quite nicely over the course of the story. The special effects were excellent, with quite a few ""oh $#!@"" moments.<br/><br/>Be warned: If Blair Witch Project made you nauseous, then I don't recommend Cloverfield. The *entire* movie is filmed in the ""handy-cam"" style of the trailer - but in my opinion, it works better here than in Blair Witch. It helped draw you into the movie and make you feel like you were in it, and it made the CGI more convincing.<br/><br/>Very intense film."
"Midgarmerc","9","667","1170","18 January 2008"," The First Great Monster Film of the Century
","If you haven't heard by now Cloverfield is a film about a giant monster attacking Manhattan all seen through the perspective of a 20-something's hand-held camera. The film has been hyped for months via viral marketing, JJ Abrams fan boys, and media coverage/ monster speculation. Did it live up to the hype? The answer is OH GOD YES Cloverfield is by far the most intense monster film I have ever seen in my lifetime, after the initial 15 minutes of character introduction and whatnot the film does not go 5 minutes without a HOLY CRAP moment. Constantly driving you to the edge of your seat at every turn and it really pulls no punches, I was surprised to learn it was rated PG13. Now the film is entirely filmed in shaky cam since you cant really survive a monster attack pushing a trolley around and it just works, you may get motion sickness though so be warned. The camera itself becomes a character of the film as it IS the viewer making everything happening on-screen more and more realistic. Now the acting is amateur but thats for the best considering that the film would have made no sense if they had used big name actors/actresses, the characters are not that deep either and mostly serve as fodder, comic relief, moral guidance, panic, commentary, puzzlement, a little bit of annoyance, in other words they're people surviving a monster attack. The presentation is brilliant, the only music heard is in the party and at the ending credits and the special effects are some of the most seamless stuff you'll ever see in a film. The monster itself is actually not seen in its entirety only being viewed from different angles for the audience to piece it together as the survivors themselves are, you pretty much know as much as they do about everything going on making you actually feel like you're there. Critics compare the film to Blair Witch meets Godzilla but it is so much more than that, Cloverfield is the definitive American Monster Film, best if seen on the opening weekend just to hear the audience's reactions not to mention the presentation is far greater on the big screen, watch it again to see the things you missed or just to enjoy the ride again, admittedly the shock value will wane with multiple viewings but for what it's worth Cloverfield is an excellent piece of film and special effect engineering and is the first great monster film of the millennium. Its also downright scary at parts. 8/10"

The sense of foreboding and mystery I felt watching the trailer was the same as when I watched the film in the theater. It is an excellently-made movie.<br/><br/>Although it starts off a little slow (with introducing the characters and their relationships), when the action kicks in, it doesn't stop. There are maybe 6-7 minutes where there is not some kind of thrilling event happening. The relationship between the characters Rob and Beth is palpable, as is the chemistry between all the actors. <br/><br/>Pros: -Many thrills -Surprisingly good acting for a 'no-name' cast -Great story -Convincing special effects<br/><br/>Cons: -The shaky camera may be nauseating to some people -The acting in some scenes could be a little better -If you are someone who likes for all the loose ends to be tied up at the end, this is not for you<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars. I love it, and it is in my top 10 favorite movies. It always will be. I highly recommend watching this on a large screen, with the sound turned up loud for maximum enjoyment."

","This movie was pretty bad. I usually trust IMDb users, but i guess i should have learned my lesson after transformers got good ratings. This movie has all the makings of crap. B list cookie cutter actors that probably came in to audition and were chosen cause of their looks and ability to hold a sentence together. Also the camera at no point looked like a hand held camcorder or had any of the qualities it might have. The battery would never last that long especially after using the light so much. It would have probably broken in one of the many scenes where it fell at least 6 feet to the ground. Also i understand taking it, but when you drop it and run back for it numerous times, then you deserve to die. The quasi love story was pathetic, the idea that after on of the friends dies that they would still all be on board to save this one girl is ridiculous. And now for the part i almost walked out on. When they are with the military and he is pleading with them to help them like they don't have a million other things to do is ridiculous. Then one of the generals give him some advice and basically helps him to save his girlfriend, that he only spent one day with after having intercourse. All in all nothing was explained well and it was cheesy and ridiculous, but it had some cool moments, but other than that sucked."

They never explain what the monster is or how it came to be, they don't let you know what happens to the characters, nor do they give any follow up on anything. Horrible. People left the theaters so angry that they paid to see this piece of garbage, myself included. I'm so angry. I sat through the entire movie with my head in my hands because of the shaking camera, and besides that, the movie had no conclusion. It literally just ends.

","I am normally a big fan of the huge monster crushes city genre. That said, I have to be honest, this movie was the worst I have ever seen in that category. I would almost rather sit through ten screenings of Godzilla 1998 (Ferris Bueller Meets Mega-Iguana), than sit through one more screening of this. The plot centers on a group of semi-self-absorbed yuppies, and their totally futile attempt not to get crushed or have their heads explode. The characters seemed somewhat 2 dimensional and they usually died before the viewer has a chance to really get to know them. The fact that by the end of the movie, every single one of them has been killed in some really horrible way, does not do much for the ending. This kind of futility movie just annoys and you leave the theater wondering why you even bothered to see it. The effects would probably have been good; had the people responsible for such things not decided to get artsy-craftsy and use the very overused 1st person handy-cam technique. Most of the visuals were un-viewable because of the constant shaking and blurring of the camera. There was pretty much not coherent story line. The plot simply connected a loosely connected bunch of video clips. At least older B movies such as the big G and the Beast from 20000 fathoms had a real plot, actors you cared about, and much more depth. As for the creature... You never get to really get a good look at him until the last few minutes of the film; and then he looks pretty ridiculous. Also no explanation was given to the small creatures that seemed to just appear all over the place at the same time. If you want a good monster movie, don't waste your ticket money on this poor substitute, go and rent or buy a Godzilla flick or old Ray Harryhausen movie. At least those movies knew how to do Giant Monsters."

The giant monster had the _potential_ to be really cool, but despite the myriad conceptual drawings (that leaked their way onto the Internet), the powers-that-be opted to go with a Godzilla/Marauder/Arachnid hybrid that was creepy without being truly terrifying. The spider-like ""ticks"" that seemed to steal their movements and appearance from ""Pitch Black"" and ""Starship Troopers"" monsters held little appeal other than a way of saying ""Boo!"" during quiet moments in the movie. If you are prone to motion sickness, don't plan on enjoying your popcorn in the theater, as the first-person shaky-camera footage throughout the movie (as in, the ENTIRE movie) will ruin your intestinal fortitude.<br/><br/>Much of the plot surrounds a small group of young adults who (like ALL good horror film antagonists) refuse to evacuate the city under siege in favor of rescuing an injured friend who happens to live near the center of the monster attack. No back story is given, no explanation of why the monster chose to attack an island surrounded by other, more tempting, shorelines, and the audience is asked to suspend their disbelief FAR too much for them to truly enjoy the movie for its own sake. The ending is abrupt and obvious, having been alluded to earlier in the film, and the characters are mostly just props behind the (inept) cameraman.<br/><br/>There have been some truly fantastic monster movies made over the years, but for all its mystery and hype, this one falls WAY short of the mark.

"ramcritic11","1","30","45","19 May 2008"," This movie was an absolute joke!
","Cloverfield is the type of film that asks so much from its audience and delivers so little. Right from the start it basically gets down on its hands and knees begging and pleading everyone to take it seriously.<br/><br/>It tells you to excuse the bad camera work which tries desperately at times to cover up the next thing it asks you to ignore, the pathetic acting abilities of all the unknown actors involved.<br/><br/>Then we get to the story (if one could call it that) and the tissue paper thin plot. We begin at a going away party in New York for this guy Rob that gets interrupted by rumblings and explosions in the distance which which are being caused by some sort of monster. So then Rob, his cameraman and friends start heading out of New York when Rob gets a call from a girl (Beth) that he slept with one time, apparently is in trapped in her apartment. So Rob decides to go and save her and his friends for tag along for the ride. To quickly sum up, one by one all our main characters die either by a big monster, a little monster or an explosion.<br/><br/>The entire movie is filmed from the point of view of a hand-held camera which for some reason has the longest battery life I've ever seen, and somehow is able to still function properly despite being dropped a couple of times and survive a helicopter crash.<br/><br/>Overall, Cloverfield is filled with people pretending to be actors, A boring story with little or no explanation of much of anything, and one indestructible video camera.<br/><br/>It is clear that the marketing campaign was where the majority of the budget for this movie went as this film was all hype and no substance. The hype for this movie was caused it go to the top of the box office in its first week and when word spread of how bad the film truly was, it sunk at box office falling in 5 weeks from 1st to 4th to 9th to 12th and the out of the top 20.<br/><br/>If you really hated this movie as I did, check out rifftrax.com home of our friends from Mystery Science Theater who know a thing or two about bad movies.

"raypdaley182","1","27","40","27 April 2008"," I really wanted to like this film
","Seeing how many trailers ran for this before it's release I was already worried this film was going to be truly awful. Anything getting hyped that much normally is awful. The film is all shot on hand-held cameras which is an incredibly bad idea. If Blair Witch taught us anything, it was hand-held cameras in a movie look abysmal! And this movie is no different.<br/><br/>It's incredibly slow to get started, with no action until your 20 minutes into the film & that's where they jump the shark. If your in a building & just experienced an earthquake then on a roof to see an explosion & running downstairs from falling fireballs the VERY last thing your going to do is carry on filming at eye-level from a hand-held camera. Your either going to drop it or lower it down to waist height to allow yourself to run faster.<br/><br/>And thats the kind of basic rookie mistake that ruins films. The bad hand-held camera work was already doing that anyway but a stupid goof like that killed the film before it ever got started. The people photographing the head of The Statue Of Liberty are just WAY too calm. There would be absolute hysteria, people would be going mental! As far all the destroyed buildings & falling rubble? In a post 9/11 climate is a movie with these images really a good idea or just incredibly stupid. The latter I feel.<br/><br/>Rob getting a call from Beth on his cell phone? Highly unlikely after that kind of city devastation, lines would be restricted to emergency calls only. The scene on The Brooklyn Bridge is not believable at all. No-one seems frightened. Even when the bridge collapses the camera guy turns around to film whats happening. No-one would do that, you'd be too busy running away or getting trampled in the panic.<br/><br/>When we finally do see bits of the monster it's an incredibly cheap looking effect. Even 1970's Dr Who would have been embarrassed about that thing. It looked like it cost all of $10, if that. A very cheap rubbery monster. A cheap Godzilla rip-off.<br/><br/>Rob's motivation for rescuing Beth is zero. They had a huge argument at the party and he was upset when she left. His mood towards her suddenly changing is incredibly suspect & a very POOR plot device. The soldiers they encountered, not 1 said get down (before they started firing), not 1 said turn back. It just wouldn't happen. The plausibility of the movie just gets less & less by the scene.<br/><br/>You also have to question Hud not knocking Rob out by the time their in the subway. Even truly good friends would have punched his lights out by then. As for ""walking the tunnels""? If there's a light on the camera, why isn't Hud walking at the front so everyone behind him can see? As far as them being attacked by those creatures? The movie should have ended right there because they were outnumbered & should have all been killed.<br/><br/>The way they just suddenly meet the soldiers is far too simple. Marlena dies (even though you never see anything, she's bleeding from her eyes then is taken behind a curtain where you see an explosion of blood so its safe to assume she's VERY dead).<br/><br/>With Rob saying to the soldier ""If you want to stop me you'll have to shoot me"", the soldier should have pulled out his gun and done us ALL a favour. Even after seeing Beth's building half knocked down Rob STILL thinks she's alive? I'm sorry but 1 of the 2 remaining friends would have actually knocked him out cold at that point.<br/><br/>After pulling Beth off the spike, why wasn't she bleeding like crazy? Also the awful & incredibly predictable scare when the monster hits the helicopter? And they survive the crash? I think at this point in the movie they had run out of ideas & were just doing anything to kill time.<br/><br/>Hud gets an excellent death (bitten in half by the monster) & then you get Rob & Beth talking to the camera, an explosion, rubble falling, Coney Island then nothing. No ending, no resolution? And to those who think they saw a splash in the sea at the end? It's a ship sailing from left to right, certainly nothing splashing into the sea like so many claims I've read. <br/><br/>What an awful film. From start to lack of finish, utter garbage! Not recommended to anyone, ever."
"jas171","3","19","27","24 January 2008"," Not Worth Your Money, Time, or Attention.
","There are a lot of reasons I could not stand this movie.<br/><br/>The best and most exciting part of the movie was what we saw in the trailers! I felt right there with the characters until they got in the subway. I slowly became more and more detached from the characters and the story after that. The humor was the only thing that kept me hanging on. I think part of the detachment comes from knowing right away that there are most likely going to be no survivors. We expect the characters to die, so we aren't able to worry about their well-being as much as we would if we did not know their outcome.<br/><br/>For the most part, the acting was horrible. Lizzy Caplan and Mike Vogel have a lot to offer, but we know what happens to their characters. Of course, the first ones to go are the best ones who act. Jessica Lucas is one of the worst actresses I have ever watched. She noticeably anticipated her lines, showed almost no emotion, and barely even reacted when her almost-fiancée was crushed. All of this chaos, slaughtering, and destruction is going on, and nobody has a good breakdown until the end. It's unrealistic. Shock is not an excuse to be used for that many people simultaneously.<br/><br/>I understand that we are supposed to be in the moment and just as confused as the characters, but would it really have hurt to have a little bit more explanation? The characters have plenty of time to at least throw around a guess as to what the monster is or where it came from, but they never even think to talk about it. A few people ask, ""What is it?"" or some form of the question, but it is always avoided. A couple of lines or another random news report with at least a speculation would have sufficed.<br/><br/>The monster was unimpressive. Most views of it were quick ones, but when we did see it close up it was not very realistic looking. Compared to King Kong, a Transformer, etc., the monster definitely could have used a lot of work. It had a slightly animated/pasted on the screen quality to it most of the time. Admittedly, I was freaked out by the mini monsters. They were creepy, but at the same time, they were somewhat unnecessary. They had a slight ""Tremors 2"" quality to them.<br/><br/>Unlike many people, the camera movement did not bother me. I thought it was actually an enhancing quality for the movie. Whatever kind of camera it is, I want one. It has some sort of force field around it that allows it to go through hell without a scratch.<br/><br/>Was this not supposed to be the scariest and most realistic monster movie ever made? That is what all of the hype told me. Do I think this movie was that? No way, man. After the movie ended, a kid said, ""That movie sucked."" Almost everyone in the theater started laughing, including me. I have never been to a movie in a theater that was bad enough to receive that reaction. I could just tell when everyone was walking out that a good portion of us were let down. It wasn't the feel-good response I usually see. Do I think this was the worst movie of all time? Absolutely not. I do think it did not exceed the boundary of expectations in any way, either, though. It actually fell very short. Anyone expecting to see something new and innovative is going to be let down, and that's all there is to it."

If something exciting happens I want to get a sharp view so I can start making up thoughts in my head. Thanks to the screwed up capturing I couldn't help but get very very upset ! The Blair Witch project didn't demand that much visual observation as it mainly took place in a forest at night and night vision helped out much of the time and thus didn't demand much sharp observing from the audience. And some folks (dare) talk about motion sickness being a shameful thing when watching this movie.. Well watching this movie is ( I think) even worse when compared with getting aboard a chopper and receiving the Rookie treatment which ends up with you throwing up your breakfast, thanks to the unexpected tricks the seasoned pilot plays on you, with the help of his controls. I just cannot believe people dare say things as ""fantastic"", ""super original"", ""haven't seen such a creative movie in a while"" .. It really makes me wonder did these same people that say such things, live In Afghanistan during the(movies not allowed)Taliban regime ?! 1:13 minutes I tried to get a sharp view of what was going on. Not a moment did I think wow what a ""creativity"" at work here.. So no Mr director you did not succeed in creating a 9/11 drama-like emotional, many different camera footage shots, roller coaster ride that was served that specific day in 2001. (Remember those camera close-ups of people running and crying while the camera men kept walking away as the dust clouds came closer and closer. So If someone in the future asks me: come up with one original movie you watched the past couple of years I won't even think about Cloverfield. To be honest I found Godzilla trashing New York a breeze of fresh air compared to this totally screwed up attempt at being ""original"".

I kept wishing the guy holding the camera would get killed and they would switch to regular filming so I could enjoy the movie -- but no such luck. Then the worst part of all was when the kids filming the movie all get killed and the movie just goes to a black screen and we see the credits. We don't know where the monsters came from, what happened to them, what happened to Manhattan, what happened to the rest of the world, what they wanted, why they came...etc. It's like they wrote half the movie and then stopped.

","I'm a huge fan of monster, apocalyptic, and doomsday movies, so naturally I was very excited to see this one. To summarize in one word: Meh. <br/><br/>This movie with such a huge premise was exactly 1 hour and 13 minutes long. WTF? With such a short movie, the writers choose to spend the first 20 minutes on literally nothing of interest. You're taken to a going away party for someone with an irritating personality. A party I would have left after 10 minutes if I was actually there. So, after a quarter of the movie is wasted here, an alarm goes off and everyone starts running. The shaky camera work at the party is annoying, and it just gets worse...and worse...and worse, and my annoyance just kept growing.<br/><br/>So much could have been done with this story, but the writers and director had it out for the audience and gave everyone a big F.U. There was about two minutes collectively where the movie was cool, but that's only if you're into special effects. If you're into extremely shaky film footage where you have to strain to see anything, then you'll love this one. This was ten times shakier than the Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>I bet this movie was made for less than 100k, and most of that was spent on CGI, because the actors shouldn't have been paid more than 5k apiece. This movie jumped from totally boring to chaos without any explanations. Where did the monster come from? Why, after seeing it blown up, did it show up again unscathed? Where did it go at the end and what the hell happened? Why were buildings being blown up? Could the monster shoot fire balls out of it's ass or something? We never find out.<br/><br/>Apparently, the budget ran out because the movie just ended abruptly. No resolution or answers whatsoever. The characters were so weak that I didn't even care when they died. This may be a candidate for a Raspberry award. Very, very disappointing."

","I'm going to try to keep spoilers at a minimum here, but having wasted $12 this weekend to see Cloverfield (thank you Manhattan), I feel it's my duty to try and save others from the same fate.<br/><br/>There's a reason why the early parts of the year are traditionally known as a dumping ground for studios. Because it is. A good deal of the stuff released at this time is done so because it's the furthest possible time between this year's Oscars and next year's...allowing studios plenty of time to distance themselves from bad films before the noms come out. Cloverfield is no exception to this trend. Borrowing liberally from films such as The Blair Witch Project, the recent Godzilla remake, and every horror movie you've seen where the main characters act completely illogically and are knocked off one by one, Cloverfield fails to meaningfully deliver on its goal of taking the big monster film down to the level of the individual ""ordinary"" people caught up in the wake of an attack.<br/><br/>It fails mostly because it fails to make us care at all about the central figures and their ludicrous quest to save a girl who is most likely already dead. I'll set aside the glaring logical inaccuracies (cell phones blacked out one moment, then working the next, cell phones working underground, extreme compression of basic New York geography...there's more but...), but I can't ignore the fact that for this little experiment to work, we have to care about these people who are running around doing really stupid things. Ostensibly, the first twenty minutes of the movie sets this up, within the thin framework of a party for the male lead. But all we really learn from it is that pretty much all the guys are kind of jerks, so no help there.<br/><br/>There's even an exact recreation of some 9/11 footage just to flavor the pot, which I found kind of offensive, and other New Yorkers might have too. I'd probably have been even more offended if the movie was any good. But it's terrible, so, there you go. Look, I wanted to like this movie. It was great promo. When I saw the trailer the first time I was really excited, as many of you probably were too. But i urge you to save your money on this one. Rent it if you must, the jerky camera-work and sub par story will be exactly the same on the small screen as the big screen."

I was always aware that I was watching a movie that was trying {and not very successfully] to be a home made documentary about an alien attack. Not once in the movie did I achieve the ""suspension of belief"" needed to draw me in. The special effects were great--it would have been a much better movie if they had picked up guns and started fighting the aliens rather than pursuing an insane and very implausible search for the main character's girlfriend. They would have been better off filling the movie with special effects and battle scenes. I also couldn't suspend belief about the basic premise of the film, videotaping an alien attack on New York---no way would I have kept a video cam walking through a dark tunnel with alien spiders chasing me, climbing into a crumbling high rise apartment, climbing into a helicopter, etc. You get the picture.

The guy was looking for the ""girl of his dreams"" and found her, of course after running up like 50 flights of stairs (without getting too breathless) and clambering across a roof to a collapsed building only to find the girl ... still alive... albeit impaled on a spike! Of course, she survived (as only she would!) and managed to run down 39 flights of stairs with a hole though her body!! The annoying guy behind the camera was nicely killed by the ""alien/beast"" thing and the two lovers escaped in a helicopter...! BUT WAIT...

","This show is a combination of Alien, Godzilla, The Blair Witch Project, and Beverly Hills 90210. It wasn't what I was expecting (which was a good monster movie).<br/><br/>1) The first 20-30 minutes which, theoretically, was setting up all the character interrelationships was BORING! It was worse than watching a soap opera. (Note to J.J. Abrams: twenty-somethings who pout in their bedrooms because their childhood sweetheart is dating another guy DON'T become corporate vice-presidents. Sheesh!) My wife and I were literally leaning forward to stand up and walk out when the first bang happened (we're still not sure if staying was the better choice). Most of the info delivered in this prelude went unused in the movie, so it could have been shortened to five minutes without losing a thing.<br/><br/>2) The FAQ is dead wrong about Beth's wounds. She had a piece of rebar through her shoulder, for crying out loud. All the adrenaline in the world wouldn't have stopped her from bleeding out in about twenty minutes after they lifted her off it. If, by some divine miracle, she didn't bleed out, her left arm would have been utterly useless, and rapidly and overwhelmingly painful. The movie portrays Beth as fundamentally uninjured by the end of the movie. Dumb.<br/><br/>3) People talented enough to become corporate vice presidents rarely associate with people as brain-dead stupid as Hud. I'm surprised they didn't show his urine-soaked pants after he died.<br/><br/>I'd go on, but it's not worth it. ""I Am Legend"" was much, much, much better. Better suspense. Better storyline. Better acting. Better movie. And that's despite knowing the storyline from watching ""The Omega Man"" years ago. When you remove the effect of motion sickness caused by the bouncing camera or the rising pulse of the beeping emergency strobes in the buildings (did you think we wouldn't notice, J.J.?), there isn't much to be scared about in ""Cloverfield."" By the way, other than being the secret document name of the government file we are purportedly watching, the word ""cloverfield"" has absolutely NOTHING to do with the movie.<br/><br/>Dumb. I'm glad I only paid matinée pricing to see this movie."
"dr_vanhalen","3","31","48","28 January 2008"," Potentially cool film ruined by laughable acting & writing.
","The Good: Personally, I'm a huge fan of the hand-held/shaky-camcorder style of film-making when it's done right. Especially coupled with big-budget special FX, it can really bring otherwise ridiculously fantastical situations to life. This technique was handled very well in Cloverfield; the scenes with monsters or things blowing up were well done on that side of things.<br/><br/>Another thing I'm a huge fan of is movies that don't lay everything out for you and explain every last bit of the story away so you don't have to hurt yourself using your imagination. This, along with the camera work, seem to be the two main things people are complaining about...but for me, these are the two most (only?) redeeming qualities of the movie.<br/><br/>The Bad: Insert anything else you can think of that has to do with movies here. (On second thought, you can also add the lack of a musical soundtrack to the ""good"" list above.) The characters, their actions/reactions, acting, plot, writing, all of it - just bad.<br/><br/>Sidenote: I didn't catch the rating of this film (I'm guessing PG?), but one of the most unbelievable aspects of this move was the lack of any noticeable ""F words"" spoken by anybody. I'm sorry, but if that was happening in my city and I was running away from a building-sized monster and being attacked by giant shrimp and Statue of Liberty heads I doubt I'd be able to get any other words out of my mouth for days.<br/><br/>The Meh: The ""realism"" of the camera work was totally undermined by a lack of commitment on the cinematographer's part. Most of the time it looked like normal movie-quality footage, just shot with a hand-held camera. It seemed like they were really going for the gritty realism thing, but they didn't take it all the way (as in 28 Days Later, for instance).<br/><br/>It also might have been nice to drop the whole Blair Witch ""we found this camera"" gimmick and just shoot it in lo-fi digital cam style to give it the realism without having the need for a character literally holding the camera thru the entire movie. Again, as in 28 Days Later."
"coopuk","1","24","36","15 February 2008"," Blair Witch meets Godzilla via Aliens.... in a BAAAAD way
","I went to see Cloverfield with very high expectations; the trailers had got my attention, and I enjoyed ""Lost"" which had the same writer. I was expecting something that was fresh, original, with a decent storyline and quality dialog.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film was a huge disappointment; it offered none of the above. The story is told from the viewpoint of one of the characters that has a hand-held camcorder, and as a consequence the pictorial style of the movie is very similar to ""Blair Witch"", e.g. jerky camera shots in an attempt to make the film more ""realistic"". Unfortunately, this becomes extremely annoying after 15 minutes or so, and as a ploy to make the audience think they watching an amateur recording it is totally destroyed by the incredible sound quality, supposedly from the same source.<br/><br/>In addition, there isn't a storyline as such; some people are having a party, and a destructive creature suddenly appears and trashes the city they are in. There is no explanation of where the creature came from, or what it is. It's a pure lift from any Godzilla movie. The rest of the movie is simply watching the jerky camcorder follow the characters (albeit with incredible sound quality) through the city as first they try to escape, and then have to turn back to find the true love of one of the characters. Yes, it really *is* that clichéd.<br/><br/>After that, the storyline (what is left of it) gets steadily more and more ridiculous. The characters go into a subway and are attacked by face hugger outtakes from ""Aliens"". The army take them into custody, but instead of evacuating them they let them go because - hey! - the male lead is going back to find his true love. So much for realism ;) The girl they're looking for is trapped in a tower block that has been attacked by the alien, and which is collapsing, but which has conveniently not fallen over completely but just come to lean against another tower block... the same as you see in any war zone - NOT. When they climb the tower to find the girl, she is pinned down by a steel rod through her shoulder. However, they pull her free, and despite the resultant blood loss she is soon running around the city like a spring chicken trying to escape. Again, so much for realism ;) <br/><br/>The key fault with Cloverfield is that is it an unholy marriage of two totally conflicting styles; the realistic, camcorder style of ""Blair Witch"" that records the relationship between the characters, and the desire to use that same style to give some indication of the enormity of the alien that is destroying the city. It simply doesn't work, specially when it is hampered by a script that becomes more and more implausible by the minute.<br/><br/>Cloverfield has no outstanding dialog, no character development, no plausible plot line, and no sense of realism. The special effects are reasonable, but they weren't what I came to see. It really is that bad, and I wasn't the only one to think so. At the end of showing I went to, there was a stunned silence, and then people started laughing... in disbelief that they'd sat and watched such a pile of rubbish.<br/><br/>This is easily a candidate for the worst film of 2008."
"manicminnie","2","24","36","9 February 2008"," A pile of steaming horse manure
","*MAJOR SPOILERS* I can't believe the high ratings that this film has received! The first thing that has to be mentioned is that the whole film is shot from a hand-held camera, which is buried under piles of rocks, involved in an helicopter crash and undergoes a chewing from the monster itself and yet miraculously manages to stay in complete working order. Unlikely, but OK I can go with that. The fact that the cameraman cannot hold it straight for one moment in the whole film and when he's running away he is constantly spinning around is just nauseating. And it is glued to his face? At some point all normal people would have dropped the camera because it would be hindering your speed and ability to run and dodge things, even when the guy was being eaten/chewed by the creature it still took him about 5 minutes to drop the sodding camera! And his friends basically went ""Ahhh!! He's dead! Oh my god! Run! Oh, and remember the camera."" Seriously.<br/><br/>The party at the beginning takes so long to get going that I was bored within about 5 minutes and it made me feel so ill that I spent most of the rest of the film with my eyes shut trying not to be sick. This probably induces the argument that I couldn't possibly comment on the film because I didn't actually see most of it. Well, I opened my eyes frequently during the film and knew what was going on from the numerous, and at most times hilarious, sounds. The noises the creature made in the tunnel were absolutely ridiculous! I honestly think that could have been a really good scene, I was getting quite enthusiastic when they put on the night-vision, but the sounds were so laughable that it just made it all a bit rubbish. And the whole thing with the rats- rats run away from bad stuff, if they're running then you'd better start running as well! <br/><br/>Then the girl who had been bitten- did she explode or did the army explode her or what? Seriously, what the hell was going on with her? And the army would never allow a civilian back onto the streets to find his (probably dead) friend who was trapped in a lopsided building.<br/><br/>We find the friend, who has been stabbed in the chest by a spike, they somehow manage to lift her off it with minimal screaming and blood, then tie a bit of cloth around the wound and make her run around, leaping across buildings and so forth. She had been lying with this spike in her for quite a while by the way and with the smallest chance that she wouldn't be dead, she certainly would have suffered enough blood-loss and trauma that she certainly wouldn't be able to run around and hug people.<br/><br/>We then encounter another mini-creature (is the mother-monster spawning these freaky mini-monsters?) which is subdued very easily and with minimal fuss.<br/><br/>Cue a lot of running around, a woman who has supposedly been stabbed through the chest being very agile and hugging her boyfriend VERY tightly and with very little blood. The creature getting bombed is quite impressive, but seeing as you know that they all die in the end it's not really that scary when the creature re-emerges.<br/><br/>We end with the last two survivors hiding under a bridge (yeh, the best place to hide when the army is bombing a massive creature which is smashing buildings up- under a pile of bricks and stones) and something very BlairWitch-like takes place, with lots of close mouth shots and snotty noses.<br/><br/>The monster had the potential to be excellent and failed quite spectacularly, the scene with the head of the Statue of Liberty is quite good and you don't really feel close to the characters and therefore don't really care when one dies. I think the guy behind me in the cinema actually cheered a bit when Hud was killed. Also, they milk the whole 'tell her you love her' bits. I mean, aren't there more pressing issues at hand here? <br/><br/>So all in all, I went with a group of six people, three of us felt ill, two of us had headaches and one was almost asleep. I want £3.50, two hours of my life and my settled stomach back please!"
"stephs_sanctuary","1","36","57","30 January 2008"," Awful. Contrived. Manipulative, Plot less Movie
","I saw this movie with my friends yesterday and I was so disappointed with it. First of all I had very low expectations of the movie because I had read forums about the movie thus knowing what to expect. Too bad the forums I was on had so many fan boys/girls that their views were somewhat tainted. Thus I know beforehand that the movie: (A) is a monster movie (B) it was shot through first person POV (C) it was about a group of young people's battle for survival.<br/><br/>But I never expected the movie to lack a cohesive plot, empathetic characters and a good ending. I mean who in their right minds would rescue someone knowing that a monster is running amok trying to devour them all. OK, I understood Rob's reason a little bit (but it still is moronic) because he was in love. What was Lilly, Hud and that other girl's reason? I just don't get it. These characters defy the very rule of human nature: that is the need for self preservation.<br/><br/>The movie also had a lot of loopholes. Some of them include a camcorder with an unlimited battery life, a person who is still filming even though they are in danger, and a girl who survives (and can very much run around) after being struck by a rod in the torso (?).<br/><br/>I went inside the movie theater expecting at least some thrills here and there, but all I got was a lingering headache. All in all I hate hate hate this movie."
"o_pekdemir","3","21","31","1 February 2008"," Weak
","First thing to mention: I didn't have any clue what this whole movie is all about (just had seen that one ""official"" trailer with the liberty statues head on the ground). And I forced myself not to search for any details on the web; just to keep it captivating.<br/><br/>OK, I guess there are more than enough basic summaries of this movie so I will try to focus on the main debacle. The first 20 minutes of this 75 minutes ""short film"" are simply boring, needless and trashy. Just like watching some c-class teeny-soap on TV. The rest is a bit better - but not much. Apart from the bugging hand-camera filming style the movie has got almost NO storyline at all. Sure, you walk along with those flat and unispiredly tinkered together characters but - imho this movie wouldn't be any better or worse if you'd simply see some unintroduced people being smashed around. It somehow just doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The visual effects seem to be mid-level ""industry standard"" and the few good shots are too short and nearly unrecognizable due to the always shaking and zooming camera. Altogether you only get a few seconds of good CG during the whole picture. It's really that bad! There are some nice visual ideas... but as they are barely seen, you might find more interesting stuff while randomly visiting some visual artists personal websites on the internet.<br/><br/>If you certainly want to go to the theatre and see a monster movie, go and see Stephen Kings ""The Mist"" which is at least much much better than this piece of expensive, visual and intellectual nausea. Or go and get ""The Host"" on DVD which also easily outclasses the poor ""Cloverfield"". So don't get too much carried away by that crappy ""viral campaign"" ruckus made to promote this brainless movie. It might be OK on DVD to bridge some very boring hours at home but definitely not worth going to a cinema to see it.<br/><br/>Sorry for my bad English.<br/><br/>Regards, Onur Pekdemir"

"AnthonyGODugan","3","15","21","25 April 2008"," Kind of crap
","SPOILERS EVERYWHERE--RIGHT OFF THE BAT--CAUTION ADVISED<br/><br/>For me, monster movies are about Zombies. I also like Aliens, Predator, AVP, slashers, shooters, and usually weird monsters that almost have a category of their own.<br/><br/>What I DID LIKE about this movie: The way that it was filmed definitely intensified the action and gave it a unique, new feel to what we're used to seeing. I liked that the characters were younger, college aged people, and that their dialogue was authentic even given the bizarre situation they found themselves in. I like that despite it being a horror-suspense movie there is still an obvious love story guiding it. Obviously, had it not been for the love part, the kids would have left the city and been safe, presumably, and the movie would have been worse than it was. Also, it helped that Beth was moderately attractive. If she had been plain Jane or just unattractive, we would have chanted, ""let her die."" Oh, and I liked that the kid filming everything was the token douche-bag, nerd that would totally ask dumb and terrifically inappropriate questions.<br/><br/>What I DID NOT LIKE about this movie: There is a movie from Korea, Gwoemul (The Host, 2006), that other than the cinematography, has a very similar plot line. This made Cloverfield not seem as original. Frankly, the monsters weren't really that scary. The whole premise was that the monster attack was centralized to one locale. The easy solution, leave the city. It may have been more frightening if it had been a pandemic and if the monster didn't look like a turtle-squid-dinosaur. The little shedding crab monsters were scarier, but just barely. Even though it was a love story, it wasn't a very good one. People in love are always compelled to do outrageous things when their love knows no bound. In this case, it seemed expected, and because we weren't privy to the whole account of their love, as we were told that they were best friends, then it is slightly less believable. A real ""love story"", which incorporates insane acts of proving his love, in a hideously taboo sort of way, is Old Boy, although I expect many arguments hereI'm just saying. <br/><br/>All in all, I wasn't impressed, shocked, horrified, or even moved by the love part. I didn't like this movie. I'll re-watch it to see if some new emotion comes forth, but I'm not expecting one. I'm a little surprised that everyone seems to like this movie and even the other I mentionedGwoemul. I didn't really like that either. It seemed a little hokey.<br/><br/>Hope this was helpful. I'm definitely in the minority of opinions here, so it may be a new light for you. <br/><br/>I typed very fast, so I apologize for grammatical errors and the like."

I wish i didn't.<br/><br/>I think the high scores are from people who downloaded cam versions where the movement of the cam counters the movement of the actors camera so they have seen a steady image.<br/><br/>I knew this was a type of blairwitch kind of filming so that wasn't a surprise. But the fact that the person filming during the whole nightmare lets the viewer believe to be a bit uncertain about operating the camera, makes you wonder why he bothers to haul that thing along all the time. If the reason was (it isn't mentioned in the dribble itself so we must guess here) that he wanted to document the whole thing, why doesn't he do that? Why does he seem to miss the most obvious shots? If this person would have been an art student or a student of journalism it would have been more believable.<br/><br/>It was a great idea, the hype before this movie worked wonders (the movie industry now has a script to hype even the biggest b movie) but it didn't work out.

But if you can focus wide and not get caught up too much in the details, you are in for an intense and unique take on the monster hits a major city (New York) genre. Where does it come from? What is it? One can speculate, but the movie is really dealing with the trauma of a small group of party goers and their encounter with the extraordinary! The effects are amazing, the acting by relative unknowns, hits on all marks; making the movie all the more convincing to the very end.

A group of loud rambunctious teens who sat next to us where giving away parts of the movie before they were shown swearing talking out loud and not amongst themselves. Though critics and film goers alike say that the way this film is done is said to be innovative but I cant see Hollywood basing many of their films on a Blair Witch theme were the whole film is seen from a camera.<br/><br/>This film is basically a rip-off what you get when a bunch of producers decide to mix Godzilla and the Blair Witch. The plot line is all out of place just them running around the city away from the giant beasts which there's really no logical explanation as to how they arrived here. The main characters are naive ignorant obnoxious but what are you going to get from a group of characters fresh out of college how are trying to live decent lives but this is an exceptional group of people who are unsophisticated obnoxious and indiscreet. Their idiocy eventually leads to their inevitable deaths as if it wasn't obvious that the whole film would turn to chaos and everyone would die what kind of film that has no morals no values make a wholesome movie. It doesn't this film is hyped and overrated and in the past few months this has faded into obscurity like it should. <br/><br/>This is basically a fan film I can see many references to the producers favorite films including Alien, Blair Witch, and any monster movie crap.

","This film was an absolute let down, like most 'home movies' it left me bored, restless and thankful when it was over. This film is just a poor Blair Witch with a bigger budget and none of the tension or fear factor. It was clearly over hyped because of its connection with JJ Abrams. It was a unique idea to get some background on the characters by showing bits and pieces of video previously recorded on the tape that was being recorded over. However, it didn't quite work and therefore meant I couldn't careless if any of the characters lived or died. The big 'monster' wasn't at all scary and for me, the smaller creatures had more fright appeal but in the end hardly featured in the movie. Due to the boredom that this movie induced I couldn't help but question the idea that someone would choose to document the situation the characters found themselves in by keeping the camera running whilst trying to escape disaster. I would imagine that the majority of people would just put the camera down and concentrate on getting the hell out of there. The only saving grace about the idea of it being part of a 'home movie' was it meant the movie was the same length of an actual DV Tape."

There's NOTHING entertaining, or suspenseful, or even remotely likable, about this piece of garbage. Nothing. It's an insult to human intelligence, not a movie.<br/><br/>Basically, you're just following a bunch of completely unlikeable cardboard cut-outs (I wouldn't call them 'characters', since there was zero character development) running around and acting scared. Of what? It's not clear.<br/><br/>I was hoping to see the monster (since it was the one I was rooting for), but... no monster. You never find out what was causing the terror. All you see is people running. I mean it; there's nothing else to this movie except people running.<br/><br/>There was no plot. In the beginning you see some lamers at a party (it takes about 20 minutes, and you're already bored out of your mind), and then, for the rest of the movie, you see people running. That's all. Yes, really.<br/><br/>I was glad when they all died. I couldn't even tell who was who in the group, because, like I said, there was no character development at all. Just a bunch of random people running around with a camera turned on -- you mostly see their feet anyway.<br/><br/>It's laughably pathetic and a huge disappointment. When the movie ends, you just have this huge WTF expression on your face, and you think, ""erm... is that it?"" You feel cheated that you sat through an hour and a half (I'm not sure how long it was) of this crap, expecting something to happen, but nothing did.<br/><br/>Just dreadful.<br/><br/>I am rarely THIS disappointed by a movie."

","The entire film consists of hand-held camera. Except it's done in the worst way imaginable. You spent the entire duration of the film with your view changing as the character runs exactly how you would in real life. I.E. With your arms swinging, So your view point changes in quick succession between the floor and the sky. It makes you feel ill, and you have no idea whats going on. The effects, due to the filming in this fashion, are appalling, the story is lacking and boring, as well as downright unbelievable in places. For example the character drops the camera directly under the biggest alien, and still runs back for it. A terrible film, with terrible cinematography. I only wish IMDb would late me rate it a zero."

For some reason, they are constantly mentioning that one of the characters is going to Japan. This plot detail serves absolutely no purpose. Next, the same group of losers decides to run through the streets and subway tunnels. It is at this point, that a few people we don't care about die for reasons not explained. Finally, the annoying characters engage in some more random yelling & running. No story, no plot and terribly annoying characters and irritating camera gimmicks. Why are monsters attacking the city?

We know within the first forty seconds of the film that the characters we meet from now on are going to die. When I know a character isn't going to make it out alive I don't go the extra mile to care about them. Even if I didn't know their fate I still wouldn't have cared because none of them exhibited emotions or dialog I found memorable or could relate to. Not to mention I absolutely hated Hud who should have been killed off right away but maybe his death towards the end was more satisfactory. But I felt it was cruel of the director to make us endure his less than intelligent narrations and constant ""DUDE"", ""Are you OK"" when clearly that person isn't, and my personal favorite ""Brah"". I would have liked this movie more if they had gradually or even eventually released information about what the monster was, where it came from, and how much it cost to get the monsters from Dead Space to make a cameo? And more importantly how getting bitten by the monster makes you bleed from your eyes and explode. You never actually learn any of these things that might have made the monster or situation more terrifying. I'm so glad I watched the Mike, Bill, and Kevin version because I would have changed the channel halfway through the party scene. One of my favorite quotes from the former Mystery Science Theater 3000 gang is ""Ah! Uh you're about an hour late monster"" ""We're only 18 minutes into the movie, Mike"" ""...I stand by my statement."""

In fact it was so shaky and vague that i had no idea that one of the main characters had died until 10 minutes later when the leading male characters says so. overall i was left wondering why the director even bothered to use CGI, the camera movements were so shaky a big cardboard cut out would have sufficed for the creature! needless to say i would not recommend this film for anything other than burning.watch Godzilla instead...at least you will know what is happening"

"ro_bo_pet","1","72","126","20 January 2008"," A derivative unimaginative waste of time and money
","I assume that the target market for this movie is people who missed Blaire Witch, all 20+ Godzilla movie, and who have not yet gotten enough of the images of the 911 tragedy. For those viewers this may seem like a fresh and exciting experience. For the rest of us it is an utter failure of creativity and film making.<br/><br/>I was advised to state that my comments on Cloverfield amount to a spoiler. So... Warning : spoiler. But I actually question if there is a spoiler to this film. I personally think in retrospect of having seen the movie, that the trailer is completely honest. The only thing hidden in the trailer is the exact shape of the ""entity"" that beheads the statue of liberty. What the heck is""Cloverfield""? It's simple ""Cloverfield"" is a terrible movie.<br/><br/>Do not waste your time or money seeing this movie. This is a cheap rip off film which can be best summarized as ""blaire witch"" meets ""godzilla"" and with an overdose of post-911 fear thrown in. Why induce 911 references and play of that remaining fear? Because this movie is so lame that it needs cheap references to 911 to get any excitement going what so ever. The only good thing you can say is that it is short - only 80 minutes long. But even at 80 minutes it is way too long. I found myself yawning with boredom. No amount of special effects or jerky camera work can save this snoozer.<br/><br/>But a boring horror/scifi film might just end up being simply bad or average. Not Cloverfield. The thing that raises Cloverfield to the status of terrible movie is that it is so incredibly, completely, utterly unoriginal. Blaire Witch was not a great film - it was however original and creative - if annoying and slightly nauseating due to jerky camera action. It used low budget techniques to tell a scary story. Like it or not there was creative thought and originality in that film. It made the most of low tech.<br/><br/>In 1954 Ichiro Honda's Gojira, ゴジラ (Godzilla for the US release), was a ground breaking film that inspired an entire genre of films, spoke to the horrors of the atomic age, decried the racist occupation of Japan, and honestly foreshadowed the horrors of the 911 attacks. Filmed on shoe string budget in post war Japan, Gojira in it's original uncut 90 minute release was a remarkable and chilling film. Honda used low tech effects to create moving and terrifying cautionary tale of retribution for the horrors of nuclear war. Though modern audiences now jaded by overwhelming overused special effects may have difficulty connecting with the special effects of 1954, Gojira still stands up, and still sends a chill down the spine. The opening credits, from a completely black screen bold white characters burst forth with the awesome roar of Gojira and the rumble of giant foot steps. In 2008 that roar and those foot steps assaulting the silence of the theatre still inspire real fear. One can only imagine the effect on audiences of 1954.<br/><br/>What does Cloverfield inspire? Boredom and nausea. Nausea not born of anxiety - but rather motion sickness from jerky camera work. Warning! This movie will make you motion sick! So a movie that is completely unoriginal. A movie that shamelessly steals it premise from two well known movies. That's pretty terrible. Add to that the fact that the main characters are undeveloped, unlikable, and incredibly stupid, and you have a stunningly bad movie.<br/><br/>Since I have a personal interest in movies about giant monsters who flatten cities I went to see this movie with the hope of seeing something original. Such a premise offers the possibility of a mystery or a surprise... or some clever twist that would pay tribute to the original - the great Gojira. An homage? I mean it seemed so obvious that there was some unknown monster out there tearing up the city - so obvious that no one in their right mind could simply leave it at that - especially after all the hype. Maybe Gojira would show up. There had to be more right? Right? Wrong. I guess all the remakes - Godzilla vs Rodan, vs, Mothra, vs Monster X, All monsters must Die, Godzilla 2000 - just slipped the minds of the producers - is that it? No this movie is exactly what it is - there is no surprise. Giant monster attacks New York. Buildings crash into clouds of dust that leave New Yorkers coughing and staggering about the post apocalyptic streets were they get eaten. (Oh yeah - plan on seeing a reference to two other famous horror films - ""Alien"" and ""The Thing"") Sheets of office paper flutter through the sky a la 911 footage. Cloverfield is a completely predictable and entirely derivative film that is driven by a highly choreographed well executed marketing campaign - that's all."

Of course, if you enjoy two hours motion sickness twinned with a headache then go for it, this if the film for you. I went out halfway through (seriously, I enjoy using the toilet more than I enjoyed watching this film) to use the bathroom and returned to find out that ""they've just been doing some more running around"".<br/><br/>I was impressed at how long the battery lasted on that camera. And how that dreadfully uncharismatic man managed to charge his phone. Whoever wrote this did a poor job of trying to weave in a storyline and trying to invent characters for us to care about. I can't remember even the names of any of those people, all I know is that all of them bar the two who fell out of a helicopter died. Or perhaps they died, too. Probably. Who cares? That's another thing I was impressed about. These characters were pretty invincible. After being impaled on some random metal post for approximately.. what was it, 4 hours?.. the woman concerned got up and ran across New York. Incredible. I loved the way the film makers tried to induce shock by killing off the guy holding the camera. Shocking! Fantastic job there, you made a whole underage child at the front gasp! And half the cinema laugh at how absolutely ridiculous the 'plot line' was becoming.

But it just more and more annoying the longer you watch. The camera keeps most of the time tilting from left to the right in exactly the same angle, this gives the audience the impression that you are on a ship at open sea rather than being on land. Indeed, I had to fight sea sickness!<br/><br/>For comparison, the movie Quarantine is told by a hand held camera, but the makers didn't overdo it to become such a nerve-racking camera shaking."

Yes, they give you a few brief moments to catch your breath, but even then you're still on edge, waiting for the next attack. I can't imagine this movie being executed in any way other than the hand held approach. They somehow managed to pull off SEVERAL absolutely beautiful shots/camera angles while still fitting into the hand held setting. The acting and dialog is so natural that it doesn't feel like they're acting a script...at ALL. It's incredibly intense, you're really pulled into the character's corners, and it's filmed wondrously.

","The marketing buzz around the monster-takes-Manhattan movie ""Cloverfield"" has been compared to that of ""The Blair Witch Project."" The movies are similar in some ways, both on screen and off: In both flicks no-name actors run for their lives under the eye of a shaky hand-held camera. In each case the footage is supposed to be a tape ""found"" by authorities in the aftermath of some horrific event.<br/><br/>Off-screen both movies received tons of hype under the guise of a ""media blackout."" I remember some dopey ""Blair Witch documentary"" where locals in the town of Scaryville or wherever the fake footage was ""found"" were filmed drawling, ""Ayuh, I heard tell of the Blair Witch"" while eerie music played in the background. For ""Cloverfield,"" the marketing blitz was of the viral variety, as film fans trying to find out about the movie ended up at a series of fake websites set up containing cryptic clues to other websites.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch"" was an enormous box office smash. It was also a pile of dogcrap in this reviewer's humble opinion. I don't know if ""Cloverfield"" will find the same success as ""Blair Witch."" But I can tell you now that it's the better movie by leaps and bounds.<br/><br/>Of course, ""Cloverfield,"" produced by ""Lost"" creator J.J. Abrams, is a much more ambitious undertaking, using all of Manhattan as a playground of destruction. It starts off in a posh loft where a going away party is being held for (I think his name is) Rob, who is leaving for Japan (the cinematic birthplace of the city-smashing giant monster) for a job. The party is being ""documented"" with a hand-held video camera by Rob's best friend, Hud. The shindig is disrupted by what partygoers think is an earthquake. (It ain't) Then the real fun starts.<br/><br/>And ""Cloverfield is a good time. It's pretty intense, and at times quite comical. The film strives to be ""a monster movie for the YouTube generation,"" as its director states. In that account ""Cloverfield"" mostly succeeds, but it does help to suspend your disbelief a bit. For example, why does our amateur documentarian continue to lug around that camera while the city crumbles? ""People are gonna want to see this,"" he says by way of explanation. I can live with that. In this shrinking Web 2.0 world, where you can access public video sharing websites and watch Saddam Hussein get executed, it's no surprise someone wants to record the end of all things.<br/><br/>Believe the hype boys and girls.

These are carbon copies of people I know, and we talk EXACTLY like the characters in ""Cloverfield"", which contains some of the most naturally flowing dialogue I've ever seen in a movie, no overstatement.<br/><br/>Rob, the lead character, was very identifiable for me.

I heard someone call this the ""United 93"" of monster movies and I agree with the assessment as this is a movie with of course a lighter tone but the same sense of relative realism and utter uneasiness which prevails throughout.<br/><br/>I disagree with those who say the love story was tacked on or shoe-horned into the script. Besides serving a crucial plot point, it was simply the emotional underpinning of the movie.<br/><br/>I thought the hand-held camera perspective was used far better here than uh... a certain movie released in 1999. ""Cloverfield"" is as creepy, scary, and relatively realistic as any 'giant monster attacks city' movie can be. It's also very well-written in comparison to many of those. I've read up on some alleged plot-holes and decided that it is unreasonable to expect us to get more closure and a deeper understanding of what was going on than the characters. This is a point of view movie with the leads being a bunch of twenty-somethings. What, did you expect a guy in a labcoat to pop up and explain everything? Perhaps an orangutan in an armchair would've been nice, right? Really, ""Cloverfield"" makes you feel like you're there. It's a formidable relatively low-budget sci-fi flick which delivers the goods.

While searching for satellite and ingredients, they woke Cloverfield (the monster).<br/><br/>The main ingredient of Slusho apparently turns a tiny fish into a HUGE whale, which explains the size of Cloverfield.<br/><br/>So I have to add:<br/><br/>If you make a movie based on a book, comic or otherwise, You should have an introduction to the story line. You don't make a movie which starts in the middle of a story. It's like making spiderman w/o explaining how he got his powers. Movies reach a much bigger audience than any book ever can. The movie itself minus the 20-30 minutes of previews and the never ending credits, wasn't that long. They could have added another 30 mins to the movie on an intro. The story line had potential but they executed it poorly. It was like watching a Quentin Tarantino movie that never jumped back to the beginning of the story."

","Not sure if the film style failure of Blair Witch was supposed to have been a warning, but someone didn't get the memo. Take the worst parts of Blair Witch, Godzilla and Independence day (3 movies you really wanna emulate) and there ya go. Not a single connection with any of the characters. All of them were just plain stupid. If these were my friends, I'd have long become a hermit, or perhaps left them for dead. The only mildly amusing character was Marlene and she didn't have much to say in the film, but was possibly the only real bright spot. That is if you don't count the fact that most of the film is really just a blur as the handy cam spun around like a 6 year old on speed at FAO Schwartz. Hud was completely annoying, in fact it was a relief that he died. Frankly, I wish that the camera had been totally demolished when the Statue of Liberty head fell on the street. When I pay to watch a movie, I expect to see the movie. Watching the 85 minutes of motion blur is not my idea of exciting. In fact, the only intensity I experienced was the intense hatred of hand held cameras and moronic people who think that this is somehow heightening the experience. Maybe some people find this edgy in place of a real story, but the visual experience I had was that of motion sickness. Perhaps the sequel to this film should be done on a video phone, or maybe stop motioned from someone's Iphone camera. In fact, screw it, just toss up 85 minutes of random photography and we'll call that edgy and frightening. I was not held in any form of suspense and can only say that I really don't care to get my money back, I want the 85 minutes of my life back. I could do something more useful with it, like kick a puppy or get unnecessary surgery. Maybe I'll remove the part of my brain that says that if I want a story told entirely in dialog without any visual reference, I'll read a book. When I go to a movie, I want to see what happens. Don't forget, the Blair Witch had some element of story. Terrible camera work that made the average movie goer nauseous, but it at least had something mildly compelling. So for anyone that thinks that this will be a fun cool film that will make you jump in your seat, the only thing I did was stare at the lights flashing by as a group of totally vapid characters who evoke less emotion then the cast of Waterworld screamed a lot. Terrible movie. Shame on whoever green lit this piece of crap."

Thats right, the new Godzilla movie = S***, while Blair Witch was just Bad. Now don't get me wrong, it was pretty intense, and defiantly new way of looking through the ideas of if there was a giant monster terrorizing a major city, this is what you would be like if you were in the mess, and lived that long through it, while trying to save a love interest/friend. But after so long, it just got annoying. I also had a problem with one of the monsters, the little ones that were given off. I'm sorry but they look like the Bugs from Starship Troopers with a more spider like look. Which made me feel like the people in charge of monster design, were effing lazy.

","JJ Abrams is a marketing genius.<br/><br/>With all the hype this movie has received ever since its teaser in July of last year, its no wonder Cloverfield made over 40 million dollars opening weekend. People are creatures of curiosity, and in turn could not help themselves from wanting to see this movie. <br/><br/>I'll admit, I was curious too. Afterall, it didn't even have a name until a few months ago and everything was so secretive. With such a big secret, this movie has GOT to be great, or at the very least, unique. <br/><br/>NO. <br/><br/>Not great, not unique, not even worth the sick, dizzy feeling I got from trying to pay attention. I didn't even pay to watch this movie, yet still I want a refund. I want my hour and a half back. <br/><br/>Now before you rip me apart for this, let me say a few things:<br/><br/>1. They spent about 30 million dollars on this movie. WHAT?!? I realize that 30 mil is pretty cheap for a movie budget but come on. Either the set had some really amazing catering or that statue replica was very expensive. Clearly that 30 mil was not spent on actors with talent. BTW 30 mil is about what they spent on Ghostbusters in 1984. At least Ghostbusters was entertaining. <br/><br/>2. And speaking of the actors... I realize that the point of using amateur actors is to give the movie a more ""realistic"" feel, to make the audience relate to the characters more. No. Screw you. If I wanted to see real people doing realistic things, I would watch reality TV. <br/><br/>3. Yes. The whole ""let's shoot this from the perspective of real people with a video camera"" idea is a great one. Look at the Blair Witch. But trying to get an audience to feel like this ""really"" happened is ridiculous. If a giant spider-monster thing attack could really happen, then maybe i'd be able to appreciate the use of ""realism"" in this movie. It's like trying to create a sense of reality in a movie like Transformers. Totally unbelievable. How about if we use this hand-held idea in a movie about a real natural disaster, or anything else that could possibly happen? Cool idea. Wrong story.<br/><br/>4. Can't anyone come up with any NEW ideas anymore? If Hollywood isn't remaking Japanese horror movies these days, it seems they are just retelling the same stories in a different way. Sure. Cloverfield is not a remake. But how many times has this ""monster-attacks-city-and-people-freak"" story been told already? Does Hollywood really not have anymore original ideas? <br/><br/>So i've wasted my time watching the movie, ranting about the movie, and writing this review. I just could not believe that so many people are saying how great this movie is. Maybe I missed something. Maybe I'm just upset by how much money is wasted in Hollywood. I'm not sure.<br/><br/>What i am sure about, however, is that I will be hanging my head in shame for giving in to my curiosity and actually wasting my time on this movie."

","Cloverfield is nothing like your average Hollywood movie. Entirely filmed from the perspective of a (shaky) handy-cam, one would not expect a very visually attractive movie. This movie proves that this assumption would be so damn wrong. The story starts at a yuppie party, but then crap hits the fan. And when I mean crap hits the fan, it really does hit the fan hard. Cloverfield is a very intense movie and the first person view really makes you feel like you are in the middle of something that you would try to avoid in real life. It has been a long time ago that I sat through a movie with clenched fists and my jaw on the floor most of the time, but this movie managed to do so. Nevertheless the movie still has its funny moments, which are timed right, so it does not take away from the tension. I could say much more about this movie, but it is really something you should see for yourself. Get the tickets now!"
"cswellma","6","11","16","2 February 2008"," I really wanted to like this
","I should preface this by saying that I watch on average about 1 movie a month at the theater, and it takes a LOT for a movie to disappoint me. With that in mind I will proceed.<br/><br/>I went into this with high hopes with ""my main dude"" who was equally excited. We had seen the trailers and expected to be thrilled. We walked to the movie theater and ended up having a hot chocolate nearby because after all, it is February. Well, we walked into the large theater and took some seats about 1/3 distance away from the screen, not a big deal because it was a very large room. Suffice it to say I was nauseous near the end of the party scene. The camera work was incredibly jerky, and throughout the film I had to cradle my head and close my eyes. I didn't understand it, I'd never experienced anything like this before. I knew that this movie used this type of filming, and it didn't phase me beforehand because I had seen the Blair Witch Project in the theater and I was fine. Through the whole film I kept saying to myself, why? Why do I feel like crap. Eventually I had to leave the theater to go to the restroom and put my head between my legs, it took ten minutes before I could return to the movie. I'm only 30, but I can honestly say while watching this film I felt it aged me a good 20 years.<br/><br/>Within a couple minutes of returning to the theater the dizzying effects began to take it's toll again. I tried to cradle my head and close my eyes to shield from the whirlwind camera work. It didn't work, the emergency lights that went on when they were rescuing the girl were penetrating my eyelids and the high-pitched noise of the alarm were earsplitting and adding to my discomfort rather than alleviating it by closing my eyes. Why did I stay in the theater do you ask? Well, for one I had never experienced something like this before (well maybe at an amusement park after eating loads of food as a child) while being stationary. I also paid a hefty price for the ticket, and I was determined to see this ""ride"" through. There were some interesting parts, don't get me wrong. This film had some amazing effects, and of course realistic acting. With all that aside, the plot stunk and the motivations of some of the characters were inane. Before seeing this film I did read some posts here and sneered when I read someone trying to discredit this film because I had my heart on seeing it. To be fair my judgment is largely based on the fact that this movie made me sick, plain and simple, and that's a new one on me. It was almost as if the filmmakers were going for a chaotic effect. Almost as if this film was nothing but crazy filming with screaming mobs of hysterical people and bright flashing lights and continuous loud effects, to be fair it IS a monster movie. It's hard to imagine how this film got such a high rating. Although, I can say this throughout the film, when I caught glimpses that didn't cause me to nearly vomit, I was telling myself that maybe this film is too intense for me, that's why people like it. Then I came to a conclusion, this movie was not intense, it was a joke. I was mistaking the hand held camera work for intense realistic drama. However, at the end of the film no answers were given, nothing was learned, and I paid over ten dollars to get sick watching a movie that wasn't even a hour and a half long. In conclusion, I want to warn anyone who got sick watching the Blair Witch Project, you WILL get sick watching this. Even if you have a strong stomach, like I thought I did, do NOT have a huge cup of hot chocolate beforehand as I did, or food in general. Also, sit as far from the screen as possible! On the other hand, maybe I'm just a wimp, and I'm starting to get old, and no one else will be effected as I was, but my ""main dude"" got just as sick as I did, but that could be the hot chocolate talking. Yes I was disappointed, not in the actors (they did a good job), not the effects (they were spot on), but in the plot and the maniacal camera man, a.k.a. Hud. Most of all, I was disappointed in myself for falling for the hype that this film promised, and more so for allowing myself to get sick."

Since I made it all the way through this, I feel compelled to give it 2, but Boy!, was this a piece of junk, in my opinion. I have seen what I think are great movies that are panned up and down, and then there are some like this that got generally good (even great) reviews that I think are total garbage.<br/><br/>The premise was ridiculous: A skyscraper sized bug/frog/spider thing that is impervious to virtually all known weaponry that basically seems to chase a few people from one end of NYC to the other, for no apparent reason that throws around statues' heads for the heck of it and has little parasite/alien/baby things that cause people to explode. The ""found footage"" was shaky enough to be totally annoying, but not really shaky enough to be believable, at all. Hud(son) used the camera at some of the stupidest moments in history, and his narrative just about drove me as nuts as he was. Him getting eaten at the end was the only redeeming part of this film! The characters were possibly the most mundane, hate-able, stupidest, most unbelievable bunch they could find in a city of 8 million people: They screamed when there was no reason, didn't scream when there was, ran through subway tunnels in shiny high heels, had inane dialogue for supposedly 7 hours, magically healed themselves when they were mortally wounded. <br/><br/>I just can't go on.

","They covered up what this movie is all about very cleverly with its title ""Cloverfield"". No one would have a clue about what the movie is about from its title. If they did, this movie would have not attracted many audiences. There's really nothing special about this movie in essence. It's a cross between the original Godzilla (creature from the ocean depth), Alien, and Blair Witch Project where the entire movie runs through a video camera of one of the characters.<br/><br/>The plot connects the lives of ordinary young people with the total destruction of Manhattan, which is type of plot that became common in the beginning of the decade first in manga (Japanese comics), where relationship between an ordinary boy and a girl suddenly connects directly with the destruction of the world. Destruction of the world in this case is not the main theme - the relation of the couple who's involved in it is. You can see this clearly if you watch ""Saikano"" together with this movie. It's my personal taste but taking one's self importance so seriously somehow does not appeal to me. If you take away the connection between the characters personal involvement, which to me is just that - there's nothing that relates back to the audience. The monsters and the special effects are cliché, the production is average, and view point annoying. I couldn't figure out what the point of this movie was all about watching through a very limited visuals of a video camera, all the way to the final non-ending of the movie.

"xandexus","3","5","6","5 April 2008"," Realism?
","The main problem in the movie is the inconsistency between the technique and the story.<br/><br/>The movie promises an unconventional point of view, and it clearly claims, that it will look as if it was not filtered in any way by the film makers, and this is NOT EASY! OK now, in my opinion this requires a lot more intelligence and mental agility for everyone too keep everything in tact to still keep it a film yet make it raw footage of a disaster. Leaving all the logical flaws throughout the story aside, the film constantly reminds you that the director is still holding onto what he really wants to see. Just the beginning seems a little random, but still almost everything is for the sake of telling the story, there are very rare coincidental things that are recorded(what otherwise might be considered as a waste of time but adds to the reality) That for me is a problem, since the film is claiming to be absolutely natural, I want those random characters and scenes. (They are clearly built up as supposedly random and generic people, but when the action starts, they turn into classic heroes with super-fortified-nerves) The biggest disappointment is the inexplicably unnatural reactions of the characters. Lily is the most obvious example. She is clearly neurotic and unsettled even in a party environment. OK lets say that she likes responsibility and is an organized type of person and that particular party is quite important for her, but how come the monster gets to comfort her? She looks more relaxed after the party is completely ruined and the monster actions emerges.<br/><br/>OK Hud is supposedly stupid, and rob is the hero type situation. There you go... Two classic characters, which battles against the realism that the film promises. They simply are too resilient to be natural human beings. I can not possibly relate to anyone of these characters simply because THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE VIEWED AS CLEAR-CUT FICTION. I refuse to accept any artistic distortions (which is not there to begin with, they are hanging loosely to the title of characters) of these fabricated characters.<br/><br/>I could be with them all the way, I could feel bad for them, I could value their lives, I could be scared for them, I could relate to their demise, I could feel sad for their losses. If only, they didn't take absolutely the most unrealistic path in their adventure. Even in the end when they were recording themselves reporting their names and such, I felt ""No, come on, you're not going to die, you're just pretending you lousy actors"" This technique (I mean the shaky hand camera thingie) could be taken advantage of thousand times better than it is in this film.<br/><br/>All in all, I wasn't really expecting much, and I didn't get much.

Uarghffff!"" <br/><br/>The acting was decent, but I never got attached to the characters. So it was not that bad. It is fairly fast paced, so I seldom got bored (but I got annoyed towards the end). <br/><br/>85 minutes are enough for a sickening motion picture with little to no story and lots of illogical elements. It leaves quite everything related to the monster unexplained. <br/><br/>But then ""King Kong"" (1933) and ""The Lost World"" (1925) really are masterpieces and ""Cloverfield"" (2008) is just a Trash movie with a too big budget."

","Sure, Manhattan has its share of young party-goers, but now we know all New Yorkers are in their 20s, allowing a photogenic cast (whose characters lead boring lives and are annoying enough to have you hoping they die deaths that are as excruciatingly painful as their farewell party -- an exercise in human drabness -- that the film opened with). And to add to the torture: yuppies using colloquialisms that left the ghetto decades ago. So, sorry, director, the intentional over-lameness backfired severely.<br/><br/>Jason's nicely-complected girlfriend Lisa takes the Looks honors but the only skin shots we get are of her legs, with contrasting white high-heels that she sports in half the movie.<br/><br/>It's conceivable that this would be truly terrifying to post-9/11 New Yorkers; that there would be real suspense in the initial possibility that whatever this was, it was caused by terrorists who might follow with other forms of attack. I'd left the room four times during the ""party,"" and after the first explosion, we thought this was going to be a killer movie. Until we saw how mundane the terrorist actually was -- a huge crustacean that spits meteors and sheds man-eating cockroaches.<br/><br/>Some of the sounds added to the film's terror and scariness, like the first attack explosions, the weird baby monster sounds, and the mother monster's bellowing, anguished King Kongish sounds.<br/><br/>The messianic alpha-male hero Rob was peppered throughout the movie with inane questions by his friends who find it so difficult to see or think for themselves, it's no wonder they haven't been invited to be non-Japanese-speaking 24-year-old American VPs in Japan, like Rob. Amazing is the lemming-like behavior that compels them first to try to walk in the dead of night across the bridge (at the urging of authorities -- a 9/11 slam) into Brooklyn whose residents would no doubt welcome a team of Manhattan yuppies with open arms, until Mama Monster attacks the bridge. They then follow Rob back through swarming subway rats and baby monsters, past evacuees going in the opposite direction as fast as they can, to Ground Zero where the monster thrashes skyscrapers, so they can climb across crumbling roofs of skyscrapers leaning at dangerous angles, just to rescue Rob's girlfriend, lovely Beth, who's able to skedaddle just fine -- what's a little impalement? <br/><br/>But the badge of courage goes to the Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) who in a toasted state can swing an ax like A-rod and knocks a monster off Rob's back -- in the process having three-inch chunks of skin removed from her torso by another monster. She unflinchingly applies dressings to them (we all know how easy it is to find clean paper towels and bottled water in subway tunnels!), only asking if the wounds look unattractive. She stoically toughs it out through exposed wounds and dizzy spells until she perishes in a glorious explosion of her own blood.<br/><br/>The DVD's Features reveal Caplan to be brighter and much wittier than the others. She was nominated for a Supporting Actress award. Some of her acting is kind of cool and she seems the only one to portray the depths of their fear and utter despondency, as they rest in the subway with the hope starting to drain out of them. Marlena uses facial expressions well. Hud, trying to hit on her, gets superb disinterested expressions from her. During a lull in the film's questionable dialog, the effects of the sustained assault on the senses and fatigue from the raw terror are spoken in one glazed look at Hud.<br/><br/>But no one seems to have the chance to build on her acting. Some of the improv from Hud, who fashions himself a comedian in real life, was distinctly unfunny, and I wonder if this wasn't the film's worst setback. If his character's intent was to annoy, it succeeded.<br/><br/>The hand-held cam shots are overdone to the point of ridiculousness. This loses the desired realism. It makes a lot of people nauseous and dizzy, or, in my case, caused me to focus just on the DVD subtitles or close my eyes. Even the classic Bourne films used ""hand-helds,"" but judiciously and tastefully. And mostly on shots that couldn't be taken otherwise. Without the shaky video I would have given this film a 4 -- it IS a monster movie. Without the party, a 5.<br/><br/>It's hard to pull off the concept of ""the medium is part of the message"" without boring, so we could have had much less of the videotaping parts. Hud, the one doing the taping, could have sounded less like a ten-year-old.<br/><br/>But the flashback playback of the videotape being made over an old tape of Rob and Beth DID sort of work. This allows us glimpses of parts that hadn't been completely taped over while watching the movie itself during the military's ""presentation"" of the recovered tape (whose magnetic domains are immune to NEMP). The last flashback completed the depiction of the once-sweet but shallow relationship between Rob and Beth, and was the vehicle to the film's ending, where, juxtaposed after Rob saying, ""If you're seeing this I'm dead,"" is Beth at Coney Island the month previous, full of life, and saying ironically, ""I had a good day."" <br/><br/>What the film lacked was dialog, screenplay, suspense, real emotion, and character and relational development. Cheers for the shots of military action and first responders which looked fairly credible. Pretty decent CGI rats or fake human legs because I don't think the actors would have supported those fat, real ones running between their legs. The plot was only mildly interesting -- trying to flee Manhattan, rescuing Beth, then trying to leave again.<br/><br/>FYI, if one can't take hand-held action found in films a refund is normally available at theaters only within the first few minutes of the film."

","This is quite possibly the most stupid, annoying film ever made. The main character is a 20-something idiot who carries his hand-held camera around while a giant monster attacks New York City. The whole film is shot through the main character's camera and it is every bit as nauseating as you can imagine. In addition to the amateur cinematography we have the added bonus of hearing, ""Oh my God!"" every ten seconds or so. At least the filmmaker was smart enough to be the first one to comment on this movie, as anyone else who actually saw it would say that it's terrible. Apparently the viral marketing has worked, though, because it's making a ton of money."

I was so bored I kept closing my eyes hoping that the creature that was suppose to be in this film would attack the movie theater and kill me.<br/><br/>I thought about leaving many times.<br/><br/>The camera angles were wrong. At times the person (HUD) was suppose to be holding the camera to his head was obviously holding it off to the side. It was too shaky, not at all realistic for normal operation, but the reason for this shakiness was obvious later in the film.<br/><br/>At around the 40 min mark, after watching a film about nothing important or interesting, the creature attacked. The footage of the beast was roughly 2 Min's, followed buy another 15 Min's of nothing at all. This basically continues until the end. We see a pattern of trying to minimize shots of the beast and maximize scenes of drab boring and immensely irritating conversations about what to do next.<br/><br/>Many times I felt as if someone was hitting my head with a rubber mallet. I was immensely annoyed.<br/><br/>Everything, except for the 10 Min's in total you see the beast, was horrible. The plot, were this small posse of intellectual effluent's with their sidekick drunk HUD are trying to rescue this woman that one of the guys slept with ONCE and apparently is in love with (please keep the damn love stories out of action films!) is just too much to bear.<br/><br/>To sum it up.<br/><br/>Cheap film, cheap acting, cheap actors, bad plot. Shaking camera to allow for lower resolution animations and add excitement by making it feel like something is happening. bad beginning, bad ending. horrible!<br/><br/>At the end of the film there was almost complete silence, except for a few people complaining out loud and one man who actually yelled he wanted his money back to the cheer of many in the crowd.<br/><br/>Just like the Blair witch project, bad film with a lot of hype, hoping for the first week to bring in enough money from the 18-24 group before word of mouth spreads that this movie is more boring than taking a rubber chicken for a walk.<br/><br/>Keep your money for something worth while."
"thomas-r-price","3","28","49","19 January 2008"," Oh my GOD it has Skintainium armor!!!
","Cloverfield provides mild entertainment but the movie totally ignores the hindrances of the laws of physics, has several discontinuities, and uses several old clichés including some from our good friend the Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>In the opening scene of action a earthquake rattles Manhattan and everyone at a party runs to the roof after finding out that a oil tanker wrecked near the statue of liberty (cause tipping a oil tanker or ripping one apart while swimming apparently can generate a massive earthquake).<br/><br/>Then the explosion (as seen in trailer) flings flaming debris around the city (cause oil is extremely explosive and oil tankers apparently explode violently just like LPG tankers).<br/><br/>Later the monster is seen by news cameras on the ground with military personnel (who responded in less than 10 minutes) dropping spawns or something that were about human sized and began attacking people (remember this it is important).<br/><br/>After a little walking we randomly stumble upon the monster and the military erupting in a gigantic gunfight. Two different classes of vehicles engage the giant man-whale-squid (monster). The lovable M1A2 Abrams (tank) which fires a 120mm smooth-bore DU armor penetrating sabot at several thousand meters per second (fast) and is capable of lighting up a Russian tank like a Christmas tree (explode) and the M270 MLRS (rocket launcher) whose 12 missiles are each capable of wiping out a football field. Both apparently are no match for the might of man-whale-squids skintainium armor.<br/><br/>Next we discover that the man-whale-squid spawns can be easily destroyed by any convenient blunt object (despite originating from the impervious skintainium monster). We also discover that the bite of a spawn eventually leads to explosive hemorrhaging such as a cheesy films version of being thrown out into space or getting un-pressurized in a pressure vessel in a bond flick.<br/><br/>After some cheesiness we see that man-whale-squid is engaged by aircraft including the F/A-18 Hornet, UH-1 Huey, and B-2 bomber. All three of which prove ineffective with their mavericks, FFARs, dumb bombs and bunker busters against the mighty skintainium armor despite such a volley utterly leveling the great Godzilla (1998).<br/><br/>Finally the military resorts to for some reason strategically nuking the entire island of Manhattan and ends the flick in a poor rendition of how a nuclear blast would have occurred.<br/><br/>So if watching a movie involving the destruction of New York on a shaky first person camera (apparently super high def and impervious to monsters and helicopter crashes) reminiscent of previous flicks and showing a complete disregard for what metal, concussions, and fire do to flesh is your idea of a good time then Cloverfield is for you. For the rest of us just imagine a man-whale-squid crashing through Manhattan being shot at and a man pitted against all odds to try to be with some chick you pretty much got the movie down."
"itsandysfault","9","82","162","19 January 2008"," Cloverfield Delivers in a MONSTER Way
","The first time I saw Cloverfield was when it was first unveiled, at the early showings of Transformers. Everyone in the sold out theater was buzzing after what was truly to be a know-nothing film. Not only that, but it created a MAJOR buzz throughout the WORLD. Rumors were flying everywhere, no truths were handed out.<br/><br/>I was immediately hooked to the movie. A longtime fan of J.J. Abrams, I knew that seeing his name attached to such a mysterious project meant only one thing: drama. And a sh*tload of it.<br/><br/>After seeing Transformers, I went home and got to work on unraveling what Cloverfield could be about. I knew I wouldn't get far, as Abrams tends to NOT lean movie-goers to ANYTHING helpful. Sure, the rumors out there were really juicy, but it took 2 weeks for anything big to happen.<br/><br/>I say all this background because not only does it set up the ENTIRE film, but it also allows for ANYTHING to happen. Nobody knew anything about the film, except that it was directed as if a New Yorker was experiencing it.<br/><br/>And let me tell you. It worked. Big time. Not only did it add to the drama, but you were actually participating in the movie. It added a level of realism to the story that I don't think has ever been achieved otherwise.<br/><br/>And the monster: FANTASTIC. Without ruining too much for you, and actually not at all, but forget everything you knew about this movie. It won't help you. Even if you've seen footage of the film, you were severely mislead. The characters are freakin REAL. This actually happened...and you were there.<br/><br/>This bad guy kicks ass all over the place. Think Godzilla, but for the awesome ass-kicking age we live in now. Action is fast-paced, and whatever Hud(the ""director"", and/or the one with the camera) sees you see. That includes falling down, personal feelings over monster action, and huge physical jerks from the unknown creature.<br/><br/>In closing, because this review is getting to be a bit lengthy, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It brings a new feeling and emotion to the big screen, and if you aren't quick enough, you might miss the biggest thing to come out of Manhattan since King Kong."
"mach1ne","2","14","22","10 February 2008"," Why do Americans feel the need for stupid, totally unrealistic disaster movies?
","Is it politics? Is it psychology? Is it sociology? I have no idea.<br/><br/>This film, at 1 hour and 15 minutes, is far, far too long. My friend who likes 'big' films made me go and see it. The story is about a giant alien thing being terribly frightening and even harmful, sometimes fatally so, to many, many people in New York. No explanation for this unfortunate event is given. The film is filmed on hand-held camera in order to capture the 'gritty realism' of said creature's destructive rampage.<br/><br/>And I feel I must share with the unsuspecting world out there the disgrace that is this awful - terribly awful - film.<br/><br/>The actors are abysmal (in fact, contrary to what I suspect I was meant to feel I actually wanted them all to die within 15 minutes of the start of the film they were so annoying). This is basically a teen flick, monster movie, stealing ideas from reality and fantasy and mixing them together - 9/11 vs Godzilla meets College Frat Party vs Alien.<br/><br/>I may have changed my mind had the acting been better but by God it was pathetic.<br/><br/>Firstly, the point of this film. Why? Why do Americans feel the need for this kind of movie, a film where they are destroyed by a superior external force? Simple, because it's reverse psychology because America has become so powerful it has no fear of anything real, which is why fear manifests itself internally in the psyche, and it's so bloody common and re-occurring, this theme, I suspect it's become pretty close to a whole new cultural archetype for the 21st century. Why, after all, for a country that's got everything, do so many people feel the 'need' for shrinks? Rhetorical question obviously.<br/><br/>So, here we are. Another disaster movie from, guess which country? Yes, America. 10 out of 10, you got it.<br/><br/>I was going to start this sentence saying, it's funny how this is the same country which had 9/11 and still they do this. But it's actually sad. A country so far removed from reality that it makes films inspired by real experiences to try and make them actual again so they can try and try and really try and re-live them in fantasy, 'World Trade Center' for example. Then they release this saying it's a reference to 9/11. Pull the other one. They want danger, they want death. Anything to pluck at what's left of a heart and make them feel alive. A strange sort of death wish.<br/><br/>Yet, in the face of the utter disaster happening on-screen, friends dying and so on, the main kid in this piece of celluloid garbage, after he and his dwindling group have gone 14 miles in tunnels underground and the group all collapses with exhaustion, this boy suddenly heroically states: ""you don't need to come, I'll go on alone"" (boo hoo). Come on you idiot, you've lost friends, the ones still alive aren't doing too good either and, for goodness sake, they aren't exactly going to turn back now are they? And besides, they'll probably wonder, after all you've been through, why suddenly you've reverted to being your usual insecure self (""what? Really? You want to come WITH me?"") mixed with some new-found, Sir Galahad style bravado.....Anyhow, the surviving kids say ""No (pant, pant, puff, puff)..we..we....we're comin' with ya"". And get this, idiot boy says ""ARE YA SURE?"". Oh for crying out loud. Does he really need to repeat it? Of COURSE he's bloody sure. NOW is not the time for this sort of nonsense. I despair. I mean, if there's a time not to be paranoid, insecure, or selfishly acting the noble martyr it's now! DEAL with it! Idiot.<br/><br/>Oh and it's all been supposedly shot on hand-held camera. This starts of fairly plausible when being used at a party at the beginning (and for a few more minutes thereafter). But when they get lost in the dark and a fairly powerful torch type light comes on and beams ahead so they can see where they're going I realise this is an expensive piece of equipment these kids have got. And when the infra red, night vision lens came on that really blew me away and told me what we were dealing with here. It starts with B, it ends in T and it has the letters ULLSHI in the middle of it. <br/><br/>And another thing, when your best pal gets her leg blown off and you've all just crash landed in a helicopter and survived, since when do you hobble off and then suddenly realise you better turn back to pick up your camera and keep filming? Ah yes, I know, it's when you're completely detached from reality, that's when. When you can't tell the difference between a film and reality any more.<br/><br/>But OK, aside from that, I need to briefly go back into the whole basis of the film again.<br/><br/>Yup, it's the good ol' American Death Wish.<br/><br/>Let's sum it up: Spent too much time in Disneyland? Well come try the death experience in your own living room - 'grab' a coke while you're at it. Slurp it down and taste that bitter-sweet taste and if you don't do it yourself then hope somebody puts you out your misery.<br/><br/>Or wait until Part 2, maybe that'll help?"
"jkhata","7","78","155","11 January 2008"," Cloverfield was Cool!
","A few caveats. I'm not a monster-movie person. I didn't even know what Cloverfield was. I didn't know that they had played an advance trailer at Transformer screenings (didn't see Transformers). I didn't know that all the secrecy combined with the street credibility of J. J. Abrams had turned the whole thing into an ""event"". And I really, really hate movies that make me nauseous with their shaky hand-held camera action (How 'bout a tripod, Paul Greengrass?). That said, my husband told me to show up at 7pm and I did since I'm always up for a free movie and especially for something that is an advance screening (I feel like I am in the cool-kids-club!).<br/><br/>Turns out that I really liked this movie! Uncomfortable chair, small screen and bad audio aside (it was a university lecture hall), I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and didn't relax even after getting home. So what makes this film different? The home/hand held video taping made me feel like I was running around New York City in the dark with the characters (and oddly, I wasn't nauseous!). The characters, mostly unknown actors, seemed like real people I might know or meet at a party and were truly genuine in their fear and their decision-making (i.e., not Drew Barrymore answering the phone). Going down into the subway was a little suspect, but given the action on the streets, I may have made the same decision. I came to like the characters - mostly Hud - and could even stomach the romantic back story. I really wanted them to make it out alive(though not sure where they'd go, Maplewood, New Jersey?). I didn't get a clear view of the monster until late in the movie which kept my attention. The human-sized spider/crab monsters that seemingly rolled off the mama-monster (must be a ""she"", was pretty angry) were totally creepy and also mysterious. All good stuff.<br/><br/>Just a few things that I question but all are minor. First, how could Lily run around escaping a monster in high heels? Second, how is it that only Marlena was bitten by the mini-monster in the subway (and what happened to her, by the way?) And third, did Hud have a super-duper camera battery? With all the night focusing, that thing should have died long before all the characters did.<br/><br/>After Jason died on the bridge pretty early on, I knew it was a different kind of movie (the anti-Lost, things actually are happening!) and as the characters were killed off one by one, I started to ponder how it was all going to end. And then it did just that, it abruptly ended! I'm usually a guy-gets-girl-happy-ending-closure-type gal and this was definitely not that. So we'll never know what the monster was or what ended up happening to it or New York City or why Cloverfied is formerly Central Park. But I remain one non-monster-movie fan who liked this one. I'm even contemplating taking in a matinée 2nd viewing! Go check it out!"
"kz_machine","1","9","13","10 February 2008"," A Really bad movie
","At the end of the movie, i ask myself if it was a joke, the little monsters that attack the people looks very artificial even when their camera appearance is poor, the monster Cloverfield (the big one) looks like a turtle without shell and the effects are too basic not the expensive ones, another thing is with so much explosions, car wrench, destroyed buildings there is no dead people, come on, in twin towers movie are much more hurt people than this movie, it really waste of time see this movie, looks more a combination of Godzilla and Blair Witch Project, even in Blair Witch Project you know what happens, in this movie you try to understand but nothing is clear, the central theme of the movie is the guy that want to say ""i love you"" to her friend, if the trailer movie was a little more images of the film i think much more on seeing it or not"
"mickmok","9","54","105","16 January 2008"," Very original take on the classic monster movie.
","Cloverfield in my opinion was excellent. I had been following a bit of the hype and viral marketing that went along with the film and was excited about seeing it.<br/><br/>I just saw the first screening here in NZ and again it was great. The way the movie is all shot with hand held was really cool and made the film really visceral and real. I know people were moaning a bit about the shaky camera, but I actually found myself questioning it in parts because it wasn't shaky enough. The whole thing really worked.<br/><br/>I was a little skeptical about it being a J.J. Abrams production however, as he annoyed me with Lost and never answering questions and replacing them with new ones etc. But there was sufficient info given in the movie as to not feel like you were left severely hanging at the end. There are questions left unanswered which is understandable considering it is just these peoples video account.<br/><br/>The monster was pretty cool and you get to see pretty much the entire thing throughout the film. It also carries some scary cargo which it drops all over the place that make for a tense subway run. All in all I was pretty satisfied with the monster, except for its apparent invulnerability.<br/><br/>Because it was a movie it did have to have a bit of a story and it mostly revolves around the relationship between Rob and his long time friend, recently love interest, Beth. This part was what made me drop this to a 9 and not a 10. It was a little corny that this guy would risk his life and the lives of his friends to go back into the city where a giant monster is, to save his girlfriend who is almost certainly dead anyway. It didn't make a lot of sense and I don't think people can relate to it, I know I really couldn't. I did on many occasions just think ""why aren't they getting the hell out of the city?"" or ""what the hell is he thinking?!"". This was my feeling mainly when he decides to go inside Beth's apartment building which has collapsed onto another one, you'll see...<br/><br/>However leaving the main story behind and focusing on the rest of the film it is an awesome ride and a very original monster film. It warrants another watch for the experience of being there all over again. I doubt a sequel will follow however it would be nice to have it wrapped up in a nice neat little package, but I imagine that will spoil the feel of the film.<br/><br/>Although not for everyone (especially those with severe motion sickness), Cloverfield lives up to the hype and is a fabulous way to spend $15. Definitely a must see among the recent releases lately."

","Don't read this review if you don't like spoilers!!!!!!<br/><br/>When you go to a monster movie, there are a few things you kind of take for granted will be in it. <br/><br/>Like a monster. <br/><br/>""Cloverfield"", which I felt was more of a college cinema project, i.e., make a film that shot completely in the first person, follows four New Yorkers and their situations as they try to escape a skyscraper-sized monster. There are many suspensions of disbelief that you are expected to accept. Like how a single video camera can shoot the events of an entire day on one tape (or SD disk, as they explain in the beginning), and on a single charge. I own a video camera, and it conks out after one hour! Our four spunky heroes, navigate through the streets of Manhattan, occasionally catching a glimpse of the monster. They see exploding buildings from afar. They see cars flying through the air. And once, you actually saw a giant claw stomp on some brave little soldiers. But all in all, the 90-minute movie gives the main attraction of the movie (no, not the unbelievably hot women in the movie), a total of 90 seconds of screen time! Even Brando in ""Apocalypse Now"" had more screen time. Last but not least, with a monster movie, you kind of expect the standard Hollywood Ending, where the monster is vanquished and humanity triumphs.<br/><br/>THERE WAS NO ENDING!!!!!! <br/><br/>The movie just ended. phht! <br/><br/>P.T Barnum once said, ""There's a sucker born every minute."" In this case, if you package a piece of crap in a pretty enough package and show everyone the pretty box, everybody will want that wonderfully packaged crap. So, if you like video games, especially first-person shooters, then this is the movie for you. Everybody else: <br/><br/>Avoid the box."

This time I wish I had watched a trailer for THIS one or even asked someone about it. I never regretted going to see a movie in the cinema as much as I regret watching this one. I'm not a sissy, but this is the FIRST movie -that I watched in the cinema, that I didn't watch until the end! After 10 minutes -minimum- I started getting all dizzy because ALL the movie is filmed by a hand camera. It's much worse than Blair Witch Project, the guy doesn't seem to be able to hold the cam steady for just 5 seconds. At first I hoped that the style would change. After a while I hoped that the guy holding the camera would die... I left the cinema 15 Minutes ago and I still feel sick, what a damn movie! I seriously regret getting out of the house and paying 7 Eur for something like that..."

I had to leave myself I was getting that bad a head ache, one girl was throwing up in the bathroom and several people where so disorientated from all the really bad camera work that they couldn't walk straight for several minutes.<br/><br/>The Monster: You barely see it. Asides from the one shot before Camera Guy gets it, it's either far away or the camera zooms past so fast you can barely figure out what you're looking at.

The way they moved, even their basic design to degree was basically just a rip off.<br/><br/>Plot: if you could call it that. It tried to be too suspenseful but ended up puzzling in a ""oooookay, what was that all about?"" way. Maleena again with the bite. We never really see what comes out of her, is it just another spider-monster or is it some other creature that is incubated in the human victims? Not only that but it moved so damn quick from them screaming ""BITE!"" to carting off Marlena to the burst to Rob and co being dragged off else where.<br/><br/>Military: Basically the whole point seemed to be for them to make the refugee camp, arrange for the choppers and for one guy in particular to tell them that there was nothing they could do for their friend.<br/><br/>I saw the ads for this movie and really wanted to go see it, but ended up getting more out of the ads than the movie itself."

","Cloverfield (2008).<br/><br/><ul><li>Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.</li></ul><br/><br/>After its shocking release 10 years prior, a repeat viewing of Cloverfield still manages to disgust and terrify. Unfortunately, many viewers do not recognize its genius. Imagine going to a famously hip New York nightclub on a Saturday evening and being shocked that there are heavy, 808-styled drumbeats interspersed throughout the catchy-but-vacuous lyrics as half-drunk people madly carouse about the parquet dance floor. A reasonable person would argue that you should have known what to expect. An open-minded person might even say, ""... heck, that was different!"" But only a 'hater' would exclaim: ""That sucked!""<br/><br/>Cloverfield, directed by Matt Reeves, written by Drew Goddard and produced by J.J. Abrams, is a shaky-camera, found footage horror film which begs the question: What would happen if a gigantic, intelligent, malevolent alien monster attacked New York City? In order to properly frame this fantastical event, the director filmed the movie using a hand-held camera to establish a sense of timely realism and cast relative unknowns as protagonists to force the audience to focus on what was happening within the camera frame. The result is partly unique, partly hilarious, very unexpected and 100% terrifying... But only if you, the viewer, allow a willing suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Cloverfield works well because the field of view is grounded by normal twenty-somethings attending a going away party for a friend, brother and paramour, as viewed behind the lens of a handicam. When this banal celebration is interrupted by the surreal experience of unnatural disasters in a population-dense New York City, the fear is amplified and very real as the audience is taken along for a very bumpy ride.<br/><br/>Some of the more original OMG-worthy moments include: 1) The head of the Statue Of Liberty flying through the air to land at the fleeing feet of pedestrians; 2) The giant, rampaging monster disgorging smaller babies from its body that fall to the ground and immediately begin attacking people; 3) The giant, rampaging monster carefully considering the cameraman before ruthlessly biting him in half.<br/><br/>You don't have to like roller-coasters, haunted houses or Santa Claus to enjoy a good horror flick - but you are probably in the minority of the human population if you don't. Escapism only works if you give it permission - or else, you'll always be that person wondering why everyone but you is having such a great time."

","okay, my dad came home from work the other day with four new DVD's, I legend, Alien vs predator,American gangster and clover field. We put on clover field, As being a thriller fan i was drawn right in it was great how the characters were introduced, and how you could go through there life without noticing that they were acting, Sure the start went for to long but it built up to a great story. I was so surprised when they just got attacked and i never saw it coming. It was just so good how the filming Made you feel like you were in the same place as they were and had you at the edge of your seats, Unlike my dad i loved the film and it kept me entertained for the whole 80 Mins i reckon it has to be one of the greatest thriller film ever!"

The beginning of the film at the party just dragged it self out so long, i wanted to go to sleep! When the part of the film when the woman gets bitten by one of the ""star ship troopers alien lookalikes"", she kinda acts like she has not been bitten at all and just walks away after a very fast patch up. Also the woman who had been impaled in that apartment, she recovered very fast for someone who had a metal pole pushed through her inches away from the heart!<br/><br/>JUST Don't WASTE GOOD MONEY ON THIS FILM AND WAIT TILL ITS ON FREE T.V Don't EVEN WATCH IT ON SKY, YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR SKY YOU KNOW."

","Well, where do I start. The movie starts with a party, okay, that is setting up the stage for the characters. Hmm, but completely irrelevant to the movie! Sucks! Images are blurry, unsteady and often pointed to the ground. Most of the time you get a pain in the neck to compensate the tilted image, so that is yucky sucky too. The monster is only a side-kick, not relevant for the movie. If you would not see it at all (you do see it for about 1 minute in the whole movie), you would not miss it. Where does it come from, why did it appear, what is thriving it... no idea, sucko again. The characters in the movie are heroes or completely stupid. For sure the latter. Any sane man, would run to safety, but no, they return to ground zero and deny any offering of safety. Mr Stupid with the cam has nothing better to do then filming, well yes, everyone would do that! again sucking. Then there are more questionable situations, which are conflicting with any logic, but okay, it is a movie, not reality. Then the end, surely, there will be a sequel, but I am afraid I will not see it, for my appetite was lost within minutes of this movie. The whole audience were not amused about the movie, so I cannot understand the ratings. Even without the hype, it would have created too high an expectancy. JJ Adams completely failed with this movie (Even Reign of fire was better, with lots more monster-shots and action). Too bad, it could have been much better. It had potential. As I do appreciate good movies, this one is rated that low, as a first-timer!"

Near the end the helicoptors are ""waiting for them"" - to evacuate the city. It took FEMA 5 days to get water to the Superdome but they can evacuate NYC in less then 7 hours when it's under alien attack! Sure!

"ElijahCSkuggs","5","26","48","19 January 2008"," Young Hollywood's take on the Monster Genre
","My topic alone should tell you straight away if you're going to enjoy this movie or not. There is a group of people who actually enjoy Young Hollywood and their movies, and then there are people, like myself who can't f@ckin stand 90% of the sh!t they feed us. I suppose you can guess from this last sentence what I thought of this movie. There are people in the middle ground where they tend to enjoy Y.Hollywood's flicks more or less, but I'd be the first to shake my head at their tastes....though with an open ear.<br/><br/>Anyways, about the movie. The story is, as you know, found footage of a group of rich, young adults who are filming the destruction of NYC. And as you know again, it's by a giant monster. But what is the movie? Just them running and running just trying to escape, which would be the smart thing to do. No, instead they are on a rescue mission to find a girlfriend, or that's the easiest way to describe their relationship. Big surprise there huh? Y. Hollywood just HAS to include a nonsensical love mission that completely endangers everyone to unimaginable heights. Sure, I'd agree that it's a bold and brave thing to do, but when the guy in charge of this rescue mission is a complete narcissist who has ONLY this one agenda on his mind, it goes from being heroic to completely out-of-line and (insert negative word). How many times do you have to scream his name in his face for him to even glimpse at you?? But he gets away with it. The others obviously don't really care about living that much and I guess are in love with Beth as much as he is. Or do they just love this Hero so much that they'd follow him to the depths of hell? The whole rescue mission really doesn't even pay off very well. The actors are you're typical WB/FOX type pretties, and mixed with that typical Hollywood acting you're also given a very, very Y.Hollywood screenplay. If any of you are even slightly aware of the route Y.Hollywood has taken with humor, you'd know that the coolest humor at the moment is the type of humor the Fat Jewish Kid in Superbad delivers. I enjoyed Superbad by the way. Anyways, the actor using the camera delivers lines incredibly similar to the Fat Kid in Superbad. Though he did sound like Jake Busey....which ain't bad. The humor is very weak and predictable and just lame. But hey, it has it's fans, I'm just not one of them. I can go on and on about how pathetic this group of friends are, but maybe that was what the writer was trying to get across. How self-obsession still remains prevalent even when sh!t hits the fan. They should have dropped that love story right off the bat, but what do you expect from the creators of Felicity.<br/><br/>Getting to the monster. It's cool. It's not bad. But it's a TOTAL rip-off of the PS3 launch title Resistance: Fall of Man. Go ahead, look up the game, and look at the creature designs. The resemblance is uncanny, and if you know of the game, when seeing the monster(s) for the first time, the surprise is nothing of a surprise. But, if you're not like me, you should enjoy the way it looks, it's unique, right Insomniac games? But I do still have another issue related to the Monster. The monster drops little creatures that are about the size of large Capibaras (ha!). Why do all monster movies these days have to include little creatures? Yeah I get that it's heightens the danger factor, but it's officially getting old, and it's pretty lame thinking. Creativity in Y.Hollywood is crap.<br/><br/>And for people looking for scares, no, there are zero genuine scares. There are jump scenes, which use the played out formula combining Incredibly Quick Visuals mixed with Sudden Loud Music/Sound Effects. And even when they're in a tunnel that's pitch dark, you still see the scares coming a mile away. ""I can't see!"" ""Oh it has Night Vision, here let me help you."" Okay, what happens when they turn on the night vision? Yep.<br/><br/>The only good aspects to this movie are the impressive visuals, cool monster *ahem*, and when the monster is on screen the movie actually works very well. But there is far, far too much Y.Hollywood bullcrap and no way near enough Monster. This is just more over-hyped Hollywood sh!t, that fails to deliver. But hell, if you do enjoy Y.Hollywood flicks, this movie will be you're film of the year. It's got everything you want, the pretty faces, the lame script, the side story of love....ugh, what a piece of crap. 4.5 outta 10"
"MidnightWarrior","1","48","96","19 January 2008"," The monster gets the star
","Let me begin by saying this film had some seriously tremendous potential. The premise is fantastic and very interesting: a strange monster invades NYC and the entire footage is captured by a group of young people. This idea is rock solid. Unfortunately, it's the execution of the premise and the poor choices made by the director that make this film, once promising, now literally vomit inducing.<br/><br/>For starters, shooting the entire film on hand-held camera is an INCREDIBLE mistake. Yes, there are instances where this approach works well, but for the majority of the film where the characters are running or moving quickly, it just doesn't work. Anytime there's some kind of action, all we see is nothing but blur.<br/><br/>Films are supposed to entertain. What is entertaining about blurs and streaks of blurs in motion on the big screen? Nothing. It's vomit inducing. It's okay for characters to run, so why didn't the crew switch to a production camera during those moments where the cast is scurrying away? We needed to see them running away, but from a third person perspective, not a first person (hand held camera) perspective. It's not like the crew couldn't afford it - especially since they did a spectacular job on all the other aspects of the film (the CGI monster). Failure of the director to recognize this exemplifies his poor integrity skills.<br/><br/>Any kind of sequel to this film is going to be lame. I was glad the characters died or were attacked. Because when they were, that awful camera was stationary and it didn't hurt to look at the screen.<br/><br/>Lots of people on here claim that Cloverfield shakes less than the Blair Witch Project. Utter nonsense. As you get into the middle and end of the film, the shaking is SO bad that the film becomes one for your ears and not your eyes. Roughly 20 people (young and old) left the theater and did not return. The man sitting behind me vomited.<br/><br/>Another reason why I dislike this film is because there's nothing invested in the story. We want answers to what is this monster, where did it come from, what does it want and how do we get rid of it? These questions are NEVER answered.<br/><br/>Again, another instance in which the director is to blame for failure to do his job properly. The shaky camera and unfinished script RUINED the film. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, after all is said and done, this film might make gobs of money. But at what price? At the price of the audience HATING the director as well as the studio? Is all that money worth it to be blacklisted by those you seek to entertain? <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, skip this film. In fact, if you want, you can grab your own hand-held camera, record yourself shaking it vigorously while you and your friends scream in the background about a monster. Then put it in your DVD player and watch it. If you do, you'll pretty much get the gist of watching Cloverfield, but I'd bet yours is even better than Cloverfield. Why? Because you are an amateur whereas these guys (are supposed to be) professionals. But to me, the quality of work is the same.<br/><br/>And it cost you practically nothing."

","I went to see this movie at 12:01 A.M. on Friday morning, the first show, and thought the movie was great. Althoguh I will tell you that if you get motion sickness or easy headaches DO NOT see this film, and if you do move as far away from the screen as possible! My friend got a bad headache and we were halfway up in the biggest theater in at the place which probably holds about 300-400 people. I was not affected because I would just close my eyes for a moment if I felt like it was a lot of moving and it would help my eyes a lot. But I went into this film with no real knowledge of the film and no expectations. The marketing of this film was brilliant, and I believe they delivered a very good film with it! Now people are coming out and saying there was no plot or back story, and felt it was hard to relate or understand the characters, but what people aren't getting is that Cloverfield isn't supposed to be that kind of film. It is a film that we are supposed to watch as if we basically found or were shown footage from an attack on NYC by an unknown creature! I thought the film was effective and I truly felt as if I was with the characters while this all was happening and experiencing it with them, so it's not supposed to be a film with character development or a real plot or explanation. The film feels eerily similar to watching a 9/11 footage video, and when you watch those you feel for the people but don't need or expect a plot about them. Don't get me wrong their is a story within the film, but I'll just leave it at that. I thought the film was very innovative and almost ground breaking in the way it was shot and the feel you get from it! Great Job!"

","Absolutely no plot. Just a bunch of CG fire and sparks...don't waste your time with this movie. I for one have had enough of movies of this type with no content to them...directors think they can throw some digital magic and viral marketing together to attract attention. Well, let Cloverfield be an example: it fails miserably. The film is left open-ended, with absolutely no explanation as to why any of the ""plot"" happened in the first place. Almost everything that takes place in the movie seems utterly random and disconnected. The filming gimmick (making the movie look like it was done on a home DV camera) shook the screen so much that it left many people I saw this with dizzy. It was very hard to follow - and I got tired of seeing split-second glimpses of everything. You never get a good look at anything interesting in the movie at all.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing this, and it's been a while since I was so disappointed at the box office.<br/><br/>We got our money back at the theater afterward, and rightly so."

","Hey, I got an idea for a movie!!!<br/><br/>1) Let's remake Godzilla! Even though monsters invading a city used to be popular like 40-50 years ago, it's a new generation!<br/><br/>2) The monster in ""Alien"" was so cool and original, let's just copy that! We'll change it a little so we don't get labeled as ripping off that movie's creature. <br/><br/>3) Okay, well maybe the monster and it's spawn will have the same vocal sounds as the Aliens from ""Alien,"" but it's a new generation, the teenagers won't notice!<br/><br/>4) Realism? What's realism? Even though the monster gets bazooka'd, and missile'd, and bombed, it won't die. Hey, if it's dies, there's no more story. Even though the monster isn't a titanium-skinned machine, it will be durable like one and nothing can hurt it. Not even direct hits by 500 pound bombs.<br/><br/>5) To keep the suspense up, it will seem to follow our heroes around. Or at least it's spawn will. Spawn that can be defeated by hitting them with pipes. Or one direct hit with an ax. Hey, they're small, so an ax will kill one. Once grown, direct hits with 500 pound bombs can't even break the skin. Realism? What's realism?<br/><br/>6) Hey, I got an idea! Let's have lots of encounters by our heroes with the monster and its spawn. Huh? Oh, okay, already said that in my idea above.<br/><br/>7) Let's put our heroes in serious jeopardy: One will get bitten badly, and bleed a lot, but she'll have the presence of mind to ask her uninjured friend how she feels, having lost her boyfriend on the bridge to the monster a while back. <br/><br/>Hmmm. That scene doesn't work? Not real, huh? Okay, let's cut it, we'll put it on the deleted scenes in the bonus material.<br/><br/>At least we'll have Beth impaled by a steel building rod, that goes through her chest impaling her to the floor of her apartment. Very cool! Then we have her friends rescue her and un-impale her. Woohoo! Now she can join them. What? No, she won't bleed to death. Yeah, the steel rod may be 1/2"" thick, but if she bleeds to death, we can't kill her at the end. Right, no, she'll be able to run and physically keep up with the rest of her friends, as though nothing happened. It'll work, I promise!<br/><br/>8) Hey, wouldn't it be cool to destroy Manhattan? Yeah! Okay, we'll have the monster do a lot of it, then we'll have missiles and bombs do more. I can't wait to see the CGI on this!!<br/><br/>9) Oh, I got a another cool idea. Let's have most of our heroes die by the end. That's cutting edge, I tell ya. Very now and hip!<br/><br/>10) What problems? I created ""Alias,"" a smart show that didn't last, so then I created ""Lost,"" a primetime soap opera with suspense and a monster, and people ate it up!!! People looove crap programming, so this monster movie of mine will be a hit!! I'm tellin' ya!<br/><br/>11) Oh, I know what we'll do! To make sure this will sell, we'll shoot this ""Blair Witch"" style! Heroes shoot all their own footage and die at end, then camera & footage is found, and it'll be like we're watching history. Yeah!<br/><br/>12) Oh, I got one more idea! We'll keep this all very secret, the whole story and shooting of this movie, and this will heighten suspense and anticipation from the public. There will be mystery surrounding this movie. Just like ""Blair Witch""! Hey, it worked for them, we can make it work here!<br/><br/>13) What? Is there anything original about or in our movie? No, but so what!? This is popcorn, baby! <br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>This is the worst movie I've seen in 10 years. Awful dialogue, no story, just a monster, and entirely derivative. Brilliant. Movie is so bad, it only runs 1 hour, 10 minutes. But 70 minute movies can be a problem for sales, so...

And of course lets not forget the camera style that makes you feel like your watching a home video filmed by your drunk grandmother. Also another thing that makes this movie so unbearable is that it is so unrealistic.

","Despite the fact that so much mystery surrounded Cloverfield prior to its release, anyone who's seen the trailers should at least have *some* idea of what this movie's about. I think it's pretty clear from the trailers that there's a monster attacking NY, that everything's shot on hand-held camera, and there's a lot of running, screaming and explosions involved. If you're expecting something else, then you'll surely be disappointed. If you're not used to watching shaky documentary-style movies, then Cloverfield possibly isn't for you. I'm sure it'll give some people motion sickness (there'll be vomiting in the aisles or whatever) but thankfully, I didn't actually feel queasy when watching this.<br/><br/>I appreciate what this movie was trying to achieve (ie. making something as unbelievable as monsters running loose around New York into something tangible and real). It was pretty much what I was expecting: a monster movie done as if it were reality. I think the trailer did a good job of setting the mood and gave you this feeling of eeriness, because you knew nothing about what was attacking the city. I also think that what kind of hurt the movie was the fact that it gave away what the thing looked like fairly early on. I'm sure all those who were worried that we'd be robbed of getting a good, long look at the monster will be satisfied with the closeup of it towards the end. I myself could have done without so many shots of the beast. No matter how good the CGI, we were never going to be fully convinced by this thing. Although the animators do an admirable job, the first time you partially get to see it, it just takes you out of the realm of believability (that so much time was devoted to setting up at the start). I think that getting the occasional glimpse of the thing's tail or claws would have been sufficient enough until the end reveal. However, most would probably disagree with me there.<br/><br/>The element to the movie which many would perceive to be the weakest (the humans) was what I personally thought held the film together. Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman and T.J. Miller play Marlena, Lily, Rob, Beth and Hud. These are the people we follow throughout, and if they weren't at all engaging or were absolutely detestable, following them on their fight to stay alive would have been a painful experience to endure. Luckily, they all come off as realistic, very human and, admittedly, not without some flaws. Yes, they make some questionable decisions occasionally, but given the nature of what's going on around them, you can understand how some lapses in judgement might occur. Thank goodness for the reluctant cameraman, Hud. His comments, whilst perhaps a little ill-timed at certain points, kept me amused. I think the subject of flaming hobos will be brought up quite a bit in future discussions thanks to this movie.<br/><br/>Rob, I guess, would be the most likely candidate to be labeled the ""hero"" of the film. But not in that real annoying sort of way. He, as well as the others, do pretty much what anyone might do in such a situation. While the beginning of the movie - which set up the relationships of the characters - might have been deemed a bit ""slow"" by some people, you can see why there was time devoted to helping us understand how each person related to one another. Rob and Beth's relationship is of particular importance (given how it plays into the last half of the movie). I'm unsure as to how much of the dialogue was improvised, but considering how natural it sounded and what things were said, it does seem likely that a lot of it may not have been written into the script. I guess the only thing that might have made it seem a bit more realistic would've been some harsher cursing than what we heard.<br/><br/>For anyone who is expecting answers to all their questions....just....don't, okay? There aren't really any. The monster's origins are speculated upon by Hud, but pretty much everything is left unexplained (such as ""Why would anyone in their right mind be worried about filming something with a video camera instead of running for their life?"", ""What made that girl explode?"", ""Does the video camera have an everlasting battery?"", ""How does somebody manage to run around, seemingly fine, after having a re-bar through their torso?"", ""Why did Rob go running back towards where the monster was to save Beth?"" - actually, that last question I can answer. I mean, have you *seen* Odette Yustman? Pretty worth it, in my opinion). Despite all this, so long as you don't need everything spelled out for you and you actually enjoy having some things left to debate/your own interpretation, then you should be content.<br/><br/>We are informed right from the start that the video was retrieved from a site ""formely known as Central Park"" (which suggests that Central Park no longer exists). Taking this into consideration, the ending shouldn't come as any real surprise. What's more surprising is the fact that some people actually found the ending surprising and felt massively let down by it. Honestly, how did you think it would end? Given what we were told at the beginning, it should have come as no surprise that there'd be zero survivors (but even that is left up for debate). I'm of two minds as to what my overall feeling about this movie is. On the one hand, it certainly provided some frights, some excites and some uh...delights? But on the other, you're just left with a sense of...""Hmm."" once the end credits start appearing. I don't know what you're expected to take away from this movie, but I thought it mostly succeeded in what it set out to do: give you a scare or few for your buck."

","I give this movie an A for Already been done. However done very well, the story is simply a mix of The Blair Which Project, Independence Day and Godzilla.

Don't get me wrong this movie is very well edited and directed and contains a lot of creativity when it comes to how the movie was made. I give the director credit for his ability to incorporate special effects in a way never done before, however the motion sickness of the camera got to a lot of the audience, and just screamed Blair Which done on a much higher budget. The plot had so many unrealistic screens, I almost felt myself laughing staying common we all know if you have been impaled by an object you cannot just pull yourself off that object and then run freely for your life...."
"blactek","4","8","12","26 January 2008"," Cloverfield - Left me neutral
","Well I have to say I just saw this film yesterday and found myself leaving with mixed feelings. I am big sci-fi fan and for me really the heyday of sci-fi was the 80's which I feel was unbeatable for good story and script ideas. But anyway back to the film..<br/><br/>For me Colverfield was really about a young man being forced by a huge monster to face up to what was important in his life. Its an interesting plot device but I really think people wanted a monster film and got a coming of age film instead.<br/><br/>The movie requires you to suspend your belief of certain practicalities that go around carrying a DV camera whilst in mortal fear for you life, and the shaky cam does serve to annoy at times. Although I understand the appeal right now of POV filming techniques I believe it is simply a cinematic fad. One that should be used sparingly to build a story, rather than as the whole story. And this is where Cloverfield looses its impact with a barrage of continual shakes, camera cuts and jerking movements that stop you from taking scenes in for greater impact.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the few scenes where we got a look at the creature floundering through the streets of Manhattan, attempting to escape the continual barrage of weapons launched on it. But they seemed too short and not informative enough, once again relegating the monster to a thin plot device.<br/><br/>I also think the ending was just not well constructed, once again it took the focus off the creature and focused entirely on the main characters coming of age plot.<br/><br/>In all I would not call this movie crap as many have, but I would say it is actually more suited to followers of real life drama than sci-fi fans."

","Where do I start. It takes too long to start and too long to finish and nothing of worth happens in between. The characters are unlikeable and unsympathetic and I wished for them all to die, unfortunately that just did not come quick enough. The audience around me actually clapped as each member of the party met its demise, interesting that. The monster looked silly and lost as it wandered aimlessly in the streets of NY, perhaps one of the local cabs it was clobbering might have given it some direction. But then again there wasn't much direction of note or worth here in the first place. When you laugh at some of the creature's antics and you start barracking for it, you know something has gone very, very wrong. And don't start me on the annoying handy-cam cinematography, if that is what it is called in this case. Do yourself a favour, buy a pizza and stay home and watch television.

","OK, take a couple of Advil, a deep breath, and leave reality, belief and rationale at the door, and enjoy ""Cloverfield"" for what it is. After minimal opening credits, we are informed by text on the screen that what we are watching is footage from a videocam ""retrieved at an incident site formerly known as Central Park."" Watching it, we discover that a going-away party for a young Manhattanite (he's transferring to Japan) is interrupted by an earth-rumbling, fiery disturbance down at the waterfront  and shortly after that, all hell breaks loose. The monster  as well as skittery, spider/crab like parasites that drop from its body  attack, stomp and/or chew on anything that moves, while our heroes decide to set off to rescue a friend trapped in her high-rise apartment.<br/><br/>This is a life-threatening predicament where you can run (for your life) through Manhattan for hours in stiletto heels; survive helicopter crashes from high above the city; take refuge in an underground subway station that, despite millions of citizens running, fleeing and/or hiding, happens to be completely empty of any other refugees; and dodge the military shrapnel and fallout from zillions of blazing guns, tanks and aircraft all around and above you. Was your shoulder pierced by steel rebar from your collapsed apartment? Never fear  you'll be up and running in no time, with a bloodless, painless, benign hole in your shoulder as a trophy.<br/><br/>And I want a videocam like the one in use. Apparently, its battery will last forever with no replacing or recharging, while further powering attachments for any situation that is called for  an incandescent light, night-vision mode, etc. It also gets dropped numerous times, and nuked at the end. Wow! I was waiting for it to convert into a gyrocopter and carry our heroes to safety. And its operator (""Hud""), who at the pre-attack beginning confesses that he barely knows how to operate the thing, manages to instantly become a cinematographer extraordinaire, studiously capturing every minute of non-stop action on tape  even continuing to fearlessly film the terrifying creature, now suddenly only a few feet away, as it is eyeing him and preparing to make him the next human hors d'oeuvre on the menu.<br/><br/>At the sneak I attended, people kept commenting on the film's ""breakthrough filming technique"" and ""revolutionary style of film-making."" I have three words for them: ""Blair Witch Project."" But you'll go anyway, am I right? Go  enjoy  then come back here and point out some more of ""Cloverfield's"" Manhattan-sized plot holes and belief-suspending missteps."

It's one chase scene after another, with a trite love story and so many holes in the story that it leaks like a sieve. If they do a Cloverfield 2 (and one hopes that it will first of all explain exactly what the name ""Cloverfield"" relates to), they need to fill some of those leaks so it can have at least some basis in reality.

","Simply put, this movie was incredible. I'm not going to spend any time going into plot detail, or try to make an explanation for everything, because the best way to go into this film is not knowing anything at all. To me, it was a lot like 300 in the sense that this film has placed itself far away from everything else out there that's thrilling and filled with action. (don't take that comment literally, there's no spartan's in this movie, or huge holes for kicking people in... that said, 300 was totally awesome!) When I left the theater, Cloverfield had me waiting for the movie to keep taking place in real life. I felt like I had been right there all along, and that's the feel you get from the unique first person, free-hand camera angle you get the entire film. Now I'm telling you right now, I've seen tons of movies, I love movies, I even work at Blockbuster!!! (aka huge movie nerd) Go see this movie!!! If you're into action, thrillers, and looking for anything that will inspire or amaze, or even make you question (much like I Am Legend - another great film)... this movie is dauntingly realistic. I'm highly recommending it to you, and telling you, it really is worth it.

I read lots of online reviews and sat happily expecting the scares to come flooding, but after some annoying young people talked a bit at a party, something went bang and then the rubbish ensued. I was kept interested in the first really dull half hour by the promise that something good was going to happen in a minute....it didn't, in fact, it didn't happen in the first 125 minutes.<br/><br/>It was dreadful, awful, terrible and stupid beyond belief. I am left to surmise that people just say they liked it so they don't feel so bad about having spent the money to go see it.<br/><br/>Don't do it. I beg you.

The camcorder was never held still the entire movie. The acting was worse than Battlefield Earth and that is saying something beyond what words can describe. I actually thought Lost was an alright TV series but this movie is definitely J.J. Abrams's company's worst.

There were a dozen times easily i was going to myself learn how to use the flippin camera. If this was a real doc i'd understand.

First 25 minutes or so i was sitting waiting for something to happen, I didn't know what was going on because it had little towards a story line. The creature it self was stupid, made no sense. The movie didn't tell you what it was, where it came from, how it got there, why it was there. But I suppose that is what you expect from American Sci-Fi movies. Sheer stupid crap. The ending was also a disappointment although i did enjoy it when everyone died as they were such bad actors. The guy behind the video camera (Hud Platt) was probably the most annoyingly character i have ever watched, the main character (Rob Hawkins) was altogether a stupid character also. The movie was not even realistic for a sci-fi movie the part where Beth McIntyre Odette Yustman (Beth McIntyre) was on the 39th floor of her apartment was idiotic. 1. she would of bleed to death when they pulled the metal spike out. 2. she would of already bleed to death anyway.

If we can forget about the fact that the cameraman apparently has Parkinson's disease and is going through drug withdrawal symptoms (note to producers: shaking the camera that much doesn't create suspense unless I want to know what my lunch looks like), there's a whole host of problems that plague this film. The intelligence displayed by not only the characters, but the monster as well is roughly on par with my dog. The plot is non-existent; the film simply happens with no explanations or expansions on anything. The characters are unsympathetic and it's possible to predict what will happen to them an hour in advance. The ending is incredibly unsatisfying, but by that time I simply didn't care. Between the feeling of nausea from the camera, the headache from the dull writing and the boredom in general, I was ready to leave after just an hour. It's like an abusive relationship: there might be times when there's nothing wrong, but you just know there's a kick in the teeth around the corner and the most fun you have with it is when you finally leave. The film had a massive marketing campaign and more hype than any other film I could care to name, but in the end it was quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen.

","There's an old saying about how curiosity killed the cat. My curiosity was raised by the trailer for this film I saw when I saw Transformers and the lack of anything really being said about it. So my curiosity led me to seeing the movie. And the old saying is true...seeing this almost killed me. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong it's got some good stuff about it. First off the concept of doing the film from the point of view of people running around with camcorders is an original idea. It helped to ground the film in some kind of reality, something that was desperately needed in this genre. Unfortunately, nothing else does but more on that later. Then there is the special effects which were terrific, particularly with the creature and its minions (for lack of a better word). Then there's the music over the end credits by Michael Giacchino. And that's about it.<br/><br/>Noiw on the bad stuff...or should I say the rest of the movie? There is not one good performance from anyone in this film at all! Everyone is self-absorbed so much that you can't have sympathy for them. Not to mention that everyone in the film seems to be able to handle cameras without too much difficulty considering that they were under attack from a giant ""soemthing""! I mean even the military comes across that away and it takes a stretch of logic to understand why anyone in their right mind would let an unarmed group of civilians run around Manhatten without at least some military back-up! There's no logic to it at all.<br/><br/>And then there's the script. The dialogue is either terrible or bad. It is just like every other disaster/monster movie ever made, except with a camcorder telling the story of a group of self-absorbed people caught in the middle. And then there's the lack of explanation. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of 2001: A Space Odseey and Donnie Darko, two films that didn't leave too many clues as to what was going on. But those were cases where explanation wasn't necessary because they were films that didn't need it because they left you with enough to work from to come to some sort of explanation. Coverfield doesn't and its hurt big time from it. These films need (to paraphrase its writer) scientist in the white lab coat who shows up and explains things like that. As I wrote above, the idea gives a sense of reality to the movie but between the bad acting from the horrible script that gives no explanation as to what is going on. <br/><br/>They say every film is redeemable in at least some of its aspects. Those would be concept, the special effects and the end credits music for the record. Otherwise, Cloverfield is a disaster. In plain and simple terms that's what it is: a disaster. As I wrote, it is just like every other disaster/monster movie ever made, except with a camcorder telling the story of a group of self-absorbed people caught in the middle. Avoid the film, save your money, and don't let your curiosity get the best of you."

"skduncan","3","24","47","20 January 2008"," 50 Years later We Make A Godzilla Film?
","I gave this movie a three because the story of Rob and Beth was somewhat compelling. J.J. Abrams admitted that he conceived of the movie while visiting a toy store in Japan with his son and seeing all the Godzilla toys. The decapitated Statue of Liberty was taken from the 1981 film poster ""Escape from New York"". The title of the film, Cloverfield, is taken from the exit on the Santa Monica Freeway near Abrams office.<br/><br/>Anyway, you can barely see the monster. In typical ""Lost"" fashion, the menace is always unseen. <br/><br/>Unlike the massive Japanese military response to Godzilla in the 1954 movie, the US military reaction was abysmal against the attacking monster in Cloverfield. One soldier proclaims, ""we're not winning...""(Could this be a reference to our present situation in Iraq and Afghanistan?)<br/><br/>The shaking camera, home-video style of filming just didn't work for me. It was amateurish and detracted from the movie. You could have used HVX 200's and been more creative with the camera angles.<br/><br/>In Godzilla we know that the monster is a mutation created by US nuclear tests in the Pacific in late 1940's and early 1950's. In Cloverfield we are not told what this monster is, where he (or she) comes from, or why it decides to attack Manhattan. <br/><br/>Godzilla destroys Tokyo only nine years after the city was actually reduced to cinders by massive US incendiary bombing raids. The Cloverfield monster brings down buildings and bridges, with huge dust clouds and fleeing humanity reminiscent of 9/11. It's been nearly eight years. <br/><br/>Many Japanese viewed Godzilla metaphorically, as the unbeatable monster (the Americans) who bombed Tokyo to the ground, in retaliation for the massacres and atrocities committed by their militaristic government. By 1954 the Japanese are aware of the holocaust they committed in China and their inhumane treatment of prisoners of war. Guilt-ridden they flock to see a monster destroy their beloved city. What is the real monster Abrams created to destroy Manhattan? And are Americans stampeding to see this movie based on their own guilt? <br/><br/>If you are buoyed by the hype, or burdened with guilt, then go and see this movie. If not, then wait until it comes out on DVD."

I cover myself a few minutes to stop my head getting pain. Actually the plot of the movie is alright,its just the way they firmed it...oh my god.. i cant even stand it. Why can't they just firm it like normal movie? I think that would be more interesting for us to watch. Dizziness = Bad impression for the movie. Furthermore, the ending. It just ended like that. I wanted to see more like what happened to the monster and new york city, does everyone die? or could they manage kill the monster? How hilarious that the most unbreakable thing in the world is a freaking VIDEO CAMERA that they guy is using. It can't be broken in any situations, even when the monster was attacking HAN, the video cam will still be working after all. What a movie manz. It wasted my AUD 12.5 for watching it. I am so shame to ask my friends to go along with me too. For readers who may concern, i strongly suggest you, YES, ITS YOU, please save the money and go and watch another movie. It could be better if you spend the money on a meal rather than watching this lousy firm."

","When Lars Von Trier was preaching his Dogma manifesto all those years ago, I'll bet my left nut he didn't think it would be embraced to create Hollywoods latest pile of steaming, stinking celluloid, Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Take out the 12 minute credit crawl (arguably the most exciting thing in the film), and you get 73 minutes of headache-inducing hand-held camera-work, a monster that would've been best left unseen and a whiny group of objectionable Manhattanites, everyone of them perfectly suited - nay, deserving - of a fate between the backteeth of any monstrous beasty.<br/><br/>I was hoping the brave creative decision to shoot the whole film from a first-person perspective would have the desired affect - put the audience into the action; redefine the disaster/monster movie for the post 9/11 generation; take genre pics to that next level that many promise to do but none ever really have.<br/><br/>But in trying to provide realism to B-movie myths of years gone by, the film-makers only manage to emphasise the cornball situations and horrible clichés that have driven these films for decades. You can make the camera-work as dandy as you like, but it don't mean squat if the script and acting is every bit as turgid and wooden as it was 50 years ago - when the giant octopus (an obvious inspiration for Cloverfields critter) crawled over the bridge and headed Downtown.<br/><br/>I know we have to give a movie about a marauding jellyfish a little slack, but its not the monster scenes that stink. It's the oh-so-lame set-up of the characters lives that is insufferably eye-rolling from the very first frame of the film. The intimacy your personal video camera captures isn't like a movie, so a movie about the intimacy a video camera captures was never going to ring true. The achingly slow story suffers from awkwardly staged moments meant to look spontaneous, weepy declarations of love and McGuyver-style heroics. The producer's could've saved big bucks on all the military hardware on display in the film - with the cheese in Cloverfield laid on so thick, the monster would've eventually died of cholesterol poisoning anyway.....<br/><br/>It's hard to totally hate a film that tries to make something new out of an idea so old but, minus all the new technology that has gone into creating this screeching, lurching mess, Cloverfield is no better than the monster flicks that your mom and dad watched in double-bills at their local drive-in.<br/><br/>When the only positive you can take from a film is the viral, pre-release marketing strategy innovatively employed, somethings up. Cloverfield is an admirable attempt but ultimately proves an immense failure."
"DaveDiggler","2","29","59","20 January 2008"," Unintelligent, Unimpressive, and Unoriginal
","I usually write reviews for films that I really liked, but my friends demanded that I see this instead of ""No Country for Old Men"" so I went into this film quite p!ssed off and mildly drunk. It started with a bunch of talking at a party about God knows what and about God knows who. The entire film is told through a camcorder. ""Cloverfield"" is a camera that was found in what was known as ""Central Park"". The movie is what was found. This video takes us from a party scene at the beginning to the death of every person on the camera. That's not really a spoiler because it's quite obvious what it is and what will happen before you even see it.<br/><br/>After the military drops all kinds of bombs on this animal and there are no affects as the big monster just shakes them off, it's pretty clear that this thing is never going to die. We watch this air attack from the camera of one of the people in a rescue chopper as the big monster falls down. Everyone in the chopper says, ""We killed him! We killed him! Hooray!!!"" as the monster falls into a pile of his own dust. Right then and there, not only does every audience member know this thing ain't dead, but we know that this chopper is coming down and everyone in it is going to die. And sure as the person reading this was born, that does happens. Only the crash doesn't kill the people in the chopper right away, just the pilot and co-pilot, you know the unimportant people, but the main characters stay alive just long enough to wake up the next mourning so we can get a good look at the monster. Then we get our first good look at it and I must say it's pretty damn cool looking, but I was so mad after and 1 hour and 10 minutes of garbage that I didn't even care. Then they die. And, I must say, this camera has some kind of battery since its running all night long and all day long. The energizer bunny couldn't keep this running for as long as it did.<br/><br/>It is incredibly unrealistic. There are so many questions I was asking during this piece of garbage. I'm asking, why isn't this guy dropping his camera while a bunch of little critters, much like ""Alien"" that are falling off the big monster, chasing him and trying to kill him? Drop the camera! They're trying to kill you and you're running backwards so you can catch it on video. Does that make any sense? No, it doesn't, but nothing else did so why would that? For one reason or another, the thought of dropping the camera never came into one of these characters heads and I wish they did since the movie would just end. How did this ""thing"" start? Where did ""it"" come from? How long has ""it"" been in New York? This is the first attack? The thing is pretty big and you would think someone would have seen it prior to this and since it's so hostile, you would also think there would be attacks left and right, but no, this is the first attack and this thing goes straight for the city. Killing everything in its way just like in the movies!!!! Basically, it's filled with non stop, predictable, been there done that action after crappy conversation in the beginning. The best part was when all these people stopped talking since they made my head spin with their stupidity and dumb jokes. If we actually got to know these people, maybe I would have cared, but their purpose was to hold the camera and die. Plus the actors all sucked so it wouldn't have made any difference. It's a little shaky and by a little I mean the entire thing. Every second of every shot is pure shaking. Think ""Blair Which Project"". You really can't find one redeeming quality about this video. Everything in it has been done one thousand times before. They copied ""Godzilla,"" ""Aliens,"" and ""The Blair Which Project"".<br/><br/>Everyone around me seemed to have the same amount of hatred for this film while a bunch of dorks clapped for it at the end and my sections rained down boos and chants of ""rip-off"" and ""Godzilla."" One of my friends liked it. Since he made me miss ""No Country for Old Men"" and for the fact that he liked it; I can now say he was a friend.<br/><br/>One of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This deserves ZERO stars."
"sehrkhan","5","29","59","19 January 2008"," It left me needing closure and wanting my time back.
","Tonight I took the time to watch the movie Cloverfield with two friends. We had been fairly excited about seeing it because all of the previews had made it look great and, most importantly, I love giant monster movies. There has never been a giant monster movie I haven't loved and wanted to own on video, and when I heard that this was coming out, I was chomping at the bit to see it; when I heard it was a remake of the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, I was very excited as I love that movie quite a lot. It didn't look like the original, but from the rumors I had heard there were quite a few similarities.<br/><br/>As I stated earlier, I had never found a giant monster movie I didn't like...<br/><br/>Until now.<br/><br/>Typically these types of movies follow the monster and the military around and are pretty homogenized in their plot movement; Cloverfield made a brilliant departure from that and allowed you to experience the attack from the perspective of a small group of individuals. The adventure they had was quite thrilling and, even though the movie did not follow the monster, very well written and directed. There were very few cues from the original monster film, and those that made it in were very subtle and seemingly unnecessary unless you had seen the original.<br/><br/>All in all it was a fantastic movie, even though it was made with a very shaky handycam, and JJ Abrams should be commended on his direction; however...<br/><br/>When it was over and the credits began to roll, I was left with this tremendous feeling of unhappiness with the movie as a whole, a feeling shared vocally by everyone who passed by my seat on the way out.<br/><br/>The problem was the ending. The problem with the ending, the problem which made me unhappy with the movie as a whole, was that there was no ending. It was like the tape suddenly breaking in your VCR as you are watching an exciting movie ten minutes from the end. It was unfulfilling and left me craving a closure that just wouldn't come. So desperate was I for this closure, that I waited until after the credits were done, only to hear a walkie talkie crackle to life and play some gibberish over the sound system of the theater; and then nothing, that was it. I felt upset with Abrams and the writer, whoever that was, for robbing me of an ending I felt I so dearly deserved. I had not only spent $8.50 and sat through commercials that should be making the tickets cheaper instead of more expensive, I had spent an hour and a half watching Cloverfield instead of doing something else that would have left me feeling much more happy.<br/><br/>In closing, I do heartily recommend against seeing this movie, not even if someone else springs for the ticket or video rental. Only watch this movie if you have absolutely nothing better to do for that hour and a half. If there is someplace you could go, a TV show you would like to watch, or a dog you would like to take for a walk, don't let this movie keep you from it.<br/><br/>-edit-<br/><br/>The gibberish that is heard after the credits is supposed to be translated into a statement that the director feels is quite clever, but after reading the translations people have made of it (basically a backwards recording according to internet boffins), it is actually redundant and stupid because you already know what this secret message is telling you."

","Viewers are entitled to be given something by a motion picture such as some insight into the human experience, a challenge to already held belief systems, or sheer entertainment value. The something viewers of Cloverfield are entitled to be given is a refund. Hand-held camera-work might provide the aura of realism in moderation; a whole film of camera-vibrato produces only nausea. A plot would have been helpful, but a going-away party for 25% of the film followed by a mysterious attack on New York by what for why, while girl bitten by spider explodes and severely injured rescued girlfriend races away like an Olympic sprinter on HGH, don't qualify. How about giving the audience some sense of what the monster is, why it's picking on the Big Apple (probably something to do with the Knicks), or a feeling of possible resolution? Nah; that would spoil their joke. Please don't give the filmmakers credit for Citizen Kane-like foresight into cinematic technique for their failure to provide even the most basic elements just because they fell in love with the video camera.

"pdj829","1","21","41","18 January 2008"," ""Blair Witch"" meets ""Godzilla""
","While watching ""Cloverfield"", it's easy to see ""Godzilla"" meets ""The Blair Witch Project"" -- except you can't help but think to yourself very early on in this sci-fi fantasy -- ""at least ""Blair Witch"" was somewhat plausible."" Like ""Blair Witch"", ""Cloverfield"" is a supposed first-hand documentary of some horrendous -- if not outlandishly unbelievable -- events happening to a group of young (20-something), single friends one dark and scary night. Unlike ""Blair"", however, the scariness takes place in the relatively safe neighborhoods of Manhattan, instead of the campground-backpacking wilderness of Maryland. Unlike its predecessor,""Cloverfield"" loses much of its would-be appeal when the ""videotape"" being shot by the group shows up on the big screen as nothing more than a badly-shot movie, ala ""NYPD Blue"" and its (at the time) ground-breaking ""move all over the place"" camera shots. Honestly -- this movie was so bad, my wife and I actually got free passes from the theater for a future flick. Wait for the video -- and you may even want to think twice about that."
"gregeichelberger","3","21","41","18 January 2008"," A truly annoying cinematic experience
","Movies are supposed to enlighten, educate, edify and mostly entertain. I do not always look for all of these in combination, and usually, the last item on this list will more than suffice.<br/><br/>Words I do NOT associate with viewing a motion picture include ""annoy,"" ""irritate"" and ""nauseate,"" among a few others. These words tend to portray the event as not so pleasant.<br/><br/>Well, chalk up ""Cloverfield"" as a lesson in the that particular category. It's also another in a very, very long series of films in which the director (in this case, Matt Reeves, making his feature debut after helming a series of television dramas) sees fit to show an entity which should have remained HIDDEN, at least until much later in the movie.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a supposed frightening creature here which - if left unseen - is 10,000 times more scary (and interesting) when it is not shown. For some reason, these directors need to keep the monsters hidden as long as possible (see the original ""Alien"").<br/><br/>Anyway, Reeves directs a bunch of anonymous cast members (the men all look like Jason Lee/Ryan Gosling hybrids, except for the fact they cannot act, and the women are completely non-descript) in a story of another attack upon New York City (you know, between seeing this film and ""27 Dresses"" - also filmed in the Big Apple, back-to-back, I'm glad I live in Southern California).<br/><br/>The gimmick here is, that everything was filmed on a cell phone, thus the above reference to ""nauseate,"" etc. This is why the movie is so off-putting - well, ONE of the reasons. Filmmakers have used this camera jiggling effect in short-term bursts to mimic hand-held news footage or a personal videography of a certain scene or two, but never to THIS extent.<br/><br/>Yes friends, the entire movie is filmed from this vantage, Confuse-O-Vision, resulting in dozens of jumpy, jiggly, bizarre point-of-view shots, quick cuts and phantom edits that call for a few doses of Dramamine to get through this picture's thankfully-short 84-minute running time.<br/><br/>And speaking of irritating, there's also the plot and the acting (or lack of it) to write about. The story has a group of uninteresting Gen-Xer's, led by Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend, Lili (Jessica Lucas), throwing a surprise party for Jason's brother, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), upon the latter's promotion and transfer to Japan (a little foreshadowing here).<br/><br/>Rob, meanwhile, has just broken up with Beth (Odette Yustman), who shows up at the party with a Scott Baio lookalike. All of this drama is being duly recorded by Hud (T.J. Miller), easily the most interesting character of the movie, in the sense we do not see him (just a few brief scene appearances), but he comments on nearly every event.<br/><br/>Beth leaves the party and shortly thereafter, a series of earthquakes strike. Not too long after this, massive explosions rip through lower Manhattan, buildings fall, bridges tumble into rivers and the crowned head of the Statue of Liberty is lopped off.<br/><br/>It turns out that a huge, multi-story creature has been allegedly loosed from the bowels of the earth and, like its predecessors, Godzilla, Gamera, Rodan and Mothra, among others, it is hellbent on destroying a major city (why wasn't this filmed in Tokyo?!).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, our little group of Yuppies is trying to get to Beth, who, in a short five-minute span, was not only able to get all the way across town during the carnage, but also thought it would be a good idea to retreat to her 37th-floor apartment. To reach her, the band has to travel through maddened crowds, falling debris, piles of dead, creepy subway tunnels, battles zones and falling bombs.<br/><br/>And as if that isn't enough, the monster exudes spider-like crabs which bite people, infect them and cause them to explode - talk about your bad days. Finally, the group reaches Elizabeth, but you'll have to see for yourself what happens after that, if you really want to shell out a 10 spot to watch this silliness.<br/><br/>Another major problem I had was a scene too close to what happened on 9/11. It's a sequence of a collapsing building that's all too familiar for those who remember those events. I'm not saying Reeves had no right to include it - he did - it just may hit a little too close to home for some people.<br/><br/>Overall, the jerky hand-held camera work, the talentless cast and the revelation of the creature far too early (and the fact it is not frightening) has me advising the paying viewers to skip this nonsense and catch a showing of ""Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster."""

I really tried to endure the camera movement in this film, but at times I had to look down for a few seconds just to recover from all the rapid movement. In my opinion, the concept of the movie is an excellent one, but the execution of the cinematography with the ""Hand Cam"" technique ruined the experience for me. So do not expect a ""breakthrough in cinematography"" because it already has been done in BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Unless you really liked Blair Witch Project, then this movie would be awesome for you.

","To be honest, I don't know whether I liked this or not. The the subway scene was probably the best bit for me, and the ending slightly disappointed. I really wish they had elaborated more on the bites- even showed what happened to the girl whose chest exploded behind the plastic curtain. Although I suppose that wouldn't really have been in-keeping with the point of the movie, same theory as 'Alien'- it's scarier when you DON'T see the monster. Not that I'm saying this movie is scary in any way. As a horror fan, it takes a lot to scare me and to be honest I just thought this was a good laugh, worth watching but it's not going to win any Oscars. The closeup of the monster at the end was a bit crap too- just looked too CG for me. I miss animatronics! And I love that everyone died at the end. I'm a bit sick of happy endings!"

","The first 20 minutes are just a party scene with no useful dialog and a lot of unnecessary camera movement (this continues as it is shot from the perspective of a camcorder throughout the entire movie, a huge mistake) finally the monster comes, a few good shots in the next 20 minutes, lots of good CGI, but wrecked by the movement. after that there are a few funny lines, watch for them as they are seldom. all in all it would have been acceptable (even with the bad acting and not much of a script anyway) if they had filmed the movie from a normal perspective. They do however provide moments of not much happening so you can close your eyes to try and get rid of the certain motion sickness you will get if you see it in theater. There is even one 20 second scene where the camera is still!"

","Cloverfield - A bunch of dumb kids have a going away party (One that's drawn out WAY too long) for one of them when some big ol' monster hits New York. That's pretty much all the movie has going for it plot wise. So not only have the writers gone on strike (if most of the dialogue in this film wasn't improvised, I'll eat my hat) but apparently the film crews have too because this is all from the pov of a hand-held camera used by either a Blair Witch fan or a monkey in a washing machine.<br/><br/>I liked the trailer for this film because it was all so unexpected. I had hoped they wouldn't do the entirety of this film that way because it would've been nothing short of torture. But they did, and the second half of it was. If they were going to do it all from first person, it would have been better to have say, a news camera operator helm the audience's viewpoint. I was struggling to avoid illness by the end. Are we sure Michael Bay had no involvement in this movie? Boneheaded plots and cameras on steroids are his speciality. Even my friends were looking up at the ceiling or trying other tricks to avoid motion sickness. One scene involves a flashing light that seemed bound to invoke seizures.<br/><br/>The film has a few scares up it's sleeve, and for the first time in forever I actually put my arms up to shield me from on screen terror. But the film as a whole, is a turd. The characters are mostly dumb or weak. There are a few cool and scary moments but when when the film's only original card to play is the very thing that also makes it a grueling process to watch, where's the fun? There's no resolution or questions or ideas explored, just a nauseatingly shot Godzilla movie. If you can tolerate it, and that's your thing, go ahead. I did not enjoy it. D"

Even if it was airing on TV I would have to change the channel."
"gulastugan","3","6","9","15 February 2008"," This concept HAD potential...
","As most other persons on this forum, I had high expectations about the film. I'd seen a trailer or two and finally watched it, last night. As many of the other comments here mention, the plot is quite non-existing and the actors are, and will probably stay, unknown for a reason: they are not convincing me or anyone else. I don't blame only them of course, the director and screen writers must take some of the blame here.<br/><br/>As the summary of this comment says, this movie had the potential to be something else, but it falls rather short. If the producers wanted to try something different they should have had, instead of a 73 minute long hand-held-cam-sequence where 2/3 could have been cut away, a 20 min long hand-held-cam-sequence with all the goodies (if there were any?) in it. The movie should then continue from a normal camera perspective about the people who found the camera and what happened afterward, with many of the obvious questions the audience have being answered.<br/><br/>But, about the film that was actually made, there are a few things they could have done to make it so much better. The story is mostly about a guy who tries to save his ex. girlfriend from death. When our ""heroes"" find her, she has an iron bar stuck through her chest. Why isn't she dead? If she had been dead, the feeling of helplessness, hopelessness and despair would have been much more convincing, when delivered to the audience. And what about the exploding girl, it would have been better if she was just taken away (without exploding), and left the rest of us in blissful ignorance. That way you would understand that something was wrong, but nothing more.<br/><br/>I understand that the movie makers wanted to give us a film about what people do in crazy and strange situations, sci-fi is all about that. The hand held camera, the feeling of no questions being answered (like: why did the girl explode, where did the monster come from, what was its purpose, why did it bring all these small monsters, why didn't bullets or bombs affect it, why did the characters spend 20min of the movie at a very boring party, why did the helicopter crash, why did the monster look at the camera holder before eating him (considering the size of the monster it must probably eat 100-120 people an hour to get enough energy to be able to keep moving) and so on and so on), the fear, the screams, people being killed all around you and buildings falling down everywhere you look. Good sci-fi does not leave you with all these questions though. <br/><br/>For some people it can sound absurd to demand a reality check in a monster movie, but the human body and human reactions most of us know a lot about. The humans must therefore act like normal humans in an abnormal situation. So, about humans, they do not survive helicopter crashes. They are not able to breath without masks in the dust from a collapsed building. Cameras most of us are also familiar with, they do not stay up and running when being thrown several meters or handled carelessly and they do definitely NOT have a battery time that lasts 10 hours or so. Buildings do not have power if its is knocked to a 15 degree angle. It is OK that the monster can withstand bombs and grenades, because, well, it is a monster, and who knows what a monster can do? <br/><br/>I gave this movie 3/10 because it is built on a good idea, but the actual product is not worth more than one or two stars."

","First off, if you can't take watching things in a shaky first-person view, I strongly advise that you do not watch the movie. Half-way through, my friend could not take it anymore and went to the lobby.<br/><br/>Sad to say, he didn't miss much. The movie does one thing very well- leave the audience in the dark, completely. You do get to see what all the fuss is about, but nothing more. No details. Nothing. Then the movie just ends all of a sudden. The ending was abrupt and most dissatisfying.<br/><br/>Nothing was gained. I could have watched the trailers over and over again, and the take away would have been exactly the same. I walked into the theater and walked out with the same information I had about the movie.<br/><br/>Bottomline: When I learned the movie was only an hour and twenty-four minutes long, this was a clear indication that the movie would be horrible. Anything that a movie like this would try to achieve would require at least another hour and a half of plot. The only upside was the 10 or 15 minutes of intense ""panic"" scenes. Besides that, there wasn't much not seen in the trailers."

","In one episode of The Simpsons Bart says: I've never thought it was physically possible, but this both sucks and blows at the same time. Something similar happened to me with Cloverfiled. It's both boring and scary at the same time, even though such thing should not be possible.<br/><br/>Spoilers <br/><br/>Boring because of the characters and action. No connections to the characters were created at all. The party itself at the begging was most likely expected to do that, for example by introducing the ""secret"" love theme, but I found myself yawning many times and looking around, because there was absolutely nothing real happening on the screen. And that nothing was happening to a bunch of shallow, dull characters, all recorded by a guy, whose personality would make even Gandhi beat him.<br/><br/>Horror movie, to be scary, must be believable. This wasn't. I could describe many scene here to support my words, I'll do it just once. The scene when they get caught in the land attack on the monster... that was a good one, best in the movie... the soldiers fire a rocket on that thing. Nothing, no harm. A tank fires at it and hits, again no harm. Okay, this can happen, it was a huge monster. But later a B-2 drops its FULL load of bombs on that creature and there is a couple of direct hits visible. And, like three minutes later, there's not a single scratch on its skin. I am no military expert, but no one will make me believe, that if a living thing gets hammered like this, it can survive. That's rubbish. The monster wasn't that big. <br/><br/>End of spoilers <br/><br/>So why it was scary to me? Because of the characters. Are they really a reflection of today's society? So shallow, childish, immature? I'm not talking about panicking when you see a Monster gnawing on the Statue of Liberty, I'm talking about the moments in between, when they had a chance to cool down, to talk. That was scary."

It adds to the realism of ""this just happened"" or ""this really happened"". Although the film got off to a slow start, the SFX and story more than make up for it. Once the movie got going, it really took off. One of the most interesting aspects to me is how they manage to keep the story moving very quickly, but fit so much in its rather short runtime. I honestly believe that if you are interested in any of the horror/ thriller/ action/ monster(?) genres you should see this movie, and even if you are not, it made 1-18-08 a fine day. Trust me- the film is a lot of fun. I wont spoil anything, but the last thing i would like to comment on is that the ending was not what it could have been, but nevertheless, 10/10 from me."

We yelled, we cried, we laughed (yes, there is a great deal of humor in it.) If you are planning to see it, there are some things which you must be prepared for. Namely, because this film is seen through the lens of a camcorder, the constant moving and jitteriness of the scenes may lead to motion sickness (a friend and I experienced this.) If you have a slightly weak stomach, bear in mind that because this is a monster movie, there will be some gross scenes.

","It's not surprising that the below average viewers can't grasp the subtleties and professional finesse of ""Cloverfield"". The movie recourses deliberately to a tacky cliché (the invincible crocosaurus attacking Manhattan) and, by combining it with the minimalistic view pushed to the extreme (the 100% adoption of an amateur video-cam perspective, ""Blair Witch Project""-like), creates a very interesting, dramatic and significant aesthetic formula. The deconstructivist recipe works artfully and skillfully in this case. The suspense is extremely well built up, the thrills abound, and let me tell you: no matter I'm a 48 years old movie professional who watched and coldly analyzed most of the best thrillers, SF, horror and action movies of all times, ""Cloverfield"" REALLY gave me the creeps!

","i thought the movie was great...i wasn't familiar with much of the hype.i only saw the trailers on TV...i thought the characters were a realistic representation of that age group and lifestyle...those who are looking for carefully scripted dialog and flowery diatribes from the unrealistic fantasy people, this movie wont be for you. real people say stupid things and make stupid choices, especially when in a panic, and this movie does ""panic"" very well. i thought the monster was unique and was thankful it wasn't a giant lizard blowing smoke rings. the little spider creatures i thought were unnecessary, they seem like they were probably some sort of parasite on the larger creature, like fleas on a dog....there were some problems with the movie, for instance: the battery life of the hand-held camera, but most of the issues you wont care about until you get home and think..""oh that wouldn't happen this way or that in reality""...while your in the theater however, your on the edge of your seat...at times i even felt a little emotional like i did when i watched footage from 9/11,...the camera shake can be annoying if your unprepared for it. i didn't have a problem with it at all...it only made the whole thing more real...again if your looking for smooth camera shots and carefully framed views of all the characters and monsters,and annoyingly typical plot lines then this movie is not for you....i do wish there was even a slight hint as to where the monster came from, but i do feel however that people in the situation the characters were in wouldn't have had a clue either, so I'm not that disappointed, and if this were any other film shot in a the typical way it would be a rip off with out it. over all its a thrill to watch and i loved it."

","I joined IMDb to warn people not to watch this movie.I had high expectations when seeing the trailer.Its the worst movie that I've ever seen in 2008. The first clue that I had of the badness of the movie is when there were only 15 people watching in a cinema with the capacity for 300+.Even an older movie AVP2 has far more audiences. The second clue is at the first 20mins of the movie.so boring. When the action does start you cant see or hear things clearly either, there are people screaming senseless or the camera isn't showing the action clearly.Whats the point of all that CG when you cant see things clearly. Somethings in the movie don't make sense,like the indestructible and long battery capacity camera,able to climb down a 60+ storey building wounded in the chest and for the monster be able to bring down a helicopter flying higher than the buildings. I was cheering when one by one of the characters are dead cause i would be able to go home faster. The ending is bad cause you don't exactly know what happened to the monster (you don't even know where it comes from) and the characters."
"dtb","10","18","36","20 January 2008"," Freshest, Scariest Horror Film in Years, Critics Be Damned!
","Oh. MY. GOD!!! CLOVERFIELD has everything: terror, laughs, pathos, sympathetic characters, a kick-ass Giger-like giant monster covered with what turns out to be even more destructive parasites, and location filming in NYC (and L.A., I'm told) with jaw-dropping F/X and one of the most chillingly apocalyptic endings since Hitchcock's THE BIRDS. What's not to love, at least for us creature feature fans? CLOVERFIELD plays like GODZILLA MEETS THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT sprinkled with a pinch of MIRACLE MILE, except that I found CLOVERFIELD's twentysomething protagonists far more sympathetic than THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's self-centered overgrown brats. (The whole cast is likable, but Lizzy Caplan stands out as Marlena, who had the bad luck to be at the wrong party at the wrong time, waiting for friends to meet up with her.) The film cleverly presents its harrowing story as found footage taken from a camcorder discovered by the military in ""the area formerly known as Central Park."" The camcorder in question is wielded mostly by affable dimbulb Hud (T.J. Miller) at a farewell party thrown for his pal Rob (Michael Stahl-David) before he leaves to take a job in Japan (oh, the irony! :-)). The first 20 minutes or so play like one of those indie comedies about young adults getting their bearings. It's all fun and games until the Statue of Liberty's head crashes into midtown Manhattan. :-) Soon, Hud finds himself documenting Manhattan's destruction (""People are gonna want to know how it went down!"") as he, Rob and others make their way across what's left of the collapsing, chaotic city to try to rescue Beth (Odette Yustman), the girl Rob loves, after hearing her tearful cell phone message that she's trapped under debris in her family's posh Columbus Circle apartment building. I know, being trapped in a posh apartment doesn't sound so bad, but trust me, Beth's upscale address doesn't seem so inviting by the time our beleaguered heroes reach her.<br/><br/>The found-footage gimmick is used especially well. Seeing the events through the eyes of Hud and his roving camcorder strips everything down to its barest, scariest essentials in the movie's fleet-footed 84-minute running time. No scientists step in to explain the origins of the vicious beasts; the closest we get to an explanation are a few terse words from military personnel and glimpses of TVs in stores (often while said stores are being looted) showing news updates, talking about tankers being capsized and such. Since Hud has accidentally been recording over a tape of Rob and Beth spending a day on Coney Island, the little bits we occasionally see of the couple in happier days sneak in some backstory, as well as providing CLOVERFIELD with one of the most ironic-in-context last lines since the late Ulrich Mühe's ""It's for me"" at the end of THE LIVES OF OTHERS.<br/><br/>I must say I don't understand all these movie critics who've blasted CLOVERFIELD for its film-making style (though Richard Roeper and the Chicago Tribune critic filling in for Roger Ebert loved it, and rightly so) and for its alleged insensitivity and exploitation due to the plot's parallels to the horrific events of September 11th, 2001. My family and I, born and raised in New York, still lived and worked in NYC on 9/11. While we were lucky enough not to have lost any friends or loved ones in the terrorist attacks, I can tell you the makers of CLOVERFIELD did a splendid job of capturing the feel of a disaster-stricken city and its terrified but determined citizens. People need to get a little perspective, if you ask me. For heaven's sake, Japanese filmmakers have spent decades responding to the destruction their country endured during World War II by making Godzilla movies and related creature features. With nearly 7 years having passed since 9/11, why shouldn't American filmmakers like CLOVERFIELD producer J.J. Abrams, writer Drew Goddard, and director Matt Reeves make a horror movie in which New York City is decimated by a giant monster who makes Godzilla look like a sweetheart, with nightmarish, surreal destruction and loss of life that outdoes even the horror of the World Trade Center attacks? I mean, at least in real life, the entire borough of Manhattan and its people weren't destroyed. In the meantime, those of you reading this who haven't seen CLOVERFIELD yet should drop everything and go see it now, now, NOW!!! <br/><br/>...Migraine and Motion-Sickness Sufferer Alert... It's been said that for some sensitive moviegoers, the deliberately shaky camera-work in certain scenes caused queasiness. To be fair, I can understand why. For me personally, the combination of the Shaky-Cam and the strobe-like effect of the malfunctioning lights in Beth's ruined hallway during the Columbus Circle rescue scene kept threatening to trigger my migraines. However, I don't consider that to be a flaw in the movie so much as a flaw in my brain. :-) Nevertheless, the Shaky-Cam cinematography is appropriate for the film's premise, so hey, caveat emptor! ...End Migraine and Motion-Sickness Sufferer Alert..."

","That's the word that came to mind when the movie ended. Everyone in the theater laughed when the first credit showed...NO ONE seemed to have thought it was a great movie. It sucked. Great effects, no doubt, but that's not enough to sustain a movie. No story. No explanation. Not scary. Pretty stupid. I don't want to spoil it for anyone that still feels a need to go, but there are so many little dumb pieces to this movie that it is unnecessary to dissect the movie into parts. And it will make me feel even more duped for paying if I think how many times I realized how short this movie fell from delivering the goods.

"sobeit712","1","18","36","19 January 2008"," An audio and visual assault
","Making a movie is definitely a team project, which involves a group of talented professionals spending considerable amount of time and money in shooting, editing and post production finishing, presumably test viewing of something that theoretically, should at least turn out to be reasonably acceptable judging by common sense of an average person. It is exactly this nature of movie making that makes me the more bewildered and dumbfounded whenever I witness something that's truly awful. Unfortunately, this movie turn out to be one of them.<br/><br/>The whole movie is made from the perspective of a rather loud and dimwitted individual defies all common sense, shakes and bumps his handycam throughout 10 hours of ordeal of his friends trying to survive an apocalyptic event. During the 2 hours sitting, I've been constantly asking myself, why hadn't anyone who participated in the making of this movie tried to ask this one simple question: isn't it more plausible for him to ditch the camera and run for his life? Why on earth did he keep recording instead of offering a helping hand like a normal human being when his friends needed his help the most.<br/><br/>Common sense aside, the viewing experience is crude and downright torturing. It is actually physically nauseating. I kept wishing that the cam is just a deploy before the real movie begins. I was wrong. By the end of the movie, which is one of those wtf ending, I felt violently ill.<br/><br/>I understand the intention of the director, which is trying to make this movie appear to be as real as possible. It turned out to be a really cheap trick and gets so obvious and old 30 minutes into the movie. How can you convince your audience the experience is real when the very gimmick to draw your audience in totally unreal at the same time. A real person would have put down the damn camera as soon as the hell broke loose. Instead, the guy kept shooting and mouthing and yelling and violently shaking the camera for 2 hours.<br/><br/>There're just so many this type of movie out there nowadays. So the director choose to do something different, which is understandable. But he ultimately failed when he decided to put all of his eggs in this one shaky basket. He bet the whole movie on the ""Blair Witch Project"" inspiration. I know the comparison had probably been made by others already. They are not the same. The difference is: it works well for Blair Witch Project, it totally failed for this movie. Blair witch project had a purpose of filming through the handycam. This movie had no purpose and it's very unappropriated for the guy to keep shooting the cam under this circumstances."
"tommyknockers-1","3","18","36","19 January 2008"," (spoilers) Don't Believe The Hype (spoilers)
","***SPOILERS!***<br/><br/>I wont deny that CLOVERFIELD delivers $8 of entertainment, but it falls far short of what it claims to be. <br/><br/>CLOVERFIELD negates its ""found footage"" schtick again and again. The exposition is blatant and forced - you constantly feel the writer leaning over and telling you the story rather than allowing you to put the pieces together yourself - mainly for the sake of establishing a generic lovestory no one came to see. It feels about as real as episode of THE REAL WORLD, complete with confessionals + backstory flashbacks. The ""camcorder"" POV works only if you buy that these kids make home movies with the same rig THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM was shot on. It looks way too good. Why not use a real consumer-grade camcorder? - if not for realism, than at least to hide your Xbox-level CGI. The director consciously breaks the illusion by allowing the cam's date mark to conveniently and inexplicably disappear once the action kicks in. <br/><br/>Whoever started praising CLOVERFIELD as a Re-invention of the Monster Movie did this film a huge disservice. The plot is nearly identical to just about any 1950's monster movie. All the narrative contrivances are there - The Sacrificed Family Member, The Quest to Save The Girl Despite All Odds, The Bumbling Sidekick, The Cynical Victim - just rewrapped in American Apparel and shot in shaky-vision. The only supposedly new element here is the ""camcorder POV""/""found footage"" angle - its been done dozens of times - and this is the least convincing example I've yet to see. <br/><br/>Its comical how many times the gang crosses paths with the monster. Critics often belittle an action film as a ""theme park ride"", but this is the first I've seen that actually feels like you're riding the tracks at Universal Studios Florida - on a coaster that loops around the beast again and again and again. I like those rides - and this is a fun one, but its hardly a great movie, and I can't imagine it having much of a life on home video. <br/><br/>ps - In my opinion, as over-the-top as THE MIST gets, it succeeds in nearly every way this movie falls short."
"paulwzhao","5","23","48","21 January 2008"," It must be my fault that I hated this movie
","First off, this movie has to be the most talked about and controversial movie of all time judging by the astronomical amount of buzz and comments it generated before and after its release. So far, most of them have been positive but nevertheless, it is undeniably one of those movies that you either hate or love.<br/><br/>Originally, I plan to give it a zero. But after some soul searching, I thought a 5 would be more appropriate if I put aside my personal grudge and disappointment due to false hope and misguided expectation.<br/><br/>It is unquestionably a brainchild of digital age. This movie would not be the least bit relevant and effective if we are not in the prime age of camera phone, youtube and digicam. In the time of prime media being flooded with low quality captures of real life events, this movie had hit home and heart of many audiences, as it was cleverly packaged, devised, staged and deployed to make you believe. Without the sense of realism, this movie is reduced to nothing but failed, pretentious, crude and vomit inducing piece of eyesore. The biggest problem that I have is that: IT DIDN'T MAKE ME BELIEVE! Hence my title of this review: it must be my fault that I hated this movie.<br/><br/>My fault number 1: I didn't know that it's going to be shot entirely on handy cam. (I guess I just wasn't that much on the vibe of current events) It thus to my shock, amazement and disbelieve that 40 minutes into the movie, the guy is still holding the damn camera though common sense would tell us that any sane and normal human being would have ditched the camera by now.<br/><br/>This factor alone had cracked a big hole for me in the credibility and authenticity of this movie.<br/><br/>My fault number 2: I'm just too critical and analytical for my own good, thus deprived me the joy of being immersed into the experience. There are time and time again that it seems extremely inappropriate for them to keep recording when they actually need to run for their life. A guy who had never dealt much with camera in his entire life all of a sudden just turned into this obsessive camera nut who insist on filming in the most inopportune moment of his life when he supposed to cover his friends and his own ass. This just takes away more credibility and simply became a distraction.<br/><br/>My fault number 3: I actually noticed all the ploy, tricks and gimmicks of tension building 5 minutes into the movie. Many here have asked the purpose of first 20 minutes of mind numbing footage of some guys and some girls and some farewell party. I actually noticed that it's there to make it real for you and prepare your mind for a shock. The problem is that there's no shock for me as I know it's a trick to lay the tone for it to be some mundane home movie and then all of a sudden just hit you with a monster. Well duh, the movie poster and trailer show liberty statue's head got ripped off, so I was expecting a monster and I knew the director was priming me for a shock. Only that it didn't shock me. Instead, I kept asking: when are you going to cut the chase and show us the damn monster already? You spent 20 minutes trying to tell me that it's just a normal day for normal people. I got it already!!! <br/><br/>My fault number 4: I'm just not that romantic. The story centers around a guy for some reason, during a life threatening apocalyptic event, all of sudden became desperately romantic and heroic and dead bent on saving a girl (who already had a boyfriend) he had one night stand with. It sort of makes sense since it may be his last chance because he's going to Japan. Also it might add to the effect that they are all about to die any minute. Riiiiight Am I the only who see the glaring gaping hole in logic here? Just for the convenience of recording the whole event for our viewing enjoyment, his friends decided to tag along, one of them is a girl who had only met him 3 times in her whole life and was apparently drunk every time. Another one is our camera man who apparently wasn't that tight with him but somehow determined to risk his life and follow him and managed to record the whole event. THEY HARDLY SEEM TO BE HIS FRIEND IF YOU ASK ME! But I'm just thinking too much.<br/><br/>My fault number 5: I thought movies, like music, are supposed to be appealing to our sensory organs. I guess I'm wrong. This movie is as visually appealing as having someone grab your feet and lift you upside down and start violently shaking you for pocket changes  FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS! There are times that I literally hope the fat guy behind the camera just die so all of this visual abuse would stop. Defies all logic, he survived many odds while managing to keep the camera rolling. In the end, the biggest tragedy is not death, but headache. At least that's the case for me.<br/><br/>My fault number 6: I miserably failed to make the connection between this movie and 9/11. I never sense the urgency of national defense crisis that got some of the viewers here so worked up. All I got out of this movie is an ill attempt to present a far fetched concept in a realistic package.<br/><br/>If it not for me being a stubborn, cynical, judgmental and overly analyzing SOB, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>Instead, I felt like this is an overly elaborated youtube hoax."

The camera angles that they move with become annoying and the farther along the movie goes the more annoyed you become. Now I understand that it was creative and the marketing for this movie was well done but I cannot recommend this movie.

"geoffreytuck","2","23","48","17 January 2008"," Example of a horrible movie
","This movie can now be used as the example of all the things not to do in a movie: Do not shake the camera repeatedly the entire movie. Do not have the actors scream the entire movie, even when they're not in danger. Do not have a movie about a killer monster in which you get to see nobody die.<br/><br/>This movies 2 redeeming factors are the monster looks freaking awesome and the script is fairly funny in places (very few, most of the script is *puff puff* AHHHHHHHH!).<br/><br/>If you can stay awake for the first hour of this movie you will get to see both the funny parts of the script and the monster. But in my opinion you should just go rent Godzilla and look up Cloverfield on google and look at the screen shots of the monster. A completely horrible movie. <br/><br/>If you were unfortunate enough to ever see the movie Open Water it is about the only movie like this one. You see the bad guy (a shark in a tank) but when they get attacked all you see is the actors saying ""Ahh I got bitten"". Cloverfield uses the same ""believe us it's true"" tactic and takes all the violence out of a killer monster movie. You get to see no action at all, unless you count 5 people running down a street."

","I think id say this is one of the most intense films I've ever seen at the cinema - first film I've really seen since childhood that i actually found thrilling to watch. some people complain about the long intro with the party etc, but i thought, whilst it did get a little boring, that it was so worth it once the action kicked in as it suddenly made what the characters were experiencing, and their reactions to it, so much more shocking and sudden. the switch from relative normality to chaos really was done so well.<br/><br/>another issue that seems constantly bought up in the negative reviews to this film is the lack of any explanation about the monster, or really anything thats happening. again though, whilst you are left with a marginally unfulfilled curiosity, i left the cinema with a feeling of satisfaction none the less - based on the knowledge that had anything been explained, it would have ruined the whole thing for me. some lame explanation about the monsters origin etc etc would remove all credibility in my eyes. credibility being something that probably comes quite hard to movies about huge monsters, i thought that leaving a great-unknown was the perfect solution.<br/><br/>really thrilling film, and definitely one to see at the cinema or on a big TV as opposed to streaming...<br/><br/>really decent movie in my eyes-"
"hanzorro1","2","20","41","21 January 2008"," Terrible and makes you sick
","My wife and I wanted to see this movie, especially because of all the hype. But I found the movie to be bad. It was very bad. So bad that I wanted to leave 3o minutes into it, but stuck with it in hopes that something would eventually get better. It didn't. I found myself not caring for any of the characters. They were superficial and did not have any character development to them. So much so that when one of them died I felt like saying ""so what."" The plot was not original either. It has been done, a lot, and by better directors also. I also found myself hating the way that ""Hud"" filmed the events. Especially with all the shaking of the camera. They wanted to be more realistic in how this movie was made but how realistic is this movie really. Truthfully if a giant monster was attacking you and its minions were going to bite you forget the camera and run.... What about the battery life of the camera. If the main character's cell phone batter died how come the video camera didn't? And if you were in your apartment with a bar sticking out of your shoulder wouldn't you die from bleeding out? The only thing that interests me was to find out what kind of creature could bite you to make you explode, and where the giant monster came from. That was all. I also was very upset that this movie made my wife sick. With the constant moving of the hand-held camera it made her motion sick.<br/><br/>So sick that she lost all of her dinner later when we got home, and we live not even five minutes from the theater. Thank goodness we didn't stay for the credits any longer<br/><br/>I should have asked for two refunds. One for our tickets and one for the dinner I paid for before the movie. We were not the only ones though. I was in the isle seat and saw many people get up and leave the theater and never come back. Two patrons if fact were seating on the floor as we walked out trying to recover from their experience. That was sad also.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money or time."
"frich71-1","1","20","41","21 January 2008"," holy hell i didn't think it was possible
","a movie as bad as AVP:r and I didn't even have to wait a month.<br/><br/>I promised I wouldn't see it. Then a friend came into to town and talked me into it. Blair Witch with a budget. Just what I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Much like AVP:r Cloverfield lacks just about everything, such as: a plot, decent writing, believable sympathetic characters, continuity and direction. You suck JJ and if you ruin Star Trek, which based on your casting choices I think is likely, I'm going to be extremely peeved.<br/><br/>Not once did this movie honestly build tension. All tension is created by way of gimmick, ie a quick flash of the camera to an incident. Why is this movie so bad? Because like Blair Witch, which I hated and thought was over-hyped unentertaining trash, the use of the shaky cam is a cheap way to try and build tension the script lacks. Ooooh things are bouncy, they must be running, crash, oohh someone fell--oops. But whereas the BWP was tolerable visually Cloverfield is not. The theater was full when the movie started...not so full when the crap finally mercifully ended. Memo to JJ..shaky cam OK, but you can't focus on strobing lights---are you trying to kill people via seizures? Between the bright lights and nonstop jitter it is hard for someone who doesn't have motion sickness or epilepsy to watch this movie. I'm just glad the people who got sick were able to get up and leave and didn't try and force themselves to stay and suffer worse health problems.<br/><br/>Finally, how do these movies get funded? ""I have no script. I don't want name actors. It's going to be shot POV handcam. Monster. Statue of Liberty's head will roll. You in?"" ""Why sure that sounds wonderful? But how you going to market it?"" ""Well, glad you asked. We film the trailer first. We leak it on the web. Viral marketing. People will see the trailer. 1-18-08. People will try and solve the riddle of Slusho. 1-18-08. That is all."" All aspiring directors, hire a good web based marketing firm then you can produce a five dollar movie and make a fortune. I'm sure the CG, which was clipped and well awful in Cloverfield, was costly but other than that this movie was done on the cheap. The bare bones cheap. The honest to god must've paid cast and crew with beer cheap.<br/><br/>Now a new age old conundrum is born. Which is worse, AVP:r or Cloverfield? Well only about a dozen people shared the theater with me on DEC 26 for AVP:r and none ran out to puke--then again at least a few people leaving Cloverfield were smiling. I don't know."
"Rick_Bman","3","20","41","20 January 2008"," Too much melodrama, not enough monster.
","A lot of the reviews I read about this state that the camera work is the only real negative about the film. Other than that it seems that people, for the most part, really enjoyed the movie. I will however start off my review by saying; the camera work was the least of my problems and in fact the camera work didn't really bother me at all. However, I was bothered by just about everything else that the movie had to offer.<br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>The ""relationship"" that was a major part of the film was, in a word, boring. It wasn't at all interesting and didn't make me any more interested in the characters then I would have been had we just been thrown into the middle of the film with no previous knowledge of the characters. None of the characters were at all likable, so I pretty much wanted them to die... well except Marlena she was kind of cool. The relationship melodrama that was going on in the uninteresting people's lives was so dull that beginning party sequence bored me to such a level that when the attack finally came I looked over at my friend and said ""Finally, now these annoying people can start dying."" <br/><br/>I had heard from several people that the movie was scary and suspenseful so I was at least hopeful on that level once the attack started. However, none of the ""scary"" moments were at all scary, I saw each and every scare coming from a mile away. As soon as they went down into the dark subway it was pretty obvious that they would get attacked down there and then when the attack finally happened they gave it to much build up that it didn't surprise or shock me. Also, when they were flying over the monster in the helicopter and they were cheering because they though it was dead I just knew that it was going to jump up and hit the helicopter. Which brings up the question, if the pilot of the helicopter was supposed to be evacuating these people why was he just flying directly over the monster while it was being bombed, why didn't he change course and get the heck out of there? Which then brings up the question, how did they survive the helicopter crash? The pilot dies but the three main characters somehow survive? How does that work exactly? The movie seriously should have ended with the helicopter crash; it would have made a lot more sense.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes of the monster attacking the city were pretty cool. One scene that stands on in my mind in particular is the one that happens right before they go down in the subway where the tanks roll in and start attacking the monster and the main characters are just kind of stuck there with nowhere to go. That was actually a very cool scene; however scenes like this were too few and far between to keep the movie interesting for me.<br/><br/>I will agree with some of the things I have read that the CGI was very well done, especially considering that all the shots were hand held. I am sure it is hard enough to animate a monster into a movie when the camera is still, but it has got to be extra hard when the camera is going all over the place. It probably becomes much harder to find references for where to put the monster from frame to frame.<br/><br/>So, in short, the characters weren't at all likable or interesting and the love story was dull. I never really felt that there was any suspense in the movie because all the scares were predictable. The only cool parts were when the monster was destroying the city and there really wasn't enough of that to justify an 84 minute length. And it is pretty sad when a movie is only 84 minutes and is unable to even justify that short length.<br/><br/>I feel the movie could have benefited from maybe seeing everything from more than one perspective. Perhaps instead of finding one camera, the military finds three cameras at different places in the city that see different things. This definitely would have helped the movie reach feature length without having to pad it with the uninteresting melodrama, because honestly the relationship part of the movie felt like it was just there as filler to get the movie up to a length that they could actually show in the theater."

Was the entire movie scripted, or partly improvised? Either way, it was badly done.<br/><br/>The ending is horrible, no matter how you look at it.

","Per the IMDb guidelines I will first list the reasons this movies sucks.<br/><br/>1) Total lack of any kind of camera work... You WILL feel sick. <br/><br/>2) Irreverent footage at the beginning for about 20 minutes into the movie. This footage serves NO purpose in the movie only to fill time and bore the audience. You could show up 20 minutes late for the movie and not have to ask any questions because you didn't miss anything.<br/><br/>3) Crappy characters.. The cameraman in the movie is annoying and ruins most parts of the movie with stupid comments. The other characters are totally forgettable.<br/><br/>4) A shaky story line (even for a fiction film)<br/><br/>5) The previews don't match the actual film. They portray the film as something that it defiantly isn't. If they would have shown even a little bit of actual footage from the film no one would see it.<br/><br/>6) As if all that isn't enough it doesn't have an ending at all. The end of the movie comes out of no where and there is no real point to the entire movie. It is almost like they realized how bad this movie truly is and just gave up in the middle of filming it.<br/><br/>7) See all the above<br/><br/>This movie just goes to show that you cannot trust IMDb, critics, or the previews that you see on TV. All the previews made this movie look like a good show. I have never seen such an awful movie. This movie was 1 hour and 20 minutes of pure torture not to mention a utter and total waste 9 dollars. I would have personally had more fun throwing the money out the window as I drove by the movie theater. I was actually sitting there wishing I could just fall asleep.<br/><br/>This opinion is not only mine but is shared with the 3 friends that I went to go see this movie with. 10 minutes into the movie I would have gotten my money back and left if I could have.<br/><br/>It wouldn't even be worth the bandwidth to download a pirated copy thats how little I think of it. It is utter and total garbage.<br/><br/>In short: Do Not Go And See This Movie."

","So I arrived at the movie theater with day light and I noticed that next to the emergency exits there was vomit, weird I though, then after seeing this garbage I understood. I believe the directory was trying to film a mockumentary that would explain why all the 80 minutes this joke of a picture lasted had all the scenes filmed with a shaky camera (beware of the nausea if you are prone to motion sickness), it is obvious that he told the ""actor""/cinematographer to shake it on purpose (a rip-off of The Blair Witch Project) which it doesn't make any sense at all specially at the beginning of the movie before the chaos. What the SteadyShot was not working? The Godzilla copycat was pathetic at best and the little critters were laughable. Don't waste your time and money wait for the DVD if you really have to see it."

They don't really do anything to try to survive, they don't try to figure out how to help themselves, they are completely helpless, and stupid.

"KennyKJCW","2","20","41","18 January 2008"," Quite Possibly The worst movie I've ever seen!!
","This may contain some comments considered spoilers, but that may be because I hated the movie so much. I am one of those people that don't want to read too much about a movie before i see it, and I never take a critics advice, I feel i can make my own opinions about a movie, and have never felt the need to comment like this, as everyone has different tastes, and that is why there are different kinds of movies.<br/><br/>I've been waiting since the teaser came out with transformers for this movie to come out. So being as excited as I was I went to see the movie at a 12:01 am showing. Now the thought of seeing what Abrams' quoted as being (and i'm paraphrasing a little here) as this monster being ""America's own answer to Godzilla"" had me intrigued, I absolutely love Lost, and have started watching reruns of Alias, so I assumed that something JJ would put his seal of approval on would be (even if not living up to the hype)enjoyable and entertaining, better than sitting at home.<br/><br/>You know that party scene that they show in the trailers?? Well thats the first twenty minutes of a movie that lasts about an hour and 35 minutes including 15 minutes of previews and 5 or so minutes of credits. So, we're talking about a mere 70 minutes of monster movie with less than 50 minutes of forward plot progression. The surprises in the movie are so drawn out and telegraphed that when they happen you see it coming and are not surprised. Case in point...<br/><br/>** Spoiler** On the first attempt to leave the city, a mass exodus of people walking across a bridge (somethings gonna happen), Rob gets phone call, for some reason he stops walking, three main characters stop with him, separating Jason (something's gonna happen) who they spent a good majority of the previous twenty five minutes introducing, a girl in heels can push her way back through the crowd but this guy cant?? (somethings gonna happen) then Jason climbs a light pole so that we can see how separated he is from everyone else, then the monster attacks and Jason is gone, yup very surprising.<br/><br/>Thats an example of every ""surprise"" or turn in this movie. Now there has been a lot of talk that the camera work, having the entire movie filmed from the POV of someone holding a camcorder, is revolutionary and exciting. Yes it was, 10 years ago in the Blair Witch Project. But the main difference is that every once in a while you'd get a steady camera shot. This could have easily been done (to the audiences relief) by setting the camera down for more than 5 seconds, on a table or the ground. The uneasy feeling that they talk about isn't from fear or excitement but from nausea.<br/><br/>The monster isn't seen enough to be scary, the slow reveal of the monster is so slow that without a score by John Williams, its just lacking When you finally do see the whole thing you get the feeling of ""that's it?"", again another slow reveal that takes away from any excitement felt. The monster looks like the person that designed it had 5 minutes to do it in.<br/><br/>All in all, i have never seen until I saw this movie, an audience (of roughly 300 people) get up and boo. And leaving the theater seeing the faces of the 300 people coming out of the other auditorium seemed about the same as ours. If this movie was any worse I would expect a riot.<br/><br/>So take this for what you will, but when 590 out of 600 people HATE (and i don't mean dislike) a movie, you've been warned. It wasn't bad enough to be good. The surprises weren't surprising, the humor wasn't funny enough to be funny, the scary parts weren't all that scary, the thrills were ruined by slow reveals, the only slightly redeeming thing about this was the last 3 seconds when an unexplained event hints at where the monster may have come from. But at that point i didn't care. It was after seeing the movie and looking at the hype, that if I had looked at the fake Japanese company made for a film website, but not actually mentioned in the film, I'd have known that it was a satellite falling into the ocean."
"KatamarisWrath","8","2","2","25 April 2020"," An Interesting and very intense ride for those who want scares and action!
","I didn't watch Cloverfield til recently and I honestly had no idea the entire movie was shot in first person. Let alone, the entire movie is filmed from the perspective of a camcorder! This was really interesting to me, though the first bit of the movie is a very slow burner that takes forever to really build up the intensity. But once Cloverfield starts, oh man it doesn't let go at all. A group of friends are celebrating a birthday for a guy named Rob because he received a new job in Japan. You're introduced to main characters TJ, Lizzy and Jessica during this introduction. However, during the birthday things go sour as his ex-girlfriend Beth brings over a new Romantic partner and it really puts him in a bad mood. But a massive tremor then rumbles over Manhattan and the start of the madness begins from there. Famous landmarks like The Statue of Liberty are destroyed instantly and skyscrapers fall crazy. Eventually, we learn that these are Monsters destroying Manhattan like its nothing. But anyway, Cloverfield's shakey camera perspective is incredibly well done. It keeps the frenetic pace of the movie going and you really feel like you're acting taking part in the film. The running scenes are incredibly intense and once the scares pick up. It doesn't stop at all. Especially when you see some of the famous NYC landmarks crumble and fall by you. If you want a movie that blends incredible Godzilla like intensity from a different perspective with some slick horror moments. Cloverfield is a movie you gotta see. Do not sleep on this movie at all."

","This is a superb monster movie. It's scary, mysterious, menacing and looks amazing. The fact it's all filmed in a video camera style is not going to be to everyone's taste but I think it adds an extra edge to the movie and makes it a more authentic experience. Whilst the characters aren't totally interesting, and a little stereo typical you feel their terror and desperation to get to friends and to safety. I love how the creature was kept a secret before release, how it teases your imagination for its existence and is completely forced upon them out of the blue. The creature itself gets screen time progresively, leaving an air of mystery but you get more than a glimpse. There are some memorable moments in this movie and its one of my favourites to rewatch."

","Cloverfield, while not perfect, is a clever film. It starts with a boring and seemingly overlong party. So when finally something is happening, you will sit straight. Another strong point is that the horror happens too fast for the people of NewYork. For the cinemaviewers too. That, and the uncontrolled camera movements, works very well. What I kept in memory mostly is Lizzy Caplan sitting in that subway tunnel. Huge eyes. I never saw an actress express SHOCK so convincingly. <br/><br/>Complaints all around that the 'villain' is hardly in view, or not clear enough. But that is how it would be had it been a real disaster. At such moments no one is able to keep a camera still and be concerned with focus. 9/11 is sort of an example: the shots in the streets very close to the towers and inside the lobbies; shaky, chaotic, moments of overexposure from daylight and lowering of the recorder so only the ground is filmed. And these filmers were profs with professional camera's.<br/><br/>Cloverfield works far better than the rather aimless Blair Witch Project. I found the ending a bit too abrupt, and realized only later that the 1h 25m film really SPEEDS by."
"msbreviews","8","2","2","24 February 2018"," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, follow my blog :)<br/><br/>A surprise going-away party between friends is interrupted when a monster of massive dimensions starts to destroy New York City. They need to leave the city before a heavy weapon is unleashed on it and rescue as many of them as they can.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams is one of the best producers in movie/television history, so a film with him and with the direction of Matt Reeves is definitely worth taking a peek.<br/><br/>I don't recall watching a found footage movie ever, so when I first saw Cloverfield I was not that excited. However, I really enjoyed the film the first time and now that The Cloverfield Paradox came out, I wanted to review the previous two installments of the franchise, so here we are again.<br/><br/>I read that a lot of people felt nauseated during this movie due to the shaky-cam that is used throughout the entire runtime, but I didn't feel that at all. In fact, even though I have no experience in watching films with this type of filming, I actually think this is a great directing achievement by Matt Reeves. He does an excellent job handling the camera like this, I rarely felt lost in space or didn't realize what was happening. I always know where everyone is compared to the others and sometimes this is difficult to achieve even with a steady-cam.<br/><br/>Additionally, it helps to hide the ""ok"" visuals effects which are not that great, even having in mind the year of the movie's release. Quality-wise, Reeves also implements some cool long takes which can battle the obvious issues that arise from a found footage film. The editing has its ups and downs since it is obvious that some scenes are too dark or too shaky to follow seamlessly. Plus, the movie repeats itself by having a lot of running with the camera looking down to the ground or way up to the sky/buildings.<br/><br/>Some jump scares can't escape the cliche build-up which does not exactly help to improve the horror genre present in the film. The first act might drag a little too much in order to introduce the characters and their backstories. Besides, the setups for each character are really brief and this might not give you enough time to care about them. Nevertheless, I think I am one of the few people out there to actually love this movie!<br/><br/>Yes, it has flaws. Yes, the characters are not amazingly compelling or extremely well-developed. But, by God, this film is awesome! The story is incredibly intriguing and the fact that it only runs for 84 minutes, just makes it even better. This is not a movie about a character's journey or an emotional drama with a meaningful message to deliver. It is a pure science fiction monster flick with a really cool action-heavy story and a freaking badass monster.<br/><br/>It is a bit hard to distinguish good performances from the bad ones through a shaky-cam. That said, I think everyone is more than fine and Michael Stahl-David (Rob) excellently leads this film. Lizzy Caplan (Marlena) and T.J. Miller (Hud) also deliver some good displays. The characters they portray might not be unique or fully-developed, but they are introduced to us on a very personal level. Even though it is a very short first act, it does more than enough for me to at least care about their mission to rescue their friends.<br/><br/>From the moment the ""event"" occurs, I did not stop having fun, not for one minute. The build-up to the first appearance of the Cloverfield monster is brilliantly executed, every scene with a small flash of a part of its body is bone-chilling and this mystery vibe never fades away. There is never a dull moment and everything feels uncommonly realistic (the sense of urgency and danger is always present), the cinematography is pretty decent.<br/><br/>Every act is better than its last, as the palpable action and the extreme suspense levels go higher and higher towards its fantastic ending (one that gives rise to well-deserved sequels). A lot of theories regarding the monster's origin have been developed and that is due to the last scene of the movie. After my rating, I will explain what happens since it might be a spoiler for the next films.<br/><br/>All in all, Cloverfield is freaking amazing. I might be one of the few people truly loving it, but the issues with the shaky-cam or with the characters didn't affect me as much as it did with others. Excellent direction from Matt Reeves, very entertaining screenplay from Drew Goddard and fantastic production of J.J. Abrams, who clearly has a heavy hand on this. The cast works fine for the plot which is the reason why this movie is a success. A science fiction monster film at its best, with suspenseful action and a tremendous sense of urgency. It has a more than satisfactory control of the shaky-cam and a mysterious ending that deserves some exceptional sequels.<br/><br/>Rating: A-<br/><br/>****************** SPOILER WARNING ******************
In the very last scene, we see Rob and Beth (Odette Annable) near the beach. We can see the sand and the whole ocean with a beautiful wide shot. Knowing J.J. Abrams, this couldn't be just a random ending to a sci-fi movie. It is extremely easy to miss, but if you pay close attention to the upper right corner of the screen, you will see something falling from the sky into the water.<br/><br/>Some say it was the monster arriving at the planet. Some think it was something like a satellite or a meteor and that it had awakened the monster living at the bottom of the ocean (during the film, Hud actually says something regarding the monster's origin being the deep ocean and that he had crawled up through an opening ... Once again, knowing J.J. Abrams, this is a hint not just random funny dialogue).<br/><br/>Which one do I think it is true? Well, I am strongly in favor of the satellite theory, but I will explain myself better in my next review of 10 Cloverfield Lane."

"zkonedog","9","2","2","10 March 2017"," An American Godzilla Take (Also Featuring Character Depth)
","While on vacation in Japan, film producer J.J. Abrams was startled to still see Godzilla merchandise in stores. After decades in the public eye, that monster still had a hold on the national culture. With that experience in mind, Abrams set out to have his production company--Bad Robot--create a similar tale. It succeeds wildly, not only taking viewers on a rip-roaring disaster-epic adventure, but also buffering it with enough human interest moments to make it all hang together.<br/><br/>For a very basic overview, ""Cloverfield"" begins with a bunch of young New Yorkers throwing a going-away party for one of their own. From their high-rise, however, they witness a terrifying creature wreaking havoc on Manhattan Island. As the film's tag line says: Some thing has found us. When one of them becomes trapped and needs assistance, the film turns into a quest to retrieve her, all the while documenting the attack in a found-footage, handheld camera method of filming.<br/><br/>There is very little ""setup"" to this movie, which is by design. Director Matt Reeves simply throws viewers into the fracas, which truly makes the experience seem visceral in a lot of ways that other films fail. You will feel as if you are right there with the main characters as they try to navigate the crumbled streets of NYC, every once in awhile getting a glimpse of the hideous, mysterious beast. The filmmakers here very much follow the ""Jaws"" rule of only showing glimpses of the creature in the early goings, building upon the suspense with further looks as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>But ""Cloverfield"" isn't just a mindless disaster epic either. Thanks to the documentarian style of filming and the acting, the characters feel like real people (absolutely necessary for the style of the experience). This is a party that you could be at, with people you could very well know. In order to provide even further depth, the ingeniously simple plot device of showing small flashback clips on the videocamera gives all the motivation necessary to hang with the unfolding events as they happen. Multiple references to terrorism themes also center the film in a post-9/11 world.<br/><br/>For many, ""Cloverfield"" seems to be a rather polarizing flick. Some don't like the shaky-cam style, while others don't feel it transcends a monster movie destruction epic. For me, though, in terms of pure science fiction (mixed with human drama), I consider this to be one of my favorite little films of all-time. There's never a dull moment (it has less than a 90 minute runtime to begin with) and one just gets the feeling that the entire project was a labor of love and care. While technically a ""studio film"" in the sense that it was distributed by Paramount, it was made for a thrifty $25 million and has a very ""indie"" feel to it."
"drprostuntsgames","5","2","2","28 December 2015"," Could have been MUCH better with just a LITTLE more work.
","There are many good things about this movie. The story is compelling, a giant monster attacking Manhattan, it is introduced with a huge explosion in the middle of New York, as Jeff Wayne would put it, ""This was no disciplined march it was a stampede without order and without a goal, two million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving headlong."" ~Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of the War of the Worlds Which in of itself is a very good way to describe this movie. The only real issue is, the camera man. Oh my good god almighty, it was like he had the camera attached to a rope and was twirling it in the air the entire time. That's the only issue with this movie and it really just kills the mood of the movie. You can hardly ever see anything! It's ridiculous. I liked the idea of having a camera man with a recorder only in this sort of situation, but my god man, this is awful! And this alone really ruined the whole mood of the movie for me. The acting had it's moments and the monster was seen attacking the camera man at one point and the camera man died. (Thank god). The movie ends with a bombing run to kill the monster and a bridge that the remaining main characters are hiding under caves in. Then the film cuts to a ferris wheel scene before the attack and that's the movie. No resolution, nothing. If the camera was more stable through the movie, and the movie didn't end with a cliff hanger, I would have gave this movie an 8 of 10, but no. I can't bring myself to do that here. I'm just giving it a 5 because they killed the camera man."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","2","22 October 2015"," Fails To Live Up To Its Hype!
","Taking the concept of a monster film & applying it in the found footage subgenre of horror, Cloverfield is considered by many to be amongst the better examples of modern horror yet the story it packs in is quite generic, the characters inhabiting its world aren't worthy of any emotional investment and much of the movie is redeemed by its frenetic camera-work, smart editing & chaotic ambiance.<br/><br/>Set in New York City, Cloverfield follows a group of friends who are throwing a going-away party for one of theirs before the entire city is shaken by an apparent earthquake. Going out to investigate, they find that the situation is far worse than imagined for Manhattan is being razed to the ground by a gigantic monster. The plot then covers their peril as they attempt to get out of the city but first have to rescue a close friend who's trapped in her building.<br/><br/>Directed by Matt Reeves, Cloverfield opens on a calm note but once the monster surfaces in the town, a frenzied energy takes over the screen and Reeves does well in retaining the intensity from that point onwards. Written by Drew Goddard, the plot outline & how all of it is supposed to unfold is taken care of quite well but the characters aren't interesting at all and one of them easily manages to get on the nerves for he was incapable of shutting up.<br/><br/>The hand-held camera-work is finely carried out, the warm colour palette fits the narrative, its 85 minutes of runtime flies by once the main plot surfaces, VFX is kept to its minimum for we don't see the monster in its entirety but only in bits n pieces and also notable is the fact that the filmmakers chose to not explain the monster's origin & other stuffs, thus giving its viewers something to ponder about once it all finishes while the performances from its cast is mediocre at best.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Cloverfield definitely has a few interesting things going on which work out in its favour but for the most part, it remains an underwhelming experience that fails to replicate the excitement its earlier hype generated. Stylishly directed, making effective use of shaky cam & brimming with 9/11 references but also marred by poor characterisation, some terrible lines & a highly annoying input from the guy holding the camera, Cloverfield isn't as special as many have called it to be but it nonetheless makes up for an entertaining ride."

I remember seeing the ads for this movie, but never got to the theater & kind of forgot about it. Until I saw it on TV. It started out good. Except for the guy that was holding the camera (Hudson but they called him Hud). He wasn't very likable. And he ended up surviving almost the entire movie. It's weird because these people had the best luck and the worst luck at the same time. First, they went through A LOT & all should have probably died 5 times before they actually did. That was their good luck. Their bad luck was that they just couldn't get away from this monster. I know they headed right into the hot zone trying to save that girl (I can only remember her last name for some reason.) I know the creature was big but so is New York. I guarantee you that others got away. When they left the party and on their way to the girls apartment building, I understood that part as they were in the city. But it was driving me crazy when they were in the helicopter. For one thing, it hardly looked like they were moving at all. Then they go the same direction as the creature and fly over it! Was it REALLY that surprising when the creature hit the helicopter? They survived the crash (luck) and then Hud looks up and Shazam!! The creature just happened to be right there. (Bad Luck) I know they were hurt, but why did they stop running? These people went through hell and back, lost friends and family members, got attacked by small & large creatures, & survived a helicopter crash and they couldn't let them live?

As hard as it tries to be realistic, there's moments, for example, the lead 4 characters are heading on foot through a subway tunnel, and they are joking? given that they've experience something on a similar scale to the 911 attack, all be it with monsters, I doubt anyone one would be joking, fleeing for their lives.<br/><br/>If the stuff in the film was happening for real, would anyone really hang onto their video camera, and focus their attention on documenting what was going on? <br/><br/>Towards the end events take a turn for the ridiculous. The lead 3 characters (1 dropped out) want to enter their apartment. The apartment is located in a tall building which is on the brink of collapse.

We never really see what comes out of her, is it just another spider-monster or is it some other creature that is incubated in the human victims?

What is the worst about the movie is that the shakes of the camera. It moved so much that I could not focused on the movie.

I'm not a monster-movie person .this film isn't perfect, the obvious flaws are the pretty boring, elongated beginning of the movie. The first 20 minutes to me are unbearable, and one reason I love being able to watch the film at home, is that skipping the first 17/18 minutes is a trivial thing to do and very little of the feel of the film is lost. The movie is, fortunately, short; only 90 mins or so long. 20 mins of that is spent at a party you would leave after 10 minutes if you hadn't paid to get in--a going away party for some loser that looks like a guy from your company's mail room.<br/><br/>Apparently this loser has been promoted (improbably) to be a VP for his company in Japan. finally at the end of the movie there were a couple minutes of cool special effects. the rest of the movie was a waste of time."

","ALL of this review is spoilers..... I saw this in the TV listings with 3 stars so thought it must be worth watching. What a mistake. There is 20 minutes of tedium at the start that makes you wonder if you are watching the right movie. Twenty minutes of talking about, setting up, going to the going away party for some guy who's just been promoted to VP of some Japanese company. We don't, and never will, have any idea of what he does and there is nothing about his demeanor or personality that suggests he's VP material. He and his friends appear to be only one step removed from their frat house vibe/bar every night vibe. Then the ""monster"" appears, sort of. It's never clear where the monster comes from or why, not that it matters to this film. The rest of the film is people doing stupid things like all rushing to the Brooklyn bridge, presumably so they can all be smashed together in one place unable to escape. Apparently the idea that it's better to stay spread out never occurs to anyone. Certainly one wonders why, after the monster has already smashed his way thru your area without killing you, you would then want to go to some other area and give him another chance to stomp you. And of course our ""hero's"" have to go into the subway - again, why stay where you can run when you can pre-trap yourself. Then, out of nowhere, little baby monsters show up to attack them in the tunnels. The connection between the big monster and the little ones?? not at all clear. Our hero's trudge on to rescue their friend, who the VP belatedly realized he loved now that he's about to leave for the airport and fly to his new VP job overseas. After rescuing her (from her nearly destroyed building that still manages to have electric) they wind up running into the military who are ready to load them onto helicopters. The rest is a silly blur, most likely several of them died, I really didn't care who did or didn't, there was never any connection to any of the characters established. I can't believe so many people liked this movie. I must be out of step. The only thing making it better then plan 9 from Outer Space was that it's in color and the actors/actresses are prettier."

","Said most of this in the summary... <br/><br/>There is a big monster loose in the city. Our protagonists are determined to learn nothing about what is going on, put themselves into harms way, and film their last adventure with a video camera that only points to where the action isn't.<br/><br/>The characters are trying to die, they richly deserve to die, and its only a shame that they don't do it more quickly and make this a film short.<br/><br/>I wish we could at least have had one military character to tell us what is going on, like that general in ""War of the Worlds"" who says, ""guns, bombs, tanks, they're like toys against those things!""

","FFirstly I have a problem with the current vogue for hand held camera shots. They spoiled the Bourne Ultimatum, ruined Hancock and countless other movie simply by making watching the movie a race between hitting the and credits and having to charge to the toilet to throw up because of motion sickness. The prospect of watching a movie shot entirely on hand held camera didn't fill me with joy.<br/><br/>I decided to wait until the DVD cam out. The wobbly cam nightmare is minimised and I stand a greater chance of finishing the movie and not becoming reacquainted with my lunch.<br/><br/>Sadly it wasn't really worth the wait. It was a fairly standard monster movie whose central conceit, while compelling in theory, fell into so may traps as a result of that conceit it became frustrating. Most annoying was the fundamental flaw that we saw what the characters saw. Now, okay, the immediacy was a fine idea, but as is usual, for most of the movie, Hud was simply looking in the wrong direction, swinging round to just miss something that had already passed; focusing on the relationships between a group of largely unlikeable people.<br/><br/>We got mayhem, we got destruction, (believable and well executed), we got a bunch of people I had little empathy for and all the while Monsters were eating Manhattan. I know what I wanted to be watching!<br/><br/>The only time this approach had any impact was during the death of the principal cameraman. That was genuinely shocking and unpleasant, neatly counterpointed by the auto-focus being unsure what to focus on. Yay Pathos.<br/><br/>Having said that, I just wasn't convinced by the Monster. Design-wise, it was pretty nondescript. The 'polyps' or 'barnacles' or whatever they were were just too unwieldy; too crablike. If they were originally undersea creatures, they looked as if their weight and shape was simply unsupportable in an air atmosphere. <br/><br/>I think the thing that annoys me most is that somewhere in here there was a germ of a good movie, but style and conceit took the place of a solid story and believable characters.<br/><br/>Shame.<br/><br/>If you want a decent 'Monsters attack a Town' type movie, with better design, more rounded characters and the bleakest ending imaginable, give the much overlooked 'The Mist' a look as it is everything that Cloverfield should have been and aspired to be.<br/><br/>And I hear there's going to be a sequel. Oh dear."

","This pathetic excuse for entertainment is, first and foremost, just plain nauseating to sit through. The movie is filmed entirely from a hand-held video camera, and serves to offer up a 9/11-wannabe-apocalyptic-nightmere, in which the audience is forced to watch a group of hip young adults (led by the unimpressive Michael Stahl-David) get killed off one by one. In addition to the nausea factor, the premise of the film is incredibly contradictory: a ""realistic"" portrait of New York City being attacked by a giant sea monster. Thirdly, its cheap avoidance of exposition -mantra throughout""We have no idea what's going on!""can and will get quite bothersome. Of course, one could throw most of these criticisms out the window by saying that it doesn't matter where the monster came from, or why it invades the city, or why the movie is even called ""Cloverfield"" to begin with (all questions that are never addressed). The heart of the story lies in the individual, personal tales of the main characters: their private lives and relationships are at the center of the movie. Alas, this key serves only to open a Pandora's box of even more serious faults. Quite simply, the characters that the producer-writer-director team of J.J. Abrams, Drew Goddard and Matt Reeves, respectively, offer up are so cliché as to make even the monster's spider-like spawn cringe. The men all look and talk exactly the same (everyone's a ""bro"" at their party), as do the women. Everyone is hip (not to mention affluent), partying it up in, wouldn't you know it, the West Village. Everyone is attractive (in the conventional sense of beauty, at least); quite simply, there are no ugly people in this movie. In addition, the movie feeds off of the plethora of brave-but-stupid personalities that have all but taken over the roles of protagonists in mainstream entertainment today: Rob Hawkins (Mr. Stahl-David) could evacuate the city like everyone else, but he just can't leave without making sure that his affair (the remarkably gorgeous Odette Yustman) is brought down to safety from her multimillion-dollar apartment in the Time Warner building first. Although this decision proves to be fatal for both him and his friends (including his brother, played by Mike Vogel), at least he gets to die with his current love interestright? Mark my words: you have been warned; however, some advice for the brave-but-stupid; the especially curious: don't try consuming food while watching this movie (it's only 75 minutes long: you can wait)."

","We heard about Cloverfield for what seemed like forever, yet the final product was only an hour and thirteen minutes. When that consists of one of the films good points, there is a problem.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is the story of a monster attack shown from the point of view of a solitary and constantly bobbing video cam recovered by the military at some point later in time.<br/><br/>The movie begins in Manhattan with the groundwork being laid for a surprise going away party for the film's human star, Rob Hawkins (Michael-Stahl David) as he sets off for a job Japan. It is here that Cloverfield already begins its descent as the film attempts to flesh out the dim-witted, vapid, cast of twenty somethings that as so often is the case in horror films, have you rooting for the evil doer.<br/><br/>By the time the monster begins his assault on Manhattan, so much time has passed already, you'll wonder if there is any left for a monster even the size of a skyscraper to do enough damage to be noticed before the film ends? Fortunately, there is as the monster gets right to work eating people, destroying buildings and decapitating the Statue of Liberty, all caught now and then in shadowy and bumpy glimpses by the movies true antagonist, the operator of the hand held camera.<br/><br/>(It should be noted that 'Cloverfield' was a clear attempt at allegory for the 9/11 attacks, as several scenes are seemingly duplicated move by move from the images from that horrible day.) As the monster plays hide and seek behind buildings, evading a hapless looking army of soldiers in the streets carrying rocket launchers, it turns out the mystery invader has a surprise. Scores of tiny arachnid-like creatures are falling off the body of the larger, attacking people in places not easily reached by the monolithic marauder. We learn, barely, that the smaller creature bites cause a delayed, yet gruesome result for their victims.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for us, instead of using this to further drive home point how dire the circumstances are, more time is spent attempting to make us care for the remaining contingent of yuppies by using goofy quips and emotion expressed with marshmallow lightness. It is at this stage of the film, with an incredible fifteen minutes remaining that you'll realize you have yet to see the monster in full! The final fifteen minutes offer perhaps where the movie might have been better served beginning. A military helicopter escape over downtown Manhattan gives us the first look at our creature- a mix of mammal, insect and fish with subtle humanoid features- tearing his way through real estate as it is bombarded by a heavy duty air assault. The monster is frightening and original, leaving you to wonder why something so fresh was kept a secret all this time? After the inevitable failure of the strike, the helicopter is swatted down and crashes in Central Park. Amazingly, the camera has not fallen victim either to impact or the many muggers reputed to lurk within the park. Even more amazing is that out of the all the personnel on board, the three surviving are Rob, his love interest, Beth and the cameraman, Hud.<br/><br/>In the closing moments, Hud is killed by the monster, who had snuck up on him (yes, SNUCK UP on him). Rob and Beth make it safely inside the underpass of a park bridge, but sirens in the distance indicate that the military has reached their final option, to level NYC with nuclear weapons in hopes of destroying the previously indestructible creature and his band of ill-tempered associates.<br/><br/>The very fact that the camera was found to document In the final analysis, it's obvious the makers of 'Cloverfield' felt the film would be more believable if it was shot from the frenzied POV of an average Joe in the street. While the chaos and futility of the situation was captured to a reasonable degree, credibility should not have been the main issue here as the first rule of any monster movie is the monster is the star. In the end, we barely knew what he looked like, let alone what his origin or purpose was. While that may seem scarier to some, it seems lazy to me, especially when that time is allotted to a cast of already forgotten and never will bes.<br/><br/>Perhaps in the sequel, one of the smaller creatures can follow the larger around with a cam. That way, it's guaranteed a little more screen time."

","-Contains Spoilers - Not that it matters. During the first 10 minutes of the movie, the song ""Suicidal"" was being played in a party scene. That song reflected my sentiments exactly. Five minutes into the movie and I was wishing all the characters would just die. I walked out several times just to clear my head but was always drawn back, kind of like onlookers at the scene of a hideous accident. What didn't I like about the movie. First of all, the main characters were unlikeable. They were self-centered and obnoxious, as well as vomit inducing. In particular, the one with the camera. I was so relieved when the monster ate him. Unfortunately, the monster spit him out. Even he couldn't stomach the actor. The logic of the movie was also idiotic. In one scene, at the military command center, someone says that two F-18 will be there in 30-minutes. Two F-18s in 30 minutes? Are you kidding me? what are they, delivering pizzas. Don't waste your money. If you really have to see it, at least wait until it hits the $1.00 DVD bin at Circuit City - sometime next month. This piece of crap was totally unsatisfying on an emotional level as well as pretentious. Like many others, I started to fill physically ill watching this movie. In fact, I closed my eyes during the first 20-minutes of the movie. It was either due to the vomit inducing script or the equally vomit-inducing erratic motion of the camera.

"alisoncolegrooveq","2","21","44","18 January 2008"," Beverly Hills 902 9:11 meets Godzilla Crab Witch, via a pointless Lost plot
","Most of the audience in the screening I attended with my wife (we're both ardent horror and sci-fi film fans) giggled (i was too stunned by how bad it was to laugh) whilst the 19yr (ish) kid 3 seats down kept gasping 'oh my god' sitting on the edge of his seat.<br/><br/>I pity that kid and how easily entertained his generation is by smoke and mirrors that only lead to yet more smoke and mirrors (incidentally, like Shaymalan before him, producer JJ Abrams seems stuck using this tedious trick) Cloverfield spectacularly fails its very own premise : a monster movie shot in a faux documentary style(and you would have to be pretty willfully stupid to not see how obviously it feeds on 9/11 fear using incredibly similar angles as the TV footage we all saw that day).<br/><br/>Here's the problem - to be real, you must commit. But we are presented with a cast of one dimensional cyborg 'beautiful young things' who are all impossibly perfect and all just so 'cool' hanging out together like they've all just stepped out of a alcohol ad. Their dialog feels empty, trite and fake and directly at odds with the direction of the film. OK so this is real? Why are these people just like the bad actors we see in so many other movies? We care about people with imperfections, we immediately want to see clichés like this die as soon as possible. (something Starship Troopers understood perfectly). Yes real life is mundane, but its not nearly THIS mundane or plastic.<br/><br/>We are fairly successfully teased by snatches of the monster when it arrives, but why it seems to be selectively picking on certain bridges and buildings, much less why it seems to confine itself all night and in the relatively small area of Manhattan seems not so much a mystery but just an embarrassing void of sense we're not meant to notice because of the unfolding 'terror'. Sadly the film is riddled with silliness that just sucks the air out of any potential for true terror or fear. Electricity seems to magically continue working where it shouldn't, digital cameras are now stronger than the tanks being squashed...the 'realistic' camera shaking neatly settles down for the corny 'hero saves girl' scene in the toppling building 'set'. The monster, despite the fact we can clearly now see it's scale and position, seems able to reach much higher into the sky to knock a helicopter down.<br/><br/>OK so you think that's just me being picky? Here's a reminder..remember we're being presented this as a 'hyperreal' account, thats the extra big SCARE right? How can you hope to do that when you are trapped by Hollywood contrivance and cheese...the answer is you cant.<br/><br/>In some ways the film is bold, there is no music. But even here there are problems...we get Hollywood style sound design and effects. So again, it's raw but utterly pretentious.<br/><br/>Some of the CGI is quite skillful, some looks downright phony. But in the end, unless you are easily amused (and many are) you feel the film is a conceit that just didn't work. You feel cheated the way many Lost fans (and before this i had NO opinion on the projects of Abrams) seemed to when the box within a box trick just became boring.<br/><br/>There is some suspense created in the tunnel scenes (which felt uncomfortably loaned from some other film) but overall this is neither a scary or effective film.<br/><br/>Since reading some of the reviews here though, i have realised the film's true capacity for terror : you can actually fool a lot of the people a lot of the time with the most paper thin ideas by simply remixing genres and techniques. When the smoke and mirrors clear up, we are not left with a classic of any genre, just a blancmange of cheap tricks we've seen before in different and more effective incarnations.<br/><br/>There's nothing in the box, just more boxes."

","Sometimes the idea of a movie can transform the experience of watching it, and sometimes only on remembering it. The challenge is to have ideas that are not only clever and appear so, but which actually make good, effective films that matter.<br/><br/>I went into this thinking that it would be an evolution of ""Transformers."" That film worked for me, and worked in ways that were beyond anything I had seen. Sure the story was dumb and the very idea of the robots was childish. But the way the film was put together was a bit astonishing. In old movies, if there was a monster destroying a building, well then you saw the building being destroyed as if you were a placid god in the sky somewhere. With Transformers, you never really saw things this way. You saw them as if you were an observer threatened by and involved in the action. You were running, avoiding, occasionally glancing and sometimes accidentally seeing part of what was happening. <br/><br/>It was new, marvelous. But we always knew the cameras were not associated with humans, at least not the ones on screen. The idea was to trick us into adopting the disembodied cameras we always accepted and allowed us, the audience to be threatened, to be there.<br/><br/>Now this. Some of the effects are the same. At least in the beginning of the disaster, we only partially see what is happening. And there are many times when the camera is unsteady. But I got the impression that although the camera was handled by a panicked character, we always saw more than he would have. The camera was always where we would have wanted it, arranged to increase the dramatic effect.<br/><br/>Transformers was silly and we could assault it. Cloverfield was supposedly real and it assaulted us. That makes the deliberation of camera a whole different thing. Its control is external to what's happening. We do realize this without thinking about it, and it diffuses the terror and changes it to spectacle. This folding technique only works when you have the commitment of the audience. They thought they would get it with the teen soap opera at the beginning. Didn't work for me.<br/><br/>It would have worked better if she hadn't ASKED to be rescued.<br/><br/>Nice bridge though.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

After getting away the enter into a Macys were the army takes to a Macy part which has been turned into a hospital. The guy who is leaving tries to get them to help him get to the girlfriend. They wont. Then the girl who was bitten begins to get dizzy. The blood starts coming out of her eyes and stuff. Not sure but i think she explodes. The army lets the three go find the guy who is leaving girlfriend. They make it to the building were she is. But the building has fallen over to the side of another building. They decided to go up threw the second building which is standing. The climb and rescue the girl. They take a pull out of her. They then run the army. Were they get helicopters. One friend is taken away. I don't know which female was taken away, The large creature is bombed by the army. But doesn't die. It jumps and knocks the helicopter down. Now just to add the large creature can bread off it self and little creators from from it. A couple hours pass. and the get out of the crash site. But the guy with camera is eating by the large creature. His friends take the camera. The run in central park.

","If I gave my 12-year old nephew four quaaludes and handed him a camera, he could do better than this.<br/><br/>Plot: A number of the most low-IQ, shallow, uninteresting characters in the history of fictional constructs have a video camera when ooooh, a monster, descends on the city. And what a monster, a really silly CG thing that would have, on its own, made me laugh, had I not been already angry plotting the destruction of every person responsible for this load of doo-doo. Nor, since we hate the characters so much can we possibly care what the monster does.<br/><br/>The movie-maker said in a DVD interview that when something goes wrong in real life, as in if a real monster attacked, that this is the sort of record there would be of it, jerky, limited. This is of course correct. (We know that from raw home video of 9/11) But that's real life. In movies or fiction, we want a plot, coherence, a through-story, and heroes who are heroic and occasionally say a full grammatical sentence with actual content. We want filmmakers to buy a tripod and hire actual actors, write a script, y'know, little things like that. We don't want to pay actual real money to see a simulacrum of what panicked people who don't know how to even hold a camera might do. We actually expect professionals to make a movie, that's what the industry is about, and if this is the future of it, I'll stick to reading books, thank you very much.<br/><br/>What movie the people who rated this highly saw, I cannot tell you. That I cannot rate it in negative numbers frustrates me."

","Really looking forward to watching this film. However, around half-way through I was watching the clock on the DVD player, as I couldn't wait for it to finish. I expected at least a few shocks, or scary bits, but no, nothing. The monster was about as scary as my Persian cat, and they're were no jumps at all. All it was was a lot of shouting. As soon as it was finished, it was straight on a well-known auction site, for some other gullible person to suffer. The hand-held camera aspect didn't bother me, but it wasn't as good as the often compared Blair Witch. Save your money and buy something really frightening instead of this bore."
"vader_001","1","9","16","27 January 2008"," This movie is terrible!
","This is one of THE worst movies I have ever seen. 15 minutes before the end of the film everyone got up and left. The people that stayed, including me, notified on how terrible the ending was and how the whole plot of the film was so stupid! Avoid at ALL costs! Around the ending the main characters are in a helicopter escaping Manhatten, the U.S Army bomb the monster, which disappears for a while and suddenly jumps up and grabs the helicopter, which the monster just somehow knew they were there, and pulls them to the ground, resulting in a crash landing. For some reason only the pilots are killed, but the main characters come out unscathed! Anyway the monsters finds them and eats the cameraman, who has filmed most of the film. The last two main characters hide under a nearby bridge in central park say there final goodbyes, saying stuff about whoever will find this tape and yadayadayada. Just before the bombs fall, the characters tell they love each other, then the bombs explode and rocks fall on the camera, and then is darkness. It then goes and shows a previous bit of footage from a holiday beforehand, then the film finishes. But what I don't get is, no matter what happened to them the camera always survived and somehow survived the blast that killed the monster. Truly terrible!"
"adrongardner","3","15","30","21 January 2008"," Wow. That one sucked.
","Yeah it has been awhile since we've had a good monster movie. Going into this one, I wanted to be free of spoilers, early reviews, or theories on the marketing campaign. So I went in with some general interest and hope. I'm even a bona-fide JJ Abrahms fan, I love LOST, nonsense conspiracies and all. Well, with this in mind, I saw Cloverfield. And I'm quite certain, the movie was absolute trash. Here's why.<br/><br/>Did I get scared? Nope. Not once. Not from the slim glimpses of the monster. Not from the little Starship Troopers creatures. Not from any of the sounds.<br/><br/>Did I laugh? YES. There are some good one liners from our humble camera man.<br/><br/>The shocks were few and weak. The part when the girl who was bit eventually spattered was good, but muted and did little to liven any tension. I just never felt any excitement or adrenaline. <br/><br/>Was the movie well made? No. The monster was generic looking and I think the word Generic fits most of the descriptions of the film itself. Its all just ""meh."" Nothing more.<br/><br/>The story was lame. Basically from what I remember, they cooked up some saved by the bell love story about some twenty-something trapped in a mega buck high-rise apartment overlooking central park. Who cares about these rich kids and their little parties? I'm sorry, but in a city like New York, there are a billion more harrowing stories to tell than a bunch of 90210 kids and their love triangle dramas.<br/><br/>OK on this hand-held camcorder business, I'm going on record on writing how stupid it is. I don't think you can effectively tell a feature length story visually or otherwise with the frame bouncing around like crazy for most of the time. This just doesn't work. Instead of creating anticipation or mystery, all I do is get mad from motion sickness and the fact I have nothing to focus on as an audience member. There is no thread for me to latch on to. This is simple and it is by design, I understand that. The other side of this is the filmmakers are, in fact, providing little for the audience in the first place. Its a very cheap way to make a film, which this film clearly was.<br/><br/>There just isn't much here to watch folks, both literally or figuratively. The 1 hour 20 minute or so running time is a good reflection of this though the movie felt like it was a 3 hour marathon of nonsense. I've never been a group mentality person, but it says something when the majority audience in the theater screams, ""SUCKED!"" when the credits hit. <br/><br/>Cloverfield is a movie that should have stayed true to its roots on how it was made and gone direct to video. My advice to the writers? Kill off all the kids early, let the aliens film the rest. This one was a dud. And seeing the splash in the ocean at the end, I'm sure there will be sequels on the way. Perhaps the end is near, after all. God have mercy on us all."
"Coventry","3","17","35","9 March 2008"," It Came From ... Who knows, who cares?
","Okay, once again it seems as if I missed out on a gigantic hype and once more I do not at all seem to comprehend the huge success of this superficially attractive but eventually bland and substantially void hybrid between an amateur YouTube video and a massively budgeted monster flick. The short trailers and secretive teaser clips didn't miss their effect, as ""Cloverfield"" quickly became one of the most anticipated movies ever, but does the finished product really live up to the beforehand promoted hype? That's a big fat ""NO"", in my humble opinion, because all I saw was an overlong (at barely 85 minutes, can you imagine), preposterous and pretentious blockbuster with very few redeeming qualities. This isn't a monster movie at all. Admittedly I might be a bit biased because I swear by the monster flicks and alien invasion movies from the fifties and early sixties, but at least they were charming and spectacular in a non-exploitative fashion. For the action and mayhem in their film ""Cloverfield"", Matt Reeves and Drew Goddard obviously cash in on the fear & paranoia caused by the 9/11 tragedy. People nervously and hectically force their way through collapsing skyscrapers and giant clouds of dust, unaware of what happened exactly, yet they resolutely continue to register their own misery and agony on a digital hand-held camera. That's like shamelessly promoting voyeurism and gratuitously manipulating people's deepest fears. And yet, whenever parts of buildings are falling down for (still) unknown reasons, ""Cloverfield"" is a tremendously boring film! Especially the wraparound story prior to the first big bang is almost intolerable dull and overlong. A bunch of irritating twenty-something people gather in someone's Manhattan apartment for a goodbye party and it seems to go on forever. Nobody cares about their romantic issues and the more they open their mouths, the dumber they appear, anyway. Particularly Hud, the guy operating the camera through tick and thin, makes some of the dumbest remarks I've ever heard. The continuously shaky camera wasn't as bad as everyone said, and at several times it clearly noticeable that professional cinematographers are holding the device instead of one of the players. I understand that, since J.J Abrams pumped quite a lot of budget into fancy digital effects that had to be shown at least a bit properly. The eventual nature of the menace actually raises more questions than it provides answers and logic and its design is not the least bit impressive. Rudimentary the concept of ""Cloverfield"" has a lot in common with the much better Korean monster-highlight ""The Host""; only the latter didn't cause motion sickness to any of its viewers of course. ""The Host"" is just far superior. First and foremost the monster looks more original, the character drawings are more realistic and likable and the production doesn't purely thrive on pretension."
"usmcdevil9811","1","17","35","20 January 2008"," Terrible movie
","The only movie that is worse than Cloverfield is probably Battlefield Earth but this one comes close. I think its pretty sad when people have to take scenes from other movies and put them into their own. Meaning the 'I'm so scared' with snot and tears; thats a bunch of crap. There was also no ending to it...I have no clue if the big thing died or not. It was 82 minutes long(the 24 minutes of trailers was better than the movie itself) witch was unheard of. Honestly, I cannot say a good thing about this movie. All i can after that is JJ Abrams will keep me from going to see Star Trek and any further movies that he produces or directs."
"knightc6","1","17","35","20 January 2008"," take away the hype, and you have little left
","The marketing was so well done that it became a huge part of the film experience and made it enjoyable to many people who showed up on opening night (much like the Blair witch project). But without it, the film was pretty bland, not as original as some of the die hard fans are hyping it up to be. Im not sure why the ""shaky cam"" effect is considered a sign of brilliance and originality these days, when it's been done before and is mainly a tool for cost reduction, but oh well.<br/><br/>Bottom line- if a movie can't stand on it's own merit, then it isn't a very good movie to begin with. Wait for it on DVD if you're curious, otherwise skip it."
"evasmum","5","17","35","20 January 2008"," How could a monster movie be this dull?
","I'm always up for a great Hollywood monster movie - nail biting thrills...great special effects...heroes you can very nearly care for. Well this ain't it. The first 15 minutes is just excruciating as we are forced to 'get to know' a group of pretty awful, self satisfied 'Ys'. 15 minutes of pointless, tedious back story that could have been established in 2 minutes. And if that isn't bad enough we are made to watch it all (nauseously) via a hand-held camera. This is followed by 55 minutes watching these same people...or rather their backs...or mostly their feet shakily run from (apparent) horror to horror. The most amazing thing about this movie was how completely lack lustre and dull it is. A seemingly clever idea...but no better than any run of the mill video game out there with a 'run away from the monster premise'. We were conned by the cleverness of the 'ad'- once again no film could live up to the hype, and certainly not one with characters you really don't care about, doing REALLY stupid things for the flimsiest of reasons."
"vheagle","2","17","35","19 January 2008"," Not as good as the previews
","The preview of the movie made the movie appear to be more than what it offered. It offered no horror, and very little suspense. Its has to be the first hyped up movie that failed in 2008. Camera is shaky (of course because they are running) and makes you feel dizzy at times. The beginning takes to long to get to the point of the movie. It never tells you how the monster got there or what it is. You get to see the monster but its a mad up iguana type monster thats as big as a sky scraper. The ending totally sucks as it gives no closure to the movie. I would have loved to have seen any other movie than this one, it was a total let down. My recommendation, Don't WASTE YOUR TIME."
"coasternut06","2","17","35","18 January 2008"," Another crappy movie....
","Sorry guys, nothing good I can say about this movie. Number one thing that drove me nuts about this movie was the fact that when I go to see a monster movie, I expect to see the monster for more than oh say... 2 minutes. Especially for an unheard of 84 minute film. I work at a movie theater as a projectionist and this movie makes me want to quit my job so I don't have to be near it anymore. I can handle the poor camera quality. I understand that's what they were going for (the ONLY reason this is getting the second star) but the acting I think is what's giving people nausea.<br/><br/>It's just a movie about running, running through the streets of Manhatten with people we know nothing about, absolutely NO closure, and without a question the worst ending i've ever seen on a movie. I agree with a previous review which stated that there is no closure. Bottom line, this movie sucks. Save your gas and stay home."

"dr_brendan","7","17","35","16 January 2008"," Fun for a while, then you might get sick.
","Here's how to make the best advertising campaign ever. All you do, is just show the most exciting and disturbing parts of the film and nothing to do with characters and then put the title at the end and people are like ""SO GOING!""<br/><br/>At least half of the people in the theater found Cloverfield hard to watch because it's all hand-held. At first I was really excited for the film and then one of my friends said ""Oh, so it's like Blair Witch Project meets The Host. (I can assure you that, that's what you're gonna get but with a little something extra) I was also really sick throughout the entire movie. However, it's probably the best survival/horror/science fiction all year but what am I really comparing it to? Hmm? First Sunday?<br/><br/>I was worried about Cloverfield because not only did I see it for free, but it was supposed to come out in January (to film geeks, it's known as dump month.) However, rest assured that the film isn't half bad. The characters are somewhat minimal but there is actually a reason for what they are doing. Most of the stuff seems plausible kinda, and they didn't ""find a scientist"" and he didn't give the ""we don't know what it is!"" or ""Human's played god!"" speech that was found in the other horror/adventure movies of last year. When the characters die, you feel for them somewhat, but, to be honest you didn't get to know them that well. It was kinda like seeing a really cool person on the street and then 10 minuets he gets hit by a car. You're kinda sad cause that character was funny, or pretty, or kinda important. Also, you feel beaten up from all the shaky-cam if you're affected by motion sickness. So when a person dies it's like you're drunk and someone told you that a relative died. You're disappointed but you can't really control your emotions at this point so you're already crying. It's kinda like, the film beats you up, and makes you feel sorry for someone else cause you can kinda sympathize with there pain since you're experiencing something similar to a seizure.<br/><br/>NOW FOR THE IMPORTANT PART: The monster. Cloverfield's monster is interesting and will make your mouth drop to the floor, because it's always changing. It's also surprising. You think you have a full understanding of the monster, and then you see a newscast and it totally changes everything think you thought you knew.<br/><br/>I also like how the movie was also like a metaphor for a love. Hold on to people and never let them go kinda thing. It really made you think. And by the end if you saw it with anyone you'll kinda have a group hug at the end.<br/><br/>Still, like I said before, the characters are minimal because the movie is only an hour and 24 min. Which is a fantastic length, because if your the one half who can't stand shaky-cam you'll be like ""oh wow, that was over soon."" and for the people who aren't affected, they'll like how it got right to the point.<br/><br/>But, because it's so short, you might want your money back if you payed $10. So I heavily recommend a matinée . No one really feels cheated out of $6. Still, an overall fun movie to see with friends if you aren't affected by motion sickness. Also it's a great movie to see Downtown cause when you get out you'll be paranoid for like 20 min cause you don't know if a monster will get you when you're on the way to your car. Overall, I would say, worth seeing if you have a strong stomach, if you don't wait for it on DVD."

Also, they attempted to make it feel like it's shot as a home video (which is very hard to watch without getting motion sickness),but even this fails - what kind of home video has such fabulous lighting?

These scenes send chills down my spine, and will surely evoke traumatic memories in people who has been through disasters. Things happen quickly, and there is hardly the time to breathe. The plot is rather weak, posing a lot of unanswered questions, but it is made up for the pacing and the action.

"KUAlum26","6","14","28","25 May 2008"," The Monster movie,from the margins
","Having read through a sampling of some of the other comments on this site,I gotta say that I'm very struck by the fact that this film doesn't inspire much ""in-betwens"": a fair share of either 8s,9s or 10s or else 2s or 1s on the star rating,and more than a couple of angry,sardonic dismissals paired in with a few positive ""I get it"" type reviews.<br/><br/>I suppose,having to chose between the negative and positive reviews,I'd be counted on the latter,though barely.<br/><br/>At this point,I don't think I'm telling any secrets or revealing anything that isn't already known about this film:producer J.J. Abrams,director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard have constructed a spare,seemingly low-budget concept movie. That this is a creature movie--and what a creature it is,replete with nearly impregnable skin and spouting offspring that's much smaller but nasty and plentiful--seems to be somewhat of a subject experiment. In other words,this is a monster movie,but the monster seems to be of less direct interest than the viewpoint and survival of some of the New Yorkers who are enduring it,in this instance the five-some of friends/family who are coming from a going away party for one of them in mid-town Manhattan. While the five actors Michael David-Stahl,Jessica Lucas,Lizzy Caplan,T.J. Miller and Mike Vogel(searching for a sixth,played by Odette Yustman)seem to show some sparks of interest,humor or emotional depth,their characters have almost no depth and hence,no real reason to care about them. It isn't until the more intimate,scary and tangential moments of the later film does it seem that there's much reason to have any interest into their fates,and by then,it feels like too little and too late.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is by far the concept and,in a grudging sense,the execution of it. The hand-held effect of filming a movie,particularly in a horror/sci-fi sense,is something of an work in audience endurance. Since there is a premium on audience fear,confusion and apprehension in any scary film,the objective of the filmmaker is to make that fear roundly and emotionally real. If one can stomach(Literally and figuratively)the bouncy,disjointed and shaky filming process--which seems fairly credible given the circumstances--then the movie's creators have done a fantastic that said viewer will be impressed. Promotion of this film,as mentioned by others,also is the grand mark or opus of this creation,being able to achieve a sense of audience interest and curiosity WELL before its release,an accomplishment that puts it up there with such cult films(which became equally famous for the public interest burnout that followed the initial swell of turnout)as ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Snakes on a PLane"".<br/><br/>Overall,I'd say this movie is certainly worth a look,though I wouldn't give any grand superlatives for how brilliant or great it is. It's effective,""BOO!""-type sci-fi/action/horror,that revels more in the concept and image than the volume of the product. NO more,no less."

","Now a lot of you may hear about this movie lacking in certain areas such as: bad camera, boring opening, plot holes, lack of monster shots and lack of explanation. With that being said, those aren't the points that the movie was trying to hit. The movie is shot with a first person camera that is very shaky, but I can't imagine someone going through this and holding a camera very steady. The first part of the movie is not intense but sets up the story nicely to let you know why the people do the things they do in the movie. There are things that make you go like wait how did that happen, but you can look at every single movie ever made and pin-point problems like that. The lack of monster shots and explanation ADDS to the effect that the makers are going for in the fact that the movie takes place over a single night and the characters in the movie don't get an explanation either. This isn't a movie that was made to be some dramatic masterpiece with a neatly done opening and wrapping things up nicely with perfect closure.

This movie isn't about that, and making millions of people believe a terror is raging Manhattan through dialogue does take some sort of skill.<br/><br/>If you're reading the review you know the story: a bunch of twenty-somethings are holding a party to see their pal off on his new job in Japan when something straight out of Japanese cinema rudely interrupts their celebration. The scenes before the monster do feel a little forced; the screenwriter's desperation to make his characters more authentic shows in the first twenty minutes of screen time. The actors do their best with the direction and script, but the party almost feels like the homework you need to finish but rush through so you can go watch television.<br/><br/>Yet the first few minutes are pivotal. While slightly one-dimensional (Rob is stubborn, Hud is the comedian, etc.), the interaction of the characters does set the entire movie in motion. Listen to all the conversations closely and you'll be even more impacted by the movie's ending.<br/><br/>And a few booms, crashes, and explosions later, our twenty-somethings are scrambling through the streets of New York, trying to find a way out of the perilous wasteland our monster has created. Most likely you'll be frustrated by the characters' inability to have common sense in an emergency--the most cliché part about the film.<br/><br/>However, the cinematic experience entirely compensates for the stupidity of the characters. You will the notice the difference between a true Hollywood film and JJ Abrams' creations. Something...gets you about seeing CGI characters on homemade, crappy quality, REALISTIC footage. The moving camera did make some people nauseous, but for me the cameraman should have been nominated for an Oscar since it added to the chaos quite well. By the third BOOM I was in almost as much confusion and panic as the people on screen--and I liked it.<br/><br/>The movie's gritty reality--in contrast to its overblown, often ostentatious genre--was what captivated me. Cloverfield was made on a budget of 25 million, and I was 10000 times more into it than I Am Legend. Making anyone satisfied is the least of Abrams' priorities; all the horror film and monster movie clichés--INCLUDING THE MONSTER--crash and burn like the decapitated Statue of Liberty. Horror and thriller cinema needed a shock to the system, and this is it.<br/><br/>The ending is expectedly unexpected, but appropriate. It doesn't matter what it would have been because the audience would have applauded anyway.<br/><br/>P.S. Stay after the credits."

I went into this movie with an open mind as to what I was going to see after reading other reviews and knowing the small basis of what was going to happen. I was in shock to see that there really was no ending to this movie. It seems that they spend most of their budget on special effects and location that they lacked the funds to find some one to finish writing this great movie.<br/><br/>I love the way it was shot, and its feel of you watching from a first person Point of View. You actually feel involved in the movie and I could tell many of the people in the theater felt to be in the suspense. I could also tell that some people did not like that, as one girl sitting in my row was telling her friend out loud how she thought that it was ""stupid"". As for my friend sitting next to me, he was actually getting dizzy and a headache from the bouncing of the camera.<br/><br/>I think the trailers for this movie were very accurate. The trailers would be clips and pieces, and you were left wondering what it was all about, well the movie will leave you the same way."

","How on Earth can this movie be rated so high? There is no real plot, no character development, and the monster, well, let's not even talk about that. What was it supposed to be anyway? An alien, a secret government experiment gone wrong, your guess is just good as anybody's because no one knows. The pictures from that hand held camera was plain annoying too. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I'm giving this movie ""one"" only because I'm not allowed to go lower. The fact that it has done so well in the box office just shows that people will just watch anything more than once. Even if it's just 2 hours of blurry and shaky picture and hearing the sound of bombs going off. I work hard for my money and recently came back from a 15 months Iraq Deployment, is there anybody I can talk to get my money back? In conclusion, I have one word for this movie, ""A MASTERPISS."""
"dsxc80","3","26","59","17 January 2008"," Entirely disappointing
","I went into this movie with no preconceptions as I hadn't heard of it, and maybe if I'd known the entirety of the storyline I would haven't given into my friend coercing me to go. The first scenes have a home video showing the burgeoning romance between Rob and Beth, this is soon taped over by the going away party for Rob, who is heading to Japan for work, and the goings on of that night.<br/><br/>My first thought was when the party came up, ""I hope the entire movie isn't shot like this"" - now remember I had no preconceptions about this movie as I had not read any reviews or even known about it before my mate asked me to go. Mix in some fairly inane dialog, some quite unlikely survival predicaments, camera shots that made me feel ill and I'm left with a movie that I would have preferred not to see.<br/><br/>People have been speaking of Godzilla, Gamera and other monster movies to say this has emulated them. But I disagree, the monster I thought was very similar to was the one in The Host - basically a mutated monster that needs people to feed on - although in Cloverfield the monster is a few hundred feet tall. Mix in a few aliens from Starship Troopers (which you have a fairly similar storyline of rescuing a trapped friend) and you have a rather weird movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong if they were going for the atmosphere of the movie being a claustrophobic monster movie shot on a video camera, they achieved it. I was just disappointed in the overall storyline, video camera angles and the impossibility of it."
"gregl-4","1","13","26","23 October 2009"," Shame on IMDb
","I'm a long time user of IMDb, and I use it frequently to inform my decision making. It's not perfect, but I know how to interpret the ratings so I can use them to anticipate how I'm likely to respond to a movie. However, I've just read the first ten pages of comments for Cloverfield, and they were with few exceptions, almost universally negative. Not just negative, but some of the worst comments and ratings I've ever seen on a film. For any long time user, it is obvious... without any doubt... that someone associated with this film has figured out a way to dramatically manipulate the rating.<br/><br/>Based on the comments alone, this movie should be rated below a 3. For it to ever be above 7 (7.4 at the time of this comment) is harder to believe than any of the ridiculous things thrown at us in the film itself. Given the clever marketing campaign that duped so many people prior to this film's release, I have no doubt whatsoever that manipulating it's IMDb rating was one of the primary tactics planned well in advance.<br/><br/>I ask any frequent user of IMDb who has seen this film to spend 5 minutes perusing the overwhelming number of negative comments, and tell me what you think. 7.4? How?"
"bloodstained_memory","5","13","26","26 January 2008"," Eh. It was not worth my money.
","I'm currently giving this movie 5 stars. Why? Because right now, it's apparently the hottest movie around; That is, until next week when it drops to the bottom of the box office in favor of a far duller ( yes, it's possible) and violent film.<br/><br/>They have been calling this movie "" A modern American monster"" and are praising JJ as if he had done something brand new and brilliant. To say that this movie touches upon originality and lives up to it's hype is as to say ""The Holocaust Never Happened."" I'd give this movie far more credit if it was something new, rather than something old from another country.<br/><br/>Frankly, I never cared for this movie to begin with and after seeing it and judging it fairly; I figured, the actual hype for the movie was better than the actual movie. Hundreds of youtube videos people posted simply because they were greedy for what was considered "" The only American monster"", so what is Mothman and the Flatlands Creature? Chopped liver? It's as people forgot about all the OTHER creature features released in the last 8 years. It takes a particularly bland film to win the praise that so many other decent films were denied simply because ""We weren't interested"". I love how that works.<br/><br/>That whole camcorder thing got on my nerves after a while. After first encountering it in the Blair Witch Project, then in the infinite number of ""Military Projects Gone Wrong, Special Ops team gets sent in and decimated by said project and it's caught on their camera"" movies and video games. So, after so much exposure you'd understand why I'd be opposed to seeing it again.<br/><br/>The only thing worth watching this movie for is the character development. Without spoiling the actual movie,the drama is comparable to Return of the Living Dead, one of my favorite movies. So, it's pretty much the only thing worth sitting through, either a bootleg version or in a theater. Your choice, but I doubt you'll watch it again, unlike RotLD. The ""monster"", you know the selling point of Cloverfield? Isn't any scarier or interesting than the giant high level monster in a generic video game. Actually, I've seen scarier monsters in videogames such as Shadow Hearts Series or the Silent Hill Series. Frankly, the debates on what the monster looked like were far more entertaining than the actual monster itself. Between the countless false images, lions, megazords, rick rolls and Dr. Wily himself, the actual monster is just a disappointment.<br/><br/>All and all, this is a good movie for the casual movie goer. For people looking for a hardcore ,dedicated creature feature/ monster movie, you're better off using the money to complete your collection of better films."

They only spent 30 million making this movie and it shows. I think they could have spent 30 thousand and still got the same result. As i was watching this film i just had flashbacks of the Blair Witch Project. The camera movement for Cloverfield was worse than Blair Witch. After seeing the movie i still can't describe in full what the creature looks like. I was getting so frustrated when the camera was bouncing all over the place during key parts of the movie or it was pointed at the wall or the floor when things i wanted to see were going on. I know i wasn't the only one that felt like this the whole theater was sold out and every one else seemed to be frustrated as well. I can tell you this for sure. Even though it will set a box office record this movie is going to fall in a major way in the weeks to come.

NO. i suppose this was yet again another marketing ploy by the filmmakers to entice people to come back and see a possible sequel? i just don't know if they clenched enough of their audience to want to come back. the movie was empty for me. but i guess all the people tired of the same old same old will give it rave reviews. <br/><br/>its a good money making scheme, i will give them that, but i don't think it will pay another $10 for any additional cloverfield movies. the only way i will is if a friend sees it and tells me Godzilla comes out of no where to save the day."

","Cloverfield was one of the better films i've seen in the past month. My friends and I were constantly laughing through-out the move from Hud's comic relief, which was realistic half the time but still funny. I read lots of reviews saying, ""You hardly see the monster, motion sickness blah blah..."" There was only like two points in the movie where the camcorder was shaking and thats because they were running for their lives, which is a given. You get some very awesome shots of the ""cuthulhu"" type monster. The cgi was also programmed very well in these shots. The beginning of the film helps you relate to these characters so nothing has to be explained later. The acting was great and so was the suspense/action. Overall a very good movie for its budget. Props to Abrams!<br/><br/>if this movie makes you ""sick"", from the camcorder, then you should never ride a merry-go-round or record home movies...it was not THAT bad."
"goodellaa","8","13","26","18 January 2008"," Skillful up-date on weird phenomena disaster-fantasy.
","This movie was, I suspect, a labor of love for it's creators. I had the pleasure of seeing it at 12:01 AM this morning with an enthusiastic audience of 20-somethings not unlike the main characters. The UCLA crowd, if I'm not mistaken, in one of the best theaters in LA. I rarely feel so good about giving up 12 bucks, and felt well served by the ads that preceded the opening, as it is fun sometimes to go in knowing little or nothing. In the closing credits there is a credit for stills from other movies: King Kong, Them, and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. This latter picture is the one Cloverfield most reminded me of and of which it could even be considered a re-make. Because of it's style and story it also put me in mind of The Birds, The Blair Witch Project and Night of the Living Dead. It is a good movie for those of us who like this sort of thing. The whole thing is from the point of view of a single hi-def camera in the hands of some guy who is participating in a wedding party in a big building somewhere in southern Manhattan Island. I'm in LA so they all look pretty big to me and I can tell you that one of the first chills for the west coast audience is the suspicion that the weird phenomenon is some freak earthquake. No such luck, though, and the picture is loaded with scary thrills, a real roller-coaster. Once in a while there is a little typical blockbuster silliness, but in general they are going for realism, without trying to present anything but outlandish fantasy. Plenty of badly needed humor throughout, so people can more easily sit through seven hours (dramatically condensed) of really awful devastation. By giving us a little time with the doomed wedding party of newly-minted adults, then following the survivors as they are whittled down by ill luck and loyalty, the human factor that gives this weird phenomenon's visit interest is never lost. As the situation gets rapidly worse we get a bigger picture of events without leaving the intimacy of the camera. Well crafted and technically sophisticated. Good fun, and like it's beloved cousin Godzilla, asks questions of us. How on earth would you handle this dire situation, and is it (at least emotionally) really so unlike your actual situation?"

This movie is the worst ever, even beats out Battlefield earth.<br/><br/>The movie had great sound effects and a few good special effects with the monster, but that is where it stops. They explain nothing, no closure at all. What you do get is sea sick, me and my friend where both sick to our stomachs and dizzy after the movie was over. The camera shaking 100 % of the time (like a really bad home movie) was a real joy (NOT). Half the time the movie is shot sideways or upside down. It was the first movie that I considered leaving halfway through. I stuck it out for the entire movie hoping it would get better, of course that never happened. I was happy to see the ending credits knowing my hell was finally over. As we were leaving you could hear curse words under everyones breath and even witnessed several people asking for the money back from the theaters. The bad thing about this crap of a movie is that it will probably win some awards and be a big hit. Seems they always do. I hope not, I would hate for them to thing they did a good thing and make more of this garbage. (Seems to have been thought up during the writers strike. :) Never before has a movie been so bad that I felt I needed to comment. I'm just hoping to save a few souls 90 minutes and their lives and a little cash.<br/><br/>The movie makes no sense. They must have spent ten's of dollars making this crap."

Very broken, with no continuity and my time would have been better spent renting a good film, even if I had already seen it in the past. 2 thumbs down. It is sometimes difficult what guidelines, if any, were used to determine whether or not a film will be released to the theaters. I predict that once it has been seen by a more diverse audience, word will spread and box office attendance will dwindle to nothing. It opened here in two theaters out of twenty two, and I expect that next week it will be down to one theater with fewer showings and be replace with something more worthwhile, like Mad Money or another comedy, where you can at lease have a few laughs for your price of admission."

The ""characters"" are introduced to us through way of home video shots at a party. I'm assuming the film-makers thought this would make me feel more connected to the so-called characters, but it did the opposite. I was more distanced and I didn't care about them, worse than that, after so long of this party nonsense, I didn't care who the characters were anymore. But then something happens.<br/><br/>The something was some kind of disaster that they weren't sure about at the beginning. Could be an earthquake, or could be some external presence. But remember this is all shot as a home video. Can you imagine what your home video would look like if an earthquake or some other disaster occurred? Yes, that's right, not much was captured. Lots of feet shots and screams of ""what's going on?"".<br/><br/>The whole ""movie"" was pretty much shaky shots of people screaming and then shots of the ground as they start running.

"Ricksterlau","1","7","12","21 June 2008"," Shaky camera - not a problem. Awful script and production value - BIG problem!
","From the start of this film, I was never fond of the filming direction whereby the director opted to use the live ""shaky camera"" style. However it did bring a more refreshing approach to films of such which I have never experienced before. The first person perspective of the camera allowed the audience to witness a more grand scale of the action sequences and really made them as if they were actually there. It's a neat idea but unfortunately other parts of the film fall short, way too short and hasn't helped this at all.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this film is absolutely abysmal. One of the cast plays as the camera man and films all the way throughout the film trying to capture everything as evidence and we, the audience see through the camera. Nearly everything he says is either unhelpful to other people, repetitive in remarks (Oh my God etc...) and mostly it's bloody annoying to listen to. One would definitely not shout out stupid comments in an awkward situations, yet the guy keeps on yapping again, again and again. I understand the producers wants the audience to feel immersed in the film. However you'll never achieve that with this broken dialogue! What can I say about the casts? Poor, very poor. You sometimes want to ask whether these people can really act. The simple answer is no they can't, especially Michael Stahl-David. Some of the face expressions they pull out at certain moments are just unnatural. However this is understandable since most of the time their speeches are ""Oh my God"", ""Oh Sh*t"", ""Oh this, that and the other."" Last but not least, the script is awful. There is absolutely no explanation whatsoever on the background of events that happened during the film. (You'll understand once you watch it.) Unjustifiable reasoning of action taken by the main casts is also a major problem of this film. A person in a right state of mind would never do things as the casts have done in the film. The script is a lousy way to produce yet another hyped pile of garbage. And the ending? Easy to understand but unexplained in other areas of the film.<br/><br/>This film is by all means poor. I can't believe why some people regarded this film as ""brilliant"" because I don't see one bit of brilliance in this rubbish. The casts can't act, the dialogue is badly written, the script is senseless and above all they (the production team) threw in a shaky camera to help all the causes. Bravo!"

Why do we have to suffer once again through the most impressive collection of jawdroppingly dumb yuppies, whose existence somehow seems to revolve around spewing the most vapid conversation around like if it was a sport. You know, like, I'm so totally amazed at this awesome dialog dudeman! <br/><br/>Cloverfield has some very impressive and convincing CGI, but when are we finally going to get treated to this art-form in a movie together with a good story and on par dialog? Transformers, another CGI wonder, was completely unwatchable for the exact same reason.<br/><br/>I realize that it's a cliché when I say that this movie could and should have been SO much better. Not in gritty realism, it covers that bit quite well (although I would have preferred some sort of mix of steady-cam and not-steady-cam footage). But rather through a decent plot, a decent (and relevant) build-up and a feasible script.<br/><br/>Hopefully the audiences will eventually grow exponentially tired of these sort of plot less caricatures of earlier, similar films, which really only give us an update on the progress of filming- , editing- and CGI-techniques.<br/><br/>Cloverfield scores a 7.8 on IMDb as I write this, which in actuality is a near 6.5 compared to the ratings of movies before studio-companies and the masses began to flood this site.

If you thought this might be the first great monster movie or an intense experience, then you haven't ever had an experience or seen a monster movie in your life!!! First of all, an entire movie, while in theory is a great idea, in actuality it gets very annoying after about ten minutes. The idea of a monster attacking New York and seeing it through the eyes of the people being attacked is a really great idea, but after about fifteen minutes of seeing nothing and hearing that something cool is going on...ALL OFF CAMERA!!! When the attack finally comes (and it takes what feels like forever to set up characters through the hand held camera) it looks like something cool is going on and we can't wait to see it, the sad fact is that we never get to see (clearly) what's going on, and we never get a good explanation of what is happeneing. What we know is that the city is being attacked by a monster, the military is involved and they're losing the battle.<br/><br/>While I've read that this is scary and intense, what it really is, is a Godzilla movie told from the perspective of the people running from the monster. And, while our 'heroes' rush back into the fray to rescue a girl, the audience is never really brought into the mix totally. Oh, we're following along for the ride, but, since we don't really know what's going on, we're not completely involved.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I bought into the hype (and the Star Trek trailer sealed the deal), but after the movie, I felt just like I did after The Blair Witch Project! I knew that the hype and discussion about the movie were going to be far better than the movie. It's sad that all this time and effort were built around a movie that's this poorly done. Yes, it might look cool, and it might have a cool concept, but, if you're making movie, you have to remember the audience. We might want to know what this monster is, we might want to know what happens when you get bitten by one of the smaller monsters, and what the hell is going on!!! If you're interested in a cool monster movie, then head down to the video store and rent Godzilla: Final Wars, avoid this movie if you're looking for excitement and horror, Cloverfield delivers none of what it promises!!"

","I caught the first showing today; and although it was 10 AM, I was fully awake and ready to see if the flick lived up to the hype... and boy did it ever!! The unsteadiness of the camera movements did not bother me a bit; nor did it with my husband. It kind of gave you the feeling of watching a home video... making it seem as if you are experiencing the events right along with the characters.<br/><br/>As far as movie ""monsters"" go, this definitely was not a cheesy one. Through the majority of the film you get brief glimpses of the ""monster"" or the filming is distorted; which makes it kind of difficult to determine what you are actually looking at. After finally getting to see the ""money shot"" of the creature looking down at the camera as well as the spider-like spawns that continuously fall off the creature .. it kind of looks like - no not a lizard or a mutant toad - but something alien-like. Especially when you see the ""air bubbles"" that are where the brain or top of the head is.<br/><br/>Above all, this was a great monster .. end of the world .. flick! It had it all .. suspense, mutilation, creepy crawly things, body explosion, and even a love story.<br/><br/>MOST IMPORTANT .. do not just get up and walk out when it ends!!! I stress this! It will completely keep you wanting more. **After the credits roll and the ""roar!"" music .. you will hear some audio. Listen closely .. it is the character Rob saying, ""it's still alive""."

","The Blair Witch styled first person shooting was clever for about 5 minutes then it started giving me a headache. I had to close my eyes to regain my equilibrium. I just don't have the stomach for that shot. That's why I hate watching people's home movies. However, I regret that I was not physically able to fully enjoy the experience, because the movie was really good. It was definitely an original take on a classic sci-fi tale of alien invasion. The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat. And the ending was not entirely predictable as it often is with this type of movie. And the graphics were spectacular.<br/><br/>And best of all, it is a discussion movie. I love a movie that my friends and I can discuss after we see it. It feels like I'm getting more for my money."

Just one thing  the idea behind the movie did have a potential which regrettably was totally wasted. And this is sad. The attempt of the creators to be ""original"" and to create a feeling of ""actual event"" is absolutely laughable. The hand camera could be cool for some minutes or if it is used from time to time through the movie, but here it quickly became more than annoying. The dialogs and the motivation of the characters  come on!!! My 7 years old son comes with better stories.

","This short feature has more viral hype than a bad film looking for box office figures through marketing, but it ain't in the same category. The idea of capturing the terrifying 7 hours supposedly on a video camera is not completely new in cinema, and here it works, though don't sit too close to the front you'll be as nauseas as a channel ferry on a rough day.<br/><br/>I do like the way the story is fairly contained to the characters, I'm still wondering what a Cloverfield actually is, and following the four to five characters running around the city keeps you busy, so at first you don't notice the large plot holes. But there comes a point where you giggle to yourself at how preposterous some of scenes are, and this makes the film feel like an expensive film school project. Those old fashioned idea's like character development, plots, and a sturdy tripod have been thrown out in this film as it tries to be the new cool kid of monster movies.<br/><br/>I'm quite undecided how I feel about this film, apart from the motion sickness of a complete feature being shot as hand-held, the fact that the characters survive the un-survivable, that we never really get to know any of the characters, except for Rob, and it seems America is still working through that event of seven years ago in New York, but it does leave a mark on you as you walk out of the cinema and expect half the world to be destroyed, I almost feel disappointed it is not."

","I did see this movie, with the same anticipations that many shared, it looked like it would be great from all the hyped TV ads...(But please read through to my second paragraph!) And then I actually saw this monstrosity-pardon my pun. Awful doesn't begin to describe this ""steaming pile"" as so many others have affectionately called it. Yeah, the CGI was cool in spots, but it had almost no plot, weak acting and had too many gaps of logic, well beyond what a good movie does to suspend one's believe in reality--> that ""rebar"" event highlights this completely. (Keep READING!!)<br/><br/>My REAL reason for this post is to take IMDb to task for giving this PoS such an unusually high rating...7.4 to date. I back my thoughts with evidence from their very own site... I perused through the ""Post your review"" pages, sorting them using the ""Hated it"" filter. There are 106 pages of reviews that ""Hate it"", 1060 responses. The first 50 pages of these reviews carry only one or two stars. By page 75 (yeah, 75 out of 106 that hated it) the reviews manage to give it six stars... Now, I sorted all the reviews by ""Love it"" and you get just 90 pages and 894 reviews out of the 2010 reviews in total, as of the time that I wrote this. Funny that the two figures add up to 1954 reviews in total, I guess a few of you are on the fence... and IMDb does have a Love/Hate category...for the 56 of you out there...LOL.<br/><br/>But still, how can there be more negative reviews than positive reviews (by 166), and this thing still ends up with a 7.4? And like I said, the first fifty, yes 5-0 pages(one quarter of the total pages of reviews) contain reviews with only 1-2 stars!! Something more that this movie smells fishy to me...didn't that monster have gills??<br/><br/>SO, MY QUESTION TO YOU, the reader of this post is, who is IMDb really working for? I would think this movie deserves maybe a four or five overall rating at best, and IMDb tells us it's a 7.4. Is it because someone is perhaps stuffing the ballot box, so to speak?... I can't see how a movie can get such overwhelmingly bad reviews, in VOLUMES, and still generate a 7.4?<br/><br/>I know math does not seem to be a strong point for most people anymore, but the math on this one really REEKS of something awful. So what's the scoop IMDb, care to respond? I'd be shocked if this post makes it to the main page, but I will applaud them if they let it fly, if for nothing more than freedom of speech... But I think my point is valid. Let me and IMDb know what you think of my thoughts, VOTE ON THIS REVIEW!!"

My last bash I have on this film is the hand cam. idea. It was creative and even though it did make me dizzy, the constant shakiness frustrated me more, because I couldn't see a bloody thing. I go to the movies to witness, life made extraordinary in the form of a fantastic tale, truth or myth. My suggestion to the producer and the director of this film, is a much stronger story that is based on more than, people running, and they're pathetic relationships. However I have to say that this film did give a good jump now and then. I really think that this movie was a creative idea to give a very real point of view, but it just went south.

So, producers of the Cloverfield - very greedy guys. They hired some beach boys and girls, cut F/X budget to the minimum.

"Jay_Exiomo","6","11","22","29 January 2008"," A clever trick but nothing more
","And the monster is out of the bag.<br/><br/>Thickly veiled in secrecy and fueled by the hype surrounding it, ""Cloverfield"" is the result of ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" after having a one-night stand. Without saying much, the film revolves around a group of twenty-somethings who hold a farewell party for Japan-bound Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) when a monster attacks New York City.<br/><br/>It's a great marketing ploy, actually, and the J.J. Abrams-produced film, directed by Matt Reeves, certainly looks interesting on paper. Written by Drew Goddard, a frequent collaborator with Abrams, the film unfolds through the perspective of a hand-held camcorder as recorded by someone, mostly by Hud Platt (T.J. Miller). The first few minutes is spent introducing us to Rob and his girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) waking up one morning, accidentally recorded over with interviews of a bunch of other people we're going to hang out with as mayhem starts.<br/><br/>I have no problems with the shaky camera nor the awkward camera angles. In fact, it helps with the realism and if only for those factors, plus the clever editing, the movie works. Still, the film doesn't present itself as anything more than a cheap catharsis for a post-9/11 New York. One is smacked in the middle of the events yet it doesn't generate the requisite urgency. There are few moments of genuine tension but those fragments never form into a consistently gripping product. You hang out with these people, but you never find the sympathy to care for them, when their motivation is anchored on manipulative gimmickry and their interaction fueled by amateur acting and a hackneyed script best suited for the emo populace.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" is a clever trick but nothing more. It's the big-screen treatment of a YouTube video, only here the gimmick is more conspicuous, and what usually lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes is stretched to 80 minutes or so."

I repeat what I said there, why can't focus be off these Ford Agency models for just 5 minutes? There ARE people in the Big Apple who never set foot in a health spa, above or underneath 20 something. ID4 had more variety in terms of human characters. The human character spoilers for this, girl/boy severed relationship, regrets it and gotta save the ex-beloved couple action crap seen in many a Sci-Fi""original"" flick.

I saw several people running out of the movie and most likely for that reason.<br/><br/>The storyline is nothing new, in fact nothing about the movie is new. It's just a rehash of several other movies, mixed in a blender, and puked out on the screen. The really bad thing is that it could have been an awesome movie. Just a little more work on the storyline, some real lighting, and for God's sake a real cinematographer would have made a HUGE difference. Just because the entire movie is supposed to be through the POV of one of the actors does not mean that we actually need to see it like that.<br/><br/>Think about it.

It's a film about a group of friends forced to deal with unspeakable tragedy of an unexplainable level. Keeping this in mind will allow you to better enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Most of the criticism levied at Cloverfield comes from the somewhat loose way the movie ends and the ""facebook/myspace"" feel some older elitist Film Critics believe the movie is rooted in. However, if you recognize that this is a movie about people then it ends exactly the way it should. Thinking that the point of Cloverfield is to find out exactly what is terrorizing Manhattan is the wrong way to approach this thrilling movie.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm different but sometimes I like not knowing everything about a movie. I don't need to know what's in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction to enjoy it. I don't want to know what hand the guy in Rounders had at the end of the movie because that wasn't the point and I definitely don't need to know how or why the monster in Cloverfield exists to enjoy it.

The great acting also extremely helped the overall mood of the film. Although I saw the statue of Liberty head fly in the trailer so many times, there was nothing like seeing the characters reaction to it after it happened.<br/><br/>If you go into the movie expecting it to be all about the monster you WILL be disappointed. Although the monster looks crazy and great and does show up at various points of the film, it is not the star. The point of the movie is to show what a normal person would do faced with this situation and not what the army and president would do. Therefore, the characters obviously don't go looking for the monster.<br/><br/>The movie has no real back story or explanations as to the origin of the monster, but it would make no sense if it did. This is just a video taped by four teenagers fighting to survive. So unless the monster had a big ""Made in China"" sticker on his back, how could they ever know.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was amazing.

Godzilla right on through the whole series. Things that come out of nowhere for no reason and kill you? Alien; The Thing; Halloween. Characters we don't care about getting what they may or may not deserve? Jaws. Shaky video? Blair Witch. So may I add my pennyworth as to why it collects so many comments? It is missing suspense. We ""know"" from the outset that everyone dies, and there isn't even the trick of a last scene in the chopper saying, ""Don't drop the camera!"" before a receding shot of the chopper's tail-fin. We ""know"" the monster gets killed eventually, cos there's someone around to dig the camera up. We certainly know that these people are supposed to be just average guys caught up in bad stuff, but they don't do anything to make their eventual fate interesting or to suggest that they have any real sense of danger. And in fact we ""know"" that the only source of danger here is monsters. There's nothing else out there in the dark; no other human interaction e.g. someone carjacking them in a panic or any other physical threat. Even scrambling across busted skyscrapers doesn't look dangerous, because the idiot with the camera still has it in his face and is busy filming. Because it is missing suspense we are left looking for plot or explanation. And of course the makers were banking so much on suspense that they left that out completely! And because there is neither suspense nor plot nor explanation we are not willing to suspend our disbelief. The only hook left is, ""that is a really cool monster! I'd pay good money to see a monster like that!"" Sorry, folks, the monster is dreck too. I though CGI was meant to keep a sense of scale, but if you watch the bad camera-work the thing seems to change size worse than Grape Ape used to! In the end the thing looks the size of a block of flats (and that would be about right) so why does it bother to eat one bloke lying around on the ground? And then spit him out? Ah, well, there it is, I think. It wasn't much of a film to start with and then it dispensed with all the things that might have made me forgive it. And I have forgiven worse things in my time! Wiser heads than I have pointed out the things that just can't be believed, but I'm going to give the merit award to the invulnerability of the monster because this is a common Hollywood trait. Humans are actually very, very good at killing things and causing mayhem and damage. Modern warfare is more terrifying and devastating than most of what Hollywood usually shows, which is why A Bridge Too Far can still be shocking. Having a lame monster like this wandering around the place and pretending we can't stiff it in five rounds rapid...that's both sad and a worrying pretence that war is harmless fun for the lads."

In fact, I always thought that particular film would have received better reviews had it not been called a Godzilla film. Afterall, the monster didn't look at all like the traditional Godzilla, and the film took itself very seriously. It could have been called Cloverfield 1. The current Cloverfield film is very short, clocking in well under the standard hour and a half. Despite this, the first part of the film seems like an eternity. Half hour number one introduces us to the film's one dimensional...no, make that non-dimensional characters at a going away party. It also introduces us to a hand-held camera that is used throughout the entire film, generating more wooziness than the most avid Blair Witch hater could ever imagine. I wouldn't advise forking out 16 bucks on some stale popcorn/week old hot dog/flat soft drink combo for this one! Your stomach will want immediate pay back. I will give that awful hand-held camera credit for one thing, though. It sure is a tough little gizmo. It's outer casing survives monsters, falling bricks, explosions, the army, and an air raid that levels Manhattan. But that camera keeps going and going and going. So do the characters. That's all they do. They run and scream and shout and run and scream and shout. People are dying all around them, but all that matters to the film's ""hero"" and his pals is going back to save a girlfriend he got into an argument with at the beginning of the film. His friends don't take too much persuading to accompany him in this futile quest either, but then again, who wouldn't blindly follow an unfleshed out character on a collision course with a giant monster that's been killing everyone in sight? Not surprisingly, the friends get picked off one by one...yawn. Too bad you see so much of these disposable characters and not very much of the monster which is barely glimpsed at for the most part. When it is seen, the big guy looks like CGI. Night Of The Demon had it right, less is more when an on screen monster doesn't do justice to the off-screen fright it is supposed to evoke. There are a couple of ""whoah!"" moments in Cloverfield involving smaller insects which spew off of the big one for no reason other than to have something to chase the kids indoors and add some gross out moments. (Come to think of it, weren't there little Godzilla monsters in the Matthew Broderick Godzilla movie as well? Hmmmm.) Toho's Godzilla films are for the most part fun and campy. Cloverfield is basically a serious attempt at a giant monster flick. It's really just an artsy fartsy Godzilla film with 80% of it's time taken up by annoying college aged blank canvases either saying nothing much (that going away party, which was filmed as if you were there, was so dull that if I was an invite I would have left long before any monster ever showed up!) or huffing and puffing while running, screaming, and orally implying vague happenings that aren't shown on camera. I can't believe this nothingness has gotten such great reviews on this site. It has a few scares and moments of ""what's going on!"", but far too many lulls, repetitions, and nothing actually going on a whole lot of the time, a fact you'll realize if you close your eyes and actually stop letting the hand-held motion camera trickery fool you for a few seconds while trying not to vomit from dizziness. If you do see this one, grab some motion sickness meds and leave all analytical thinking out the door. Questions as to why there's a monster, why college educated people would go up on a roof during an earthquake, why little monsters are falling off the big one, why cell phone batteries die so easily and camera batteries do not, (etc.) have no place during this frill ride. If you think too much, sorry to say but you'll fall into a plot hole, not a hole caused by an inferior CGI Godzilla wannabe. Despite all the negativity I've stated, I give this one 5.5 out of 10, meaning, like most films, it's just a middling time waster to be seen once and never again. There are a few genuine critter jolts and some very nice building disaster special effects. It just isn't worth the raves on this site. I was unpleasantly surprised and disappointed after hearing so many overly positive reviews. (As time has passed, it's obvious that IMDb is no longer a place to go to base your decision on whether to see a new movie or not. A bulk of first reviews here are written by hired guns to get people to show up at the box office. The other vast majority of reviews on here are by people who love certain movies almost with an obsession. Trust only the ones that briefly describe the plot and tell you a few pros and cons so that you can decide if such a movie will appeal to you or turn you off. Only you can truly decide in the end, but at least the latter kind of reviews can help determine a rental versus spending a fortune at the theater.)"

","OK ladies and gentlemen lets recall what we learned in 10th grade English. <br/><br/>Plot=exposition then rising action then climax then falling action then resolution and/or denouement <br/><br/>We have our exposition in the party scene. good. great. excellent... We have rising action. OK good so far We have rising action. Wait didn't I just say that?? We have rising action. OK what is the climax? The End. WHATTTTT!!!!! No resolution? Are you kidding me???

The material quoted above is more or less excuses as to why the movie couldn't possibly suck (which it does in my opinion). Don't get me wrong i enjoyed my time at the theater but shortly after i realized there really wasn't anything special about this movie at all. I gave it four stars for being a great action film but nothing more. I guess it can't be anything more. <br/><br/>And the character development....man o man. It couldn't happen. There was the party scene at the beginning where everyone is first shown (exposition) but there's no actual character development going on then. The rest of the movie, of course, is hogged by the monster. Any appreciable character development could not happen. The whole movie long we are wholely concentrated on finding out just what the heck that monster is and how it became...making it impossible to care about the characters...so the monster is a mega hindrance to the film. <br/><br/>Stop accepting this film as greatness just because its as good as it was allowed to be"

","Normally when a film has 4000+ good reviews it will be a good picture. If I don't find the film good, I usually watch it again to see what I missed, or I feel that I wasn't in the right mood for it when I watched it. As for ""Cloverfield""...I'm drawing a complete blank! I heard that the amateur camera work gave it an authentic feel and helped define the characters. It didn't do that at all! The behavior of the characters throughout the so-called terror was not realistic at all. This includes the military personal as well as the main characters. Just totally unbelievable. This film was not only boring, but very predictable throughout. Cmon...time to run the other way when we see rats running? Give me a break! I've given this film a new title...""Creed""!

"VelHam6","5","8","15","28 January 2008"," Disappointing
","**Contains spoilers for ""Cloverfield"" and ""I Am Legend""** <br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I love JJ Abrams' work. Favorites to date include ""Armageddon"", ""Alias"" and ""Lost"". And I'm really looking forward to the upcoming ""Star Trek"" release. But ""Cloverfield"" was unfortunately a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>First, let's address the most obvious problem: vertigo caused by the shaky camera effect. I had no idea my popcorn bag could potentially have served another purpose usually associated with airplanes or amusement parks; I personally didn't succumb but came very close. The shaky photography was for too long and was too intense. I even had occasional trouble following the action because by the time my eyes re-focused on the screen the scene was over. The theater din during and after the movie were mostly mumblings of nausea, dizziness and headaches; some of my fellow patrons, like the poor guy next to me, even left without seeing the end of the movie. My two thirteen year old ""dates"" complained of headaches and were completely silent for the entire car trip home. I saw the movie this past Friday and today is Monday and I still feel a tad nauseated. Maybe if some scenes had been still shots and the shaky camera effect had been intermittent the movie could have maintained its first person perspective without compromising its creativity or ferocity. Or maybe I just should have taken a Dramamine before leaving my house.<br/><br/>I also wish the characters had been developed more. Marlena was unfortunately very distant and not always nice, especially to Hud. When she died I felt sympathy for her as a human being but not much more. I wanted to see more of Hud. He was cute and funny and we didn't see enough of him because he was the movie's primary camera man. The other characters were mostly likable but I still don't feel like I had a chance to connect with them. I was honestly more upset when Sam died in ""I Am Legend"" than I was with the deaths in ""Cloverfield"". (Allow me to clarify that my issues are with the characters, not with the actors.)<br/><br/>As for the monster(s), I was left wanting to know more. Were they aliens? An evolutionary nightmare? A government experiment gone horribly awry? In the makeshift department store/medical unit scene, we saw at least one of the smaller monsters on a gurney but we didn't get any follow up. No scientists dissecting it. No news conference with a White House/DoD/State Department official press release. What are these things? Why are they here? Are more coming? This trick on ""Lost"" made me tune in every week for more information (especially that darned polar bear); in ""Cloverfield"" I was just left confused and a smidgen apathetic. And even though I wouldn't have wanted to live through that horror, the movie didn't really scare me like I anticipated.<br/><br/>In summary, the movie was okay but not the masterpiece I expected from Mr. Abrams. If the sequel is mostly still camera, I'll probably go see it just for closure. If it's shaky camera, I will definitely pass and wait for the DVD (so I can watch it in spurts to avoid the vertigo). The most important thing I hope to discover in the sequel is who, what, or where is Cloverfield? I do wonder though...if I hadn't had to close my eyes periodically in an effort to avoid vomiting or if I had been able to focus on the screen better, would I have fewer questions?"

"forpassord","3","3","4","22 October 2019"," Regret that I watched it( again)...
","I remember that I did not like this movie when I watched it earlier. But I did not remember that it was THIS bad, and I regret that I wasted my time again by watching it again...<br/><br/>I can see why the movie contains so little answers about why, what, how and so on as other reviewers are complaining about since this movie obviously is meant to show the experience of what happens the way the characters in the movie experience things there and then, and just theirs. But this could have easily been (partly) solved by making the movie a bit longer by showing more news stories in the beginning. Alternatively the film makers could just have kept the same length of the movie by just using the part of the movie that took place before the ""event"" better.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is a problem in itself in combination with the rest of the movie: The introduction to the movie took about one minute, and it is not until ca.19 minutes after that things actually starts happening. The end credits starts BEFORE the movie has lasted even 74 minutes. That makes the first 20 uneventful minutes of this more than 1/4 of the movie!!<br/><br/>In my opinion both the special effects and the acting was as good as it could get given the premise of this film and what they had to work with. What mostly ruined this movie for me was the terribly exaggerated shaking of the camera: I sometimes during the movie almost wondered if it would be possible to make the camera shake more if they tried to...! I found the dialogue in this movie to not be bad as such. But it was written as if the characters in the movie was less than intelligent, and to a certain point naive and stupid with the consequences that had for the dialogue... Much of the ""acting"" therefore consisted of running in panic while cursing and asking ""what was that""/""did you see that"", and so on repetitively.<br/><br/>To sum up: For more than 1/4 of the movie nothing happens, and the rest of the movie for the most part consists of the main characters running around confused while cursing and questioning what happened with barely anything getting answered."

","What I love about Cloverfield is how much mystery was leading up to the film premiere and how much the movie after years later; can leaves you with further questions. It's a thinking man's film as you're left asking yourself, what was that movie really about? Directed by Matt Reeves, Cloverfield is a mystery science fiction monster movie. The film is well-known for barely explaining anything. Coming from J.J Abrams, the producer from TV's Show 'Lost', it shouldn't be no surprise that the film will leave you with questions after watching it. Before settling on an official title, the film was marketed as 1-18-08. A lot of people didn't know what the untitled trailer for Cloverfield was about. Some thought it was a live-action adaptation of Voltron, others thought it was work from author H. P. Lovecraft 'The Call of Cthulhu' or spin-off of the TV show Lost. Due to the trailer, not having a title, so people started to use the name 'The Parasite', 'Slusho"" ""Greyshot"" ""Monstrous"" and 'Colossus' to describe it. In the end, Cloverfield was chosen as the title. Cloverfield is a weird title that makes you wonder. What does it mean? It seem to be taken off from a street from California. Well, you don't find out in the movie what it means. The film presented itself as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists video of the events of Friday, May 22, 2009 follows six young New Yorkers attending a going-away party on the night that a gigantic monster attacks the city. Occasionally, older segments are shown from a previous video that was mostly taped over showing a trip to Coney Island. What made this found footage movie different from the others, is how big budget, it was. Instead of showing us, nothing like most found footage does, we see a great deal of the monster attacks. Lots of great special effects and CGI that was scary at some points. Lots of scenery gorn. The violence was a bit graphic at times. Look for the store scene for details about that. It was great, but the shaky camera can makes some audience hurl. The film had this cinéma vérité style to look like it was taped with one hand-held camera. You can also see bits of 9/11 allusions based on the destruction in New York City, that makes the film even more disturbing to some viewers. The movie makes homage to other monsters film such as 1954 Godzilla, 1933 King Kong, 1953, the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and others. There is even homage to action movies like 1981's 'Escape from New York' such in the case of the rip Statue of Liberty head being tossed into the streets. The movie also put in Easter Eggs like the drink Slusho and the Japanese drilling company named Tagruato that served as part of the viral marketing campaign for this movie. You can see, both as Easter Eggs in many of JJ Abrams movies since then. So look forward to that. If you look closing in the Coney Island scenes, you can see a certain item hitting the ocean as foreshadowing of the monster's attack. Having the Coney Island scenes in the film, show that a lot of heart went into this film. It really give the movie so emotional value. After all, the acting is alright, but not memorable. Most of the character act like really dumb people and some can be a bit annoying at times. Without giving too much away of the downer ending, thank goodness for the Coney Island scenes to lower the blow. The DVD includes two alternative endings, which vary only slightly. The movie might hold a possible sequel, as there's a moment on the Brooklyn Bridge, with a background character was filming, the characters of the film. It show a different point of view. Overall: The entire film is one long love letter to Kaiju films but lacked substance, development, and emotional value with its damsel in distress story. The action scenes speak more than the human characters. The camera work can physically as well as mentally nauseated. In the end, it's a good B-movie story with a big blockbuster budget. Watch 2014's Godzilla, first. It works better."
"rodolforiverol","1","3","4","28 August 2013"," WOW....I have never seen such a horrific movie!
","Told through a hand held camera, the movie uses the same story telling technique as the Blair Witch Project - just not as well. While the first few moments of explosions and mystery are engaging the movie soon begins to drag, as a band of friends makes their way uptown to rescue the leading man's girlfriend. On their odyssey they soon come face to face with the marauding leviathan who in the first few scenes shows it's disdain for the statue of liberty by decapitating her and tossing her head right at our gang's feet (was it the huddle masses bit?), eventually forcing our gang underground into a subway station for cover. Predictably, walking uptown through the train tracks they're attacked by the monster's bug like spawn, which oddly enough resemble the creatures in Aliens. Of course one of the gang is bitten only to soon feel sick and explode in a burst of blood behind white sheets in a makeshift hospital, as something pops out of her. Where is commander Ripley now? After what seems like an eternity that makes actual NYC midtown rush-hour traffic look like the autobahn they make it up to midtown only to find the missing girlfriend's building drunkenly slumped over like the leaning tower of Pisa against another building. Jumping from one roof to another then back again with the skill of mountain goats they miraculously rescue the half conscious girlfriend then evacuate in a military helicopter. As the copter soars over the monster a bomber overhead makes a dead on strike only to anger it and cause it to swat the copter down into central park... Even Godzilla was killed by a missiles after getting tangled up in Brooklyn Bridge. The central characters themselves come across as selfish, unfeeling, pretentious and narcissistic. As members die they quickly move beyond it accepting it as coldly as a reality show contestant. Except for the bizarre pigheaded stand the troop takes to rescue one single person while putting everyone else in mortal jeopardy, they're completely devoid of empathy for anyone else around them including each other. Yuk. <br/><br/>This is one of the worst sci-fi movies and should be B - no, a D movie, if that. It's derivative - Blair Witch meets Blahhhh. At least other films, even the campy Godzilla movies of yesteryear tried to explain the why the monsters exist (atomic age etc), and what could kill them. The only thing we know for sure is Cloverfield hates the Manhattan skyline. The one saving point is that everyone dies at the end including the obnoxious filmmaker who's partially eaten by Clover - though she doesn't even finish her meal - I guess it can't stomach him either. I can't understand why it got so many stars except movie buffs/makers like the idea of a movie maker along with his hand-held camera as story teller. <br/><br/>The South Park parody of Cloverfield, the ""Pandemic"" episode, with its giant guinea pigs and flute bands was eminently more entertaining, plus it has a story line with reason, and Randy's wife finally takes away his camera. I wish someone had taken away Hud's camera at the very beginning."

","I checked spoilers to warn readers of this highly marketed garbage, that is if revealing a found footage shaky cam vision all throughout is considered a spoiler. You see, I've always been out for top of the line blockbuster movies that is worth every cent. I don't see film greats such as Spielberg, De Laurentis, George Lucas, James Cameron and Roland Emmerich use found footage crap in their films, and even if they did, they used it moderately to make a point, but not throughout. Super 8 gave us a shaky cam feel but it was so blended well with the entire movie you don't even notice it or get epileptic watching the movie. Now I call that pure genius in film making. So far, we have been bombarded by found footage, shaky cam types since it's conception, and most of these types are truly garbage. Should I say more to smash the likes of these films to oblivion? Sure, I'll give you 2 more examples to ruin your appetite. Imagine the movie ""Godzilla"" (1998) or ""2012"" (2009) by one of the greatest directors of all time Roland Emmerich, shot with found footage, epileptic shaky cam! Now tell me if you will enjoy it like we all did if it weren't. Cloverfield sucks! If the director tried to emulate the greats it would have never been so bad. It's all hype. I hate to see this movie get a higher rating than a 1. For fuck's sake, we want to see a disaster movie with all the special effects and not from a stupid handy cam. Hey shaky cam directors, there's a lot of people who hate your types of films. Your reign of terror must stop. Stop torturing people with shaky cams. Are you in bed with the eye doctors and the shrinks or something?"

","How can anyone even come to liking this movie? I came on here expecting to see something between three and five stars and when i saw that it had a 7.3 i fell out of my chair. This movie has absolutely no plot/ dialogue what so ever. One minute they're at a party then the next their running around in a street from an unknown enemy. What strikes me as most unbelievable is the fact that through all of this terror, someone still finds the need to keep the video playing on their camera... thats ridiculous. The only part of the movie that is worse then that is the end, where the monster thing (whatever it is) allegedly kills everyone, we assume, and then the camera starts playing some film of two people at a carnival sometime before this nonsense took place. Overall cheesy, boring, and extremely predictable. <br/><br/>If you were planning on watching this movie, I recommend you not waste your time on this sorry excuse for a film.

","WTF was that? was what I asked myself as I struggled my way through this so-called film.<br/><br/>The title of the movie, Cloverfield, has absolutely nothing to do with the story in the movie, unless they decided to name the rarely-seen monster such a pretty name.<br/><br/>The story is done as a series of videos shot on a single tape over the course of a night. However, we see scenes of happier times as the main characters are getting ready for a party, messing around the park and town, and generally having fun. Then all hell breaks loose when some thing decides to destroy New York in the Godzilla fashion. Throughout the movie these people run around taping everything with a single hand-held camera. The story covers the early evening, all night long, and the following morning. (Please tell me what camera can film all that time without once having to recharge it's two or four-hour battery.) As the story progresses, in true four-character horror film fashion, they discover that one of their dear friends is missing on the other side of town, opposite of the evil mean and nasty CGI monster. So, with camera in hand causing nausea to the viewer, they run all over town, through the subways, and into the military who, in true horror-film fashion, wants to kill everything in their path, including the meek and bewildered characters.<br/><br/>They finally find their friend impaled through her chest on a long piece metal rob and, gently pulling her off, they ALL run away from the now collapsing building toward safety. And the camera still runs.<br/><br/>The ending is something of a downer and one by one the people all meet their demise. Nothing is ever said as to why the monster appeared or what anyone was doing about it, save lobbing rockets and missiles at it. (Here's a tip: Kill the guy who created the damn thing on his laptop!) As far as the stars, no big names were in this picture. And the one who should receive the most recognition is the hand-held camera that filmed everything all night long, without having to change tapes or sitting through a recharge.<br/><br/>Not worth watching unless you are a film student in need of what not to do, or you just like bad movies. This one should be ranked down there with the movies ""Absolute Zero"" (2005 - TV) (which is so dumb it's insulting), or ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (1959) (which is so dumb it's funny)."

","""Memory-keeping is a function increasingly assigned to the electronic media, whilst a new awareness of the artifice of representation casts a cloud of suspicion over the documentation of the past."" – Jose Van Dijck (Mediated Memories in the Digital Age) <br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" is the last in a long line of post 9/11 monster movies. Reflecting the anxieties of a populace cowering irrationally in the fear of faceless middle eastern terrorists, these films all feature everyday Americans under attack by giant CGI beasts. With their huge monsters and burning cities, this micro-genre closely resembles a burst of similar films released after the atomic bombings of Japan (""Godzilla"" etc) and, to a lesser extent, the nuclear anxieties of early cold war cinema, with their giant radioactive beasts and bugs (""Them!"", ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" etc).<br/><br/>Of these post 9/11 monster movies, only Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" and Frank Darabont's ""The Mist"" have aged well. Spielberg's film may be dishonest in portraying the enemy as technologically advanced Muslims (""Are they terrorists!"" a character yells at one point) embedded in underground sleeper cells and waiting to strike, but its camera work and action set pieces have a balletic grace that few directors can match. And while Darabont's ""The Mist"" handles its CGI sequences ineptly, it's beautifully written and features genuine character interactions.<br/><br/>Great characters and great action sequences are precisely what ""Cloverfield"" lacks. Instead, the film hopes to wow us with documentary realism. Filmed to resemble footage awkwardly captured by consumer video cameras, ""Cloverfield"" pretends to be the ""authentic"" and ""documented"" account of an important historical event (an attack on New York by a giant monster). What's interesting is that, aside from its mediated view (the film is shown solely through one man's perspective), it is also simultaneously re-meditated, the witness filming others who are themselves filming the event (on phones and cameras).<br/><br/>This faux documentary style of cinema isn't new. ""Cannibal Holocaust"", ""The Last Broadcast"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""X-Cops"", ""Open Water"", ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The McPherson Tapes"" all presented themselves as recovered historical footage, each showing attacks on humans by various monsters (witches, cannibals, werewolves, aliens etc) which the eyewitness was fortunate to record due to his possession of a camcorder. Significantly, the cameraman dies at the end of each of these films.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" continues this trend. At one point in the film the cameraman crosses a dangerous bridge and yells that he ""wants others to see what went on here"". It's a throwaway bit of dialogue, but it highlights how humans are increasingly outsourcing themselves to their technical, extended memories. It does not matter if we survive, what matters now is that the ""camera is kept alive"" and that its digitized memory is safely stored. What the characters in ""Cloverfield"" are concerned about is not their own memories of the event, but their ethical responsibility to ""capture"" and ""digitally remember"" the event for future generations.<br/><br/>This mirrors real world trends, in which ordinary events are increasingly treated as history before they even occur. Think of the hordes of people walking around recording mundane events with their cell phones, or the thousands of people who visit sporting events, ceremonies and music performances, eyes affixed to their tiny camcorder or phone screens rather than the event itself. On a more graphic scale, think of the Korean student in the US who went on a shooting rampage at a University. In the middle of the slaughter he stopped suddenly to mail a ""press pack"" to the media, then promptly resumed his mayhem. The priority for these people is no longer to experience the event itself as it is occurring, but the recording of the event for future consumption.<br/><br/>But what people are really doing, with all their technological gizmos, is attempting to prolong the pleasure of the event. They digitise and store their ""special moments"" for some kind of future gratification. The end result is that so many moments are collected, stored and saved for later use, that the user either never gets a chance to revisit the event, misses the event as it occurs in the present, or trivialises the ""special event"" by putting it in a digital data-bank filled with millions of other similar events. It's a form of modern greed, the user frantically hording digital memories.<br/><br/>On a larger level, films like ""Cloverfield"" demonstrate that we are in a culture that is formally nostalgic to an astonishing degree. It is precisely the failure of historical awareness that leads to the rise of nostalgia. Those who can't remember the past are condemned to have it resold to them forever. Everything becomes a ""re-make"", a bland simulation, but one that always seems ""new"" because there is neither the memory nor the historical context/awareness of the original.<br/><br/>And so the characters of ""Cloverfield"" run to their deaths, desperate to save their digital memories for future consumption, historical archival and personal fame. The irony is that what they record has been recorded before, both by cinema and by history.<br/><br/>7/10 – Films like ""Cloverfield"" and ""War of the Worlds"", mark an age where cinema spectacle is dead. They are anti CGI and anti spectacle, downplaying special effects for fleeting glimpses of CGI wizardry and shaky-cam realism. The way out of this trend seems to be ""word cinema"", a reliance on word oriented drama and literary twists and turns, and the upcoming hype of 3d, itself a nostalgic technology of the past.<br/><br/>Worth one viewing- I'd take the 1954 ""Gojira"" or even ""Godzilla vs Mothra"" over this rip off. For a better modern ""giant monster movie"", check out ""The Host"", ""The Mist"" and ""War of the Worlds"". What's amazing is how identical these new big budget movies are to the old classics. For example, there is nothing separating ""Jurassic Park"" from either ""The Beast from 20,000 fathoms"" or ""The Valley of Gwangia"", aside from the replacement of solid-state models with CGI."

The girl with the re-bar threw the (left) shoulder and near her heart and they lift her body and slide the re-bar threw her ... yea, she would have bled out in no time and passed out from the pain yet she is very mobile and the use of her left arm was amazing after suffering that type of injury.<br/><br/>The guy after the heli crash (her pseudo boyfriend) suffers a leg injury that requires a belt to be used as a tourniquet yet he remains extremely mobile and doesn't bleed out before they reach the bridge at the end no way in hell is that possible.<br/><br/>The massive injury suffered by the quiet girl in the subway tunnel wasn't even bleeding when we see her back and she really doesn't seem to be in any real pain or seems to have a life threatening injury by the way the other characters react to it. she says ""how does it look"" , reply ""it looks like it hurts"" but she isn't crying, wheezing, moaning heck she is fine.<br/><br/>There are way to many non-intelligent items in this film to list here and agree with other comments here about how ...<br/><br/>You don't care about the characters they are stupid and not believable. I cared more for the monster I really did. After they bombed it and the guy is recording it from the chopper I was worried until I seen the monster preform that amazing jump up to the chopper and caused it to crash was the first time I was excited in the film ""He's OK!"" wow that was an amazing jump. I thought the chopper was higher but I guess somehow it dropped altitude and the monster got it.<br/><br/>Yea, thank god it was a rental for me. This is the reason why I attend very few movies at the theater each year."

","To see this film at the Cinema was an experience to behold, something I won't forget for a long time. I have since bought the DVD and although my parents disliked the film because of it being ""To short with a crappy ending"", It is without argument that this is definitely a film to be reckoned with and easily one of the most cleverly filmed flicks of recent times.<br/><br/>It's something just a little bit different, so allow me to review what I like about the film.<br/><br/>The cleverly selected and anonymous cast. - This worked perfectly for the film, I did not recognise a single face for the duration, which allowed for serious plot changes and twists because there was no Main Character that couldn't die, because there were no famous actors that needed to see the film through.<br/><br/>The CGI. - Another beautiful part of this film is the scenery which surrounds what is happening, the iconic decapitation of the statue or liberty was an awesome way of setting the tone. My only criticism would be the Monster it'self, looking slightly un-detailed in comparison to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The Idea - 10/10, What a way to attract a crowd, don't tell or explain anything, do some quiet shouting, make the people want to watch the film using curiosity, and it works so much better when you don't have a clue about the film, honestly, I was totally drawn in.<br/><br/>The Ending - Again has had some bad reviews based on this, Personally, I don't think it could have ended better, finally, a film that doesn't end on a good or bad note, just silence."
"jakedog-1","10","3","4","9 June 2008"," An amazing feat in immersion, tension and excitement
","Cloverfield is the film equivalent of a roller-coaster ride, pure thrills. The story begins with a group of twenty somethings in New York celebrating the departing of one of their kind, Rob, who has accepted a job in Japan. Hud, a layabout with feelings for another girl at the party, is given the job of documenting the night on the home video camera. It is through what Hud films, that we see everything that happens throughout the night and as the party progresses we get a good feeling for each individual character and their respective romances and qualms with one another. Then the events take a turn for the worse when the city is rocked by ominous rumblings and subsequent power outages. Suddenly the city is under attack by 'something' and the friends find themselves running for their lives from a gigantic creature (and various smaller ones)that are wreaking havoc.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is an exercise in 'what if' and as this, it works incredibly well. The Handy cam style creates level of immersion i have never felt with another film. The style results in the building of tension and fear, through the fleeting glimpses we see of the monster, a leg and a tail glimpsed only for a second are much more frightening than seeing the monster in all it's CGI glory (which, inevitably, we do.) From the get go Cloverfield grabs you're attention and doesn't let go until the credits roll (though you wish they didn't have to.) Handy Cam style may have it's enemies but here it has never worked better, creating untold levels of realism. A a creative, original feast for the eyes and nerves, this film will leave you buzzing and hungry for more, just DON'T watch it on a small television!!!"
"afamouspetty","3","3","4","8 June 2008"," OK, but not a must see
","After seeing previews I was ready to watch this film.<br/><br/>The beginning clips of the film make it seem very believable with the intro. You actually feel you are watching a home video. Similar to the ""blair witch project"" but not quite as ""raw footage"" as that.<br/><br/>During this time, you get to know the characters briefly and get an overview of who is who. It actually is a little boring.<br/><br/>Then it switches gears, still filming as if watching a home movie, and you are taken to a party scene. This part is very boring and could not hold my interest. I would have rather them moved ahead. It seemed a little unnecessary and really had me ready to move on to another movie.<br/><br/>It then picked up a little when the ""news"" breaks in during the party. Some of the reactions are a little over done, in my opinion. They all leave the party to find out what is going on.<br/><br/>Havoc ensues and everyone is running for cover. Their curiosity gets the best of them and they just have to go out in the danger, debris, and unknown. <br/><br/>The movie begins to pick up at this point. You then want to see what is reeking havoc on NY but they keep you in suspense with just a few little glimpses here and there. It is effective. The movie continues as if it were some one's home video tape which makes it seem a little more believable with the movements that would take place if someone was running or walking with camera. The way the filming was done came across believable and convincing.<br/><br/>However, throughout the movie a few second blurbs flash with images of two of the main characters outlining their friendship. That broke up some of the effectiveness when the blurbs would pop in. Regardless of the reasoning it made the overall watching a video tape less believable and it strayed away from the original filming. There was one point it sort of worked when the characters were ""viewing"" the tape and you were kept occupied with the clips of the friends. But all the other break in's throughout the film sort of spoiled it.<br/><br/>When you finally get to some better information and some more images of the attackers in the movie, it reminds you of what the movie is about. Sadly it just did not deliver as you would expect.<br/><br/>The movie has some good parts, some good story points. The filming was effective for the most part and this overall could have been so much better.<br/><br/>The movie was OK for me, not quite what I expected. It really wasn't a movie I could watch again. Once was enough. I don't really think this is a must watch movie."

","Yes, i agree, the first 20 minutes were very, very...boring and really unnecessary. I'm actually glad i didn't have to see this in the theater, without a remote to fast forward through just to see exactly when the monster would show up. However, after the first 20 or so minutes the fun started to begin. You hear a roar, an earthquake, people running, screaming and WHAMMO!!, the head of the statue of liberty comes hurtling at the guy with the camera at a 100 miles per hour! Whew, at that point I felt so relieved, (even though I've already seen that scene in the trailers) and braced myself for one heck of a monster movie. And let me tell you, I wasn't disappointed. True, the shakiness of the camera was a bit too much, but thats what made it so realistic! Unlike anything I've ever seen before!(I never saw the Blair witch project by the way) Everything was so unexpected and startling! There were some scenes that were truly terrifying. (have you seen the monster folks? its pretty gruesome, but SO AWESOME! and trust me, you get to see the monster plenty of times, even more than you anticipated) Anyway I don't want to spoil the movie for you, so i'll stop there. I'll just cut to the chase. I loved it, it was beyond my expectations and I'm getting ready to see it again....and am really looking forward to the sequel!"

I would not recommend this movie to anybody that suspects that they will get motion sickness. Be forewarned.. I gave it a try because of all the hype but, in the end, it wasn't worth it for me. I have not walked out of a movie in YEARS so, this was a big upset for me.<br/><br/>The special effects in the film were done great though but, I think that the movie would have received a better response if it was done with a normal movie production camera.

","It had some good camera shots, and Hunt was funny. That was about all that was good about it.<br/><br/>The movie was full of clichés and plot holes.<br/><br/>1)Wow they must have the worlds best camera that has unlimited battery life. 2)The little things were zergling rip offs, and somehow 4 tired 20+ yr olds are able to fend off a group of them in a completely dark tunnel? Are you kidding me? They must be the weakest monsters ever. Not to mention every single person gets knocked over and jumped on, but somehow only one person manages to get bitten. 3)The military presence was unrealistic. If a giant monster attacked New York it would be nothing but non stop barrages from tanks, jets, bombers, everything constantly over and over. There would be soooo many more troops. 4)Would 99% of ppl go back into the heart of a city under a monster attack? I think not. 5)The girl had a metal pole nailing her down to the floor through her shoulder for multiple hours and not only doesn't die from blood loss, but after they forcefully rip her off the pole she is than able walk down 50+flights of stairs and run though streets apparently not hurt anymore. 6)The fact that no one said ""Zomg its a giant monster"" on the news blew my mind 7)The monster was fleshy and boney and it made no sense why it could take all those blasts. No thick hide, armor look, scales etc. 8)When they are flying away in the helicopter the pilot is so stupid that instead of flying away from the monster he decides to fly perpendicular to it as its being bombed. 9)The monster after getting blown to crap and being hurt then decides to jump hundreds of feet high and miles in distance at a helicopter and bite it for no apparent reason. Even though in every other shot it is slow and can't defend itself from aerial attacks. 10)Of course the 3 kids manage to survive a helicopter crash from hundreds of feet in the air, almost entirely UNARMED, yet the military pilots die. 11)They cut out 20mins of the movie explaining what the monster is and what the title means. 12) And my personal favorite, a Monster thats the size of skyscrapers somehow manages to sneak up on someone. <br/><br/>How is that even possible?<br/><br/>Not to mention in the final shot it somehow shrunk in size.<br/><br/>Go see the Host.

"moviesleuth2","8","12","25","18 January 2008"," Near brilliant
","Man, what a rush! ""Cloverfield"" is, in short, a wild ride.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the story at all because there isn't much more to the story than everyone knows. It's not that kind of a movie.<br/><br/>What it is, however, is near brilliant. Not everything works (almost everything does though), but all in all, it's well worth the admission price.<br/><br/>The decision to make it using a hand held camera was genius. It really puts you into the middle of the chaos, and makes the need for richly-developed characters not needed. Plus it intensifies everything by about 100 times. Some will complain that this makes the film have a dizzying effect, but except in a few spots, that's not really an issue.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is the dialogue and the acting. For the most part, particularly in the beginning, the film feels almost unscripted. The people say things and talk almost exactly like real people do, and the actors supplement that quality by acting like real people, and not like movie characters. Again, this heightens the movie's immediacy and realism, and avoids making this movie having an intelligence level of zero.<br/><br/>In any review of this movie, there is going to be some mention of 9/11. This is as unavoidable as it is necessary to discuss. In a few spots, it brings back unsettling memories of that tragedy. I can't fault the filmmakers for this because since the event was so traumatic, it was probably unavoidable. Or maybe it was intentional. If so, it works.<br/><br/>This is a summer action movie without a doubt. Why the producers decided to release this in January is quite obvious. This time of year is a bridge between Oscar-movies and movies that would cost less to flop than to shelve. Since this is a radically new approach (one that has never been tried with a big-budget action movie-at least for the whole film), the producers probably didn't want their whole summer resting on the shoulders of something they weren't confident would work. Releasing ""Cloverfield"" at this time would cover two bases: if it was a huge, unexpected success, it could be up for some Oscars (as it looks now, that is highly unlikely except for the awards that typically go to action movies, since the Golden Globes are typically good indicators of the Oscar nominees). However, if the movie flopped, it would disappear along with the rest of the post-Oscar trash without so much as a blip on the radar screen.<br/><br/>I really hope this movie does well. Given how stingy mainstream movie producers are with new ideas, they probably won't try this approach unless it makes big (and I mean BIG) bucks. That would be a shame, because when used appropriately, the use of a hand-held camera can be very effective. However, it is a little early for the post-Oscar garbage (that usually comes in February), so there is a definite threat that it might get lost in the Oscar racing movies. Should this happen, mainstream movie producers would probably assume that this movie was rotten as a whole, thus ending the careers of the approach as well as the actors (which would be horrible, since all are great, especially Michael Stahl-David, who is excellent). Only time will tell what the future holds for this kind of movie."
"tomq5p","7","12","25","18 January 2008"," Decent but nothing to write home about
","I had extremely high expectations for this movie (as I'm sure many other fans did). They were not met, but that doesn't mean that the movie was a complete flop. I jumped in my seat many times and I appreciated the unique way the movie was filmed. <br/><br/>The movie succeeded at creating a realistic feel. The acting was better than the average movie and the CGI wasn't too bad either. <br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, the monster looks kind of weird. Some people will like it, others will not. I am on the fence. It was unlike anything I've seen before, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. One thing I am sure of is the fact that I wish I saw more of it (as well as the destruction that it left behind). <br/><br/>I think, in this case, a bigger budget would have yielded a more satisfying result. I am also not too sure that the hand-held camera approach added a whole lot. The way the wide angle shots were set up was pretty clever though. <br/><br/>One thing that really bothered me was the product placement. There is one shot in particular when the camera hovers over some candy for no reason whatsoever. There were embedded ads for Nokia, Dunkin' Donuts, Juicy Fruit, Mountain Dew, and others. Call me old-school, but, like David Lynch, I don't think that product placement has any place in true cinema. I expected better from Cloverfield. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie was on par with Godzilla. Godzilla had better CGI and way cooler shots of the monster but a weak plot and pretty bad acting. It just depends what you value. Since I am a sucker for cool action sequences and good special effects, I would probably prefer watching Godzilla. At least I wouldn't have a headache when it was over. <br/><br/>Speaking of the ending, I liked it. I have heard a lot of complaints, but I think it was appropriate and well done.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"truthseekers","5","10","20","31 January 2008"," I was excited but after watching it not any more
","Its an average disaster movie with ""Godzilla Final Wars"" like special effects. Considering the hype, the fact that we have to suffer hand held camera-work which makes our moments of view of the creature, rather frustrating I felt after watching that I was being cheated of experience. Really the filmmakers got away with not having to do so much because of the hand held effect. If they had been making a full cinematic movie they would have perhaps screwed it up because it would have been harder to pull off and look good so I am sorry I just see this hand held stuff as a way to skimp out of good filmwork. For this reason I feel I was cheated. Also the people in the Uk didn't get a simultaneous release date when the movie was advertised as 18.1.08 and no name.. so the whole appeal became a joke when people in the UK never got to see it on that date. Thanks Hollywood for screwing the UK again and making the movie an instant pirates dream. Godzilla Final Wars wipes the floor with this movie anyday."
"chadthornburg","3","10","20","21 January 2008"," Exciting, yet disappointing
","Like many who seen the trailer preceding Transformers, I went home and IMDb'ed it right away. It was, and still is, the best trailer I have ever seen - but maybe that's not a good thing. Good for Paramount, yes, because it got many people excited to see the movie, myself included. Not good for the audience, because I think most people will be disappointed. You don't have to follow all the online viral games to know that this is a monster movie.<br/><br/>That's the problem - it isn't. Everybody going into this movie expected to see a monster flick. Cloverfield is not a monster movie. For the entire 74 minutes of this movie, you see a monster on camera for what I would have to estimate is a total of three minutes. So what makes up the rest of the movie? Beginning: The beginning of the movie is awful. I knew there was a party scene, I knew it was about Rob moving to Japan. I expected 5 minutes of this, at the most. It ended up being 20 excruciating minutes, which for a 74 minute film is already way too much. After the first few uncomfortable moments, I just wanted the explosion to happen. As the movie draws on and on, that anxiety turns into anger .. what the heck is going on here? I didn't think I would be watching 20 minutes of the world's most boring party with the world's most boring party-goers and some ""girl-I-slept-with"" story that no audience would care about. I want some action, I want thrills, I want excitement - get on with it already. I was worried about being late to this movie, I guess I should have finished my dinner - it would have been doing me a favor not being forced to sit through that.<br/><br/>Middle: The middle of the movie is the only thing Cloverfield has going for it. From post-party to pre-ending, there is chaos. There are definitely some exciting moments, particularly when the little monsters attack in the subway, and what happens to the girl after that. Yes, I would have to admit, I was on the edge of my seat, wanting to know what was happening next. Unfortunately, after the end of the movie and thinking back on what the entire movie encompasses, I think it was a false suspense. 90% of this movie is people running around. The rest is an absolutely horrible love story. I still wanted to see what was going to happen next though - I expected a huge finish. After all, this is a monster movie right? Nope :( End: And in the end, it all comes tumbling down, almost literally. There is no end. Like some other user on here mentioned, it was as if somebody turned off the movie at the best moment. Imagine watching a movie where the guy has to defuse the bomb to save the city and right as he's deciding which wire to cut, the movie ends. That's what Cloverfield's ending is like. You just get so upset at it. There is no resolution.<br/><br/>If you want a monster movie, don't see Cloverfield. What you will get is people running around, shaky cameras (which are OK if it fits the scene) that are shaking/angled when first-graders would handle them better, and you get possibly the worst love story ever told. If the movie was going for realism, it should go all-out, not have a 100 pound girl impaled by concrete rebar in the chest suddenly awake from near-death and somehow run like Marion Jones. Or people surviving helicopter crashes like it's nothing, while the pilots die? If you enjoy seeing people run around, not about story lines or monsters at all - then you might like this movie. Show up 20 minutes late.<br/><br/>I wanted Cloverfield to be good, I really did. But the one-word title should be changed from ""Cloverfield"" to ""Disappointment."""
"AttorneyAtLawl","10","10","20","20 January 2008"," AMAZING. But people miss the point...
","As I said, from what I can tell, most of the people that didn't like the movie were missing the point of the movie.<br/><br/>1. ""The camera was shaky"". YES. THE CAMERA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SHAKY. The movie is being filmed from the point of an ACTUAL PERSON who is stuck in the attack. You have to be foolish to think that anyone in the middle of a giant monster attack can manage to hold a camera straight and not shake it while running. Maybe some people are prone to motion sickness - fine, but that is no reason to give the movie a bad rating. Your own personal medical problems are not the fault of the producer.<br/><br/>2. ""The camera's battery lasted too long."" The thing people seem to miss is the fact that the camera wasn't on for the full 7-8 hours. The footage shown was the raw footage recorded by Hud. When something was cut out, the camera was off. This means the camera was only on for as long as the movie - about an hour and a half, which is plenty in range of a typical camera battery.<br/><br/>3. ""The camera is too powerful/has special features."" Yes, the camera is high quality. Yes, the sound is good. Yes, it has strong lights and night vision. Yes, it can survive being dropped. People, they DO make very high quality cameras - who's to say this camera wasn't one of them? Rob is obviously upper-class money wise, so he may have had a very expensive camera.<br/><br/>Anyway, now that thats out of the way... The movie itself was really terrific. I was worried about it, honestly - I thought it might be bad, but I gave it a shot anyway, and I've gotta say - WOW. I was really blown away by this movie. I like that there were no super-famous actors, because they were all REALLY AWESOME at acting. The script was terrific and 100% believable. The camera was only shaking where it was appropriate, such as when Hud is running or something explodes, etc. I truly felt like I was there during all the events - it felt extremely realistic and I loved it. They were aiming for that feel and they hit it spot on.<br/><br/>I will say, though, that if you are prone to motion sickness, do not see the movie. And if you do see the movie anyway, please don't rate it down because you, knowing the movie will make you sick, made you sick."

It was jam-packed full of action (just what you want in a monster movie) and you could really connect with the characters.<br/><br/>But then it ended.. just like that, no explanation given about anything.. where did it come from? what was it? what happened to it? given that the movie was only 80 Min's long its not like there wasn't enough time to fill in some blanks.. perhaps in the way of a news item after the handy-cam work had ceased..<br/><br/>In a word, i think the way i feel about this movie is...

The whole thing is shot to look like an amateur video (the film's only real success), so 50% of the movie is shots of walls, floors, and blur. Tries to rip off Godzilla and Alien with nothing new.

I found myself relieved whenever the camera fell to the ground and gave the same view for a few seconds. It felt like I had on the wrong glasses - I was constantly trying to bring the scenes into focus and the continual motion, coupled with the random focus and quick glimpses of things I wanted to see clearly, made me feel stressed, strained and then annoyed.<br/><br/>Add to that the ending, which leaves so many issues dangling, and, overall, I found it very unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Despite that I still gave it a 6.

"rob55-2","4","7","13","25 January 2008"," Another movie that doesn't deserve the rating it has.
","I read many of the user comments before deciding to chime in myself instead of just rating the movie. For starters, I want to clarify something. Many comments criticize the seemingly endless battery life of the camcorder. Having done a fair amount of videography (both for personal use and professionally), I can tell you that getting 73 minutes out of a camcorder battery (particularly a high capacity battery) is not a stretch. Comments have mentioned the ""7 hour"" battery life of the camcorder but failed to consider the actual amount of footage shot (again, 73 minutes worth). It's not like the camera ran continuously for 7 or so hours and then someone ran home, edited it down in Final Cut and then returned to Central Park to die in a nuclear explosion. One of my pro-sumer cameras can easily do 90 minutes with a single, fully charged, high capacity battery. And, with the appropriate length, all the footage can fit on one tape. If anything, the only stretch is how durable the camera seems to be (but again, not impossible). With all that aside, here's my review.<br/><br/>Whoever said this wasn't done before obviously hasn't seen or heard of the Blair Witch Project. It's the same basic concept except the shooter here wasn't shooting a student film. Oh, by the way, another user also commented about how BWP bombed. Well, $140,530,000 is not too shabby for a movie that cost extremely little to make. Anyway, getting back to the subject, Cloverfield manages to pull off the whole ""handheld cam"" thing better than Blair Witch did. It's unfortunate, however, because the shaky camera actually obscures some of the nice CGI work. The opening 15-20 minutes was another big waste. It seemed like they only came up with 60 pages of script (if you can call this movie scripted) and needed to fill in some time to actually try to get close to being feature length. It reminded me of the opening of Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" with the drawn out conversation between the characters in the car in the beginning of the movie. Once the story gets moving, things improved somewhat. As others have mentioned, it was reminiscent of some of the 9/11 footage we saw with people running from the towers and the dust cloud when they came down. That, to me, helped build up some tension. There are some inconsistencies, not the least of which are the subway attack on our 4 characters by the smaller creatures where only one person gets bitten or infected. The rescued girlfriend's amazing recovery to the point of being able to run almost on her own is another example and the whole surviving the helicopter crash virtually unscathed comes immediately to mind as well. It's not like I wasn't expecting to suspend reality (this is a monster movie after all), but let's not push the envelope. The acting was generally what I expected from a bunch of people acting like they are in a critical, life-or-death struggle. No big-name actors made the whole ""these are everyday ordinary people"" situation more believable. Ultimately, some background details, perhaps from the military perspective, would have been nice. Even some after-the-fact details to explain what happened to the creature after the nuclear blast. Did it move on to New Jersey or head out to the Hamptons for some R&R after laying waste to NYC.<br/><br/>All said, this movie will not last very long at the box office once word of mouth gets around as to how disappointing it is. Most will not have a good time with the shaky-cam footage and will be upset about the short run time as well. I wouldn't go so far as to say the movie was terrible or awful, but in my opinion, it falls way short of living up to the hype. I think a second viewing at home once the DVD comes out will be in order to see if the film is more tolerable on the small screen."

","I found this movie very boring and unappealing, but everyone is raving about how amazing this film is. I have to say I usually find IMDb quite accurate, usually I agree with ratings, but as it stands right now the movie is at an 8.1... 8.1!?!?!? This suggests it is one of the best films of all time (by IMDb standard), which I feel is absolutely untrue. By these ratings this film is better than Scarface, Kill Bill vol. 2, Snatch, Trainspotting, and Patton just to name a few. I can't help but find that absurder.<br/><br/>Anyways, enough ranting, on to the film...<br/><br/>The lack of a narrative really hinders the experience of this film. There is never a clear distinction about what is going on; things just randomly happen, the characters get scared, they move on. Nothing seems to have an effect, they cower for a few seconds (or feel depressed) then they are over it and moving on. Any scenes which could have been used to convey serious emotion happen so quickly you never have a chance to really feel what the characters are feeling. As well the action is so quick you never really know whats going on, and like a teenagers first time having sex its over before you know it. The shaky camera also adds to the lack of intensity, often you just see blurs or quick glimpses of the action then its over. You are often left asking ""what just happened?"" A huge problem I have is that so many things happened in such a short period of time with no explanation as to why they happened. You don't know why that one girl blows up after being bit (I disliked the characters so much I can't even remember their names lol), you don't even know if they really kill the monster in the end! I need character development, I need a plot with originality (not another lame love story), I need surprises (this movie had none, ie. in the tunnel when they turn the night vision on...you know what I'm talking about...if you didn't see that coming you shouldn't watch movies). I simply can not recommend this film, in fact I found it boring and lacking in engaging qualities. This movie is below average at best: 4/10."

","Before i continue i must emphasize that the every-man's perspective was very refreshing, however the point of view quite literally and physically made me sick, i was dizzy, and nauseated withing 15 min. so I spent more than half of the rest of the movie staring @ the floor. <br/><br/>Also the movie revealed nothing, which, though i do understand was part of the perspective, irritated me immensely. You never find out what the monster actually is, where it came from or it's purpose, one can make assumptions, but the point of a movie is to tell a story, not leave the story up to the audience. I think a vast improvement would have been to have an actual opening and closing to the story, perhaps a government official giving a brief on what's expected now. <br/><br/>This movie just doesn't seem to be able to stand on its own for me, so i would be willing to see a companion piece that reveals more, but this movie itself was not my cup of tea."

","(((Parts might contain Spoilers)))<br/><br/>I will be honest, I didn't really want to see this movie in the first place...... but my wife and some of her family did, so I went along.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so of the movie were so slow, it was hard to sit still. Then it picks up for a little bit when the Monster attacks. Then it just ends, and you don't know what ever happened.<br/><br/>My problem is that, I hated the shaky camera gimmick!!! Granted, it did make me a little dizzy.... but more than that, I just didn't like the way it worked in this movie. You did kind of feel like you were really there,.. but I would have traded that for the chance to actually see what was going on, or actually see the Monster. Another problem for me was that there was no character development. I really didn't know any more about the characters at the end of the movie than I did at the beginning,... and as a result..... didn't really care about what happened to them. ALSO.... the guy ""filming"" all of this, and doing a lot of talking.... think his name was Chud. He was the most annoying character ever. And hearing him talk constantly through the whole movie was painful!!! After all his screaming and stupidity, the best part of the movie was him finally dieing.<br/><br/>The characters were bland and boring; the story was very weak... and not much to it; the Monster and the little creatures from it, were lame and fake looking... from what little you see clearly;..... The only good part was the effects of the destruction of NYC.<br/><br/>We went to a late Sunday night showing, so there were only maybe 40 people there. By halfway through, I had counted about 9 people who got up and left. Before it was over, I would say maybe another 4 or five left. Which I have never seen that many people leave one movie. After it ""ends"", there was nothing but silence. Finally you could hear people complaining, and a couple boo's. Although there were a few who liked it.<br/><br/>It is up to you, if you want to go see it. But if you must, try to wait for DVD."

","The 'Blair Witch' effect may have been popular about 10 years ago, but I really thought Hollywood had grown out of it and realised that if people wanted to see the camera moving around as if held by a drunken idiot one would only have to look as far as Uncle Jimmy's Christmas video, which would undoubtedly have been more entertaining than this sack of crap. The plot - non existent, the story - a linear traipse through a New York battered by some creature that has materialised from God knows where... and I doubt you'll really care anyway. The main characters are a bunch of drunken party kids who you care even less about, one of whom seems to think that keeping the video camera going and waving it around as much as possible is more than his life's worth, literally. Half way through I was praying for him to die if only so that someone else could pick up the camera, and hopefully do a better job. But no, they were all equally bad - a three year old could have done better.<br/><br/>The one saving grace in this whole sewer of a film was the remarkable technology brought by Sony's camera division. They've managed to create the most indestructible camera I've ever seen! From helicopter crashes to the military mass-flattening New York, this little baby just shrugs it all off. Congrats Sony, I think you have a winner there!"

","I hated Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Maybe I've watched too many excellent films, but this film has a great concept, but poorly executed. I didn't care about the characters, none of them were even likable. At the party these guys fall out over a girl sleeping with this guy. Somehow this storyline smears the rest of the film like a dirty rag. I guess this is more important than helping the citizens leaving the city with their lives.<br/><br/>Out of all the people in the city we follow a bunch of random guys who have their party ruined by various explosions in the city. Then we learn the city is under attack. What is special about the guys we're following? They are just ordinary twenty-somethings getting drunk and talking about who had sex with who. Would picturing it from the view of a hot dog salesman be any worse? I just didn't care about the characters or their Cannibal Holocaust-inspired amateur movies. Why not follow a small family fighting for survival? Why do we need to care about some heartbroken guy? One of the things which is both good and bad is that there is very little focus on the monster. And by that I mean, you will only see the monster once or twice in full view, the rest is obscured by the huge skyscrapers of the city. I like the fact the monster is barely seen. But they could have also added some suggestions as to where the monster came from. Space? Under the ocean? All we know it as is a monster. No more elaboration or subject to think about.<br/><br/>The movie really is no more intelligent than Godzilla. Cloverfield yearns to be something new and exciting, and I was disappointed with the full package.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a cross between World Trade Center and Blair Witch. But it is an instantly forgettable movie which proves once again that Hollywood and hype will bring in money."

Cloverfield is nothing more than a poor Godzilla knockoff, minus the storyline, character development, background and conclusion. The first 30 minutes of the movie depicts a teenage loft party which serves little purpose other than filling time in the movie. The shaky camera work in the movie was enough to make audience viewers walk out at the screening I was at. Poor dialog, cliché riddled, this movie will likely get ripped apart by the critics.

","For most of us who enjoyed this movie it was due to the fact that we spent pretty much every night after work,school,etc. hypnotized by the hundreds of videos/images being fired at us by the brilliant marketing tactics performed by JJ and his team. A way to spend little money, and at the same time bring us something fresh.<br/><br/>****WARNING SPOILERS**** Now after keeping up with: Tidowave, Jamie&Teddy,Slusho,and the story behind Tagruato. I can say I was a tad bit disappointed. With all these videos and sites, I fell in love with the big story. How a questionable corporation which was associated with Slusho(with a possible addictive ingredient). With a story of a couple(Jamie and Teddy) in which Teddy the boyfriend goes off to Japan to stop this Tagruato corporation, and later on tries to save the day with his package to a hard headed girlfriend, to warn her of a ""thing""(monster) the corporation found. And then to find out Rob has taken a vice president position in the advertising section with Slusho! This story seemed like a dream come true! So all threw the movie I was hoping for some of this to emerge in front of our eyes, the closest we got was seeing Jamie drunk on the couch.<br/><br/>So my only complaint was that, this movie had one of the most creative stories ever, but we only got to catch the monster.And for toughs who never followed the sites, they were left with confusion.<br/><br/>But the reason I gave the movie an Eight out of Ten was due to the fact that it gave us a frightful new monster, and one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>Thank you to everyone who was involved with this movie."

","I get the camera motion and length of the movie. I get the supposedly hyper ""realism"" that they were going for. That doesn't change the fact that this is a gawd awful film. A bad movie with no premise, plot, script, characters, or salvage quality; except the monsters near the end. But by then it's just too late. You'd be annoyed by the forcefully lame camera takes; if not lit sickened. Unrealistic and senseless people that you actually wish were dead 5 min into their appearance. Terrible decision making that even a 5 five old would put to shame. The ""acting"" was a joke. In fact, the monsters are the only reason to not give it a written negative or zero rating; ie, getting it's sole star rating. The whole movie kinda works better like a comedy; if you're willing to tear it apart while watching it with your friends. The only surprisingly and frightful moments were the odd fact that the battery never died out. I kept on wondering; when are they just going to die? Plz gawd, make your heavenly monsters wipe them out of the face of the earth already! These people actually deserve to die. And I was relieved it ended sooner that I expected. This would normally be a bad thing with other movies, even the not so good ones. But in this case; it was gawd sent! Like the Blair Witch Project; which BTW is a masterpiece in comparison of this piece of excrement. This movie, with a lot of tweaking, might have worked in a 2nd rate festival. Not so much for general release. So in conclusion; just watch it if you're a masochist, or for a chuckle on TV; and don't even bothered rented it. You've felt like if you just wasted good money on this silly thing. And since it's so upsetting; I just wanted to warn common folks about the concealment and dangerous deceit this movie poses. It's beyond me why would someone even remotely fathom this is an even mediocre; let alone, a good motion picture... (Word of mouth withstanding, sadly):"
"bloodweiser1","2","6","11","17 July 2009"," Dross... complete dross.
","Where to start? Although Cloverfield has a high rating here on IMDb, I honestly believe it to be one of the worst movies I have recently viewed. No. Check that. It's one of the worst movies I have EVER viewed.<br/><br/>I really cannot for the life of me understand how anyone can rate this movie highly - it has NO redeeming qualities. To begin with, the first 20 or so minutes are just pure tedium. My guess is that they were put there to ""flesh out"" the characters, but apart from being mind-numbingly boring, all they succeed in doing is to irritate. By the time the monster appeared, I really couldn't have cared less about the people in this movie. Sure, there are always those people who go down into the cellar when you just know there's a monster there. There has to be - without the characters doing dumb things there would be no movie. But the characters in this movie? I would have shoved them down the cellar steps myself. They're so dumb, so annoying, so damn pointless. In fact, if I were a monster in Manhattan, I would have specifically targeted these guys and squashed them or eaten them myself. Just to save the rest of the human race from having to share oxygen with them.<br/><br/>And then the guts of the movie - the ""monster section"". There was nothing. No story to speak of, no monster to speak of (we see very little of it), no great finale, no real gore, no logic, nothing but a bunch of people running around, screaming on a jerky video camera. Sure, leave me something for my imagination but at the same time, at least give me SOMETHING to work with. Cloverfield is just empty. I feel like I got the husk of a movie, something with no substance - a chocolate wrapper without ever tasting the chocolate.<br/><br/>There are those who will say that this movie has ""depth"". There are those who will say it is ""realistic"". There are those who will say that it stands out as ""unique"". Yeah? On which planet? Here on Planet Earth, all I saw was an incredibly dull and poorly made rehash of a Godzilla movie. I am utterly amazed that this dross pulls in more than a 7 rating. Not only that, but reading through some of the positive reviews here, I can't help wondering whether I actually went and viewed the same movie. Perhaps I just dreamt that I saw an incredibly bad movie called ""Cloverfield""? Perhaps I haven't seen the real ""Cloverfield"" that others seem to be raving about. That's really the only explanation I can come up with when looking at the discrepancies between my opinion of this trash and some of the views of the people who rave that it's a decent movie. Or maybe a lot of people see an America scarred by 911 and believe that a disaster movie where New York gets trashed is some sort of Holy Grail that can only be venerated? I honestly can't see any other reason for giving Cloverfield a second glance.<br/><br/>Believe me: don't be fooled. Cloverfield is NOT a good movie. It's terrible. I could go on and on about what makes it bad, but analysing every scene would take ages and this movie really doesn't deserve any more of my time than I've already given it."
"dbborroughs","6","6","11","21 January 2008"," Great monster, the rest I'm not too sure about
","Supposed found footage of a civilian's eye view of a monster invasion of New York. Beginning at a party the action then shifts as something is seen and felt invading New York. When a desperate message is received from a friend trapped in her building several friends head off to rescue her...<br/><br/>I'm of mixed emotions. Certainly when the film gets things right its gangbusters and some of the best film making of its type. When it doesn't work its downright tedious.<br/><br/>What doesn't work for me (aside from a bent sense of New York) boils down to two things. First the twenty minute or so set up is way way way too long. Especially when you consider that the film sans end credits is about 70 minutes. the party sequence goes on and on and on and had I not been waiting for monsters I probably would have bailed. Hud, our cameraman, is a bit of an idiot and I hate that we are trapped with him for most of the film. The other problem for me is that the camera is constantly recording. Hud insists on recording everything at the party and then once things start to happen he constantly has the camera rolling. To be certain if he didn't we'd miss things but I doubt the batteries on the camera would last that long and I get real tired of him filming walking upstairs or down a street with nothing happening except him babbling. Events toward the end, that probably should have not been filmed because the camera would have been dropped, are also seen. (The hand held nature of the film is annoying but its the central conceit of the film so you have to go with it.) I could also go into the deus ex machina sequences (the electronics store looting) that are there simply to move the plot along, but I won't. I kept thinking that had they filmed this with out the conceit of the camera this would have been a better movie.I know that the POV allowed for a cheaper film, but at the same time I wanted to see more. I think perhaps I would have like how it was filmed better had I connected with someone in the film. I really didn't connect to anyone, I don't think we really saw anyone long enough to connect. It is at times like watching someone's wedding home video or home movie. You can see that these are real people but at the same time you're left wondering who are these people. I don't think we're ever really given enough to really care about anyone.<br/><br/>What the film gets right is the panic of the attack. The beasties, completely unexplained, are terrifying because no one knows whats going on. The fact that the film takes place over six hours keeps up the tension of the unknown. the attacks themselves are also really well done because we see only just enough to scare us. The monster stuff is great and probably some of the best giant monster stuff put on film, certainly its better than the American Godzilla which shares a couple of locations. There is a tension that is created that is rare in movies of this sort and when the film is firing on all cylinders the film is very tense and scary. This is the bread and butter of the film, this is the reason the film exists and its very well done.<br/><br/>How do I rate the film over all? I don't know. There is much to love and much to dislike. I know why it is and how it is. I just wish it was better. Is it worth seeing? yes at some point. I know I'll probably get the DVD and watch the monster stuff again. I doubt I will ever really watch the early party sequences. If pushed I'd say 6 out of 10. Some better parts than that some worse. Worth a bargain matinée, but too short (and too uneven) for a full priced admission."

Why they chose to go with a group of models instead of legitimate actors is beyond me. I honestly can't believe anyone with an IQ over 10 would act like that. Apparently, this movie would have you believe that Manhattan consists solely of supermodels with giant hearts and superhuman strength, all of whom are immune to pain and talk in scripted comments.<br/><br/>The actors and dialogue are scarier than the monster itself.

I saw it at a second-run/Dollar cinema (paid $1.75) and still felt ripped off.<br/><br/>The sad part about this film is that if it had been made like a regular film and not some half-assed pseudo documentary, maybe you would have had an OK film. The idea of a Godzilla-type monster attack as told from the viewpoint of ordinary people, rather than from people (scientists, reporters, military, etc.) on the inside was an interesting idea. However, the shaky camera was painful to watch and took away from knowing what was going on in the movie. <br/><br/>As it is, this should have been a bonus disc for a Godzilla DVD. My advise would be to run away from this film like you were running from Godzilla, Mothra, or anything else like that."

","A monster attacks New York City. Years ago it would have seemed passé to have an unknown entity attack the greatest city on Earth. Now, after 9/11, it's not only passé, it's insulting to the intelligence of the audience.<br/><br/>Cloverfield takes this tried-and-true formula and has put a new spin on it, putting the action and reaction of the characters in a hand-held camera held by Hud. Hud, the comic relief of the film, is probably the only redeeming character in the entire movie, as his lines are so stuttering and nonsensical - who, after all, would be able to say something witty in the middle of escaping a fifty-story monster? - that he adds a sense of realism in his comedy. The chemistry between the two main characters, Rob and Beth, does seem genuine, but only in that ""doomed affair"" sort of way. Anyone who has seen this type of movie before will know they're screwed after about ten minutes into the film, when she shows up at Rob's going away party with -gasp!- another guy.<br/><br/>During the party scene of the film, I was getting the vague suspicion that this was a convenient way to suck up time on the film reel. However, I was still holding out that the attack on New York would cause the movie to jump start and live up to the considerable buzz and hype which had surrounded it.<br/><br/>Not so. The attack on New York is standard, but I should have known better. New York has been blown up so many times in cinema that it's a wonder anyone bothers to watch movies like this anymore. The hype surrounding aspects of the movie - ""the reactions of the people in the party are like people responding to September 11th!"" - are inaccurate. If someone told me a giant monster was attacking Manhattan, I'd tell them that I had read their pamphlet once in a Chevron bathroom. The only reactions that truly mirror 9/11 are those found in another film, United 93. I don't have to go into the plot of that film because we've already lived it.<br/><br/>Monster movies, to me, don't pack the punch that they used to because the real world has become so much more terrifying. By the time we see the monster in his full form, at the climax of the film, I was hoping that Godzilla would make a cameo and save the day. That's a monster I would gladly pay money to see.<br/><br/>I do give the movie some points for its strict adherence to the digital camera. The overarching premise of a monster attack, though, doesn't resonate. It's as if the director was so keen on trying out his new movie trick he didn't care what god-awful plot he slapped it on. Do yourself a favor: if you want to scare yourself and get a gut-wrenching, you-are-there sense of realism, rent United 93. If that hits a little too close to home (and there's certainly no shame if it does), rent War of the Worlds. True, it's also a monster movie in this Brave New World of ours, but hey, at least it's Spielberg's take on H.G. Wells."

","Background: Though it was a successful online/social networking campaign for the mysterious Cloverfield (named after an L.A. freeway exit), the secret came out early enough that it's simply a monster movie. Directed by Matt Reeves (writer of TV's ""Felicity"" and Under Siege 2: Dark Territory) and written by Drew Goddard (TV's ""Lost"" & ""Alias""), Cloverfield stars a diverse bunch of good-looking young people who you've never seen before. The gimmick is that the whole film is supposed to be confidential government footage recovered from a camcorder recovered at the area ""formerly known as Central Park."" Ooooh...<br/><br/>Synopsis: The movie has no music, starting from the beginning. Seriously, it's ""government property,"" with a confidential stamp and all kinds of ""official"" A/V garble. Anyway, we meet Rob and Beth, hot best friends who have recently become a couple (they had a one night stand?). Rob, all of maybe 22 years old, is the Vice President (why?) of some unnamed company that is relocating him to Japan. Footage of Rob and Beth on their dreamy date is cut off by a live recording of Rob's going away party three weeks later, which is where the story starts. Beth shows up with ""Travis,"" Rob is crushed, Beth storms off, blah blah blah. After watching what feels like about 20 minutes of MTV's ""Real World,"" a rumble shakes through Manhattan, followed by explosions and, shortly, the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling through the streets. Our narrator and videographer is Rob's friend Hud, the kind of idiot sidekick that would be ridiculous (and strong) enough to hold a camera up in front of his face for 7 hours - all while dodging monsters, little monsters, bullets, mortar fire, collapsing buildings, and a helicopter crash. Anyway, we're with Hud, Rob, Rob's brother's girlfriend, and Rob's friend's friend, who Hud has a major crush on. While the ENTIRE population of Manhattan evacuates over the Brooklyn Bridge, our foursome heads to Midtown to heroically rescue Beth. Here and there tragedy strikes, and more than once we see the plodding monster stomp through the streets, impervious to all military weaponry. By the end, our lovers have reunited in Central Park, which is of course where the camcorder was recovered...ooooh...<br/><br/>I Loved: + Some of the visual effects - buildings leaning against each other, explosion from the rooftop, monster shots.<br/><br/>I Liked: + That some significant plot pieces were unresolved (where did the monster come from, what happened afterwards, etc.). + The ending, in a way. A little cheesy, but ultimately satisfying.<br/><br/>I Disliked: - The predictability of the Brooklyn Bridge and post-monster-bite scenes. - When the video would obnoxiously cut back to Beth and Rob's happy date.<br/><br/>I Hated: - The cringe-inducing acting. Really bad. Really. Bad. - Not being able to suspend my disbelief about some things (the little monsters would have hunted them through the city, no?), while totally accepting other things (a monster existing). - Hud's unceasing sense of humor.<br/><br/>Grade: Writing - 7 Acting - 5 Production - 10 Emotional Impact - 8 Music - 5 Significance - 3<br/><br/>Total: 38/50= 76% = C<br/><br/>Last Word: Cloverfield is a movie with an identity crisis - bad enough to doom it, but unbearable when combined with terrible acting. It's easy enough to say it's Blair Witch meets Godzilla meets Jurassic Park meets 9/11 meets King Kong meets Alien. But that's not what I mean. What I mean is Cloverfield doesn't know what it wants to be. You can't have have some realistic elements (panic in Manhattan, accurate geography, real time, human weakness) and some ridiculous elements (ability to hold a working camera that long, nobody in the subway stations, functioning electricity, no cars on the subway line, etc.). Either go way over the top and make it funny, or take a subtle, scary approach (don't even show the monster, for starters). I'll give Cloverfield credit for at least trying a new style, but all it really showed was that that style doesn't work without a better story. This is where I desperately suggest seeing The Host, which has all of the elements of Cloverfield yet somehow manages a balance between comedy, fright, amazing visuals and characters you can care about. This is also where I'll mention J.J. Abrams - as only a producer, this is where his mention belongs. Had he written and/or directed, it might have been a better movie..."
"lukas8","3","8","16","22 January 2008"," The ugly love child of the blair witch and godzilla
","This movie may be remotely enjoyable as long as you can turn your brain off. Unfortunately, I couldn't.<br/><br/>The characters were so unbelievably bad, and the worst was definitely the camera man. He was somewhere between quagmire (without the funny) and dude, where's my car. The writer couldn't have made the characters any more linear and cliché.<br/><br/>The story is exactly what you expect. Even if you haven't seen the movie but have seen the trailer, imagine what it is going to be like and how it is going to end, and you are probably pretty close. For a movie that is supposed to be mysterious, there are no real surprises here, and nothing terribly original.<br/><br/>The first person amateur video gimmick is so tastelessly done. The most annoying part is they feel the need to explain everything that is going on. I am pretty sure they are counting on an audience with a low IQ. Blair Witch broke some ground with this technique, and director Matt Reeves must have decided that they got it right the first time and there was no need to build on it. There are so many similarities that you can pretty much count on hating it if you didn't like The Blair Witch.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie is completely unrealistic. I am not talking about the monsters, I am talking about very simple details that it is not easy to ignore. For example, the beginning clearly states that it is on an SD card, yet the movie keeps cutting back and forth over footage that was supposedly filmed over. Also, apparently helicopter crashes are a lot safer than most people would guess.<br/><br/>Like I said before, the movie might work if you can simultaneously block all of these things. The rating it got here on IMDb absolutely boggles my mind. I can only assume an 8/10 is the new 5/10."
"Goodfello86","10","8","16","18 January 2008"," A New Standard In Monster Films
","I just got back from seeing Cloverfield and I have to tell you, I was amazed. When the teaser first came out in July, I was one of the many who was blown away with it. And like many, I started thinking: What if this thing doesn't live up to the hype? Those fears were put to rest today. The fact that this filmed from first person point of view really hads to the thrills. Sure it gets kinda shaky at times, but just remember, this isn't a professional cameraman. This is just a guy filming a surprise party that gets caught in the middle of an attack and he is trying to film while the world around him falls. The monster was totally original. To answer questions people have, you do get to see the entire monster in the end. It is an amazing thrill ride to go on. And if you just go with your fear when watching it, you will enjoy it even more. There will be scenes that ring familiar from 9/11 but that adds to fear. To know that New York had something similar happen and that people were walking through the rubble and dust in shock really makes you think. Anyway, this is a very good monster flick and I wouldn't be surprised if we see other movie producers copy this movie."

","Do not waste your time or money on this film. It was a waste of film, to be honest. It was the most boring movie I have ever watched, and I've seen LOTR trilogy. This was so hyped up for no reason. My friend and I both fell asleep while watching this movie, in the middle of the afternoon. It was stupid, had no concrete storyline and the ending was crap. It was very difficult to follow most times. Just a crappy movie overall. When it tried to be witty or funny it just didn't work. I mean the acting was OK but the writing was strange and the hand held camera thing was cool but I expected it to be better. I read all that stuff about the motion sickness thing and I thought it was real but I walked out of that theatre bored and perfectly normal. It definitely wasn't that bad. The commercial makes the movie look good. There was maybe one good scene in that entire movie, so basically it was a waste of my life. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, not even my worst enemy. It was terrible. When will people start making good movies again is what kept going through my head while watching this movie. It's a shame because this film had the potential to be really good...it just didn't live up to all the hype."

"dee.reid","10","12","27","18 January 2008"," The ""Cloverfield"" review
","(Before I start this, I just want to say I'm 22, going on 23, and that I grew up watching Japanese monster movies, or ""kaiju-eiga,"" and I consider Godzilla to be the ultimate movie monster. I've also come to love Gamera and Ultraman, and I was gosh-wowed last year by South Korea's contribution to the genre, ""The Host."" Now here we are at ""Cloverfield,"" what I will refer to as ""the first great American monster movie of the 21st century."")<br/><br/>It makes no sense to describe the plot to the ""Alias"" J.J. Abrams-produced, Drew-Goddard-written, Matt Reeves-directed flick ""Cloverfield"" in any real detail because therein lies the problem: there is no real detail, only raw, on-the-scene, up close & personal action. In a hype campaign the likes of which haven't been seen in a movie of this type for quite some time now, ""Cloverfield"" remarkably lives up to expectations. Ever since the first trailer appeared during the previews for ""Transformers"" last year, a three-syllable word has come to describe a movie to be released on January 18, 2008, and it was called ""Cloverfield,"" even though early press releases said that wasn't the movie's real title.<br/><br/>So what's all the hoopla about? Some suspected a war movie, others a viral outbreak, or a terrorist attack. As you know, the plot has been kept real hush-hush, though sordid details have been allowed to leak on the Internet.<br/><br/>Rumor control, these are the facts -<br/><br/>All you need to know is this: in an inventively bizarre hybrid that combines elements of both ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The War of the Worlds"" with ""Godzilla,"" a monster is laying waste to New York City. Buildings crumble, the Brooklyn Bridge is snapped in two like a twig, the military strikes back, mass hysteria as thousands try to flee the city, and a giant reptilian beast of unknown origin is causing mass destruction. The chaos is captured through the hand-held lens of a couple of terrified New Yorkers as they give a first-hand account of the devastation while trying to reach safety.<br/><br/>And that's all you really need to know. First of all, because this is a first-person account of a New York City monster attack, we never get to see a really good picture of the monster until somewhere close to the very end, since it decides to make its debut at nighttime in the City That Never Sleeps, and up until then all we get are brief flashes and glimpses of ""it."" (To get an idea of this creepy critter, imagine a reptile, like a shell-less turtle, combined with a slug and a sea crustacean. And then imagine its nastier, creepy-crawly subordinates that come to chow down on many unsuspecting New Yorkers.) To get this out of the way, this beast is a force to be reckoned with. It's certainly an impressive CGI creature creation, like all the classic Japanese monsters I grew up with - Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Gamera. But what's paramount here, is that this flick, despite any misgivings I'll probably have in the future, is way better than the 1998 American adaptation of ""Godzilla.""<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" does have some pretty wicked special effects sequences, including some genuinely intense moments of peril and a few particularly chilling sights and sounds. Some have panned the shaky and frenetic camera-work; if you were in the middle of all this chaos, would your camera be perfect and composed? The guy's right there, in the thick of it, scared to death with his closest friends; does anyone really think he's going to get the Oscar for Best Cinematography or something, if he makes it out of the city alive? I don't think so.<br/><br/>New York has seen some pretty wild sights over the decades. In the post-9/11 world, you would think that ""Cloverfield"" is the last thing Americans would want to see right now, and Abrams will be accused in the future of being insensitive to the feelings of Americans. But it seems that every so often filmmakers need to vent some unstated/unwritten frustration/aggression and this is what we occasionally get sometimes.<br/><br/>And as for those poor New Yorkers I was telling about? Well, their footage was found.<br/><br/>10/10"

Honestly, I can't think of a single thing to recommend this movie, except for the fact that it was very short.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people see movies like this for mindless thrills, but Cloverfield stinks even by the lowered standards of the genre.

The producer did a great job showing us the destruction of the city and the chaos that was ravaging the streets.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie would've had that kind of atmosphere without the hand-held camera view. Some people might get headaches at times but I didn't. The monster was quite original and the idea of introducing smaller monsters was genius. The only disappointing thing is that there is no information on the monster whatsoever..! I recommend Cloverfield for any action/monster movie fans."
"kris0031","9","9","19","19 January 2008"," Slice of Life Revival of the Monster Movie
","The mark of a great film is when the audience can't stop talking about it when they walk out of the theater. Cloverfield certainly delivers in that area, combining electrifying effects, great character development, and a unique point of view that brings a sleeping genre back to life in a stunningly real way.<br/><br/>I was definitely foaming at the mouth for the 18th to roll around so I could catch this film on opening night, and it was well worth the wait. The most remarkable aspect of this movie was the realism. Shot entirely from a first-person perspective, I caught myself trying to get a better view right from the edge of my seat. I was afraid the hand-held camera would take away from the experience, but it only made it better. The visuals are on the cutting edge of Hollywood realism and you can't help but ask yourself how it was done, as much of the green-screen work looks perfect. When it comes to special effects, Cloverfield is a 10.<br/><br/>The downfall of this genre is typically a perspective that gives away too much. Cloverfield is simply a slice-of-life. There's no explanations, no resolutions, just a few hours of an experience that leaves its mark. The characters are easy to relate to, and the dual plot gives resonance to it's realistic charm. The beginning wets the appetite just enough so that when the action starts, you almost weren't expecting it. This isn't a hero film though, it's too honest to try and be more than it is; it just gives us enough to leave us wanting more. The only thing I found to fall a little short was the length of the film - it's only 80 mins and my audience really wanted more - to the point were they were yelling at the screen and calling for a sequel.<br/><br/>I think Cloverfield has set the bar much higher when it comes to indie-style films that tackle a major Hollywood trademark. The effects, character realism and point-of-view that includes the audience in the action hasn't been done this well before. The movie is fun, scary, flows well and definitely kept my attention right through to the end. Big recommendation on seeing this in the theater to get the full experience."

","A big monster attacks New York, and some guy runs around with a camcorder and films what is going on from the perspective of average Joe. No heroes, no plot, no point. Just confusion until the recording ends at some random point in the event, leaving no answers to what really happened.<br/><br/>The movie got high ratings because its new and unique presentation, you have a sensation of being there like an insignificant individual who is tossed around as a victim to events that are not clearly understood at any point in the movie. Its basically like looking at some war footage from a civilian who is randomly running around in a war zone, trying to survive. This gives the old fashioned Godzilla kind of movie an amount of realism that is unusual and fresh.<br/><br/>But, its just not enough to make the movie a rewarding experience. Its a freak show of a movie, doing something a bit unusual, sure, but its like eating a cactus just to do something new when having dinner. Yes, different, but maybe its a reason no one did it before...<br/><br/>To build a foundation of realism, the first part of the movie is only showing the camcorder guy walking around in some regular party, talking to random people. To give you the feeling that this is real. And surely enough, it could have been recorded at any boring party you have ever been to. And, this is just where the movie fails to entertain. Its like watching your relatives endless vacation photos.<br/><br/>When things finally do happen, at the point where you are about to leave the theater out of boredom, the camera is mostly waving around like crazy while the recorder is running around in panic, making you want to throw up from motion sickness.<br/><br/>Although I can appreciate them trying to do something different, to make you feel like you are really there to experience this, it just ends up like a blur of noise and messy clips.<br/><br/>The whole point of the movie is obviously to recreate the kind of confusion and panic an individual would experience during such an unlikely attack, however, this fact also leaves you with some kind of unsatisfied taste in your mouth as watching the movie will not put your curiosity at rest. In fact, you can just watch the trailer, its the whole movie right there, you wont get anything more from seeing the whole thing. Just more of the same, but you can just watch the trailer in a loop until you get tired of it, and there you go.

"Hannibal_Chigurh","3","7","14","22 January 2008"," Starting the year off with a colossal letdown
","Jesus, what a disappointment. I didn't eat a thing all day cause I thought I'd get motion sickness from the movie. The only part of the movie that was unbearably shaky was the very beginning. For some reason, once the monster shows up the camera steadies a bit. Now, of course no sane individual would go towards the monster, cause if they didn't we'd have no movie. But I have an issue with the number of people who went. Out of the five who attempt to rescue Beth, only three have any business going. Rob wants to save his love, Jason naturally will follow his brother, and Jay's girlfriend will naturally follow Jay. Only problem, Jason doesn't go with Rob thanks to a series of unfortunate events. That rules out the reasoning for Lily to be there, and leaves only Rob with a legit reason to travel into the heart of Manhattan. Even then, Beth is not Rob's girlfriend; she is merely his crush. He is willing to risk his life and the lives of his idiot friends (he doesn't put up a fight when the volunteer to tag along) to save the chick who blew him off. That leaves Hud and Marlena. Marena barely knows any of these people, yet she tags along. At one point, she and Hud bring this up; Marlena busts a Clerks-like ""I'm not even supposed to be here!"" (which is true), and Hud questions why she came. Bad move! Films shouldn't call attention to their own plot holes unless it's for comedy's sake. Hud also has no reason to go, other than curiosity. Am I really supposed to believe that the guy can't wait long enough to get out and watch CNN in the morning? This was supposed to be intense and thrilling. The only real moment of suspense came in the subway tunnels with the lice. Even then, the setup for the scene was ludicrous. If you see a herd of mice (or any animal) running in one direction, run in that direction! They just power walk until they hear something, then stop and fidget with the camera. How stupid do you have to be? However, the lice attack was truly terrifying and the only real jolt of the film.<br/><br/>The monster is the source of so many plot holes I couldn't focus on the movie. If this thing came from the depths of the ocean, how can it breathe on land? Why does it have legs? Even if it can breathe, how does it survive in the drastically different climate of land, where there isn't the crushing pressure of deep ocean as well as a different make up of nitrogen and oxygen? The thing looks so unadapted for marine life that I wish they had just made it an alien. Many people complain that they wanted more monster and less crappy acting. While the acting is bad, I think they gave you too much monster. Hud's final scene serves only to give us a closeup look of the thing, but we got a hell of a lot of revealing glances along the way (I assumed the way people talked about it that the most you got was a roar and a foot. Instead, you see the whole thing several times, but at a distance.) Also, the lice bring up questions. If they infect anything they bite leading to an Alien-like chestburster explosion of blood, why hasn't the monster been infected? I don't think there are enough creatures in the deep sea to feed the huge number of lice on the creature, so how have they survived the thousands of years that the monster has been underwater?<br/><br/>Abrams and Goddard came up with this elaborate back story for the monster involving a Japanese corporation that makes a drink called Slusho. Note that what I'm about to say may seem like spoilers, but at no point in the movie does any of the following come up: Slusho's main ingredient is a super-sweet nectar found in the depths of the ocean. Apparently, this is the monster's source of food, and when the drink becomes a hit, Slusho mines the hell of it, draining the beast's food supply. If the thing lives off nectar, why does it have such a predatory mouth (it looks like it was made to kill)? It should be something like a proboscis to suck the nectar from the water. I understand that Abrams and Reeves couldn't reveal this within the confines of the first person POV of the film, so why bother? It's like they tried to tack on a point to the film, making it as much about consumerism's effect on the world we live in as Godzilla was about the atomic age. But you can't do that if it doesn't appear in the film. This is why I never got into Lost.<br/><br/>The first person POV was something I got behind, and it remains the highlight of the film. It made the subway scene and some monster reveals actually scary and tense. The rest was just annoying. The group makes frequent stops that are too long, yet they make rash decisions during this time of rest. The dialogue is bad, but happily there isn't too much of it. It made me feel like I was there even though every shoddy line took me right back out. It also didn't help that whenever I saw Lily, I couldn't focus cause the moron is running around in heels. Yeah right.<br/><br/>In the end, this was marginally entertaining at its best moments, but I spent way too much time laughing at the idiocies, bad acting, and glaring plot holes to be fully engaged with this film. 3/10"
"abe_1618","5","7","14","22 January 2008"," Are you serious?
","After watching this movie on opening night I thought of how it would get destroyed on IMDb due to how bad this movie is but to my surprise I found that it was actually given a pretty high rating. This movie lacks 2/3 essential parts of a monster type movie. Any monster movie has three parts: 1) A beginning(the origin of the monster and why it wants to destroy stuff) 2) A middle(the struggle with the monster) 3) An end(the monster is killed, isolated or the monster wins). Cloverfield had a great middle but completely lacked the other parts. Some movies can get away with missing parts (ex: Dawn of the Dead has no beginning or end) but this didn't work at all for Cloverfield. I think it is an over all disaster of a movie."
"movieman430","6","7","14","19 January 2008"," Different in a good and bad way. Satisfyingly unsatisfying.
","Cloverfield... Okay. This movie is two things. The first is a ripping success, the second is a near cinematic scam that doesn't exactly deliver anything in any great amount, accept vomit if you suffer from motion sickness. Cloverfield benefited from the best marketing campaign since Blair Witch. They based it on one question: What the hell is the damn thing? Now before you go to see Cloverfield, I'm going to hit you with some logic that might deter you or might fascinate you. First of all, if you expect answers, this movie is anything but up your alley, you just need to go with it. Secondly, when they say it's comprised of hand held footage, they weren't lying. The movie is constantly shot at odd angles, the film jumps certain segments, occasionally flashing back to a month prior, a day that the tape is recording over. There is also no soundtrack to the film, it's all just eerie sounds and all that jazz. For those of you who have seen Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, probably not many of you, this is not the same. The camera movements in Behind the Mask jostle just enough for you to believe it's hand held but don't overpower the images on the screen. In Cloverfield, half the magic, probably more than half, is how poorly the movie is shot. Is it effect at time? Definitely. Is it gimmicky? You bet your ass. The monster scenes are effective but too meager; J.J. Abrams said ""You will see it."" in response to whether this would be like Blair Witch. He probably should have said, ""You will see it, once or twice. And a handful of times really out of focus."" Another thing, for a movie that is really 75 minutes long, the exposition of the movie is far too long. Now there are moments of truly effective suspense and horror, the monster effects are good and the city in ruins looks pretty good to. Some people like to draw parallels to the terrorist attacks, there are one or two similar things, all drawn from the fact it's New York. Yes, it does suck that New York is constantly picked on, but you've got to expect that, its more effective to see the Chrysler building fall apart than some random building in Dallas. Okay, for those who don't want any spoilers, skip the next paragraph.<br/><br/>Okay, if you're reading this you should have already seen the movie. Now, here are a few of my problems with the film. The movie fails to live up to it's potential. The shedding of spiders, is so freaking cool and yet they are only in three scenes... Okay. Design of the monster is cool but we never really see the whole thing clearly, we see it's face a brief profile, I kinda want more. This movie would have benefited from a longer running time, and an R rating. Like Marlene's stomach exploding was cool and gross, but probably should have been followed up fifteen minutes later by actually seeing something. Another thing, one of the big advantages to the hand held camera is that it almost brings reality to a completely ridiculous situation. Now, in a realistic world, don't you think one or two people might be dropping the F bomb, no, I think everyone would be dropping them right an left. But okay. Now, the ending. Does it suck, yeah, but could it have ended any differently, no. The movie's ending is redeemed by two things. One, in the ending sequence with them at Coney Island, you can clearly see the monster in the water. That's cool. Secondly, if you sat through the credits and listened really, really, really friggen carefully you heard something. Then if you're a douche bag like me, you drove home debating what it was and then looked it up. The following words are uttered in deep static. ""Help us. It's still alive."" That's pretty damn cool. Will there be a sequel? Maybe. If there is I hope it will not attempt to pull of the hand held thing again.<br/><br/>Okay we're back. In the end, Cloverfield is a standard monster film that uses the home camera gimmick to build mystique and be a little different. Personally, I think with such a great concept and creature design, it might have been able to pull of the standard monster film angle. But it decided to be different. Okay. It's defining quality is also it's biggest fault. How many times will I watch it... Maybe once more. I'd suggest you see it, and then decide for yourself."

I mean the huge spider looking monsters..what happened to them? Did they die? What exactly were they? Where did they come from? Why were they in Manhattan? Something! But at the end you are left with so many questions that should have been answered but didn't because the main characters die. And then it shows an old video-clip of them then BAM! your done!

"targaid","1","11","25","31 January 2008"," Hand-held interference spoils reasonable premise.
","The Blair Witch Project has a lot to answer for. None of it good.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams latest production has taken chunks of Godzilla and mixed them with Blair Witch's hand-held, reality TV style and web-buzz advertising and come up with a film equally annoying and devoid of interest.<br/><br/>There's a good premise here which seems to be looking at the action in Godzilla from the viewpoint of ordinary citizens not involved in the main action. As a result the main monster is almost kept to the status of featured extra. The fact that the creature looks so much like the CGI from Godzilla helps this impression along nicely as does our heroes being chased through the subway by small versions of the parent. The cast are pretty and the performances more than adequate, but Abby & I were both ready to leave by 20 minutes in and afterwards we heard not one good comment from the assembled reviewers. Several did leave.<br/><br/>What's the problem? It's that hand-held style. Leave aside that we're supposed to believe that a slacker who didn't want to use a camcorder he's never handled suddenly becomes an obsessive photo-journalist who continues to film even as being attacked or running from explosions. Forget that we're supposed to believe a domestic cam-coder can film constantly for about 8 hours on one battery and an SD Card (I want an SD card that can hold that much footage!). Ignore that the military don't take it from them as they run around filming their operations or that it's apparently indestructible. Forget all the stupid rubbish you're just meant to ignore and all the rip-offs from other films and being unable to care about most of the characters & their yuppie lives & concerns. The BIG problem is that hand-held style.<br/><br/>There are times you can't even look at the screen it's so awful. In a thriller/horror movie the only thing that should make the audience look away is fear not motion-sickness induced by aimlessly waving the camera around. Long sequences pointed at the floor as people run, more lying at an awkward angle as the action flits incomprehensibly through the static frame or others pointed away from the action leaving only sound for a clue as to what's happening.<br/><br/>The style is meant to make one feel part of the action. It's meant to give a sense of immediacy and truth and use the power of imagination to heighten the tension. What it does is get very irritating very quickly and soon becomes an insurmountable barrier to connecting with the story. Did no-one watching the rushes spot this? Or were they all too busy feeling self-satisfied & clever? Hell, they couldn't even be bothered coming up with a real title; they named it after the street the production offices were in. SHows the level of thought they actually put into this mess.<br/><br/>Total turkey. Avoid at all costs."

I got to chase behind some guy whining about the love of his life that just treated him like garbage while his friends follow him blindly, and yet somehow I am supposed to feel connected? Don't give me that ""people react under pressure nonsense"" guess what, people are what they are, and under pressure it only intensifies. As a combat Marine you will have to take my word for it, or find out yourself when a monster from wherever visits your town.<br/><br/>Typically when a monster is demolishing buildings, eating people, or throwing the Statue of Liberty's head around, that is usually enough for me to say , ""Ok, that can't be good"".<br/><br/>You want me to be attached or to scare me? Show me something I don't expect. When I can tell you what will happen from one scene to the next, either you are foreshadowing or explaining too much.

","""Dude, bro, yeah, cool, man... Whatever. Oh, and awesome, dude."" This, in a nutshell, is the kind of dialogue we're subjected to in the first 18 minutes before the monster finally arrives on the film set (he was late due to contractual negotiations). If this truly is how today's businessmen interact with each other - in ""the city that never sleeps"" (and apparently ""the city whose inhabitants never build up on their vocabulary"") - then good luck America... ""If you make it here you can make it anywhere"": provided you're an overachieving yuppie airhead, apparently.<br/><br/>Film-making nerds and nerdesses, how about laying off New York for a while, huh? There must be other places on the planet deserving of a monster's attention. There have got to be other cities that ""never sleep"". If I see Manhattan in another movie, I think I'll break my remote control.<br/><br/>As seen previously in The Made-Out-Of-Thin-""(Bl)Air Witch Project"" and ""(Para)Normal Activity"", whenever the entire movie is captured by a character waving around a camera there is bound to be much illogic regarding how and why certain scenes could have been filmed, given the extreme circumstances and camera-unfriendly situations. But never-mind that: ""Cloverfield"" is ""A Clockwork Orange"" compared to the afore-mentioned flicks. There is a budget here, the film isn't dull.<br/><br/>I had to kind of wonder how it was possible that wherever the yuppies headed, the monster was there. A few theories/explanations: 1) The monster came to NY with a mission to kill yuppies. And not just any old yuppies, but our main characters. 2) The monster had a natural ""bro, dude, whassup dude, yo"" radar in its brain. Hence, whenever the yuppies tried to get out of harm's way, all they needed to do is utter out loud any given moronic modern-day slang word/phrase, and the monster would be - yet again - at their tails. If this theory is correct, then maybe the suggestion that the government created the monsters was indeed true: the motive being to eradicate stupidity in a nation accelerating with leaps and bounds towards all-encompassing dumbing-down. 3) The monster felt he wasn't getting enough screen-time (and he was right: certain yuppie packs have the sick urge to place themselves at the center of attention even during a 200-meter-Godzilla attack), so in his light lizard-head he figured that killing the main characters would increase his chances in the editing room.<br/><br/>I didn't quite understand how the unarmed, disorientated, panicky yuppies, a handful of them, managed to repel the first attack of the ""spiders"". And then the second attack. After the initial attack they even joke a bit, which certainly lends some much-needed realism... I can certainly see how people would goof off each other after just having been confronted with blood-thirsty legions from Hell.<br/><br/>Also silly was the helicopter flying so dangerously close to the monster (so that Hud could get better footage? those military pilots are certainly quite Hud-accommodating) - and then getting predictably hit by the yuppie-hating monster.<br/><br/>Still, there is the happy ending..."

Cloverfield delivers, too; plenty of suspense, chills, and action, with believable characters and realistic drama that truly moves you. Michael Stahl-David and the rest of the cast impressed me with their abilities to show us characters, not actors, as I was drawn into their interactions, and their reactions as the chaos began. The point of view, that of the video camera, could be tedious and trite, but great direction by Matt Reeves makes it highly believable, and the varied camera angles throughout the action scenes add a wonderfully unsettled feel to the unfolding drama.

"gamenski","9","8","17","18 January 2008"," Exactly what I expected. Which is AWESOME.
","****SPOILERS BELOW, PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED****<br/><br/>I went in the movie having no idea what to expect. I heard that you want to sit back from the screen to comprehend it, and I agree with that. But other than that, all I had seen were the trailers. And I was hyped. And I wasn't disappointed at all. I'll say my only criticism first: the movie is short. It feels like even 10 more minutes of just running or fighting the little monsters or even grieving like in the subway platform scene would have been great. The ordeal seemed to take so little time for how large of a crisis it was. The movie has a couple awesome aspects. First, the presentation. The filming feels really real. The stops are natural, and the characters are always aware of the camera. The hand-held camera view also leads to better tension in some scenes, like in the subway tunnel. Second is the characters. In the monster/action movies I've seen, the protagonists always seem to want to save everyone. The entire city, country, world. Now ask yourself this: if a monster attacked your city, would you try to fight it, or try to escape? I think most of us would try to escape, which is exactly what the characters do. They're not involved in any of the problem solving, they're just victims, bystanders of a crisis. They always seem real: real reactions, real decisions, etc. And the characters interact with each other perfectly. No sudden romances, no relationship changes in the span of 6 hours. Hud and Marlena are perfect examples. Marlena sort of warms up to Hud before her explosion(no, she's not taking her coat off), but it's not like they're star-crossed lovers. And Hud is always making funny comments during the quiet times, which seems a natural way of his dealing with grief and anxiety. I was worried this movie would end up with no reveal of the monster, just a mysterious figure. But throughout the movie, the monster is shown, though not in full detail until the end. And then, it is awesome. It's absolutely original, and it's a good type. Not too much like a dinosaur, not too much like a fish, but instead something totally foreign. And, there are little monsters, but I still don't know for sure if the main monster spawned them or if they hitched a ride in, or what. Which leads into the open-endedness of the movie. The movie ends with Manhattan being leveled to destroy the monster. The camera obviously survives, so we don't know the outcome of the monster, or Beth and Rob for sure. Also, we learn nothing of the origins of the monster, what exactly the bites from the little ones do, or anything. And this stresses one of the points of the movie before it was out. Admit it: we all had fun hypothesizing what every single line of dialog and frame of video meant and figuring out how it could fit into the plot. The fun with Cloverfield was that everyone could have their own idea on what the monster was, where it came from, the outcome of the characters, etc. And with an unresolved ending, we can do the same. Now, granted, I didn't stay through the entire credits, but I doubt there's that much resolved, if anything. My final recommendation: see the movie. It's an excellent movie with style and a realistic flair that should not be missed."

The people also tried to get on an elevator in a building that was halfway on its side.

Maybe I can stand it as a rental and see it on the small screen, having that constant shaking taking up my entire vision was more than I want to bare.

","The US Defense Department finds a videotape in the former Central Park. The footage shows a group of friends celebrating a surprise farewell party in the apartment of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) in Lower Manhattan. Rob is a young man that is leaving New York to work in Japan and his friend Hud (T.J. Miller) is recording messages from his friends. Out of the blue, they are surprised by an earthquake and they see on the news that a ship has capsized in the harbor area. They go to the penthouse to see the accident and they actually witness explosions everywhere; when power goes out in the building, they run to the streets trying to save their lives from the attack of the monster.<br/><br/>The unoriginal tragedy movie ""Cloverfield"" is a boring combination of ""Godzilla"" à la ""Blair Witch Project"" style. The story is disclosed through the viewfinder of a hand-held video camera, and the dialogs and situations in the farewell party are silly, uninteresting and tiresome. The movie improves with the special effects of the attack of the monster, but the shaking camera and the characters are annoying. I had good expectations based on the overrated IMDb User Rating (7.5/10 @ 102,264 votes) and I was absolutely disappointed in the end. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Cloverfield Monstro"" (""Cloverfield Monster"")"

","At one point during the mayhem of ""Cloverfield"" our jerky-jokey cameraman Hud (an annoying T. J. Miller) remarks that the monster ravaging New York City is ""something terrible."" Well, ""Cloverfield"" is pretty close to something terrible, but it's also laugh-out-loud funny and loads of fun.<br/><br/>Taking cues from ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Godzilla"", and our current YouTube/MySpace crazed youth oriented culture that believes everyone's point of view deserves to be recorded, producer J. J. Abrams' opportunistic ""Cloverfield"" operates at a mercifully quick clip to maximize entertainment value with a minimum of effort (and budget) while showing us allegedly top-secret video footage recovered after a massive monster attack on NYC.<br/><br/>Though barely ninety minutes long, we still have to suffer through an excruciatingly banal opening twenty minutes of vapid, spoiled twenty-somethings partying the night away before the monster strikes. There was a moment somewhere during this that I actually zoned out completely and found myself staring at the dark theater wall. The cast of unknowns thankfully contains a few people who might be able to act if given the chance in a normal film. Standouts include the painfully lovely Jessica Lucas as the feisty Lily and Zooey Deschanel look-a-like Lizzy Caplan as the sarcastic Marlena. These two young actresses acquitted themselves nicely while a group of anonymous and interchangeable actors playing stupid characters making bad decision after bad decision whirled around them. It made for one of those odd movie-going experiences where you actually start routing for certain characters to die in horrible ways while you hope the pretty girls make it out alive because, well, they're cute.<br/><br/>As a gimmick film, ""Cloverfield"" is as shallow as they come. It's also too silly and too much fun to end up mad about it. At least the idiot hand-held cameraman/character wants to see the monster and the destruction as much as we do. This leads to some great money-shots of the creature and its tour of terror through midtown Manhattan. It would've been more thrilling had I not seen very similarly designed creature effects in last fall's ""The Mist"". Like that film, ""Cloverfield"" certainly has its moments of giddy monster oriented fun, but it ultimately implodes and leaves behind a wreck of a movie that is pretty close to something terrible."

","This movie draws a ""10"" rating from 47%? IMDb, you just lost all credibility with me. Having seen this movie, my question isn't why was this movie named Cloverfield. My question is, why wasn't this movie named ""Blair Witch Project and Godzilla Do Manhattan."" I can only assume that a healthy portion of this film's budget was spent stuffing the IMDb ballot box. When this movie ended - quickly, mercifully - I had a headache and the movie audience audibly grumbled, sneered, and laughed. I don't consider it a spoiler to reveal that the film is entirely done on a hand held video recorder carried by one of the characters throughout. That includes numerous instances of running, ducking flying debris, and scuffling with critters. Rather than spoiler, this revelation should be considered a warning."
"bjmax33","1","9","20","18 January 2008"," Couldn't have hated it more
","First off, I get motion sick easily and the entire movie is shot using a shaky hand-held for effect so this movie just wasn't for me from the start. My curiosity made me gut it out, but I really wish I hadn't bothered. The lead up to the action is drawn out and extremely boring. I literally almost got up to leave 3 or 4 times before the sh*t started hitting the fan. The sad part is I became more frustrated with the movie and just plain annoyed with the characters after the attack begins. Hud, the character holding the camera through the majority of the movie is a damn idiot. I found myself cursing the guy under my breath for his sheer stupidity and supreme annoyance factor. I forced my self several times to stay in the chair thinking things had to pick up at some point, but found myself never satisfied. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It's the worst movie I've seen in years. For your own sake, please stay away."
"Ziya90","10","6","12","9 January 2010"," A lot of people say that they hated it, probably just to be opposite
","This is not a movie which tries to get people's attention in order to do well at the box office. In other words, what people call, not pretentious. J. J. Abrahams is one of this movie's producers, but Cloerfield was not appreciated, even the half of it as Star Trek was appreciated. Instead, there are a lot of people who say that they hated it and there are a lot of people either who give it only 1! There is not even one flawed moment in the movie on all counts and acting that is criticized by the haters is not amateurish at all. I did not understand why it is criticized. All the actors and actresses are amateur, but the acting is not amateurish, very persuasive. Cloverfield is extremely realistic that makes it much more effective. It is because all the things seem extremely realistic, how is it called? Documentary style. The most unusual opening sequence for such a movie is in Cloverfield I guess. The mood, the atmosphere are very interesting and it is like someone records a party rather than the director introduces the characters of a monster movie to us. Therefore, it starts like a stylish drama. However, it is not like party, girls, drinks, chats and music, something different. I just can't describe it. Because of realism? or because of another reason? I don't know. As for the first attack, I haven't seen such an engaging and impressive one before. This is much more than panicked people run and scream and a monster attacks them, really it is too hard to describe how it is impressive, brilliant. Almost everyone compares the movie with other mockumentaries which is unnecessary, if you ask me. By this style, the movie does not become an imitation or pretentious, it makes it real effective. Then, why realism does not effect people? It seems that the haters do not care about whether it is extremely realistic or not. I put myself in the characters's place, panicked as if I am in there and I worried about each of them. By the way, there is an action scene which the forces clash with the monster and it was much more satisfying than even the whole War of the Worlds!! The subway scenes are one of the best parts of the movie, also one of the most realistic parts of the movie, it was like it could happen and also so sad. The movie, Gwoemul was very appreciated, people say that it was dramatic that generally other monster movies are lack of, believe me, it is nothing. And the final. Very exciting and at the same time dramatic. However not for everyone, especially if you don't like unconventional finals. Lastly, this is one of the most engaging movies ever."

","First, see it in the cinema - you need that massive surround sound.<br/><br/>Second - this was so clever. This is supposed to be the film someone takes on his video camera on the day New York is attacked by ... something. That means the camera-work is sloppy and amateur - which makes the whole thing look incredibly real and immediate. The characters are just so normal and ordinary - they could very easily be someone you know. And the destruction of New York is breathtaking - seeing on a hand-held, amateur camera like that gives it overtones of 9/11.<br/><br/>And there were a few genuine scream moment- and I hardly ever scream.<br/><br/>This is an intelligent monster movie for those who like their horror, death and disaster mysterious, unexplained, and without 'clever' funny lines. If all you want is a big monster, snappy one-liners and a pat ending, complete with explanation, watch Godzilla. If you want a challenging monster movie, one that makes you feel this could happen to you, this is the one."

","Most of the negative comments others have written are correct, but they're a bit harsh and possibly done to counter the over-the-top praise this flick is getting.<br/><br/>On the positive side there are a few decent action sequences involving explosions, attacks and chases. But, they come too late and are too short to counter all the bad that fills the rest of this movie.<br/><br/>The beginning is such a bore it is difficult to sit through the first 20 minutes; it's here the main characters are presented, but not really developed so you just don't care what happens to them.<br/><br/>Everyone seems to be using the shaky camera method of filming these days; it's not new and it's not that effective here. It actually makes fiction seem even more fake. Case in point: instead of helping his friends fight for their lives against a creature attack, shaky the cameraman just sits backs and video tapes them. Not realistic.<br/><br/>Amid all of the destruction and on-going panic it's amazing how empty NYC appears --- these main characters seem to wander for long periods of time without encountering another soul. Again, not realistic.<br/><br/>In the midst of running for their lives, one of the main characters decides he wants to visit a girl he once knew to see how she's doing. So the entire gang of goofballs trek across town and ascend several stories of a high-rise while other nearby tall buildings are being toppled just to rescue the damsel. How brave, how stupid! <br/><br/>When the main characters encounter some soldiers, they're given VIP treatment and airlifted out of the city via helicopter (I doubt Joe Schmoe from the Bowery or the million other people in the city are given this treatment --- if so you'd have grid-lock in the air).<br/><br/>Once aboard they speak gleefully as if it's their first helicopter ride over NYC. As to why the soldiers aren't more concerned with fighting the monsters than giving joy rides over NYC --- it's because this is what's needed to put the dumb in a dumb movie.<br/><br/>After their joy ride these goofs land/crash back in NYC. So, after more than seven hours since the attacks began these goofs still can't find a way to get off the island of Manhattan. It's the opposite of SURVIVOR; here, the clever people leave and the idiots remain.<br/><br/>Oh, and as for a monster flick --- we learn nothing of this monster: not it's origin, not it's name, not it's favorite color --- Nothing.<br/><br/>One Last Note: I've looked at some of the 10 star reviewers' other movie reviews and there aren't any. Sure ---maybe this could be their first review. Or, maybe it could just be some paid hacks abusing the IMDb system to hype this flick."

","Seriously, that's about all I could say, or think after walking out of the theater at the end of this movie. I still remember nearly having a heart attack when I fist saw the teaser for this movie before Transformers. It left a lot of questions and I immediately went crawling on the web to find answers. JJ Abrams and his crew that put in a lot of really hard work did a very impressive job keeping this under wraps and building the almost endless and impatient-inducing hype. From the beginning of the film all the way to the end I was constantly craving more. Some critics say the acting was terrible, but to them I show them a certain finger, because honestly, if you were running around NYC fearing for your life, how would you act? The story, which the audience can relate to, revolves around, for the most part, Hud and his best friend Rob (Hud being the comic relief behind the camera). Rob is leaving for Japan with a new VP position at some unnamed company (my guess from the start was Slush-O, look at what shirt Rob's brother, Jason, is wearing). Weeks before Rob sleeps with his good friend (and as we find romantic interest) Beth, what do you know, Rob falls in love. Then the night of his going away party he sees Beth and it pretty much ruins his fun, that is until the ground shakes and the power fails temporarily. Enter: ""Cloverfield"" from the ocean tearing off the head of the Statue of Liberty and capsizing a ship on it's entrance into Manhattan. The rest of the film continues with Hud behind the camera and Rob with a small group of close friends in tow in a desperate attempt to save Beth and flee from this creature. There is the story that I can tell without ruining the film. This unique style that hasn't really been done before (we'll just forget Blair Witch on this one) really gives the audience a new view on a movie not yet seen, the first person perspective of the main characters. Yes, you see the monster, and they do a great job of teasing you with small glimpses of it (and the smaller almost more terrifying creatures that come with it). The special effects are well done, and the action scenes involving the Army are just as intense as the destruction this creature unleashes. A ""you never know what'll happen next"" ""edge of your seat"" thrill ride- sorry to sound cliché'd. I loved this movie and really hope they follow through with the rumored plans to make another from a different perspective. If you like monster movies, thrillers, action, and keep-you-guessing films this is one you must check out. Hey, if it's good enough to beat out Star Wars: SE and Black Hawk Down on the opening weekend box office records then it must be good. $41 million and counting can't be wrong!"

","everything HAS to be realistic. If you have to ""suspend dis-belief"", then you HAVE to use conventional 3rd person camera techniques.<br/><br/>I give it a 6. The camera work was simply annoying. And even if you try and say ""well, it's realistic"" well, it's not. No camcorder battery lasts that long. And the entire time (basically) the guy holds the camera at shoulder level like he's looking through the viewfinder. Even when **SPOILER** the monsters are attacking him, he's pointing it in the direction of the action. I understand that it's necessary so the audience can see it, but if the director wants us to see it, then abandon that concept about the movie and do it 3rd person like every other movie.<br/><br/>No one reacted like a real person would have. NO ONE WOULD HAVE GONE BACK INTO THE CITY! If someone would have, then hundreds would have. That was one of my gripes... where are all the other 20 million people? No one else has relatives? No one else hides out in the subway? No one else is hurt in a building? No on e else left their apartments? Give me a break.<br/><br/>The special effects were very realistic. 9/10. The acting was sub-par. The main character, looking for Beth (Rob, I guess?) was totally non-believable. The smart-ass remarks by the guy running the cam were equally un-believable. Beth is impaled by a piece of steel, then is fine for the remainder of the movie.<br/><br/>There were just so many things un-realistic, and that's fine for most movies. I can suspend dis-belief as well as the next guy. But for this specific technique of realism in camera work, etc. then it damn well better be 100% realistic. Otherwise, use conventional story telling techniques.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed. Mildy exciting, horrible cinematography (which I would have accepted if 100% realistic in character actions), monster was just OK. Little monsters were copies of ""Starship Troopers"". I had no problem with the ambiguous ending as it was set up in the first sequence, that this tape was found ""after the fact""."

Abrams apparently never got the concept that you have to 1. begin the story, 2. tell the story, then 3. end the story; all while keeping the viewer interested.<br/><br/>We never find out how the story begins. Rather, we are treated to 20 minutes of banal party where 95% of the characters have no role in the rest of the movie. Once we're into the movie we are treated to watching the 5 dumbest people in New York City ignore everything around them to go on a pointless quest. The other two million residents of New York figure out how to get at, but not these folks. The ""story"" never concludes but does mercifully end along with the movie resolving nothing about how we got here, what happened, what will happen next, or why we would care. The only thing we know is that some unnamed ""company"" just got a reprieve from the worst personnel promotion decision ever made.<br/><br/>We never see the coolest thing in the movie, which is the camera. Although allegedly shot on a hand-held digital camera, one has to wonder where to get this fantastic camera. It has resolution well beyond modern HD quality, records in surround sound, has unlimited batteries, a 50k candle power light, night vision to die for, and the ability to constantly shoot the ""right"" spot, even when the operator is supposedly running or not paying attention. The one feature it has is anti-stabilization which causes the camera to constantly jiggle, even if the character holding the camera is stopped, but stops jiggling for really ""important"" scenes or to let the audience ""catch"" something that is ""cool."" If the executive producers of the new Star Trek see this, they should can J.J. Abrams on the spot or require him to invest his own money."

","**Warning, this review contains some spoilers**<br/><br/>Cloverfield desperately wants to be an invigorating, fresh take on the monster movie genre. In this quest, it achieves only marginal success. Cloverfield appears to have had the strongest January premiere weekend to date, but time will tell if the film has legs. Negative word of mouth may hurt this movie in the long run.<br/><br/>Cloverfield's premise is one of classified footage of the events in the movie recovered from a site 'formerly known as Central Park' after the fact. The film begins with home movie footage of a couple, post night of romance, then moves on to more footage of a going away party for one of the main characters. The party lasts roughly 20 minutes of screen time and is an obvious attempt to familiarize the audience with the main characters and to gain empathy with them for the ensuing events. The party sequence could have lasted 5 minutes and been just as effective as it tends to drag on, becoming boring, and morph into a very special episode of any of the teen angst drama TV shows. <br/><br/>Eventually, things begin to heat up and events unfold as the monster attacks NYC, people flee, people die, etc. All of this continues to be told from an immediate first-person perspective shot with the same camcorder used in the party. (ala Blair Witch)<br/><br/>My problems with Cloverfield are not with the plot (this is essentially a monster movie, and all of the appropriate suspensions of disbelief need to be made). If you are looking for an accurate portrayal of how real life people might react should a city be attacked by a giant monster, this movie is not for you. (Do I document the almost constant peril my friends and I find ourselves in, or put the camera down and GTFO?) The idea that every last question is not answered (in fact most of them aren't) was refreshing to an extent. <br/><br/>My problems lay with the execution. The shaky cam made me nauseous and from reading many other reviews, I'm not alone. If you get motion sickness, avoid seeing Cloverfield on the big screen and wait until the DVD where the effect will be dramatically lessened. Character development was poor. I felt little empathy for the characters. The ending left many questions, which will annoy some people. (though no one walked out at my theater, there was booing and grumbling)<br/><br/>In the end, the concept of showing a disaster from the perspective of the people who experienced it is somewhat unique, leads to some good moments of suspense, and creates a degree of immersion in a genre that has been there, done that. However, it is woefully overused (but notice how when an important event occurs, Hud suddenly becomes cameraman of the year?) and will make some people sick, ruining the overall effect."
"Take_1","4","4","7","20 January 2008"," Financially deprived director!
","I was so excited about seeing this movie. I thought ""this is going to be a great movie"". Why? Because the previews hadn't revealed any vital plot or character details! It appeared to contain elements of the destruction of part of New York by some sort of monster or god knows what, from who knows where and who knows why! The potential therefore to be completely surprised and exhilarated, mind and body! <br/><br/>The movie starts with a guy holding a camera and as it progresses I think, ""I hope this hand holding camera portion eventually ends, it's dizzying and making me want to look away"". But I didn't look away and the movie continues to its conclusion, the dizzying, jumping and rather annoying hand held camera action continuing to its very end, which was a great disappointment! You could sense this dissatisfaction as people were leaving the theater, by their comments and quick exit. No need to stick around and relish on the remnants of how this movie has left anyone feeling. Unless of course you'd like to stick around and deal with your astonishment and regret! <br/><br/>So this movie remained in the realm of ""potential"" as it could have been one of the best all time's alien monster movie. But it fell way short of that with the director opting to present the plot and its characters in the eyes of an amateur hand held camera (not even its owner) user. Maybe the director wanted to copy the method used to film the Blair Witch Project. Or maybe he couldn't afford an experienced camera crew (I say this sarcastically). <br/><br/>So no exhilaration or surprise, except to be surprised when I read some of the reviews! Some saying ""it felt like I was there just like when I watched footage of 911"". Phooey! It was nothing like watching news or amateur hand held footage. Any hand held footage would have been screened for the best footage and you would not have been subjected to it for 2 hours. <br/><br/>My hope! The director will have some sort of an epiphany and will want to create a sequel at which time he will have collected enough cash to hire an elaborate and otherwise experienced camera crew."
"SnobbyDude","1","24","68","20 January 2008"," Cloverfield Lost Connection? That's really what is driving the hype.
","I believe the hype of this movie is being driven by some of the LOST mania. In an interview with JJ Abrams, before the premiere of the movie, he said there are a few LOST connections in there. That's all you really need to do to make anything a success - just say there is a lost connection. You don't even need to have a good product.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" was a movie produced by the late, great Stanley Kubrick. Like Abrams, he had a cult following and everyone went to see his movies based on the reputation he had in Hollywood of being a genius. Stanley Kubrick's last movie was terrible and if it was put out there by anyone else it would have been a huge flop. Because of the Kubrick name and the hype associated with it, EWS was much more of a success than it should have been.<br/><br/>Similarly, Cloverfield isn't a good movie. There is really no plot, no character development, no ground breaking cinematography, no fine acting moments. The special effects were decent, but not really any better or worse than any other Hollywood flick out there. It's the first movie I've ever reviewed where I don't have to worry about spoilers because there is no plot to spoil. Everyone knows it's a film where you see a monster destroying a city and not much else.<br/><br/>Another thing that adds to the frustration of watching Cloverfield is that the camera is so shaky it will make you physically ill. Everyone I was with got sick in the theater. I can recall at least three times where the motion sickness got so intense I had to close my eyes until the nausea passed. Then I would open my eyes and the nausea would set in again and I'd have to close my eyes again. Even though my eyes were closed for what seemed like a large portion of the movie, it didn't really make any difference because nothing happened to advance the plot because there wasn't one.<br/><br/>If you really need a lost fix this badly, just spend the night re-watching a season of lost. You'll find some hints and clues you haven't seen before and you won't make yourself physically ill from motion sickness in the process."
"ninaeb","1","31","92","22 January 2008"," Dizzy effects with no plot!
","Maybe you can say it has a unique perspective but maybe unique isn't always good.<br/><br/>It made me dizzy. It gave me no clues of the monsters beginning (alien or earthly) nor did it have an end. I certainly won't go back for a sequel. The actors were OK but certainly no Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt or Mell Gibson.<br/><br/>I use the ratings from this site to make a decision whether or not to see a film but in this case I was sadly disappointed. I can't imagine who the folks are that could have enjoyed this film. Well, maybe I just set my standards too high."
"tom1111","2","7","15","20 January 2008"," Motion sickness issue, big time.
","This movie is not for people who have easy motion sickness. The camera movement will make you throw up if you have motion sickness easily. The actor's emotion and the action in the movie wasn't realistic. Things were exploding next to you, they are basically standing around for most of the time during the beginning of the movie. When their friends die they basically act like nothing happened 5 minutes later. The monster was childish. It was something out of a comic book. It was straight out of a comic book. The acting was not very good, motion sickness was terrible, and what they were doing and why they were doing in that circumstance was very bad. Some things didn't tie up.<br/><br/>Especially the camera movement is not for viewing. It is always shaking and you can't see anything and makes you want to throw up right then and there.<br/><br/>Not recommended because of the camera movement. Big time motion sickness movie. I had to walk out because it made me sick (the camera movement)."
"bandrews-18","2","7","15","20 January 2008"," One of the worst movies I have ever seen
","Very hard to follow and very unrealistic. I would love to own a camcorder that works for 7 hours on one tape and one battery! The plot, if you can call it that, was pretty much worthless. I understand the use of the camcorder for effect but not to the extent it was used in the movie. Maybe I am a little behind the times, but I have never been able to purchase a battery for a cell phone that did not have to be charged - but since it was in a movie it has to be true! The only thing worse than the beginning and middle of the movie was the end of the movie. Maybe they are planning a sequel - if so, I at least know where NOT to spend my movie money in the future. Your money is better spent on the popcorn."
"hanzo_the_angel","10","7","15","20 January 2008"," Cloverfield should be renamed to goldmine
","Now let's get one thing straight, Cloverfield is an experimental movie that really hit's the mark, regardless of what retarded people say. The film was shot by hand held camera, and yet everyone complains about motion sickness and knew it was shot hand held. Second, There really is no plot...yet, The only thing we have is the viral marketing, which does give a little bit of the back story. Now there is the other thing people were disappointed about, the ending. The trailer gave hint about the ending, camera retrieved in central park. What does that tell you? Well, many of you would believe The 2 main character's are dead, but the info card makes no mention of no survivors, and not to mention we hear they are alive at the end of the credits. So that really does open for a sequel. Now the reason this movie does not have much of a plot is because it is really placed on the survivors who are like us, not knowing what is going on, just experiencing it. Now Blair Witch didn't do that, all there was in Blair Witch was running around and screaming, Cloverfield has more then that. The visual effects capture you, the actors make the character's real, the action is intense, and the monster is purely original and mega creepy because it Really looked and felt real. Now I have no idea why people complain of motion sickness, the camera really caught a lot of the action, unlike Blair witch did. But if the 2 main character's are dead, then yes is sad but let's remember, this is not a Disney film and sadly...happy endings don't always happen, but keep note nothing is for certain. As for the other character Lily, she survived.<br/><br/>So if your run into people who complain about this film, they are either very weak minded, or very sensitive to little movement. This film is a work of art and I sure hope that they make the sequel or add more to this film when it comes out on DVD. Either way, Regardless of what dumb people say, Cloverfield is a great experience and quiet a ride, and if you are sensitive to motion sickness, then maybe you should rent the movie first and see for yourself.<br/><br/>Acting - 10 Action - 9 Drama - 9 Visual Effects - 10<br/><br/>Language - Moderate throughout Violence - Some mild gore Disturbing or Terrifying Elements - monster is terrifying and somewhat deformed, The action scenes are realistic and characters are always in Peril. Kid Friendly - No<br/><br/>Overall - 10"
"j_tru06","10","7","15","20 January 2008"," Amazing movie, amazing experience, must see in theaters.
","I am going to try and keep this as spoiler free as possible, let me start off with this, if you need a movie to spell things out for you or you're not up for doing some research on this movie, you probably will be very unsatisfied. The movie itself doesn't tell you why the monster is here, where it's from, or why it's doing what it's doing. If you watch the movie very closely there are some hints that it gives you, but even those are hard to find and still not clear as to what they are hinting. I suggest you search the internet for more info before you see this movie, interviews with the director, fake websites set up for companies in the movie that more than likely have something to do with the monster, my space pages for the characters, that will help you understand a little bit more. But once again, even after doing all of that, you still won't be positive of what is happening or why, but you will at least have more information to draw your own conclusion. Now for the actual movie review :) I had very high expectations for this movie and it actually blew them away, I think the only other movie I have seen that has done that was the third Lord of the Rings. I have never been sucked into a movie like this before and never caught myself actually being nervous and on the edge of my seat. The only bad things that I can say about the movie are, #1, that the acting can be a bit amateur, I'm not sure if the actors did that on purpose to make them seem more real, or if they just were like that, but there's a few times, especially early on, that the acting isn't the greatest. However it's NOTHING that can't be overlooked and shouldn't hurt the experience. #2, if you get motion sickness easily, this might not be a good movie for you, I for one had no problems, but my fiancée, whom also loved the movie, had to look away a couple of times. I think the way they filmed it was awesome and added to the realism factor, but be ready to watch an entire movie through a hand-held camera. Other than that I can find no faults, I'm usually pretty picky and hard on movies but this was hands down the most realistic, intense movie I have ever seen. It feels weird describing a movie about a giant monster as realistic, but it is, you really feel like you are right there. There is a part of the movie that you could call gross, anybody who has seen it probably knows what I'm talking about, and when it happened my stomach actually churned. I have seen Hostel, Turistas, and many other movies that push the gross out factor and never even blinked. But I felt so strongly that what I was watching was real and that I was there, that when I saw what happened to this character, I actually felt sick to my stomach, and the craziest part is that technically, you don't actually even see what happens. Also, you DO see the monster, I don't know what people are complaining about, they don't put it in a well lit room and let you walk around it, but you see enough to get an idea of it, any more and I think it would have had less of an impact the times you do get a glimpse of it. In closing, this was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen, and I have a wide range of movies I think are excellent, from 12 Angry Men, to The Life of David Gale, to The Matrix, I give any movie a chance and this one DID NOT disappoint. I feel bad for the people that don't or didn't enjoy this movie and wanted a typical Hollywood destruction/monster movie, or were not angry that the movie didn't tell them more. This movie is a hands down must see and you have to see it in theaters to fully enjoy it, be ready for a very realistic, very intense, and very vague movie."
"Codezilla","8","7","15","19 January 2008"," A great theater experience!
","This is a great movie going experience. the only down side is the shaky cam, but this movie was incredible!<br/><br/>The monster was better than I thought it would be. The shots were intense, and perfectly executed.<br/><br/>The acting isn't great, but honestly I felt like I was watching a video of a bunch of my friends. People that are hating on the acting are probably over 40 and can't identify with that generation because the dialogue is almost spot on to todays 20 somethings to 30 somethings.<br/><br/>The ending - is by far the best part. I could go on and on, but this is a must see on the BIG screen. Don't look at it like a movie, but as an experience!!!"
"firegremlin","9","7","15","19 January 2008"," Its everything you wouldn't expect
","I have never commented on a movie on IMDb. I have been a fan of the site for years and I have been thoroughly influenced by movies my entire life. Growing up I have seen a lot of good movies, and a lot of crap. Cloverfield was the first movie that even made me comment. Not because it was the greatest movie ever made, which I won't lie and say it was, but it was worth every day I waited since I first saw the teaser trailer earlier in the summer. Knowing nothing about this movie is what makes it worth seeing. There's none of ""Ohh I saw that in the trailer"" crap. Every reaction seemed realistic and every emotion seemed real. Not because they were the best actor, even though they weren't nearly as bad as I would have though, but because you didn't know them. Real life isn't filled with good actor. Listen to people complain and they sound pretty stupid.<br/><br/>The filming did shake, but there is no steady cam in the real world. Go watch a home video and tell me Uncle Johnny is a grade A cameraman, you can't. You don't really learn to much about the characters, but that is because you have only been drawn into their lives for a few hours. There is no year gap where you can see them grow as people. You see them at their worst, at their barest level of fear. <br/><br/>So before you read a review on how bad the movie was go watch it and decide for yourself. I'm not saying you have to agree with me, but don't miss out on a very interesting movie experience by being afraid of what other people say."
"drew_tucker21","10","7","15","19 January 2008"," One of the best original movies in a long time!
","Getting to work at a movie theater has its perks: Getting to watch movies before they are released, and not paying for them.<br/><br/>I have to say that getting to see this movie for free was awesome, and after watching it, I would've gladly paid for a ticket. Reason? This movie is original. It's not your typical monster movie with a bunch of gory killings. This movie actually had a good plot. A monster attacks a city and the story is told from a person's point of view. Nothing else.<br/><br/>After the first real showing of this movie, I had to clean it. As I was holding the door for everyone, I couldn't believe my ears. People actually hated it! I could not understand how. I loved it! After talking with a bunch of people, they said that they were angry with the ending, and lack of history about the monster. I then explained that this movie was from one person's point of view (the camera). It only showed what was in front of it. I then explained that the ending was necessary. How else could it end? People are taking this movie too personal. New York has always been a city for movie destruction. King Kong, Godzilla, even foreign films. All monster movies. All from New York. Everyone knows what New York looks like. This movie has nothing to do with 9/11 and I really doubt the filmmakers were trying to remind you of it.<br/><br/>I have realized that most of the people that are complaining about this movie are older folks. They do not like that the camera shakes, and they do not like the lack of story. However, these are the things that made this film work. If this movie told the history of the monster, or what happened afterwards, it wouldn't have worked Plain and simple.<br/><br/>This was a simple movie about a monster that attacks a city."
"okleydokley-1","3","7","15","19 January 2008"," Something new that was not worth doing.
","I don't understand why everyone has to do something new.. Guess what, everything worth doing has been done. This is new, but not worth doing. I would explain it as boring with lots of motion sickness.. I thought that the idea of the movie was good, and I would not mind a little POV camera thrown in, but use some of the professional footage with lots of editing and color correction. The grainy footage with not cuts does not do it for me. (these cuts went on forever and felt like home movies). I really like JJ Abrams for all his TV shows (Lost, Alias, etc), but I think he made a mistake here. I do not want to pay $12.50 to watch someone else's home movies.. Save your money."
"db1985","8","7","15","19 January 2008"," ""Cloverfield"" better than expected.
","The beginning of the movie is pretty much what we all saw from the trailers on TV, everything else, you NEED to see for yourself. First, I will start off with the negatives. My first complaint was the story didn't have much time to develop, characters didn't have enough space for us to really understand them and who they are and what they do, but the rest of the movie makes up for that. There's Rob, who is headed to Japan, Hud, a guy who is ""documenting"" the party but unknowingly he is going to be the eye of the movie itself. The idea of this was truly exhilarating! Another thing, I realized more than once there were times where everyone in the entire theater had to tilt their heads to certain scenes, this became a little stressful and uneasy at times as I heard a lot of people complain and yell ""come on!"". Yes, the shaky camera does add realism to the movie but with a huge consequence. As a movie watcher, I find it aggravating to have to focus on the motion picture with my undivided attention, I had to squint a lot, to really see what the movie makers want you to see. This became tiresome a few times during the movie.<br/><br/>Positives: The story development was a B at best, it was nothing we have never seen or experienced before but we don't know why these creatures are here but they are, and they are winning in a battle against mankind but in the midst of all the horror, Rob, one of the main characters, goes on a self-journey to find the one he loves. This was the stories strong point, in my opinion. The man behind the camera, ""Hud"" adds humor and a few laughs during scary moments, which lightened up the mood a little bit and later in the movie, you start to really care for Hud and Rob, you get attached to these two men as they are best friends. The action was, without a doubt, the most intense in your face, thunderous, godlike and most realistic action scenes EVER to grace a motion picture. The fact that the movie really has no musical score also heightens the realism of the film. Midway through the movie, you start to realize, this does not seem like a movie, it seems like we are all watching an educational, horrific piece of evidence, a historical and tragic event that took place in time, and the world got to see the results through a camcorder on Friday, January 18th, 2008.<br/><br/>It's real, it's sick, it's gruesome, it's epic, its laugh out loud, this movie got my heart pumping more than any other movie I have ever laid eyes on.<br/><br/>It's so good, that I'm going to see it again in its 2nd weekend with a lot of friends because they need to experience it. Maybe if I can watch the movie from a straight angle, not in the very first row of the theater, this film would be 10 out of 10!"
"imyourcanary","10","7","15","19 January 2008"," Incredible, unique and, yes, ""intense""
","I feel a little weird giving this 10 stars, but I'm going to throw it out there, if only because it is completely unlike anything I've ever seen in my life. I've heard that said about many films before, and it's terribly cliché. I use that wording here because, for the first time, it's actually true.<br/><br/>Another cliché I've encountered when reading about this film is that it is ""intense."" I kind of laughed it off when reading reviews and hype leading up to the release, because I never seem able to lose myself enough within the imaginary world of a film to actually find it intense. After all is said and done, a movie is just a movie, and I've always understood that. With Cloverfield, (another cliché, coming up) I actually felt like I was there. As soon as that first explosion went off, I was there, and it was scary as hell.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with this film is the first 10 minutes or so, in which the acting and interaction between characters seems a bit fake and forced, but the rest of the film will wipe that from your memory. Other than that, just make sure to suspend disbelief, because some pretty preposterous things happen throughout the course of the film. To me, the probability of these events didn't matter as much as the overall spectacle and sensation that the film achieved.<br/><br/>I came into this film just expecting to see an entertaining, so-bad-it's funny film along the lines of a Godzilla movie, since I've been enjoying Godzilla films since my childhood. I've always thought the ""giant monster"" genre was something that was impossible to make scary or believable, because it's so inherently laughable. Watching this movie in the theatre scared the hell out of me. And movies never scare me.<br/><br/>Go see this in the theatre. It is a one-of-a-kind experience."
"tyankou","10","7","15","19 January 2008"," Marks the Beginning of an Emerging Genre
","I had high expectations going into this movie. I had seen the teaser trailer last summer and the flaming head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into the street blew me away - its sure to become the most iconic part of the movie. It wasn't until it re-emerged a few months later - title included - that I started getting really excited. Finally, now that I've seen it, I can honestly say...wow.<br/><br/>The movie actually begins before the events of the monster attack. We are introduced to Robert Hawkins and Beth Mclntyre about a month earlier. We then cut to the farewell party made famous by the teaser trailer. The reason for this is made clear when it is revealed that Hud - the cameraman for most of the movie and also the token comic-relief - is taping over a day Robert and Beth spent together. In fact, Hud stops recording at various points during the movie, giving you glimpses into the day Beth holds so close to her heart. The farewell party also does more than to just introduce the characters - I spent those first minutes of the movie on edge, knowing that everything was going to go to hell soon but having no idea when.<br/><br/>When it finally does hit the fan, you are thrown right into it. As you follow Robert, Hud, and a couple of others through the streets of Manhattan to escape the monster and find Beth, they do not catch a single break. From the first explosion until you crash into the ending, you'll always see them fighting, struggling, and running for their lives.<br/><br/>This constant feeling of danger is complimented by a wide variety of set pieces. As you progress through the movie, you'll watch as they escape a collapsing bridge; traverse a pitch-dark subway tunnel; scale a lopsided apartment building; and many more moments where you're always wondering what is going to happen next, and sometimes being surprised when you think you do.<br/><br/>In the end, I have nothing bad to say about this movie. Sure, the entire thing is shot with a handy-cam and the footage is sometimes shaky - but such is the draw of a movie that hasn't invoked such a sense of reality to something so fictitious since the Blair Witch Project. My only complaint is that these are the only two movies in what should be a well-rounded genre by now."

","This movie could have been really good had the camera not been so jerky. It was 10 times worse than the Bourne trilogy and a little worse than the blair witch project. My girlfriend and I had to walk out halway through, luckily I was able to read about the ending on wikipedia. Wait until it comes out on rental, it may not be so bad on a normal sized home TV. Another thing that I did not like is how they spent so long in the opening scenes establishing the characters. You are supposed to feel like you are one of the people at this fun little going away party. It's annonying because it takes up about one third of the movie and its sole purpose is to make you let your guard down. This way when the monster scenes finally come out, it's more shocking and scary. Overall, this was a poorly shot version of I Am Legend/War of the Worlds, save your money."
"gargamel_gargamel","3","7","15","18 January 2008"," If you think you want to see this movie read this first!!!!!!
","First of all, I understand that this movie will appeal to a certain crowd of people. But it will not appeal to most I feel. I gave it a 3 because there are certain parts that are.... well, okay. However, for the most part I just felt bored.<br/><br/>Problem one, the camera. I liked Blair Witch, I liked the bourne movies. People said those movies made them sick with the camera shaking.. I didn't. Even this one didn't nauseate me or give me a headache, but it was overused. Just simply overused. Any idiot can keep a camera more stable than Hud did. Also, even in parts when everybody is sitting still and the camera isn't shaking, the picture is either out of focus or out of frame... come on. Overused.<br/><br/>Problem two, the monster. Missiles, bombs, tanks, all sorts of ammunition expelled on this beast and nothing even phases it... even Godzilla feels pain, really. The sub-monsters that came off of it were cooler in that they were fast and scary and at least defeatable. It was obvious from the closeup of the big one that it has no exoskeleton and actually has what looks like soft spots (gills or lungs) on it's head that move when it breathes.... they weren't even scuffed after all the explosions..hmmm.<br/><br/>Problem three, the story. I saw every single thing coming. OOOh they are going to escape across the bridge, huh.... oh look the monster made the bridge fall down.... Rob's girlfriend is trapped in her apartment with a piece of rebar through her chest for 45 minutes.... instead of escaping I'm sure they'll go back after her in her apartment building that didn't 'quite' fall all the way over but happened to lean against an adjacent building so that you could climb out a window, blah, blah, blah, give me a break.. I'm sure she's fine and once they pick her up off the rebar she'll be able to run with the best of them.... Oh wait, that's what happens.. then everybody dies... real original. The monster seems to only want to stay in New York where thousands of troops are trying to kill it rather than crossing over to Jersey or going back to sea... oh, and the troops, wow! Thousands of troops with tanks and other heavy equipment are in the middle of Manhattan within minutes with the Brooklyn Bridge down and certain gridlock at every other entrance/exit to the island... I found myself extremely bored watching everything happen exactly as I thought it would. Even the last 3 surviving a helicopter crash while the 2 military personnel in the chopper died.. of course they lived... the movie's not over yet. And as others have said, the first 15 or so minutes at the party is absolute drivel.... waste of space.<br/><br/>I'll give it this, I liked the lack of music leaving you able to pick up on some of the same sounds the characters hear. I DO like the filming style, it does bring you into the situation, yet over used in this film greatly. Picking not so famous actors so that it seems like it could be anybody, and a pretty good job of keeping the details of the monster secret so that you are always looking forward to seeing it. I DO like that it doesn't give you all the answers.... but that kind of movie has to at least be entertaining or full of surprises... The people here that say it scared them or surprised them must have the mentality of five year olds. The theatre I saw it in had about 100 people in it and after the film was over EVERYBODY was laughing and saying what a horrible movie it was..<br/><br/>...is that how you want to spend your hard earned money??"
"ryanrobb87","8","7","15","18 January 2008"," Yep...it works....
","I just saw the midnight showing of Cloverfield, and overall I thought that approach worked very well. From the beginning I felt like I was there and apart of these people's world's which then get's very fun and even scary when they become attacked. When I first saw the preview I thought the whole idea of the movie being filmed in a digital camera point of view would just annoy me and take a way from the enjoyment of the movie, but actually it was on the complete opposite. Some of the cuts and editing worked fantastic given us that frantic feeling. I also liked the fact that they got mostly unknowns to play the parts. I thought that added to the effect of realism by letting the audience believe that they were there living in these people's worlds and lived up to the approach the director wanted, because had an A-list actor been casted it would have taken the audience out of their world, and we would have thought, ""oh there's Brad Pitt,"" and it just would have taken away from what the director was trying to do. With that the camera does get a little annoying at times, and I felt I may have lost some valuable information because it was frantic and I couldn't quite understand what was being said. Some questions, without giving anything away,of why some specific things occurred I felt weren't all that clear. Another problem some people might have is the ending. But the more that I think about it, I think the way it ended was appropriate to the approach and style of the movie leaving us with many questions, as it would it if this type of thing like this really happened. I also felt it was a bit short, but at the same time sweet. So overall I think this was a good idea and worked in so many areas, and at some points leaves the audience feeling what the characters in the movie are feeling. I felt like I was there and enjoyed it. But really you're just going to have to see it to judge for yourself because I have a feeling this will have a lot of mixed reviews."
"JamieClay","10","7","15","16 January 2008"," You may be surprised at how much this film doesn't suck.
","Most of us know that 99% of the films released between January to mid April pretty much suck, it's been Hollywood's dumping ground for years. This film may just change that and may lead the way to better films being released this time of year. (yah right) <br/><br/>If you like the horror genre and of course Godzilla monster movies then you should have a blast with this one. The unique angle to this film is how the story unfolds, through the lens of one very lucky camcorder (because obviously it survived). <br/><br/>The first 25 minutes of the movie unfold slowly but help us get to know the characters through small snippets of reality recorded (and over recorded) onto the camera - in a fashion pretty much how we all use camcorders - candidly, sporadically, erroneously and spontaneously . <br/><br/>This may try your patience but look at it as the ride to the top of a roller coaster, enjoy the pretty people and get to know them. This will help to make what comes next even more entertaining and suspenseful.<br/><br/>The script does a good job of escalating the horror and for the most part it feels real, as much as one might expect given the circumstances.<br/><br/>Three suggestions for seeing this film, - see it in the theater (don't wait for it to come out on DVD) - see it in as big an audience as you can for the group reaction - avoid seeing any spoilers that show you the actual monster. I say this NOT because the monster is surprisingly original, it's just that the less you know what to expect the better the suspense. During the film you get caught up in the discovery of 'it' and in the small doses one might in real life.<br/><br/>Bonus extra suggestion, sit as far back in the theater as you can - at least that helps me to deal with all the hand held footage.<br/><br/>##2ND VIEWING UPDATE: After the first viewing I had the oddest experience in that I kept expecting to turn on the news to get an update on how things were in NYC, very much like post 9/11, 'it' had left that much of a resonance in my head.<br/><br/>So, I went to see it again with a bunch of friends and found the movie to be even better. I was able to pick up on many of the little details that I missed the first time. For me, this is a film that improves the more you see it.<br/><br/>3rd Viewing notes:(yes I've seen it 3 times now) In the previous two viewings I didn't stay for the credits. The music is AWESOME, and there is a geek tease at the very end. The very last bit of audio, but you have to record it and reverse it to hear what is said. (and that's all I'll say about that).<br/><br/>*********************************** Technical Spoiler section *********************************** <br/><br/>The Monster  Not a great design (my opinion) and kind of a cliché style - I can see why it was kept a secret. At times it reminded me of Violator, other times like the Rancor Monster from Star Wars. (ewww what if Violator and Rancor mated???) I'm sure it's real hard to come up with genuinely original looking monster these days. Frankly a large crab would have been as effective. :)<br/><br/>The smaller Monsters  looked pretty much like the bug monsters from Star Ship Troopers, again not original but still fun to have attacking people.<br/><br/>The star of the film, the Camera (and this comment is VERY petty): The film was shot on a tape based camera (the film presents itself as a single tape recording) 80 minutes is too long as most camcorders by default are set in SP mode giving you 60 minutes tops. It could have been set to LP mode (about 95 minutes) but it's not likely.<br/><br/>Oh and for you American Godzilla fans there is one shot in this that should come across as sort of an homage.<br/><br/>##2ND VIEWING UPDATE: The film opening said it was found on an SD card / camera. SD video is recorded in individual files with each start and stop of the camera, plus the actors refer to the tape a number of times. This is another petty technical over site, BTW.<br/><br/>##3rd viewing note: At the end, you find yourself looking out at the ocean, keep a close watch just to the left of the boat near the shoreline. Something falls from the sky and splashes into the water. No smoke trail.<br/><br/>Also - the reversed audio at the end of the credits sounds like Rob saying ""It's still alive""."
"bkoganbing","6","8","18","2 February 2008"," First Camera Perspective
","Unless there was a lot of clover in the fields of Central Park where some of the story of Cloverfield takes place, I'm not sure of the significance of the title here.<br/><br/>Director Matt Reeves had the interesting idea of filming this movie in the first camera perspective. The film is the recorded viewpoint of a video camera and whomever is holding it at the time. Just about every one of those Fifties Science Fiction films takes it from the viewpoint of the people who will eventually slay the monster or defeat the aliens, whatever. You see masses of folks running in panic from whatever the threat is.<br/><br/>What we've got in Cloverfield is a group of ordinary 20 somethings having a party. When some kind of alien invasion hits New York City. Then the group of them take off in understandable panic in search of safety. The film is about that quest for safety.<br/><br/>No name players of any kind are used here and to be sure that does give the audience a good identification. They're not a terribly interesting bunch though, I'm not sure if I really cared whether they made it or not.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is an interesting, but not terribly entertaining science fiction film."
"abm_10","2","8","18","20 January 2008"," Bad idea
","The camera work is done from the point of view of one of the characters. If you get motion sickness...DO NOT WATCH.....and if you're squeamish....DO NOT WATCH. And the ending was horrible. It was like they couldn't think of a creative way to finish the movies so it just stops. Overall, not a very good movie at all. There are so many better things they could have done with what they had. The special effects, especially on the buildings are the only saving grace of the entire movie. It was a disappointment and not worth the gas and money I paid to see the movie. It might would be a better movie if you could watch it in you're own home on a smaller screen, but watching it on the big screen was too much like you were in the movie and the jerkiness of the camera was irritating and made me sick to my stomach. There were several other complaints of this nature when I spoke to others who had watched the movie."
"Kingonads","2","8","18","20 January 2008"," I want my money back, complete waist of time.
","This was a fine example of advertising winning one for the movie. The advertisements were WAY better than the actual movie. This was nothing more than another Blair Witch Project, with the big bad thing being shown instead of being a mystery through the whole movie. This was nothing original, new, innovative or exciting. I about went to sleep through the bad acting of the character build ups. I was bored to tears through the monster attacks. The droning of the cast as they meandered across the Brooklyn Bridge was unrealistic and insulting. The military showing up artillery tracks leading the way after fifteen minutes of the monster showing up is well NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Note: 9-11 it took the army almost a solid day to make it to the towers. Another thing this movie has shown to me that the word ""dude"" can be used every 30 seconds and almost be as sickening as the movement of the camera. So I am to believe that the whole movie, length of the home video document, is to be 85minutes? Again lets poke holes in that one. Party roughly started at 10PM, Main character shows up at 1130PM-12AM... Monster strikes at about 1 maybe 2AM.. so the battery on the camera lasted 8 hours till sunrise while using Nightvision, and a light and filming being slammed around dropped and thrown. Hmm... again I want this camera cause it must be made by the Unubtainium Corp, in Never Never Land. There were so many bad parts in this movie most of the audience actually boo'ed at the end of it, and I wasn't the only one to demand my money back. JJ Abrams has lost ALL respect from me, and I doubt I will go and see the Startrek movie because of his name being on it. The only thing I gave him a 2 for was because of the advertising campaign. Every time I think about this movie it makes me madder that I waisted 13 bucks to see it. Its almost like wanting chocolate and eating a turd."

","Cloverfield was like a bad mixture of the Blair Witch Project and the Godzilla remake. Sad part is, both of those movies, which are not great movies, are much better than Cloverfield. Between the obvious product placements, the unlikelihood that anyone would actually carry around a video camera during all this ""chaos"", and the first 30 minutes of torture you must endure to get to any action, I thought my head would explode. Nothing original, as others have mentioned. Only a lot of other ideas combined into one bad experience. I'm mad at myself for being talked into seeing this fiasco. Watch the trailer.

"jbrown-46","9","8","18","19 January 2008"," A dark, depressing movie; some will enjoy, others will be disturbed.
","The monster movie genre is as old as cinema yet in almost every film from Godzilla to King Kong the star of the movies are the monsters themselves with the humans often viewed as the antagonists or cause of the monster's rampage.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a whole different ball game. The movie is filmed entirely through a hand camera; if The Blair Witch project made you nauseas, this movie will do the same. The beginning starts off slowly as we get to know some characters, all of which happen to be generic rich teenagers who have their own little back stories filled with love interests and sexual encounters. Eventually, they hear a roar, witness an explosion, and the movie kicks off in full force.<br/><br/>Before seeing the movie, get this out of your head right now: this is not a traditional destroy-the-city-flick. This movie is about survival. Very little is explained, the monster's origins are kept in the dark, you hardly see the creature for more than a couple of seconds, and the film doesn't hold your hand in any way. Cloverfield is a roller coaster ride of suspense and thrills. While some may draw comparisons between the destruction of Manhattan to that of 9/11, the fact remains that the film's focus is on the plight and survival of the humans involved.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a tale about how a group of plucky youths overcome their fears and defeat an ancient god-like creature, then you'll be sorely disappointed. Cloverfield is dark and tragic while bordering on depressing. There is no hope. There is no bright light at the end of the tunnel. There is only death, destruction, and carnage. There are no morals or lessons-to-be-learned about preserving the environment or the fallacy of mankind. Cloverfield is more akin to a film about natural selection where the strong live and the weak die.<br/><br/>If you don't like tragedies, stay far away. If you're in the mood for a wild action flick with an engrossing atmosphere and dark images then you'll leave the theater very satisfied."

It basically shows a monster (of unknown origin) destroying parts of Manhattan.

I simply cannot explain to myself how this piece of work can receive a 7.9. I guess a smart marketing campaign does suffice as a substitute for a good plot. Actually I just named it: This movie has no plot! But even that could be forgiven as there are tons of movies without a plot that still have something to them. The most annoying part about this piece of work is the fact that the characters are simply aggravating! As they pass away during the course of the movie, all one can think of is: Meh. I couldn't care less. No sympathy. The motivation for their stupendously foolish way of action is just too unrealistic. And yes, I know that this is not supposed to be a drama so character development is not a priority. But this?!? There's porn with smarter characters out there! I left the movie feeling as if this movie was simply made to take the mickey out of the audience. I really wanted the wasted one and a half hours of my life back. To make matters worse there is no sense to the whole thing whatsoever.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Have been trying to find something good to say about the film and all I can come up with is that it's unconventional. I am a fan of unconventional, but prefer it mixed with a dose of substance. This is nothing more than a bunch of second tier TV actors running around being filmed in the dark by some hand held cameras. Blair Witch Project blended with Godzilla on September 11 just as the War of the Worlds begins.<br/><br/>The only suspense here is whether anyone in your audience will barf from motion sickness. OK, it is loud. And unconventional. Oh, another positive ... there are no opening credits and no need to stick around for the closing credits. The best of the actors is Lizzy Caplan, who gives her best (but not good enough) Zooey Deschanel impersonation.<br/><br/>Oh, and there is a monster who changes shapes and experiences no apparent side effects from the mightiest military weapons. That is unconventional. Director Matt Reeves (""Felicity"" is his main claim) doesn't give us too many real shots of the monster, which is probably a good thing.<br/><br/>Pretty sure most of this was filmed on a sound stage and I assume there were numerous camera operators ... one's arms would get awfully tired jiggling a camera around non-stop. Not sure who the target audience is since we never really get a chance to know any characters, but I will say the film is unconventional ... and lacking substance."

I had forgotten that it would also take up two hours of my life, which is the part I want refunded. The attempts at verisimilitude via the hand-cam were, in a nutshell, ridiculous. The movie was a B-movie with a C-movie script and cinematography but A-movie advertising.

"Gojira8-1","8","5","10","19 January 2008"," A unique approach to a classic genre...
","So, here I am, the day after seeing Cloverfield on opening night, having been able to ""sleep on it"" before expressing my views. So, here it goes...<br/><br/>I knew from the get-go that Cloverfield would be shot through the viewpoint of a camcorder, following a bunch of young adults around NYC as they attempt to survive a monster attack. Right away you can see where this could go terribly wrong, as I did, but nonetheless I reserved judgement until the movie spoke for itself. And did it ever.<br/><br/>In short, this is a very good movie, especially for a monster film. I honestly think this blows the 1998 American ""Godzilla"" movie out of the water. Why do I feel this way? For five reasons: <br/><br/>1. The movie's unique point of view (first-person via camera) and the video quality of said camera gives a very ""realistic"" look to the whole thing, like something you'd expect to upload and watch on YouTube. And just like would happen, the camera shakes back and froth, jumps up and down, and cuts in-and-out multiple times. Yes, this could get very annoying, but fortunately I think the movie captivates you enough that you really don't mind it so much in the long run.<br/><br/>2. The characters are interesting and believable. I must admit, the first twenty minutes of the movie, mostly shot during the going-away party, is not my cup of tea when it comes to settings and people, and I may have thought to myself at one point ""anytime the monster wants to show, please do,"" but really it did good at giving us a feel for who these people are and where they're coming from. Hence, you come to either love or hate or just find annoying the people we end up following, just as you would in real life.<br/><br/>3. The monster was very interesting in design and though not the best looking beastie I've ever laid eyes on, I have to give him thumbs up for presenting us with an unconventional creature to rip apart the Big Apple. What especially works here is that we see very little of it, that we don't know what it is, nor where it came from, nor why it's attacking. That might sound frustrating, but think of all the cheesy plot lines the writers avoided by literally dumping us into the middle of a monster rampage: no long drawn out scientific explanation as to its origin and motives (""it's a product of nuclear testing and has chosen New York as a nest for its eggs""); it just IS.<br/><br/>4. The ""gore"" factor, though very limited, I thought left a powerful impression. I only recall three real ""gore"" scenes; shoots of wounded and dead in mall, girl explodes, and another girl impaled by rod. All are very brief and mostly ""off screen"" but the execution of them and the mood you're in by the time they arrive really adds to the horror and mystery of just how this creature operates. (Does it implant a parasite into a human host, ala Alien?) <br/><br/>5. The music. Wait... what music? Exactly! My favorite aspect of any movie is often the soundtrack. But alas! No music is to be found gracing this motion picture! But it works; never during the movie do we expect to hear any sort of soundtrack kick in and heighten the mood. Everything plays off very realistically. But even so, I must mention the end credits, for during them an actual orchestral piece composed as the monster's theme does play. And it's FANTASTIC! This composer--Michael Giacchino--never ceases to blow my mind away. His theme, entitled ""ROAR!"" takes you back to the classic 50s monster/alien B-movies and Japanese kaiju eiga--in fact, I think it'd do swell in a real (Japanese) Godzilla film! I give two big thumbs way up to this guy! Do yourself a favor and sit through all the credits--it's almost wroth the ticket price alone!<br/><br/>On a side note, I must mention that throughout the movie at various points my mind recalled all-too-clear images of 9/11; falling skyscrapers, cities and people covered in smoke, ash and dust, pieces of paper flying and falling through the air, buildings half crumbling full of the dead and dying, utter confusion and panic as the driving emotion... I also thought to myself: was this perhaps how the Japanese felt while watching the original Godzilla movie back in 1954? I don't consider such similarities to be a negative thing. True, such reminders may prove unpleasant for some, but they add two imporntant factors to the film: first, because we all ""experienced"" 9/11 we all feel that we can ""relate"" to it, or at least re-visit those past emotions; this brings you right into the film and gives it more realism. Second, for those same reasons, it helps to pass off an unbelievable idea as real by putting the impossible into real-life scenerios. And--as in the case of the first Godzilla movie--a third point stands out; it drives home the message and allogory of ""monster=nuclear bomb/terrorist"". However, I get the impression that Cloverfield wasn't meant to be a political statement, as Godzilla was, so this third point may be ignored.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, I must admit that Cloverfield is not perfect. But it is different. It does not entertain. But it does exhaust you. It does not fall gently on your ears. But it will shake you up. The point is, if you're wanting to see a movie like King Kong, then go see King Kong, because you won't find it here."

","I do believe this is one of those movies you either love or hate. For me, it was a breath of fresh air. It was realistic in a way unexpected for a horror/sci-fi flick. It must have been a combination of the first person camera view, along with the acting, which I found to be way above average, since the actors made their fight for survival seem real. You were in for the ride, right besides the protagonists; and what a ride it was. I won't go into any details because the purpose of this review is to make more people go see it and I wouldn't want to spoil anything for them. When all hell broke loose, I felt absolutely submerged in the action, almost like playing a really realistic first person shooter. This movie certainly brought something new to a somewhat aging genre. It's not even about the monsters and people getting killed, it is about changing your point of view and showing you how things can be done differently and still work out in the end, to bring you an emotional thrill ride. Having in mind the budget, I really don't know how they made it work this well, this gem of a movie is up there with the best of them. To sum it up, this movie is great and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it."

The set up of the so called ""plot"" was quite poor. We were introduced to to many characters in the beginning, and did not know much about them. Also, it appeared to be a cross between a Godzilla movie and the Blair Witch project. The lighting was terrible, and so was the focus on the people as opposed to what was really going on around the city. If I wanted to watch a story on survival and humanity i'd turn on the discovery channel. All in all I would put this movie in the bottom 100 movies of all time."

","Cloverfield goes for the found-civilian-documentary approach, and then violates it's own rules by adding lame acting and stupid out-of-a-video game situations. The Blair Witch Project stuck with it's documentary style all the way up to the end. That's not the case with Cloverfield, and all those stupid decisions (keep the camera taping while on desperate situations, for example) just destroy the concept of 'reality' it's trying to imply. We end up with a boring story and some glimpses of what could really be a devastating attack on New York City. Lets face it: this thing wants you to feel it did happen. The problem is that it sticks so many regular narrative vehicles it doesn't feel real. Then the pace and ideas start to repeat over and over, until everything feels exahusted. There's one point where you stop getting amazed and just begin to wonder when the hell it's going to end. It's no better than Emmerich's Godzilla."

"bill_b4","10","6","13","19 January 2008"," Ingenious Storytelling
","I have to say...this movie is good on many levels. First of all, the plot is fascinating. Having borrowed a page from the best video games, the monster and the havoc it wrecks on New York City is ""edge-of-your-seat"" captivating. Fans of Half-Life II might relate. This screen gem brings back the thrill of the MONSTER MOVIE. As a kid, I LOVED the old Godzilla & Gamera movies, but as an adult, those movies became corny and outdated. This movie brings back that thrill in a fresh, contemporary setting with all the anticipation and chills I experienced with those classics as a child. I couldn't really enjoy the Godzilla remake because that's all it was...a remake.<br/><br/>Godzilla represented the fears of Atomic war, but I think this monster does a great job representing the next generational challenge: terrorism. Faceless, a humongous threat that can knock down buildings and ruin cities, but also affect everyone on a more personal level. I don't think it was mere coincidence the monster in this movie and it's assault on New York City was portrayed similar in nature to the fear, horror and devastation experienced during 911.<br/><br/>The next piece of praise I have for this movie are the special effects. Absolutely amazing is all I have to say. And as spectacular as the visual effects are, the SOUND effects must receive special mention. To it's benefit, this movie does not have a soundtrack that tells you how to feel...rather you feel this movie through the numbing bass tones you would expect to experience in an earth moving event such as an earthquake. The monster's earth shattering footsteps and distinct roar brought back the fear experienced in the unique, terrifying sensation heard with the death ray of the original ""War Of The Worlds"". It's easy to overlook the challenge movie makers undertake to recreate a memorable audible experience, until you consider less-successful attempts. For example, Steven Spielberg's attempt to recreate the terrifying sound of the Martian machines in his remake fell far short of the original, but in this movie, the sounds that originate from the monster are haunting to say the least, both in it's roar and in it's attack on the city.<br/><br/>I reserve my greatest praise for last. J.J. Abrams & Co. have cracked the code. In my opinion, the most entertaining experiences in the past 10-15 years have come from the video game world, especially first-person shooters (ie Doom & Half-Life). But Hollywood has had a less-than stellar track record in trying to reproduce those experiences on the big screen. Their solution to that problem was so simple and yet so ingenious, I'm surprised no one had previously thought of it...depict the movie from the point of view of a character stuck with holding the camera through the whole experience. Now don't get me wrong...the first-person portrayal has been done...most infamously with The Blair Witch Project. I did enjoy The Blair Witch, but that movie was supernatural and small in scope, whereas Cloverfield is large and earth-threatening...a truly grandiose cinematic experience. I took my family of five and two friends of my children...and paid a pretty penny...but felt it was worth it.<br/><br/>Just a word of advice. Because of the unique perspective the story is told through, one or two sequences are dizzying. If you grab a seat toward the back of the theater, you'll minimize the potential for ""motion-sickness"".<br/><br/>To summarize, if you are up for a unique cinematic experience, a thought-provoking, captivating plot, with earth-shattering visual and audio effects that go a long way toward effectively portraying the story from a first-person shooter perspective...you'll enjoy this movie. If you like movies that tell you how to think and feel, if you enjoy brainless mind-pap, reserve your copy of ""House Of The Dead"" today, and leave enough seats in the theater for me and my family."

We went to the digital version, and it was just as good of quality as any film movie I've seen. <br/><br/>The monster in Cloverfield is worth seeing, its not like any movie monster I have seen before. As if Denzel Washington were the monster screaming ""King Kong Ain't Got Sh*t On Me!"" It's so true. <br/><br/>You get emotionally attached to most of the characters and laugh and love along with them. You feel their pain and their fear as they try to survive an attack unlike anything you have seen in the theaters before. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to all who enjoy new directing and filming techniques, and just general lovers of movies.

","This film is what The Blair Witch and the American Godzilla wanted to be. Those of us who grew up in the 50s and 60s and watched all the giant something-or-other movies on TV after school or Friday's Fright Night late show saw a world where scientists with screwdrivers, pilots, soldiers, reporters, or teenagers with headlights could stop monsters. And there was always the lengthy exposition scene to tell us where the monster came from and what it wanted. Cloverfield has none of those conceits. It just shows ordinary people in an extraordinary circumstance they don't understand--which, I imagine, is how it would really be for the average person if something the size of a skyscraper attacked his or her city. Cloverfield is a stunning piece of work."

"tony2847","9","7","16","19 January 2008"," Exhilarating terror.
","We were pretty early for the film and I was worried there wouldn't be a crowd. Yes, I wanted a crowd. This fear was unwarranted because just before the previews started the place filled up. Mostly adults. Think about that for a moment. Adults, filling a theater at two in the afternoon on a weekday. My friend Jason and I were a little nervous that the film might suck and we'd look silly for being so excited about it for as long as we have been. One person who was leaving the theater after an earlier showing said 'It sucked'. We didn't believe them. The previews were ones I've already seen before except for one. It's was a teaser for the next J.J. Abrahms film and the audience was all atwitter about it. I won't tell you what that film is going to be but it'll be huge.<br/><br/>The film opens and it's immediately apparent that it will perfect. The first twenty minutes is basically set up. Talking, no action. Even this part was great. The humor and camera work was done well. Jason turned to me and said 'How could this film not be great? This is awesome!' <br/><br/>The drama reaches an apex and then things go wrong. Very wrong. I get the added anxiety because New York is still vivid in my mind and I love that city. Seeing the city empty in 'I Am Legend' was fascinating. Watching this city get destroyed was also fascinating, but also brought back memories of 9/11. The destruction is massive and believable.<br/><br/>You, the reader have questions. You want to know what the 'thing' is. You want to know what the film is actually about. Trust me, you don't want to know. Just let it unfold. Pretend it's you in the situation, imagine yourself as one of the characters and what you would do. I found everyone's reactions reasonable and logical. The terror one would experience during such an ordeal makes for strange decisions. I found my reactions occasionally divergent with the people on screen but it turns out my reactions would have gotten me killed simply because I didn't have enough information about the situation. On the ground, you don't really know how bad it is. The situation is beyond bad. Beyond dire. Escape? Wait it out? Hide? Good luck.<br/><br/>Jason and I have similar tastes in films and I can't tell you how many times we said 'What!?' in unison or swore in disbelief. I jumped many times, my hands clenched, pulse racing. At one point Jen screamed. We all did. My hand actually went out towards the screen in self defense. It didn't work. A moment expected yet totally unexpected. There were many moments of shock and they were earned, not cheap. A quiet terror builds inside, a numbness. 'This can't be happening.' One minute you feel hope, the next despair. You keep begging them to run. Run faster actually.<br/><br/>You'll be hard pressed to stop watching and I don't recommend you leave the theater for more popcorn or to go pee. You'll definitely miss something. Don't take your eyes of the screen at the end. Yes, you'll know when the film is ending because it's almost perfect. You should sit through the credits as well. The film leaves you wanting more and you'll have many questions. During the credits Jason remarked that he'd never seen so many people still seated and talking with each other after a film. He was right. People were in no hurry to leave.<br/><br/>Jen and I talked about it and we're going to go see it again tomorrow in Federal Way. Yes, it's that good."
"Power_Fan","4","7","16","17 January 2008"," Disappointing Disaster Movie
","As a big fan of disaster movies like 'The Day After Tomorrow', 'Titanic' and the 'Godzilla' series, I found this movie to be very disappointing. I believe that the director's idea of filming the movie as if it were done by someone with a hand-held video camera a bad idea. For starters half the time you are watching the cameraman's feet or you never really get a good look at anything happening. Also the fact that it is filmed like this, gives you very little background information about the monster in the film and whats going on. Another reason why this can hardly be called a disaster movie is because you see very little destruction of buildings or people being killed. The whole Statue of Liberty picture to hype up the film was barely used, you never see the monster destroying the statue, you just see it's head in the street... weak. I see disaster films to see buildings destroyed, landmarks ruined and people suffering, this film completely lacked all those aspects. Finally the ending was pathetic, aside from the fact that for a disaster film it was very short, you never get to see the city in ruins, just people's faces looking at the camera.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of disaster films, AVOID and see the excellent 'I Am Legend' instead."

Abrams, the man who gave us the tricksy TV series LOST, this is a monster flick with a difference: it's shown entirely from the ground, from the point of view of the humans caught up in the carnage. As such, when the first twenty-minute set up is over and the film begins for real, you're in for a real, original treat with this movie. I've long been a fan of monster flicks and this is no doubt the scariest ""giant creature rampage"" you'll see.<br/><br/>The hand-held camera vantage point manages to combine gritty on-the-street realism with glossy mega-bucks effects work, and the result is often phenomenal on a visual level. Buildings crumble like on 9/11; people are infected by hideous spider-like parasites and everything is burning, blowing up or getting crushed. The monster itself is a rarely-seen beastie that came from the sea and should have stayed there; it's origins are never fully described and that works in the film's favour.<br/><br/>The acting's great from the cast, and I could fault no performances; I especially liked cameraman Hud, whose simple-minded footage works in the movie's favour. Some have compared this to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and indeed it IS like that film, except down with a multi-million dollar budget. It's not quite as frightening but there are plenty of pants-wetting moments, like the bit in the tunnel and the (literally) overwhelming climax. Forget about that awful US remake of GODZILLA: CLOVERFIELD is what that film SHOULD have been. It's taut, short, straightforward and simple: people running around a city while a monster and its minions wreak havoc. Gruesome, dark fun throughout."
"john-maidhof","1","3","5","1 January 2015"," Worst movie I have ever seen
","The camera work is not innovative or clever it is substandard, it is so bad it will start annoying most people right away. After the seizure inducing mishandling of the camera has gotten under your skin the D-bag holding the camera will start whining, pissing you off even more. I kept waiting for him to die, I really want to track down the actor and director and punch them both in the face. This is genuinely the first movie to actually make me angry, I hate it with an unnatural level of passion. The rest of the movie is irrelevant with the usual ""stupid horror movie"" behaviors being exhibited by all of the irrelevant characters. The ""big military scene"" at the end was a nice reprieve from the stupidity of everything leading up to it. Which is unusual because I get tired of excessive gun fire in movies, here though, it was nice to have gunshots drown out the stupidity of the cast.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's an all around great movie!"
"OllieSuave-007","4","3","5","25 May 2014"," Had to take a Dramaine to watch this.
","This is an entire movie shot with a shaky camcorder that tells about a monster attack in New York, told from the point-of-view of a group of youngsters. Because of the shakiness of the picture, the film was an uncomfortable and unpleasant experience. I had to take a Dramamine and lay down on the sofa to watch the movie. <br/><br/>I know the filmmakers wanted to make a unique film that captures the tension and atmosphere of the people with the camcorder's viewpoint; however, this film did have several flaws: The story was confusing to follow - just a lot of mishmash and running around; the character developments were non-existent; visual effects were bad (you can hardly see the monster); and the acting was below average.<br/><br/>I do have to admit that the overall monster presence was pretty thrilling, reminding you of a Godzilla-like creature. However, I would pass on this film over something more steadier to watch. There are a lot much better giant monster movies out there. <br/><br/>Grade D-"
"sirinbayraktar","1","3","5","22 May 2013"," ıt was not good.ı do not suggest this movie.
","It was awful. ı did not like it because it was not realistic and they tried to made a scary movie but they did not acvihe. also they used a hand camera for making the movie realistic but it wasn't. that's all. ı think ıt was not good movie the scriptwriter could be more creative. as ı said it again this movie was not realistic and we can understand that from this example;It's clear that Rob didn't record for 7 hours. There are about 70 minutes of footage in the movie, so the battery would only have had to last that long. Most consumer digital cameras, even battery-hungry miniDV devices, boast a recording time of more than 2 hours on the supplied battery pack, and on the order of five hours on the manufacturer's high- endurance option. and another example like that is here; When Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena are hiding in the subway, Rob gets a call from his mom and has a conversation with her on his cell phone. There is no cell phone reception underground in the subways."
"muhammed_kok_92","3","3","5","18 May 2013"," The most disgusting movie ever!
","I have not seen such a boring movie which cause me fall asleep while watching. Visual effects and even the story of movie support my opinion. For that reason, I will never watch and of course not to suggest anyone to watch it. It will probably be the worst time you spend in front of the television. Especially for those who are eager with watching high rated movies on popular sites, that one will possibly be disappointed. Firstly, I did not like that movie any because the type of recording film I mean to record a movie with a hand camera seems to me a bit weird. Also during movie, I could not comprehend the main message which is trying to given. In my opinion, there cannot be such a creature as it is shown very shortly in movie, and that was not believable of course. For these reasons all above, I strongly do not suggest people to watch that movie at all."

","Last week, I watched this movie from DVD with my friends. Supposedly, The film occurs with pictures which one's taken by camera. The name of the film is Cloverfield but you see monsters too little and too short in film. The film shows a stupid man who wanders from place to place. The scenes are bad and complex to notice. There is nothing in the film, any action or something else. I wrote 7-8 lines to comment this film. It was so bad movie that this film does not deserve any comment. It is just a waste of time.

"mrmac-1","4","3","5","16 October 2012"," The first 23 minutes
","23 or so minutes of uninteresting film. Lot of time in a film. Uninteresting people, unless you are actually there at the party. Stories are about us. Doesn't even need to be your age group, economic group, any group. But the story depends on some bit of interest in the difficulty, pleasure, angst, whatever, happening to those involved. In other words, we must feel some empathy with the story's characters, whether it's Star Wars or Cloverfield, or especially your own life.<br/><br/>23 minutes of watching these people live their lives. So what? If the story is confined to you at 20-something, then it;s only empathy for your age group, and that is certainly not going to give you any support once you reach 30. I like fluff as much as the next person, but I also need some balance. This story simply has no connection to real life. Even the fantastic must have a connection to everyday life, yours and mine.<br/><br/>It's always the extraordinary in the mundane, the ordinary. So, the imagination becomes so important in our everyday lives, let alone films. Even if your 20-swomething, remember when your were a kid? What did you use the last time you experienced a travesty, something painful, a loss, a taking away? Probably in some sense, it was your imagining something better, or at least something different. <br/><br/>I have worked in a bureaucracy for over 40 years, yet the most uninteresting people I have met and worked with, I would place in Cloverfield and make you a better film for their quirkiness, and certainly their innocence -- they are totally who they are. Would you truly trust any of these personalities in Cloverfield?<br/><br/>Call me nuts, call me crazy, but I watched The Avengers recently, and it's all ""pie in the sky,"" so to speak. ""Much ado about nothing? except special effects and superheroes acting without any connection to you and I. I do not need superheroes, but do require a certain amount of support and affection from my own superheroes, just a few friends. I do also need escape, but escape becomes boring quickly.<br/><br/>If you enjoy film stories, and perhaps feeling, my recommendations are three (these three are not difficult to view, but more difficult is Antonioni's The Passenger, which I've been able to watch only once):<br/><br/>Bin Jip (3 iron) a Korean film Another Earth Snow Flower and the Secret Fan<br/><br/>Take care and pay attention, Greg McCormick Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"
"cardel1","4","3","5","8 July 2010"," Rob, Rob, Rob!! We gotta stop using the hand-held!!
","This movie made over six times what it cost to produce but as far as I'm concerned, fell short of expectations. I know, I know, it's rated over 7/10 on this site but I am giving it low marks for two reasons: First and foremost is the use of the hand-held camera. I can't believe that filmmakers still think that it's original or artistic to film movies in this way. It may have been a novel idea when The Blair Witch Project was released but it's overstayed it's welcome. It's nauseating and detracts from the story!! I found myself concentrating more on the annoying camera work than on the movie itself. The 2nd reason for the low marks is due to the acting....it was poor! I'm sorry, I'm sure the actors tried but they didn't succeed. This movie needed a couple of more established, seasoned actors to motivate the lesser known cast members.<br/><br/>I like movies about creatures or monsters but one of the things I noticed is that we don't get too many close-up shots. I want to be able to take a good look at the detail (or lack thereof) but am so often disappointed because the shots are too dark or too fast moving. I guess I am little too fascinated by special F/X.<br/><br/>The box office numbers for this movie were purely due to the hype surrounding it's impending release as well as a decent marketing campaign. I truly believe it could have made twice what it did if it was shot the old fashioned way. Too bad they didn't shoot both ways and let the audience pick which style they preferred. It would have made for a great DVD or Blu-Ray release with 2 versions of the movie in one package. I'm sure there will be more movies shot in this style and the good thing is that we have a choice to watch them or NOT! Oh and if anyone knows what kind of battery Hud was using, I'd really like to know because I've never seen one last that long. Regards."
"lanquihue","2","3","5","25 October 2009"," Cloverfield is an insult to the human race
","Every now and then, a motion picture comes along that is simply an insult to humanity, more often than not, horror movies such as Cloverfield. This movie starts out so slow, I'm looking at my watch and thinking, ""Okay, I get it, a kid with a camcorder!"" It was a horribly long, drawn out, and completely ineffective way of introducing the characters that really didn't need to take place. What's so offensive about this particular movie, however, is the way the characters react to whatever's happening on-screen. When a director has people acting is such stupid ways, I'm left asking myself, ""Is this how he would act in a crisis? Does he honestly believe real people would act this stupid?"" This is one of those movies where, more often than not, you're yelling at the screen, ""You've got to be kidding me, who wrote and directed this garbage, that's not how real people react to crisis!"""

I kept willing the ""monster"" to eat them all just to put me out of my misery.<br/><br/>The characters, if they can be called that, are so one sided that they could be super-string.

As far as horror movies go, that includes everything from Disturbia to Sweeney Todd. I am shockedREALLY shocked to say that list does not include Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Yes, you've heard the story before. (Well, as far as this movie goes, that is. Who knows what the final plot will end up being.) But when it comes to this movie, really, who cares? The only thing I can compare the way this movie made me feel to was the original Alien. The characters were as realistic as really being at a real party. The camera just simply adds yet another added layer of realism. The plot was realistic, as I would have done nothing different than the main characters. I never once would have thought I would be writing the word ""Hollywood"" and ""realism"" anywhere near the same sentence.<br/><br/>The whole adventure is just awesome when I look back at it.

"piksplanet","10","3","5","11 April 2008"," Just loved it!!
","I'm yet to get out of the dizzy feeling I got after seeing Cloverfield. Basically for two reasons. The first being that its been shot on a hand-held camera. Secondly, what a movie! To say that J.J.Abrams and Matt Reeves make an awesome movie-making couple just doesn't say it. I loved the movie they had made a couple of years ago, The Pallbearer. This is contrast at it highest point. It's like Laurel and Hardy decided to make movies, and it was oh so good.<br/><br/>Yes, Cloverfield is a monster movie. But, unlike the monster movies which have been made more recently, this one works. It's from the point of view a a few 20-something's living in New York on the night of a farewell party. It's Blair Witch style. But better. It's Godzilla, but more terrifying. It's fear, its pain, its horror, its loud, its everything. All packaged into an hour and fifteen minutes of a roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>It is a look into the monster attack on Manhattan on 22nd-23rd May, 2007 recorded on a hand-held camera found in Central Park. The name of the movie is basically the name of the sighting. Read : Multiple sightings of case designated Cloverfield.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most was the hype created before its release. No one had a clue what it would be like. Whether the monster was Godzilla, some dragon, etc etc. I recognized no one in the cast except Jessica Lucas, whom I had seen on Life As We Know It and The L word. So, it was even more of a surprise for me. The casting is perfect, mind you. I haven't seen a bunch of 20-something's running for their lives more horrifically in my life. You can feel the terror. It's like its sitting there right beside you.<br/><br/>There is no background music. Its real time sound. Man, is it loud. Man, is it freaky. There's just something about the fact that there's a 400 foot monster roaming around somewhere near you that freaks anyone out. And that ain't all. Wait till you find out that its dropping little many-legged thingies making sounds like 'ayayayayaya' which could tear you limb from limb. Not just that. If you happen to get bitten by those little thingies, guess what happens.. You explode!! (Sorry for letting that go. I just could not help it) Behind all the horror and all the havoc of this 'monster', their lies a very well pronounced story. Something that most films lack these days. A bunch of people trying to save a loved one. It ain't no tear-jerker, but its bound to make you care for the characters. That, added with ""Dude, I really think we shouldn't be here"", and stuff that happens so fast that you'll go,'What the Hell was that!?""makes Cloverfield one of the best creature feature's you'll ever watch. Just listen to the havoc when the severed head of the Statue of Liberty falls to the streets. You'll know what fear is.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is short, exhilarating, sad, scary, all at the same time. It leaves certain questions unanswered. Even the closing credits were scary. I hear they're making a sequel. Eat your heart out King Kong and Godzilla. I was hooked on to this, from the time the thump hit and I saw that red robot running around the bushes. Then came the writing, Bad Robot Pictures. And the movie began..<br/><br/>9/10 for acting. 9/10 for story. 9/10 for direction. Straight 10 for the music. And I cannot get enough of the dizzy camera!"
"dpajur","5","3","5","3 March 2008"," American teenage comedy
","This is quite an interesting film, at first it starts off like any other teenage film, bunch of people at a party, having a few drinks, sending a friend off to Japan.<br/><br/>But soon it develops into so much more, an hour and a half of teenagers running around Manhattan screaming ""Oh my god, oh my god!"", while the city is being attacked by aliens.<br/><br/>Seems like a pretty unfortunate place, New York. First it's earthquakes, then it's aliens, then it's terrorists, then it's a government conspiracy, then it's terrorists again, then it's aliens. My god, when is Hollywood finally going to let the city rest? I guess the only good thing about the film is the mockumentary camera work which creates an interesting atmosphere and keeps the audience in the seats. Apart from that, well, you'll just have to face more of the same over and over again, but that's Hollywood, and apparently that's New York, too."
"Superunknovvn","8","3","5","15 February 2008"," The best behemoth movie I've ever seen. Period.
","After first having seen the now famous teaser trailer a couple of months ago, I thought that this movie - then tentatively referred to as ""Untitled J.J. Abrams Project"" - was going to be a fluke. A minor hit fueled by a clever marketing strategy. The teaser got me curious, but I thought the CGI-shot of the statue head landing in the New York streets looked cheap and fake. Unexpectedly, I was proved wrong. A lot of very positive reviews preceded the Austrian theatrical release of ""Cloverfield"" and having finally seen the movie now I have to say that all the praise is more than deserved. And the CGI has thankfully been worked on.<br/><br/>What makes ""Cloverfield"" work better than any other behemoth movie is quite simply the concept of having the whole thing being shot by one of the characters. Sure, that idea isn't new at all. ""The Blair Witch Project"" had done it years before ""Cloverfield"". Even George A. Romero has made his latest ""Living Dead"" flick with that technique. Still, the concept works best here. Somehow the contrast between this giant monster wrecking a whole city and this one guy with a small camera creates amazing tension. Showing the main characters' adventurous journey through the lens of a shaky, hand-held camera puts the audience right in the middle of the events. We never get an overview over the whole situation - neither visually nor plot-wise. Rockets, wreckage and monsters fly around our heads left and right and make us feel as if we were in the middle of a war. Don't see this without a Dolby Surround system! The sound design is brilliant. From the roars of the behemoth to the creepy, blood-thirsty gargling of its crab babies it makes your skin crawl. What adds to the realism of the movie is that there's no music, which also makes the jumps completely unpredictable.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" plays out almost like a Haunted House or a roller-coaster ride. We never know what waits around the corner for us. We only get very brief glimpses of the giant monster and its even more horrific little spider babies and every time we see something it scares the crap out of us. There's one scene that I liked in particular: the characters run through the streets and into an underground station. Shortly before they walk down the stairs the ""cameraman"" looks up and there's the monster letting out a terrifying roar. That moment is ten times more effective than any high gloss production like Roland Emmerich's ""Godzilla"" could ever have hoped to be.<br/><br/>Of course, another reason why the perspective of the guys in the streets running through the ruins of New York is so genuinely horrific these days, is because we've seen scenes like that on TV in real life-news. It's the memories of 9/11 that ""Cloverfield"" is toying with. Just like every good horror movie this one is incorporating current imagery of terror and fear.<br/><br/>The hand-held camera is not only used for action purposes, though. It also backs up the story brilliantly with occasional flashbacks that appear as the remains of previously filmed material on the video cassette in the camera. That is a very original stylistic touch and one of the great things about ""Cloverfield"": the movie is bursting with fresh ideas. This can also be said about the various settings, most of all a nerve grinding walk through the staircase of a half-collapsed skyscraper and a helicopter ride that you're never going to forget.<br/><br/>Even less spectacular scenes like the exposition at the beginning, which has been dismissed by some reviewers as being too long, is brilliant and fast paced to an extend where I thought, that I couldn't care less if a monster was coming any time soon or not. The characters alone, played solidly by a largely unknown cast, were interesting and well-crafted enough.<br/><br/>Finally, let's talk about the main attraction, the behemoth and its spawn. The big one itself must be one of the most memorable monsters in movie history, looking like something that jumped out of a Derek Hess-painting. Its spider babies are even creepier, though. Although they don't look that original, you can never go wrong with aggressive arachnids that lurk in the dark (see also ""Starship Troopers"" or ""Gremlins 2""). The CGI is fantastic, and even though it may not age well, in 2008 it looks flawless. There wasn't one special effects-scene in the movie that I didn't buy and that's also due to the fact that the camera is used so thoughtfully.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the direction. Director Matt Reeves does a superb job in that the whole ""filmed by an amateur""-feel never seems forced. We're shown exactly what Reeves wants us to see, yet it all feels completely coincidental and natural. I even bought the fact that the guy holding the camera would go on filming throughout the entire trip.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" sets new standards in its field. It outshines every other behemoth movie that has been released, yet, and raises the bar for the whole subgenre. You can't make them much better than Reeves and Abrams did with ""Cloverfield"", because this doesn't rely on CGI mostly, but on character development and tension. Similar projects will have a hard time topping this movie in the future."

","I saw the first 30 min of this film with gritted teeth and eyes that hurt, i understand the movie is designed to show the events from a first person perspective with a hand held camera, however the desire to give the impression of an amateur camera man making an amateur film has been overindulged so much that it is not possible (for me at least) to actually follow the film, my girlfriend who was with me actually felt sick and dizzy! i cant say much about the plot as i did not watch enough but it looked OK on that level, a big nasty monster devastates a major American city and we follow the progress of our main characters as they try to save themselves,fairly standard but its the telling of the story that counts, i thought the latest alien v predator was badly filmed but this is worse by light years."

Sure, the idea is to be realistic, because in real life there is of course no background music coming from nowhere and there is no camera crew filming you without you being aware of it. That's the best I can say about this junk. Warning (and i don't think that's a spoiler): the first 20 minutes of Cloverfilth are VERY boring and confusing."

This movie is not for anyone who gets the least bit motion sick!!! The woman who refunded our money was very sympathetic, though, and said numerous people have had the same problem.

","This movie is probably the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. I'm usually very open to new things in movies and I've never rated a movie as bad as this one. You are given no information at all throughout the movie, you have no idea what is going on until 3/4 of the way through the movie, and WORST of all, the entire movie is ""shot"" with a hand-held camera which bounces around all over, the ENTIRE movie! My friends and I were all nauseous at the end of the movie it was so bad. I had to close my eyes at times, not because it was scary, but so I wouldn't throw up. Also, the end of the movie has no conclusion, no closure, nothing, it basically just ends. BOO!"

","Cloverfield is essentially a love story. The city is being attacked by a monster and Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) must try and rescue Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) who didn't even know she was loved. His friends Lily Ford (Jesssica Lucas) and Hud (T.J. Miller) tag along to help. Hud films the movie so you rarely see his face.<br/><br/>There are so many reasons to dislike this movie, but I didn't. For those who have seen the trailer, there might be concerns that the camera action is too jerky. It is. It definitely is. The movie goes for realism so you have to suffer through some scenes that strained my ability to follow what was going on.<br/><br/>Regardless of the jerky camera action, I was leaning forward in my seat soaking in the action be it good or bad.<br/><br/>A great deal of mystery has been surrounding the monster. It doesn't stop while you are watching. Like the original Alien movie, the monster is a tease. You want to see more, but they keep showing portions of it and just tidbits. Thankfully the viewer is not robbed and some really good perspectives do get shown.<br/><br/>Although I did not laugh, many people did because Hud the cameraman isn't the brightest and some of the things he says or films does warrant laughter. It got a smile from me.<br/><br/>The monster attacking the city is accompanied by some smaller ones. If you've seen Starship Troopers, that's the best way to imagine them. Some of the CGI wire frames looked like it might have been borrowed from Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>The ending evoked mixed emotions for me. I really liked the way it was done. There were so many wrong ways it could have ended, but the movie shows a little respect for the characters and the ending is proof."

While the movie is reasonable, there is hardly any plot and the camera work (all being done handy-cam style, like blair witch) made me feel nauseous. I wasn't the only one. While it was rather nauseating, I will admit the camera work does seem fairly realistic, though, somewhat unnecessary. The special effects are really good, but the acting from a few characters is dismal. <br/><br/>All around, I would recommend this movie only for die hard Godzilla fans whilst it's still in the cinemas.

A movie that is weak in content is frequently stretched by using long periods of meaningless dialog.<br/><br/>Then, suddenly, there is a very loud 'boom' and I said to myself, 'now it begins'. 'Now it's going to live up to it's good ratings.'and for a few minutes it did. Buildings being destroyed. Vehicles overturned. Brief glimpses of the 'monster'. Then it slowed down again and never really got any better. <br/><br/>A very bad script. Poor direction.

","I apologize sincerely for not having been requisitely (and I do mean requisitely) impressed by this non-starter of a horror film. Frankly, there was not a single identifiable element of the plot or the setting that was not readily demonstrable as derivative of some previous B-movie or other. A purely technical inconsistency also plagues me from the start: how can an ostensibly ninety-foot creature (it looked much, much larger, but that's what the press releases all said) suffer from seven-foot parasites--and how can these be compared to whale lice? Whale lice are teeny, tiny creatures that infest the tiniest crevices, and whales have not the mechanical means (read as ""hands"") to remove them. A ninety-foot animal having seven-foot parasites equates to a six-foot human being having ""parasites"" five and one-half inches long: wouldn't the sufferer merely pick them off with his hands and toss them into the gutter?

A good movie experience for me, is when I get so absorbed in the movie that I forget that I am watching a movie or sitting in a chair. The perspective constantly reminded me of that.<br/><br/>The idea of 'oh, it'll be so much more realistic and thus scary' by shooting it, as if it were a real tape from the incident, bombs with 'how much longer, do I have to look at floors, running feet, and face shots that only show the mouth? The final part of the movie has a distinct Disney Land/Universal Studio ride feel. The action is over the top. A helicopter goes down. The guy with the camera gets chewed by the monster and spit out. Have you been in the ride of Star Wars or 'I shrunk the kids'? That's what it feels like. It makes you feel like you are in an audience, while someone keeps yelling 'oh, my god' in a pathetic approach to make you feel scared.<br/><br/>BTW, did anyone notice that the insects in the subway looked like small ant lions from the video game Half Life 2?"
"carcrazy89","10","4","8","24 January 2008"," Cloverfield delivers genuine thrills, genuine chills.
","Cloverfield is quite honestly one of, if not the best movie I've ever seen in my 18 years of life.<br/><br/>Many people complain repeatedly about the lack of realism in this movie. However, I think it's one of the most realistic ""monster attack"" movies ever.<br/><br/>Unlike most, there is no ""all-knowing"" human (i.e. a scientist) that understands the monster and knows how to stop it. The main characters also aren't officials that have extra knowledge of any events or the attack itself. They're just as confused as we are. The monster and the whole attack itself are all just one big mystery, which adds to the realism.<br/><br/>Some have said that the perfect shots of the monster would actually be impossible to get with a hand-held camera. The shots themselves are nowhere near perfect. They are just as shaky and short-lived as they should be from a camera held by a shaky civilian.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I could say I have with this movie is the main camera's longevity. The thing survived a helicopter crash, a near building collapse, getting picked up and thrown by the monster, and its battery life lasted well over seven hours.<br/><br/>Also, I thought the ending fit the movie very well. Leaving the last two main characters in a state of uncertain danger added to the rest of the movie's theme of confusion, panic, and overall chaos. The last few explosions and blackness also left the movie open for a sequel. Does the monster ever get defeated? Do the main characters survive? Hopefully there will be a Cloverfield 2 to tell us."

"Adorable","9","4","8","22 January 2008"," In a field of its own: getting the story right and the art of wowing viewers
","Since the dawn of humankind stories and narrative have been about perception. And good stories were the ones that managed to play tricks with their audience's perceptions. This doesn't have to be overly meaningful or oh-golly mind bending and life changing. It's enough to get much more than what you were expecting to get upon sitting down to hear the tale.<br/><br/>And this Cloverfield (CF) does so, so well. In fact, it's one of the best, most memorable movies of the decade so far. I was literally and physically gripped with emotion when it ended, a situation amplified by my prejudiced, indoctrinated psyche mumbling ""but it's a monster movie, for Pete's sake!"" That's like saying the Grand Canyon is a gap in the ground. It's true, but somewhat underwhelming and unappreciative. Put plainly, CF is a masterpiece of storytelling because it's potent and powerful, not to mention well managed: the thing is just over 80 minutes long and succeeds in narrating more than most would require three times as long for. It becomes omnipotent thanks to its short run, which means we only get fleeting glimpses of everything, from the beautiful to the terrifying.<br/><br/>CF is also a superb vehicle for some new and exciting talent. All actors herein rise to the challenge and perform marvelously, so here's hoping we'll be watching more from Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman, T.J Miller, Jessica Lucas and Mike Vogel sometime soon.<br/><br/>The film has been the subject of much speculation, with producer JJ Abrams of Alias and Lost fame and director Matt Reeves (Felicity) playing it hush hush. The wait was worth it, and indeed the team used CF as a neat way of acknowledging many of the other gorgeous stories we've all enjoyed in the past: War of the Worlds, Stephen King's The Mist, maybe even TV series Jericho. Of course Godzilla  perhaps more 1998's US Godzilla than the original movies, but that was a fun version no matter how you look at it.<br/><br/>CF, on the other hand, isn't about fun. It's about sheer emotional and contextual impact. It starts with a going away party for one Rob Hawkins (Stahl-David), who's bout to leave for Japan. This is where we learn the characters aren't all perfect and have some issues. Then the attack comes, and a group of friends finds itself on the run, with only a hand-held camera to document events as a mysterious monster rampages around Manhattan.<br/><br/>At first we get next to no information on what's going on, it's all a big tease that keeps you guessing and thus makes the inevitable twists and angles all that more gratifying. Likewise, the destruction wrought upon NYC is excellently depicted via capable but never overwhelming or cheesy CGI. This also holds true for the monster when we get to see more of the character  everything looks perfect, unlike that other New York disaster flick of recent times, I Am Legend. Maybe this is why CF has been catching flack vis a vis the events of September 11, it's just so vivid and moving, there's nothing cinema-detached about it.<br/><br/>The roller coaster that this motion picture amounts to doesn't last long, but features everything in the storyteller's guidebook: love, romance, fear, hate, loss, hope, despair and quite a few more. And you'll feel all of them right along with the story, down to the sobering closing moments of this wonderful ride.<br/><br/>I therefore salute Cloverfield and all those who had a part in making it a silver screen reality. It's a great movie, I love it, it caught me completely off guard and came out on top with that elusive magical quantity called emotion, a thread so woefully missing in many other narratives and, sadly, from life as we know it in general.<br/><br/>Well done people, well done: I'll be thinking of this one for some time to come, and am waiting with bated breath for the special edition release. Just let me at those deleted scenes."

A lot of people won't like the ""Blair Witch""-style, first person/shaky-cam method used to tell the story, but this is exactly what sets it apart from and above your ""average"" monster mash.

The acting was magnificent, the hand held camera (can be a little uneasy for some folks) but I think it worked quite well and gave you the sense that you were really there with those people, feeling the same emotions and are just trying to make it with them.

","This may have spoilers in it.<br/><br/>Cloverfield has a somewhat unique take on a monster attack story. Think Godzilla meets the Blair Witch Project with a dash of Starship Troopers. I typically do not like movies that do not have closure at the end, but Cloverfield is an exception. If have to have closure and don't like to be left thinking then don't go see it because there are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The story of going back for a loved one when a disaster strikes is a bit typical for a popcorn film, but the way it is done is this movie is a little different. The main character Rob, goes back for a girl who is his best friend who he recently slept with and is in love with but hasn't told her. The situation of being in love with someone but not telling them is something that many viewers can relate to.<br/><br/>The movie is filmed from the first person so it really brings viewers into the story like you are traveling along with them. I jumped a few times when things happened and would not have done so had it been filmed from the typical 3rd person viewpoint.<br/><br/>The thing that attracted me most to Cloverfield was the preview. There is the right way and the wrong way to do a preview and this movie got it right. A preview should wet your appetite without giving away everything.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is not a cut and dry ""see it or not"" case. If you like closure, don't go. If you want a solid hour and a half of entertainment, its worth it. Go to a matinÃ©e show, its cheaper."

The only part that really made me think of these people as ""stupid"" was trying to go back to the middle of Manhattan through the subway tunnel. HELLO?! dark tunnel + scary monster = VERY BAD SITUATION! I still think it's unbelievable that a hand held camera was able to record 24 hrs. worth of footage on one disk and battery. On BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, they had equipment with them to keep camera's charged. Back on subject, I do give credit for the monster. My main concern was is this monster going to be a cheap rip off of Godzilla. It wasn't, thank God.<br/><br/>I liked the style of how close the buildings were together and the sense of there was no where to hide. Especially how the sense of panic was thick in the atmosphere. I felt a sense of panic at times whenever the monster was shown in any scene. They do leave the ending open, but you can pretty much conclude that Manhattan is gone. The small love story that went on I thought was very touching. At first, I felt it was unneeded, but as the movie continued, I was glad that a love story was in-compassed within this.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that making Hud, the camera man, have a sense of humor was a very good element to add into the movie. It really lightened up the mood in some very dark and tense situations. The only thing that was disappointing was that only one person, Lilly, survived from the group of friends documenting this whole situation. I wanted Hud to live, but, ya know.<br/><br/>So if you have any doubts towards this movie, I promise you, there will be no disappointments. It was amazing and worth every penny. I even went to watch it a second time because there were some things I missed the first time watching it."

","I would have given this movie an eight if I hadn't felt a little motion sickness about half way through my popcorn. There was a warning concerning this posted outside the door, but I didn't see it until afterward. To be fair, I knew it had the Blair Witch jerky camera effect but was too curious to pass on it. It was a very original approach to an old sci-fi theme and for that alone, it deserves an 8 or possibly 9. My wife and I agreed that our daughter's age group (twenty something) would have identified more with the characters. The special effects were very good and the overall mood of the movie was sustained by the latter. If you aren't bothered by jerky camera movements you will enjoy this thriller. It keeps you on edge right to the last second. I see a sequel coming soon to a theater near you."

","OMG, what can i say about this film that doesn't involve a runaway train of obscenities and tales of regret for handing over my 10 quid for 2 tickets. An intelligent person who requires an onslaught of stimulation to keep his/her attention will NOT like this film one bit, however you dress up this movie it will always suck, though i do think this will be the first of many Cloverfield films centred around a monster that attacks a city. The film concept is the typical monster attack but without the grand finale, there is about 45 seconds of actual monster footage and you cant feel in anyway close to the monster like many monster films have tried to do i.e Godzillla, Predator, Alien, Gweomul etc The monster isn't really seen until the end, there is a lot of shaky camera work because the film is a documentary of a groups perspective of the attack - think Blair witch project and u have the deal. I rated this film a 1/10 because it deserves it, if this is 1 part of a massive collection of to be released films then we should have been warned so we are not quick to judge, if you are planning on going to see this film then be warned, its likely you will walk away at the closing titles agreeing with this review, visually the film is standard and nothing new, there are no exciting new concepts that will throw future monster movies into a new parrallel - i cant help but feel like i was let down by the genre and JJ Abrahms, the acting is OK but you cant help your mind from screaming ""If i was there, I Wouldn't HAVE DONE THAT!"" The characters are a let down Half way through the film i had gotten soo frustrated with the dodgy camera work that i wanted to leave"

The part that angered me was the total lack of quality story telling. Suspense is only useful if it takes you some place. Leaving the last 2 minutes of a film on the cutting room floor is just obnoxious.<br/><br/>Really, don't bother to spend your money in the theater.

"kuroneko_kitty","9","6","14","18 January 2008"," I'd see it again
","Before I say anything, I feel I must call to attention a point that defines whether or not you will like Cloverfield.<br/><br/>In my opinion, there are two types of monster movie fans: People who like Alien, and people who like ToHo's Godzilla movies. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of the Alien-esquire genre, you get a rush from the mystique of clever plot devises, and the suspense of NOT knowing exactly what it is you're -supposed to be- scared of.<br/><br/>If you are of the ToHo Godzilla persuasion, you enjoy a movie with very few loose ends and a full-body shot of the monster within the first ten minutes of the film's beginning. <br/><br/>Allow to admit that I am a fan of BOTH. However, both will not get the same experience from Cloverfield that I did. <br/><br/>If you were in the percentile that enjoys rubber-suit Godzilla... I'm sorry. Its just not that kind of film. No, Cloverfield takes a refreshingly different direction with a genre who's light is slowly fading away into the mindless explosions and gore of films like AVPR. <br/><br/>Not to say that this movie LACKS either of those things. In fact, explosions make up a large portion of this surprisingly short film. It just chooses to present them to you in a much more realistic fashion (or, at least, as realistic as a movie like this can be). Plus the filmmakers use them to execute what I think makes this movie a standout, and ultimately genius... To actually HIDE the monster from total view for the greater percent of the viewer's time.<br/><br/>And HERE is where the Godzilla people will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, seeing the creature immediately has its own advantages, but its honestly an overused devise. Movies like Alien, Predator (it pains me to put them so close together, but I'm going for a point here), and even Jaws/The Abyss have been intensely enjoyable in their own ways, with ALL of them have a substantial wait before the ultimate 'payoff' of seeing the movie's central focus... and Cloverfield handles this beautify. The viral marketing that has made it so popular only added to my curiosity, thus making that 'payoff' all the more enjoyable when I actually DID see the beast (sorry if that's a spoiler... but YES. You do get to see the monster). <br/><br/>The camera thing is another issue that seems to bother a lot of people. For those that don't know, its shot from the PoV of one man's video recorder. There's a lot of jerky shots, static, and the occasional jump forward (and sometimes, randomly, back). There's also a few times when the viewer is denied a visual of what's happening around the characters, even though it would seem relevant to do a quick pan towards the action. HOWEVER, one should keep in mind that the actual cinematography is MUCH better than the widely-compared-to Blair Witch, with the camera used being of a much higher quality (there are several scenes where its easy to forget you're be being toted around by one of the characters). I personally felt that this added to the whole premise of 'realism' the picture was going for. As in, the characters honestly were too scared or too occupied (with things like running, creaming, etc.) to attempt filming one thing or another. It'll work differently for different people, probably NOT so well with people that are prone to motion sickness. <br/><br/>Cloverfield does not offer you any answers, nor does it aim to. Its meant to keep the viewer guessing, and leave you with that small, slightly ignorant feeling at its end. This again will bother some people. I would have liked a bit more from it in that respect, but I understand why I was denied such. <br/><br/>All in all, I came out very satisfied. Whether or not you will depends on your type. Casual moviegoers will more than likely enjoy it, while die-hard fans will either love or loath it."

","On seeing the short short previews of this movie my first thought was is this going to be another Blair Witch Project style of movie, so I had a few concerns with seeing this movie based on the short short preview. The lights goes down and the movie starts with all the usual characters appearing on screen. Act 1 starts by trying to make the audience feel more relaxed before some might say the roller-coaster ride of Act 2 begins for the virgin viewer of this type of film while others more experienced with this type of film may start to yawn with a seen it all before attitude. When the final Act began I felt it was just added to pad the film out because how the film is set out in Acts 1 and Acts 2. On a side note I am very impressed with the battery performance of ""camcorder"" they used but not impressed with the ""thing"" that was supposed to be ""scary""."

","JJ Abrams, what were you thinking? A movie like this should have kept me glued to the screen, waiting breathlessly for the next heart-stopping moment. I should have cared passionately for the characters and been desperate to see them make it safely to the end. Instead, about 30 minutes into the movie I switched on my laptop, headed to IMDb and started reading reviews. Wish I'd done that first.<br/><br/>Seriously, you know it's not working when you want everyone to be killed--within 10 minutes of the movie starting.

"NeoGeo09","9","5","11","18 January 2008"," Visually Stunning!! As if you were there.
","You could not believe how many times I said ""Holy S***"" through this entire movie. There was one part when the monster was directly in their face and the dude with the camera got eaten!!! And another part was when the building crashed to the ground and the dust was flying through the city. It sort of reminded me of 9/11 a little bit. Anyways, the movie was very good. The only thing that stopped me from giving it a 10 was at the end. The monster never died. So you know what that means???? Cliff Hanger?? A sequel??? something after the credits???? Nope... the quote ""It's still alive"" does hint a sequel.<br/><br/>The monster itself was one of the creepiest monsters I ever seen in my life! A hybrid between a Gorilla and an Insect that lives in the water that drops parasites and make people explode when they bite. (Another Oh S*** moment. The biggest ""Oh S***"" moment was when the Monster was saw them in that tilted building and they had to pull that girl out the building before it falls. When they got to the chopper, the monster that everyone thought was dead rises back and hits the chopper... They go flying, land in central park, and the monster is smack down in their face.... I was like ""AWWWWWWWWW H** NO!!!"" And then the movie ended.... That was worth waiting since the Transformers preview. The most thrilling movie ever.!!! And I really need to find out if they are making a sequel to this. Because if that monster was a baby, then where the hell is the mother??? trapped underwater ready to look for the child??"

""It's not down...."" is all you hear. <br/><br/>I would like to know what the creatures are suppose to be. The bigger one looks to be a mutated bat or even a mutated Jersey Devil. And the little ones, they just reminded me of the creatures from the movie Starship troopers, just with more eyes. And that Poor girl bitten by them and then she explodes, what's that all about???<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth seeing and I think it actually lives up to the hype they surrounded this movie with."

","When you consider that my single complaint was that the film was not even an hour and a half long, and yet I still have so much to say...That should tell you something. From the opening sequence - a near-black background with pitch-black lettering spelling out ""Property of the U.S. Government Do Not Duplicate"", then in white lettering little official statements about ""designate Cloverfield"" and where the camera was found...It was already exciting. The editing in this film was stupendous!! The action was incredibly realistic, so much so that a suspension of disbelief was entirely unnecessary. I was immediately drawn in, completely immersed in the events, horrified and excited by each new happening and all that threatened to happen next. There was action, horror, comedy, drama, and intense realism all rolled up into basically eighty minutes of film! At the end of the film, many people sat through the credits expecting there to be more, seemingly unsatisfied, as if there had been no resolution...but I disagree. The events in the film did resolve themselves. But from beginning to end, this film was like nothing I had ever experienced in a theater. Blending the first-person-camera concept of the ""Blair Witch Project"" with the Monster in Manhattan ideas from ""King Kong"" and ""Godzilla"" with the harsh-realities-of-love-in-a-war-zone story from...well, pick any war flick from the bunch; this film stands on its own as the first extraordinary action flick of the new year! It was truly amazing! A definite nine star film!"
"angelusexmortis","10","5","11","18 January 2008"," Cloverfield, worth the hype?
","Surprisingly, yes! With this to say, this movie lived up to all the hype made of it. The adrenaline rushes from this movie stays with you for about an hour afterwords. This movie is shown as a video tape, nothing more and nothing is explained, however JJ Abrahams has done a wonderful job. He has succeeded where few have gone as monsters come. He has shown the monster's features, what it can do, and how it does it, but still contained the fear factor within the monster. This is a wondrous movie, definitely worth seeing, renting afterwords, and also buying to watch again and again. With the greatness of this movie, and it's almost inevitable high grossing weekend- I smell a sequel!<br/><br/>P.S. Did anyone else notice that there seemed to be two separate monsters?

","I can't rate because I haven't seen it yet. But why the hell do all these comments bring in Blair witch project to compare? That movie sucked, mainly because it was a hoax and dumb people couldn't look it up on the internet beforehand to know this. What I want to see is the action and the suspense from the entire movie. Who cares if there's no soundtrack, the movie is from a cellphone powered by Energizer, and the ending leaves you with a ""hmmm"" in your throat, or even a ""wtf?!"".. I just wanna see it for what it's been promoted as. Something severe that destroys a city and leaves a wake of destruction and the unknown. And if it's good enough (box office wise), then maybe a sequel will spawn from the monster's back like the little crab monsters yall had to mention. I'm tired of all the crap movies coming out, with the story lines all unbelievable dumbed-down for all those who can't seem to think for themselves. At least this doesn't seem to be another one of the Hollywood poopy films being plopped out as if from an assembly line hooked up to a really giant crapper-factory. I don't want glammer, I don't know want well-known actors who get paid way more than anything they're worth, and I definitely don't care about shaky-vision. I want something that will make me feel glad that someone else isn't making a movie like everyone else's crap. I'd rather this feel like a bad dream that I couldn't wake up from and awoke with a sweat and jumping heart than have it rub me the wrong way like the old man from Family Guy who's in love with Chris Griffith. Give me action, horror, suspense, something I'm not expecting, and add on some hot mommas (even if they die), and I'll be happy. and big bad monsters won't hurt either. Time to see this tonight. Beowulf 3D kicked butt, so hopefully I will enjoy this one also even if there are things that won't make sense because the Director didn't spell it out and have people read it from a teleprompter for those who have no imagination. Love story??? I hope that gets stepped on quick. Ex-girlfriend in trouble?? Whats wrong with friends with benefits, even if she has no brain to leave a dying city...

"glynnjamin","10","5","11","17 January 2008"," Shocked
","I wasn't sure what to expect...which I think is most people's reaction when going in to Cloverfield. We got to go to the screening in Tempe on Wednesday night and saw it with a full crowd. Honestly, it was slow at the beginning. It takes a while to get used to the hand-held camera shots and really, the character development is a little obvious. It is nice that they took time to build a relationship between the main 4 characters in the movie, but really, I could have done without it.<br/><br/>Once the movie gets going (the part you see in the trailer when the monster attacks) it really kicks in to high gear. The hand-held camera allows the movie to cut out the boring stuff and only show the exciting parts without seeming disjointed. This is a revolutionary approach to monster movies and is probably something we will see lots of in the future.<br/><br/>Without going into the plot of the movie (and ruining it) I have to say that the acting was wonderful and the writing was well done. The editing is what made this movie great though. There are no cheesy scenes and there aren't any laughable moments (like the alien reveal in Signs) that ruin the movie. While parts of the dialog are funny, the plot never turns over-the-top. I enjoyed it immensely."

","I love Cloverfield. Ever since I first watched it when it came out, I became a fan of it. 11 years later, it has aged VERY well and I find it to be my favorite found footage film ever.<br/><br/>Cloverfield takes place in Manhattan, where there is a going away party for a guy named Rob (Michael Stahl-David). He is going to be a vice president in Japan, and the party then gets interrupted by a rupture outside, and they find out that the city is being under attack by some unknown creature. Rob's girlfriend, Beth (Odette Annable) is trapped in her apartment, so Rob and his friends must try everything they can to rescue Beth and escape before they get killed.<br/><br/>What I love about Cloverfield the most is how it is a creature feature inside of a found footage film. Most creature features and be cheesy and lame, but this one was done right. The plot may seem cliche, but it had really good moments and elements to it that made it very well done.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. The character I like the most is Hud, who is played by the hilarious, T.J Miller. His character is idiotic in parts, but in a very humorous way and brings out the funny side of the film.<br/><br/>The CGI for the monster is pretty unique, and the design for the monster seems original. He's not a dinosaur or some prehistoric creature of sorts, and that made the film very more original.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Cloverfield is one of my favorite films ever made that has aged well over the years, and is a very well made monster movie."

"david_rudy_lee","9","2","3","5 February 2019"," Good Found Footage/Giant Monster Film
","This was film I was intrigued by when I first heard of it as I'm a big fan of giant monster films. My first viewing for this one was right after college. I enjoyed it, but that was the only time I'd seen it. The official synopsis is a group of friends venture deep into the streets of New York on a rescue mission during a rampaging monster attack.<br/><br/>It starts off telling us that the footage we are about to watch is from the area now know as 'Cloverfield'. It is formerly known as Central Park. The footage begins with a guy looking out of an apartment overlooking the area. He goes into the bedroom where we see Beth McIntyre (Odette Annable). The man is Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David). They plan their day together going to Coney Island.<br/><br/>The footage then shifts to Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas). She is with her boyfriend, getting things ready for a party that night. He is Jason (Mike Vogel), Rob's brother. Rob is leaving for Japan for a new job and they are throwing a going away party. They don't realize they are filming over the great day that Rob and Beth spent together.<br/><br/>Back Rob's apartment, Hudson 'Hud' Platt (T.J. Miller) is convinced to film the party and to get people to say on their goodbyes on tape. They give a surprise to Rob and he had no idea. He starts to ask about Beth. She shows up with a new guy, upsetting Rob. All the while, Hud is trying to get the attention of Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan) and figuring out what is going on between his best friend and Beth.<br/><br/>Things take quite the turn though when an earthquake hits. They turn on the news to hear about a ship overturned in the harbor and then rush up to the roof to see it. There's another earthquake and they flee outside. There's a giant monster that moves past and the head of the Statue of Liberty rolls down the street. They decide they have to flee the island. This all changes when Rob gets a call from Beth. She's trapped in her apartment and he decides to try to save her. This won't be easy with whatever this giant monster and the things that fall off its back.<br/><br/>As I've alluded to, this is only the second time I've seen this film. I knew from the first time that I liked it, but after this rewatch, there were a lot of things I didn't remember. The first thing that struck me is the emotion of this film. It starts off as a really good drama. I love the editing of the happy day that Rob and Beth had together, with the reality of where they are today. Building that emotion in the beginning makes sense as to why he is risking his life for her. To be honest, this is something that I've thought about on a regular basis if something like this happened around me. I was a big fan of that aspect.<br/><br/>The next thing was I for whatever reason thought they really didn't show the monster much. I was wrong about that. We get to see the monster a lot. I will get into more about the look of it a bit later, but I do love that much like the Godzilla and other giant monster films, we get to see it quite a bit. Making the film found footage is interesting as well, since we get to see it from the perspective of what it would be like trying to survive this.<br/><br/>There is a section where the surviving members of the group have a run in with the military. I love what happens to Marlena during this stretch as I found it interesting. Everything all happens in one night, so they wouldn't have the answers yet. It was interesting how this plays out for sure.<br/><br/>Now really the only issue I have with this film goes back to the found footage aspect. I believe that Hud would keep the camera and keep filming. It is even more prevalent in today's society that we would film things around us like he is. This is a major event and will change the course of history. There are just times where I'm like; wouldn't you put the camera down here? It just makes it implausible that you would risk yourself to just keep filming. This doesn't hurt the film, but it is an issue with found footage.<br/><br/>This brings me to the pacing, which I think is great. The film doesn't waste any time. The introduction of the characters is good and it doesn't take too long. We continue to learn about each one as they try to survive this event. I really dug that aspect of the film. Rob becomes the catalyst for what they are doing and I thought it was interesting how it presents his issue and how he actually grows from it. I thought the ending was good and bringing us to how the footage was found. I dug the making confidential and that the government has confiscated it.<br/><br/>Acting was something else was really good. It is crazy that quite a few of these actors have gone on to do other things and this film really shows their potential. Caplan is solid as the outsider. She does bring some sarcasm and I thought her role was good. Lucas is interesting and her frustration was good. She is a good friend throughout. Miller also brings humor. His character isn't that different in Deadpool. I love his nervous tick to just talk, especially about inappropriate things. Stahl-David is good. He is kind of the hero and I thought his growth was solid. I just love that he's scared to fail and can completely understand it. Vogel was also solid as his brother. Annable is gorgeous and it is just a shame she wasn't in the film more. I'm also a big fan of her. It does well at making you care about these characters, so when some of them die, you feel something. The rest of the cast round out the film for what they needed as well.<br/><br/>Next would be the effects of the film. To bring a monster like this to life, you have to go CGI, which I thought looked great. The monster looks real and the things they have it doing are as well. There are a few moments where it doesn't hold up, but very little. As I said earlier, I was actually surprised how much they do show the monster. The setting is also great to make New York look as empty as everyone is trying to flee. That is an underrated aspect of the film as well. The film is also shot very well for being found footage. It does make you feel like you are really there.<br/><br/>The score is something else that can be tricky in a film like this. The only music I remember was at the party and it felt like we were really there. The rest of the sound design was good to make it feel as real as possible. You get the sounds of monster, the army fighting back and just buildings falling part. I thought this was well done to help build the realism.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I'm definitely glad I gave this film a rewatch. I knew that I liked it the first time, but I can confirm this film is really good. As a fan of giant monster films, this one feels so real. Going with found footage like they did make it feel like this really happening and the realism is great. I thought the acting, effects and sound design were really good. The low running time and editing of the film keep the tension building to a satisfying conclusion. I even like the beginning being somewhat of a drama helps us to like the characters and care about what happens to them. If you don't like found footage, I would avoid this. If that's not the case, I think this is a really good film, especially if you like giant monster films. I'd recommend giving this one a viewing and it really does hold up to multiple viewings."

","The Cloverfield Paradox is the third film of this series . All three are very loosely linked and all three are very different films. I absolutely loved the 2008 Cloverfield film. It was a film that used found footage special affects really well before it became old hat but this is not that kind of movie. This is pure Sci-Fi and I loved it.<br/><br/>In the near future, scientists aboard a space station are attempting to aid the Earth's energy crisis. Energy is depleting at an alarming rate, leading scientists to turn to a new source but the crew inside of it notice some serious side effects as the energy source causes them to collide with another dimension .<br/><br/>Like the previous films there was a lot of secrecy as to what this film was about. In fact critics only got to see it when it was released on Netflix on Sunday after the Superbowl. 
I predict that lot's of people are going to hate this film. Sci Fi fans can be a funny lot and the cross over of genres won't please everyone.
Sure , it's a bit silly at times but I love the way it tied up why ( or how) the aliens invaded the earth. 
It looks great and at no stage did I not feel thoroughly entertained.
Produced by J.J Abrahams , The Cloverfield Paradox is now available on Netflix."

","While at a farewell party a couple of teenagers find themselves in the middle of an alien attack, which seems to rip the whole New York apart. With one of the ""documenting"" the event, they venture into the war zone in an attempt to rescue one of their friends. Presented through the camera which films whatever they do, we follow their desperate adventures throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>As said above, the movie is presented through the ""eyes"" of their hand-held camera. Unfortunately, to say the least, this is the biggest flaw of the movie. The whole experience, if you can call it this way, is just a series of amateur filmed footage. To make matters worse, we're not talking about a good amateur film, but something coming from the sloppy hands of someone how hasn't seen such a device in his life and apparently isn't able to keep it straight most of the time. As a result, you'll soon get a headache which will only get worse as the film progresses. I cannot explain the sensation you'll have after seeing for over an hour an series of images which shake erratically, without any purpose or artistic direction. I can understand that it tried to be authentic, presenting all as it was filmed right from where the events happened, but the overall experience is simply unacceptable.<br/><br/>And I haven't reached the plot yet. Speaking of which, is simply awful and without any logic. In the beginning, we're presented for about half an hour some sort of introduction, or better said a series of irrelevant and boring events, which were supposed to present the characters, their relations and their feelings. And just when you're about to give up and close the agony, the attack begins. As you would imagine, panic everywhere, military start to fight and evacuate everyone, and what do you think that our group of survivors start to do? Seek shelter? Evacuate maybe? Nope. They are ALL going to save the girlfriend of one of them, who just half an hour ago had a fight with her and separated like they weren't even friends anymore, but somehow decided to leave him a message that she's trapped in her apartment. And now, he suddenly realises that he loves her, that he knows what he's doing (you simply cannot be serious with this line), and that he's going to save her. Not to mention that his brother just died minutes ago and he didn't even shed one tear for him. As you could have imagined by now, the plot is lacks basic logic at its core, not to mention what is going to happen and what each character decides to do in each and every scene. I can understand that this type of movie cannot exist without a couple of stupid characters, but they've simply gone too far with this aspect. <br/><br/>Due to the above mentioned, the atmosphere is dull and not interesting, caring about the characters is out of the question while the finale simply can't do anything in terms of good. Oh, about the finale, I won't spoil it for you but I have to mention that it is as sudden, as pointless and as predictable as the entire movie. What else can I say? Simply put, it's a movie which shouldn't exist. The fact that anyone would want to see this nightmare for the eyes is simply puzzling. The fact that someone would even go that far to consider it good is simply mind-blowing. Stay away, avoid or don't get any closer to it are simply understatements when speaking of this amateur footage!"

","One of the things I have inherited from my father, besides the eyes, is a love for this film. Now, just to make this clear, I'm not saying the sun rises and falls with this movie, I'm saying I think it's well made, has a great and engaging plot line, and likable characters that you can root for- which, I believe, is what anyone would want from a film; ""Cloverfield"" does exactly what any good film should do: it entertains the audience.<br/><br/>I love the use of home footage, and think it works especially well in this movie. Unlike similar monster-terrorizing-Manhattan movies, Cloverfield gives a personalized experience of a group of people navigating through the city and the destruction. This, aside from an exciting view of events and a more immediate sense of danger to the characters, creates a fresh view on a disaster movie (so unlike films like Godzilla, you aren't just following some stereotypical science nerd explaining where the monster comes from, followed by some stereotypical army dude trying to blow the thing up). Also, although the film itself is not exactly mentally taxing, it has some fascinating trivia etc. which I would recommend reading after watching the film... <br/><br/>Cloverfield is an exciting, engaging and humorous film which I really love and would recommend to everyone. It's even sort enough to watch twice without people realizing!"

","They say never judge a book by its cover but for many years now I've been good at spotting a bad movie just by looking at the title and cover art. The title of the movie 'Cloverfield' set in New York was a bad sign from the start and the bland poster art absolutely screamed mediocrity. <br/><br/>Again I was right! This DVD had scuttled about in my closet after picking up from a bargain bucket somewhere for quite a few months before I found the will to put it in the DVD drawer. I was prepared to be pleasantly surprised but expected, as usual, to be badly disappointed. Guess which it was!<br/><br/>Typically for me to score 1/10 I have to quit midway through and I quit after about 35 minutes with Cloverfield, less than half way through. I could see how mindless the whole thing was. People running about screaming, running and screaming, more running and screaming, explosions but why we know not, hand held camera work, all topped off with more running and screaming. In the background you can see some squidgy prehistoric creature waving its tail about amid explosions and fireballs. Nothing makes sense in this movie. Was I the only one wondering why the Air Force doesn't just make a surgical strike on the monster with an air to surface missile?<br/><br/>I wont say anymore other than it was as bad as I expected and so I wasn't too disappointed, especially when it cost about 50p to find out."

","Many people were talking about was the ""realistic"" style that the movie tried to convey. However, now it was more of a criticism, rather than praise, as people began complaining about motion-sickness. I personally never found the movie sickening, or even all that difficult to watch, but then, I was probably in the minority in that regard.On the other hand, putting too much focus on the creature could really take away from that dramatic, realistic tone.The other important thing is, when in my initial viewings of the film, the characters weren't exactly the reason why I had seen. While I can say with certainty that I was far more patient than the average movie-goer, who was waiting for the monster to show up, I never actually cared about Rob or the others. The opening 20 minutes were merely there to set up the plot and situations that would sort of push the characters along, but we never got to learn much about them outside of their social lives"

There was one camera an done boy was holding it during the film. After ı watched, ı thought that Turkish films could also be wonderful as this film.

The atmosphere itself that just surrounded the whole movie and the emotions of happiness at a going away party that suddenly turn to panic and fear when flying debris from a building thats after being destroyed starts flying thorugh the New York skyline towards our characters on top of a high rise apartment building. It was so good.<br/><br/>Im not going to go into great detail about the movie, because it is more about the experience itself of seeing Cloverfield. Our characters are likable, I liked Rob an awful lot, and his other friends that were at his surprise going away party also. The may seem like yuppies, but they're OK. Their journey through Manhattan, from crossing a massive bridge where the monster attacks, from underground subway tunnels filled with creatures to an open street where they encounter a war zone with between the military and the monster, through a mall where they come across a triage of wounded people/soldiers where we find out the monster can in fact release these smaller creatures and when bitten by one of them, one grows inside you and bursts out of your stomach.

"rakiani","3","2","3","7 June 2010"," The 'real' elements suffered.
","I'm just going to give a few negative and positive points to represent my opinion. I prefer not to give away to many specific moments of a film as I believe it can ruin a movie. This is why I always try to avoid trailers as I find myself waiting for moments I can remember whilst viewing a film. Not fun. All I'm gonna give away is that it's a giant monster movie shot through someones home camera (like you didn't know).<br/><br/>Starting with the positives. <br/><br/>The pacing of the film is good. <br/><br/>A few moments create a good sense of chaos and believability.......ummmmm.....and....ummmmm..... I TRIED OK?<br/><br/>I might have to hold back now because my minds filling with things to say! IT'S TIME FOR THE NEGATIVES! <br/><br/>None of the actors are good at natural acting which I believe is vital in such a movie. Very generic.<br/><br/>The camera is almost always tilted to the right. I noticed it early on so I found it hard to get past. I'm guessing the director suggested rough filming to make the film seem more believable. But I think the cameraman only had the imagination to tilt it one way, it's not even subtle. Now I've told you, you'll find it hard to ignore, so for this I am sorry. <br/><br/>The camera is a far too high quality for my liking which again takes away from the realism they are trying to create. <br/><br/>I also believe that a great opportunity was missed. A more realistic path could have been taken by the characters in the film. We could have seen them make decisions like you or I for a change. Instead they opted for the standard 'love connection, make unreasonable decisions to get into action based scenario' route.<br/><br/>This movie had potential but we ended up with another Hollywood blockbuster in disguise."
"MrTAToad","4","2","3","7 June 2010"," Just about bearable
","The first thing to note is the ""Shakey-cam"" filming is very off-putting. Most users of hand-held recorders to tend to make sure that what they film can be viewed without the viewers deciding that the contents of their stomach's need to be examine by the floor. This does make it hard to see what is supposed to be going on.<br/><br/>Next thing is that the the characters aren't particularly interesting. Nor are they particularly bright : Trying to use a lift in a badly damaged build ? Stopping under a bridge when there is a slightly miffed monster around ? These are the actions of Homer Simpson, and hopefully not the average American, although saying that... One good thing about the person using the camcorder becoming a monster sandwich : The camera work is a bit more steady.<br/><br/>I didn't find it particularly frightening, nor interesting. There was too much talk and not enough action, particularly around the monster. I only saw it to the end to see what the monster looked like.<br/><br/>Its a film to watch once and then forget all about - or perhaps buy it for someone you don't like."
"cyberknight","1","2","3","14 February 2010"," Eastern Movie Remake mixed with Blair Witch
","This movie is a kind of remake of ""Gwoemul"" (a.k.a. ""The Host"", 2006 Korean movie), mixed with the ""shaky camera"" from ""Blair Witch"". The main difference is the size of the monster. Gwoemul's monster is about the size of a cargo van, so it ""interacts"" with humans directly. Cloverfield's monster is Godzilla sized, but don't worry, the plot brings up an excuse to force an interaction with the human victims.<br/><br/>The second greatest difference is on camera direction. ""Gwoemul"" uses a conventional camera style, while ""Cloverfield"" uses the ""field documentary"" kind of filming, as seen on movies like ""Blair Witch"", ""(REC)"" and the remake of ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series. The obvious problem on this approach is that the director needs an excuse to keep filming, even when it's very unlikely that the character with the camera would do so (or have the means to keep recording or to get the best angles). On ""Blair Witch"", the characters wanted to keep a record for whomever would find their corpses, in case they didn't survive. ""(REC)"" had probably the best excuse of all, the character was a professional cameraman, working for a news channel, so he had all reasons to keep filming, even when his life was at stake (as seen in actual war documentaries, for example). ""Battlestar Galactica"" had no reason at all to use ""shaky camera"", they did so to mask the poor acting/action and bad visual effects, mainly on the first seasons. ""Cloverfield"" solved that by putting the camera on the hands of the kind of person that make you wonder if he's on drugs or suffered a brain damaging accident. Because of such lame excuse, about half of the scenes on this movie make absolutely no sense. I mean, someone running for its life, don't matter how idiot it is, wouldn't keep a camcorder at eye level to record its friends' escape from death (much less point the camera backward to record the monster coming after them!) Other plot details from ""Gwoemul"" were adapted to ""Cloverfield"", like the ""problem"" that happens when someone is bitten or scratched by a monster (and exactly like on the former, it is completely left undeveloped, such a waste!) The endings are also very similar, although with different technological approaches.<br/><br/>Finally, similarly to ""Gwoemul"", ""Cloverfield"" doesn't bother to explain its title. Of course, there are lots of out-of-the-movie explanations, but no one coming from the movie itself.<br/><br/>I managed to watch this once, but never again. Another Western remake of an Eastern movie, with an irritating camera style and underdeveloped plot (not that the former had much of a development, to begin with...)<br/><br/>The (few) visual effects are well done, but it is a dark night scenario, I'm not sure it would look so good at daylight (as it does on ""Gwoemul""). It almost makes me want to raise my rating on ""Gwoemul""..."

","As others have said, this is basically a by the numbers giant monster invasion movie.<br/><br/>Its one trick is the pseudo-amateur documentary filing style ala ""The Blair Witch Project. In fact if they had named this movie ""The Blair Witch Godzilla"" you wouldn't have even had to go to the film to get 90% of it.<br/><br/>The BWP technique applied to this subject material IS interesting. My experience was that it added to the sense of realism. I stopped thinking about the CG (which was thankfully used sparingly, someone understood that what you can't see is a lot scarier then what you can) and just accepted the action, which is unusual in my experiences of modern effects film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the shaky hand held camera work really made me ill. I had to do deep breathing exercises just to make it through without vomiting.<br/><br/>So... its an interesting little film IF you literally have the stomach for it. But if you are prone to any kind of simulator or motion sickness, I wouldn't try this movie."
"nascentt","7","2","3","29 September 2009"," Watch this film, but be prepared for the flaws.
","I just re-watched Cloverfield, I originally saw it in the Cinema when it was first released and remember enjoying the film, but disliking parts of it, so a year later decided to re-watch it to get a better idea of what exactly worked and what didn't.<br/><br/>My first thought after seeing it again at home, even on a big TV, is that the atmosphere is much stronger in the cinema. I remember driving home after seeing the film in the cinema once it was already dark out, and looking at the sky and finding it too calm, after seeing the explosions and fires and general mayhem brought about in the film. I think moments like these are what make movies most memorable, which reminds me of being a kid watching Jumanji in the cinema, and on the way home hearing the drums of a nearby circus or fair which instantly led me to think of the Jumanji drums when someone is about to discover the game.<br/><br/>Anyway, back on topic, this film isn't perfect, the obvious flaws are the pretty boring, elongated beginning of the movie. The first 20 minutes to me are unbearable, and one reason I love being able to watch the film at home, is that skipping the first 17/18 minutes is a trivial thing to do and very little of the feel of the film is lost. I do think it is important to establish a a ""calm before the storm"" atmosphere in films such as these. A film that nails this perfectly is The Host (2006), which has one of the best introductions to a monster in modern cinema. (In fact there are many similarities between The Host and Cloverfield, and anyone that even partially enjoyed one should check out the other.) Cloverfield, unfortunately, does not do the ""calm before the storm"" very well. The character's are not interesting, their lives are not something I want to witness 20 minutes of when they aren't running for their lives, which is obviously a big flaw in a film that needs you to feel loss when characters are killed.<br/><br/>I do not understand the hate towards shaky cam in films that apply it well, and this film applies it well. Unfortunately due to the acting more than anything it doesn't always feel realistic, despite the visuals being stunning and very apocalyptic. I find myself having more issue with the acting, which isn't terrible, as emotional scenes like in the subway, I feel successfully do their job. However some of the throw-away dialogue seems very difficult to listen to, which might be more of a script issue than acting, but the acting to me still feels over the top, but without a better dialogue I guess there's no real way to measure this.<br/><br/>I note that some reviews seem to indicate that people take issue with the lack of information of the origins of the creature and other facts and information about what exactly is going on, but I strongly disagree with this point of view. A ""realistic"" shaky cam film that is meant to be from the citizens' point of view shouldn't have facts, because it is unlikely facts would be given if a situation like this ever did arise. As stated in the movie ""by the time you see this video you'll probably know more about this than we do"", which is pretty much exactly as you'd expect, nothing is ever known the minute it happens. I hate to make 9/11 references because every review of this movie has one, but no one knew what was going on as the events of 9/11 happened, all we had was speculation.<br/><br/>Finally, I also have a problem with the ending of the film. I don't want to have any spoilers in this review so I will be very vague, but some of the events (if not all of them) are extremely over the top. I'm not sure how it should have ended as trying to think of the film ending earlier than it does would make it way too abrupt and would leave the film very anti-climatic. Perhaps the film would be better if the flying scenes were removed entirely, which would be sad because the visuals are very well done. Also the ""face to face"" scene is over the top for my liking.<br/><br/>I look forward to the sequel of this film, I hope they learn from their mistakes and if they do reveal more information about what exactly happened, do it tastefully and not just have a scene with a scientist explaining everything because he's a scientist and therefore knows everything.<br/><br/>if you haven't seen this film, do so, it is for the most part a decent film, especially in terms of atmosphere and visuals. If you see this movie at home, don't feel bad about wanting to skip a big chunk of the character introductions, because they are pretty hard to watch."

","OK, first off I'll admit when this first came out I wanted to watch it so badly. But due to money reasons I couldn't see it in theater so I waited and it came out on DVD. Once again I wasn't able to watch it but this last Sunday I finally got my hands on it. I wasn't sure what to expect to be honest, I knew it was about a monster that attacked a city that much I knew. But now that I've watched it I'm not sure if this was the intended effect but honestly I couldn't help but laugh my butt off. It seems that some actors used too much emotions while others didn't use any at all. It seems that they couldn't have a target zone for emotions, Rob was all over the freaking place and Hud... I'll be honest in my opinion Hud was annoying. He seemed to be overly energetic considering a 15 story monster is coming through town and just laying waste to everything. I'm really wondering if he did some drugs or something prior to the attack. Even when he got eaten by the monster there was a comedic effect with that, even the monster couldn't handle Hud anymore and spit him out.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about some of the things I noticed in the movie I stated this earlier but was it me or was Hud really annoying? The guy was told in strict confidence that someone slept with another person so what did he do? He ran all over the party just blabbing it out. I mean seriously if this guy was at my party I'd thrown him out the window by the time I got to talk to him.<br/><br/>Next, there is the issue of the little monsters in the subway but isn't it me or did the monsters make the same sound that the Hamburgler from McDonalds use to make? You know the whole ""Wobble Wobble"" sound, I hear that and it's like whatever intensity they were trying to build up for this movie just got trashed because of that sound, I heard it and honestly I laughed it's just so cheesy.<br/><br/>Now, what's with the Camera? this thing lasted almost what 12 hours on one battery? this has to be either a top secret camera that only they had or... I don't know but the thing was also rugged as all get go.<br/><br/>The last WTF moment I'll talk about is what was with the horse going down the street? what was the monsters taste specific? it'll eat a human but it'll not touch the horse? Overall the Movie was nice with the exception of what I talked about if they ever do a sequel lets try to get the emotions in check."

I thought the hand held camera was used to good advantage to help build the emotion and move the story along. It is appropriate to the characters running in the streets from a gigantic monster. It helps heighten our own fear and is appropriate to the situation. It certainly would not have been the same movie without it."

","What do you get if you combine THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and GODZILLA? You get that movie. What a way to start the year. This film pays homage to the classic giant monster movies like KING KONG, THE BEAST FROM 20'000 FATHOMS and THEM plus some ma-sized or smaller than man monster films like Dracula (1931) and ALIEN (1979). Now why did I mention Dracula (which is a favorite of mine)? Here's why. There is one scene where they guy rescues his girl-friend and she has a metal bar impaled through her and he takes it off of her off-camera! Just like the way the title vampire gets killed. I also mention ALIEN because there is one scene where you see the small monster comes bursting out of the girl and growls about, which sounds like Donald Duck having a fecal fit or Homestar Runner's The Cheat loosing his mind.<br/><br/>Now when I saw the monster, it was sooo original and scary looking. In fact, it could make THE HOST look like a tadpole, King Kong look like a chimpanzee or Godzilla look like Barney. The gigantic beast (created at Tippet Studios, lead by JURASSIC PARK animator Phil Tippet) looks so imaginative, it contains characteristics of various animals (the tail looked like those of an eel). <br/><br/>At the end credits, it the music sounded like those of Danny Elfman (MEN IN BLACK, THE SIMPSONS and the SPIDERMAN trilogy) and Akira Ifukube (who did music to a lot Japanese fantasy and science fiction films, but he was known for doing the score to the original GODZILLA). After the credits, you hear a voice, if you mess it around, it says ""Help us."" or ""It still lives.""<br/><br/>After the film was a monster smash (no pun intended) at the box office, there was fan-art running rampant on Deviant Art (such as chibi-cloverfield, cute eh?), parodies like the one digital short in Saturday NIGHT LIVE and like KING KONG and THE BEAST FROM 20'000 FATHOMS, imitations of cheesy proportions like Asylum's MONSTER, the low-budget independent schlock-fest MONSTER MOVIE and the porno version, CLEAVAGEFIELD.<br/><br/>Usually movies released in the beginning of the year are boring, and not impressive Until there was ELECTRA in 2005.

The movie starts as a monster of unknown origin destroys a building. As they go to investigate, parts of the building and the head of the Statue of Liberty come raining down. The movie follows their adventure trying to escape and save a friend, a love interest of the main character.<br/><br/>i must say the acting was very well done, Especially by Lizzy Caplan(mean girls).<br/><br/>the Special effects where pretty good but all up the movie was something different and very entertaining"

It was refreshing to see some ""real"" camera work where the monster itself was shown in fleeting glimpses and for the most part they had very little idea what was going on. It would have been nice to get a little more at the end, but actually nice to be left to wonder how the future panned out and what that thing actually was. The spider like creatures were a masterful piece of horror, who wouldn't shudder and recoil at the site of Labrador sized beauties sticking their fangs in.

For those of you (Like me) who saw this because you like Lost and JJ Abrams made it, then get ready for all the worst parts of Lost in about 80 minutes. No. 1. You get WAY (and I mean WAAAY) more questions than answers. 2. You get unoriginal ideas not fully fleshed out. (at least with Lost they are intertwined and halfway interesting. 3. Unlike Lost, you have this movie full of people you really don't care about. People would die and it didn't really matter to the story or to the viewer. So, what actually happened, some unexplained monster shows up in New York, from an unknown location, for unknown reasons and was met with an unknown fate. That's just a little too many unknowns to make a quality movie. Now, I ask all of you who have seen this movie the following question: What was the point?"

The story is seen before and according to my personal opinion, it is not attractive. Acting... these days it became such a trend that anyone can take 500 dollars camera and suddenly he/she is an actor, director and you name it. I am not opposing this, but don't make fool of the people by reaping them off with the movie tickets. Upload the video on Youtube or something and be famous. And what's with this idea that this is some kind of governmental tape... Come on people, i don't like to comment on that.. you could have done better that that. To sum up, this is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Very poor attempt to present some kind of reality, but this movie has gone completely off the track"

","I went to see this film after seeing rave reviews and hearing my friends talk about it as if it were the second coming of Christ. Personally I was disappointed; while there are many elements about this film that are very good, the main actors, for example, really throw themselves into the seemingly ludicrous subject matter creating a convincingly tense atmosphere, however the film itself does not hold up to scrutiny. First of all the shaky cam style is good for about ten minutes; after forty five I felt a combination of motion sickness and annoyance at the fact that what I was effectively paying to see was a bad home movie. Don't get me wrong I applaud any attempt to do something new and different in film and I really wanted to enjoy the experience but it was just too much; chocolate is good but too much of it makes me feel the same way I felt watching this movie. Second the monster was incredibly disappointing, again the hype would have you believe that it was going to be the terrifying hybrid of King Kong, Godzilla and every other Thing From Outer Space to smash their way across the silver screen. What we actually get, however, looks like a poorly rendered lump of snot on legs. I feel a bit conned by this, I wanted something that would give me chills not make me laugh. Then you take into account the addition of those little spider things that drop off it like furry drops of sweat and make people's stomachs explode; in which universe did the designer honestly think that anyone would find that scary? In an age of slasher films and zombie apocalypses exploding stomachs just looks silly. This movie wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't amazing; it was OK. It is an average monster movie dressed up as an indie art-house horror movie and that is all it is. The only genius that J J Abrams has shown here is his ability to whip the international film community into a lather over anything he does. If you want a monster movie there are far more capable ones out there though I will hand it to him; P T Barnum hasn't got anything on J J Abrams."

","I love it when you go to the movies to see a film that you know very little about - The Sixth Sense was one and look how that turned out. With Cloverfield there was so much mystery and so many rumours I avoided everything but the trailer until I went to see it.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Robs farewell party which is shown quite a bit in the trailer. It is there we meet our cast - Rob, his true love (which unfortunately for everyone he only realises this after the first attack) Beth, his brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily, Hud who acts as the cameraman and sarcastic commentator, a character which you will either love or hate and the girl that he loves Marlena. The characters are all pretty much one dimensional but it doesn't matter - there is no time to delve into their back story and get to know then - we know all we need to know from the party.<br/><br/>After a very quick introduction to everyone the attack on New York begins and the head of the Statue of Liberty is one of the first casualties in the attack. It was one of the most memorable moments of the trailer yet it was still shocking to see it happen so early in the movie.<br/><br/>Following the first attack Rob receives a voice mail message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment across town and Rob sets of to rescue her along with his friends. Not since Lord of The Rings have a small group of people out walking suffered so much drama, heartache and action - and it was great fun to watch.<br/><br/>Once you get used to the hand held, unsteady movements of the camera it really added to the panic and chaos. We saw the explosions, monsters (the big one and the small ones) and action from the point of the characters, who were usually running in the opposite direction. This added to the tension and excitement as you were only really seeing snippets of what was really happening in the city - we pass by ambulance crews working on the injured and a mass army operation complete with tanks and loud explosions, but these are only in the background as the main focus remains on our small group of characters reaching Beth's apartment What makes the action work is the fact that the characters are just normal everyday people - they do not produce shotguns or start quipping witty one liners at the danger. They are running for their lives in terror and again this works so well with the unsteady camera - there are no slow-mo Michael Bay money shots in this film!! There are some very memorable scenes such as turning on the night vision in the underground tunnels - even though you knew what was obviously going to happen it was still scary, the death scene in the tent in the army base - I am still not sure what actually happened but I know that it was gross and the helicopter evacuation.<br/><br/>I am not intelligent enough to think of a clever and thought provoking metaphor for the monster attacking New York as that is it not why I go to the movies - I go to be entertained and I left the cinema feeling buzzed, excited and thoroughly entertained by Cloverfield and because of this I would give it 10/10.<br/><br/>My only grip would be asking why the characters walked everywhere - I would've stolen one of the many cars that were abandoned about the streets of NYC - but then again I suppose that it is easy to be critical when you are sitting in the safety of a cinema screen and not running for your life"

","Following one of the best anti-marketing campaigns in recent history, one could be forgiven for thinking ""Cloverfield"" has no chance of living up to its own hype. In many ways, it doesn't... but what it does is give us one of those truly great little B-grade gems that you can appreciate time and again.<br/><br/>Much discussion has been made of the film's Blair Witch-inspired format. I work at a cinema, and have had many complaints, but the first thing I always do is let people know what they're getting. Most go in knowing it's going to be jerky, helter-skelter hand-held, and if they come out and complain about that... I'm sorry, but I have no sympathy. You really should've listened to me to start with.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a great film (without actually being 'great'). The threadbare story starts with a group of twentysomethings at a farewell party for main character Rob, and very quickly moves into the monster attack we've all been waiting for, captured by Rob's dopey camera- carrying best-friend, Hud. As they move through Manhattan, first trying to leave, and then going back for one of their number, they find themselves caught in the front-lines of the attack, and the military's strike-back.<br/><br/>The handling of the visual effects sequences in the medium is awesome, and the crew has worked hard to establish the camera not just as a framing device, but also as a storytelling tool (at many points in the film, the camera flips over to VTR or playback mode, showing us the existing footage already there; some of the onboard tools come in handy as well). Hud as a character does become a little annoying at times- seriously, the guy doesn't shut up- but the playing out of the action, and working it in with the filming, makes for very visually cool cinema.<br/><br/>I have also heard many complaints about the film's construction (one review I read here asked questions about how the camera or the tape/SD card can run for 8 hrs or so without change-over; why, the answer is simple: he DOES switch the camera off a LOT during the film, often for great big long chunks of time, and the film's on-screen action lasts for just on 80 mins- and there are definitely 80 min tapes out there, the Sony BCT64HDL to name but one eg.)- to those, I ask: whatsamatter, never heard of a niche film? Experimental cinema? Something DIFFERENT, you remember that concept? Sure, the general idea is old as the hills, but the execution is one of the freshest things I've seen in a long time. Sure, it's no classic, and the script and acting left much to be desired, but check it out, if only out of curiosity (get it on DVD if you can't stomach the format on the big screen), and I promise that, at the least, it's gonna be different to all the paint-by-numbers every-shot-perfect blockbusters you'll come across."

The movie was good, it will keep you on the edge of your seat but it isn't the greatest film as I've heard in other places. The story about a monster trying to destroy a big city isn't new, but this one is different because of the special effects and the ending that in my opinion wasn't the best. It also left me many questions like What is that monster? Where did he come from? Why is he attacking New York City? The camcorder style gives you the feeling of being there but as time passes by, you can get tired and even dizzy with it. The cast doesn't have any known name, thing that makes the movie a little more credible and the performances are convincing enough."

","The phrase ""emotional roller-coaster"" gets bandied about a bit, but Cloverfield is exactly that, in more ways than one. Yes, it's a monster movie (yay!) but it's also a lot more. A combination of hand-held camera work, emotional acting, realistic drama and a high sense of urgency means there is a massive connection between film and audience. I found myself, a few times, wanting to yell at the characters to ""Run!"" because the monster would get me if they didn't. This is not a feeling any other movie has given me. Usually, when there are big explosions and Monster VS Army battles, I want to watch because it's cool. In Cloverfield, the cameraman was one of the main characters, which meant that when there were action scenes I was willing the camera to turn around and not watch because it would mean he was (finally!) running away. I came out of the theater feeling as if I'd woken up from a dream where I was riding a washer on spin-cycle in the dark with spiders: dizzy, confused and wary of anything moving. And yet, I wanted to line up for the next ride. If you ever want to know what it's like to be a civilian caught in the middle of a war you know nothing about, watch this movie. Cloverfield is not just a movie, it's an experience and I heartily recommend going for the ride."

It's not enough of everything - except being visually annoying enough for anyone. I guess I was disappointed that the writers tried too hard to make this a teenage movie. Young people are indulged in so many ways in our society, but we are not being true to the art of cinema when we get so hung up on form over substance.

","Back when found-footage/mockumentary genre was alive and kicking, out also came ""Cloverfield"", which has kept its place among the better examples of the now almost extinct horror subgenre. And, very importantly, years later, a movie universe was built on it - ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016) and ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" (2018) are the ones. ""Cloverfield"" was also Matt Reeves's start for an amazing run which hasn't stopped yet, for we are all currently waiting (im)patiently for ""The Batman"". Perhaps ""Cloverfield"" can't be called very sophisticated, thoughtful or a prime example of realism, but it is without a doubt one of the most thrilling and fun found-footage horror movies ever made, along with REC, The Troll Hunter etc.<br/><br/>In its first 20 minutes, ""Cloverfield"" introduces the group of characters whose fates we're going to witness tonight, it does so via main character's going away party. Even before any real threat has presented itself, the movie feels fast and dynamic, tagging along with no problems whatsoever. When the mysterious monster strikes, it's mostly all-out action and tension till the very end. There are a couple intermissions, of course, but all in good traditions. The hand-held cinematography, trying to pass the feel realism, does feel faux quite often, and some situations have characters doing actions that are questionable, but even in the light of these flaws the entertainment value is impossible to ignore. ""Cloverfield"" is also one of those rare found-footage movies that feel, look (and are) expensive - a galore of special effects and lots of destroyable scenery. I've heard people complaining about the casting - personally I thought all the performances were fine and above, I couldn't care less if they are ""too good looking"". Young people in the same age group, it's more or less justified in the plot. ""Cloverfield"", as a singular unit, works well on all levels and succeeds at most of the tropes it utilizes, even if they are clichÃ©.<br/><br/>I believe that this film - and many of its genre relatives - should be viewed as an adventure, a rollercoaster ride, a walk in the haunted house, call it what You will. It's big, loud and feels packed, but ultimately works on simple terms. Unless you get dizzy easily, enjoy the trip. My rating: 8/10."

"Cineanalyst","5","1","1","17 April 2020"," America's Godzilla
","Although Hollywood has remade ""Godzilla"" a few times, it never made much sense as an American monster movie. That's because the original ""Gojira"" was an allegory for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. ""Cloverfield"" is a similar cinematic processing in the kaiju tradition of national tragedy, that of 9/11. Others have done likewise with sci-fi adaptation (""War of the Worlds"" (2005), superhero fare (""The Avengers"" (2012), Man of Steel"" (2013)) and still others merely add robots to combat the kaiju (""Pacific Rim"" (2013)), or make the kaiju robotic (""Transformers""). In other words, there's been a lot of movies translating the attacks to an invasion from outer-space aliens--one world fighting another and usually turned into a cinematic universe or, otherwise, a franchise. ""Avatar"" (2009) even reverses the trajectory by having Americans as the invaders of an alien planet. Anyways, ""Cloverfield"" appropriately enough includes, reportedly, blinking footage from early American monster movies ""King Kong"" (1933), ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" (1953) and ""Them!"" (1954) (although the Statue of Liberty head, referencing ""Escape from New York"" (1981), is better done).<br/><br/>The gimmick added on this in ""Cloverfield,"" besides the much remarked upon paratextual marketing schemes of the franchise, is the pretending found footage--a technique popularized in horror movies by ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) and preceded by ""Cannibal Holocaust"" (1980). Theoretically, this offers the simplicity of the spectator's gaze, already associated with or directed by that of the camera, to be directly associated with a character or multiple ones--something that classically is done more loosely by a series of looks (e.g. shot of protagonist looking at something or someone being followed by a direct cut to a shot of what they're looking at). Unfortunately, the main character as camera here is portrayed by T.J. Miller. On the other hand, the handheld camerawork putting us in the point-of-view of the character also distances us from him to the extent that he's largely removed from the footage. That the footage is supposedly found further removes them. In a sense, they're already dead even if the characters didn't turn out that way by movie's end.<br/><br/>Besides the tediousness, if not downright offensiveness, of making cinematic spectacle out of 9/11--an act of terrorism that was already remarkable, for among other obvious reasons, as a televised spectacle--""Cloverfield"" also offers a hackneyed and simplistic setup, of a surprise party and unrequited love--this time, abruptly interrupted by immersive alien invasion pandemonium. Miller's idiot doesn't even provide effective comedic relief, and the other characters are wooden. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016) is better simply because it has compelling characterizations, and its black humor rather works.<br/><br/>Others have also commented on the obscuring of the view of the aliens, as aided by the found-footage style--as a character more afraid for their life and running away rather than trying to capture the best camera angles, but we get pretty good and increasingly better looks at the monster and monsters and their destruction before that final facial close-up. It's hardly Lovecraftian, and if anything the camerawork is suspiciously too good to pull off the effect. One of many alien-invasion 9/11 movie metaphors and another horror flick to employ the found-footage technique is not a philosophically cosmic exploration of the unknown, either. Regardless, the technique does echo how much of 9/11 was actually recorded and presented on TV, and it's interesting to track how tragic national events, from WWII and before through the War on Terror have been represented figuratively in cinema. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a slew of pandemic parables on screen in the years to come. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" already resonates more today with much of the world under shelter-in-place orders. This is the second time I've seen the original ""Cloverfield,"" as well, but it hasn't improved as such with age; if anything, what may have been seen by some as novel in 2008 isn't very impressive with hindsight."

The official synopsis is a group of friends venture deep into the streets of New York on a rescue mission during a rampaging monster attack.<br/><br/>It starts off telling us that the footage we are about to watch is from the area now know as 'Cloverfield'. It is formerly known as Central Park. The footage begins with a guy looking out of an apartment overlooking the area. He goes into the bedroom where we see Beth McIntyre (Odette Annable). The man is Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David). They plan their day together going to Coney Island.<br/><br/>The footage then shifts to Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas). She is with her boyfriend, getting things ready for a party that night. His name is Jason (Mike Vogel), Rob's brother. Rob is leaving for Japan for a new job and they are throwing a going away party. They don't realize they are filming over the great day that Rob and Beth spent together.<br/><br/>Back Rob's apartment, Hudson 'Hud' Platt (T.J. Miller) is convinced to film the party and to get people to say on their goodbyes on tape. They give a surprise to Rob and he had no idea. He starts to ask about Beth. She shows up with a new guy, upsetting Rob. All the while, Hud is trying to get the attention of Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan) and figuring out what is going on between his best friend and Beth.<br/><br/>Things take quite the turn though when an earthquake hits. They turn on the news to hear about a ship overturned in the harbor and then rush up to the roof to see it. There's another earthquake and they flee the building. There's a giant monster that moves past and the head of the Statue of Liberty rolls down the street. They decide their best chance is to get off the island. This all changes when Rob gets a call from Beth. She's trapped in her apartment and he decides to try to save her. This won't be easy with whatever this giant monster and the things that fall off its back.<br/><br/>I knew from the first time that I liked it, but after my previous rewatch, there were a lot of things I didn't remember. The first thing that struck me is the emotion of this film. It starts off as a really good drama. I love the editing of the happy day that Rob and Beth had together, with the reality of where they are today. Building that emotion in the beginning makes sense as to why he is risking his life for her, especially since he messed it up. To be honest, this is something that I've thought about on a regular basis if something like this happened around me. I was a big fan of that aspect.<br/><br/>The next thing was that I for whatever reason thought they really didn't show the monster much. I was wrong about that. We get to see the monster quite a bit. Making the film found footage is interesting as well, since we get to see it from the perspective of what it would be like trying to survive this. The group is doing something pretty stupid, but if they don't, we don't get to see all of things that happen. This is an of course thing, that I know. There's some pretty interesting set pieces though.<br/><br/>There is a section where the surviving members of the group have a run in with the military. I love what happens to Marlena during this stretch as I found it interesting. Everything all happens in one night, so they wouldn't have the answers yet. It was interesting how this plays out for sure. I did have a bit of an issue that the military lets them go. Not sure that they would, but the only thing would be the humanity of the military officer which could cause him to break protocol. He probably wouldn't be found out so there is that.<br/><br/>Now really the only issue I have with this film goes back to the found footage aspect. I believe that Hud would keep the camera and continue filming. It is even more prevalent in today's society that we would film things around us like he is. This is a major event and will change the course of history. There are just times where I'm like; wouldn't you put the camera down here? It just makes it implausible that you would risk yourself to just keep filming. This doesn't hurt the film, but it is an issue with found footage.<br/><br/>This brings me to the pacing, which I think is great. The film doesn't waste any time. The introduction of the characters is good and it doesn't take too long. We continue to learn about each one as they try to survive this event. I really dug that aspect of the film. Rob becomes the catalyst for what they are doing and I thought it was interesting how it presents his issue and how he actually grows from it. I thought the ending was good and bringing us to how the footage was found. I dug the making confidential and that the government has confiscated it.<br/><br/>Acting was something else was really good. It is crazy that quite a few of these actors have gone on to do other things and this film really shows their potential. Caplan is solid as the outsider. She does bring some sarcasm and I thought her role was good. Lucas is interesting and her frustration was fitting. She is a good friend throughout. Miller also brings humor. His character isn't that different from his in Deadpool. I love his nervous tick to just talk, especially about inappropriate things. Stahl-David is good. He is kind of the hero and I thought his growth was solid. I just love that he's scared to fail and can completely understand it. He needs to overcome this though. Vogel was also solid as his brother. Annable is gorgeous and it is just a shame she wasn't in the film more. I'm also a big fan of her. It does well at making you care about these characters, so when some of them die, you feel something. The rest of the cast round out the film for what they needed as well.<br/><br/>Next would be the effects of the film. To bring a monster like this to life, you have to go CGI, which I thought looked great. The monster looks real and the things they have it doing are as well. There are a few moments where it doesn't hold up, but very little. As I said earlier, I was actually surprised how much they do show the monster, but also how quickly or being shown from a distance as well. The setting is also great to make New York look as empty as everyone is trying to flee. That is an underrated aspect of the film as well. The cinematography is very well done for being found footage. It does make you feel like you are really there.<br/><br/>The score is something else that can be tricky in a film like this. The only music I remember was at the party and it felt like we were really there. The rest of the sound design was good to make it feel as real as possible. You get the sounds of monster, the army fighting back and just buildings falling part. It is done ambient, so it builds that realism.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I'm definitely glad I gave this film a rewatch. I knew that I liked it the first time, but I can confirm this film is really good. As a fan of giant monster films, this one feels so real. Going with found footage like they did make it feel like this really happening and the realism is great. I thought the acting, effects and sound design were really good. The low running time and editing of the film keep the tension building to a satisfying conclusion. I even like the beginning being somewhat of a drama helps us to like the characters and care about what happens to them. If you don't like found footage, I would avoid this. If that's not the case, I think this is a really good film, especially if you like giant monster films. I'd recommend giving this one a viewing and it really does hold up to multiple viewings.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"iquine","8","1","1","6 March 2020"," Effective Approach
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>A taught and modern spin on a classic monster invades a big city movie. The approach of appearing to be filmed with a handheld camera worked for me as it echoed the chaos. The chaos triggered by some huge monster ravaging Manhattan. The film starts at a condo party to introduce the characters and then abruptly turns into a survival film as the authorities try to protect the city and people. While the characters aren't really sympathetic, they do show concern for their close friends and the film with all the mayhem and tight editing is engrossing. And you have a turn a blind eye to the cameras battery life and durability but it didn't impact the movie for me as it is a monster movie! Not sure if this is a spoiler or not but the film owned the found footage approach by not revealing how this started or ended, you just get a snapshot of the attack from a few people's harrowing perspectives."

","On Sept. 11, 2001, for the first time since Pearl Harbor, Americans found themselves attacked when they least expected it.<br/><br/>It's party time in the inscrutably titled ""Cloverfield,"" as a roomful of millenials fete Rob (Michael Stahl-David) on the night before he's to leave for a job in Japan. We eavesdrop on conversational trivia, as Rob's best friend Hud (T.J. Miller) makes the rounds with a video camera, filming testimonials and gossip that Rob has bedded his brother's babe, Beth (Odette Annable).<br/><br/>From out of nowhere, a thunderous crash resounds, the lights go out, and, just as in America on 9/11, life would never be the same. New York erupts into a chaotic frenzy of panicked humans amidst bombs and collapsing skyscrapers. A clueless TV anchor announces an oil tanker may have capsized near the Statue of Liberty. They wish!<br/><br/>The horror in ""Cloverfield"" derives from the pandemonium amidst humans who do not know what is happening. The movie weakens as it reveals we are dealing with monsters here. How much scarier this would have been if the foe had remained amorphous and intangible!<br/><br/>This film effectively recreates the type of mayhem that ensued in the minutes and hours following the 9/11 attacks on New York City. How chilling to remember that World Trade Center denizens were told to remain in their office spaces after planes-as-bombs fueled an inferno in the upper reaches of the targets. In a similar case of the blind leading the blind, clueless civil authorities urge throngs to flee Manhattan -- ""If you're not injured, you gotta keep moving...Keep moving in a quick and orderly fashion!"" -- only to witness the Brooklyn Bridge crumble into the East River.<br/><br/>Our protagonists retrieve a voicemail from Beth, who begs Rob to help -- she's been pinned to the floor of her Columbus Circle apartment. Reaching her will mean flouting civil authorities' orders to flee south, but they head uptown anyhow. Tramping through a subway tunnel, member of the group Lizzie (Marlena Diamond) helps Hud avoid a monster but gets fatally stabbed. This grim interlude provides a lull in the action, a chance to catch one's breath, but this is only a delay in the next horrible twist in the plot. In ""Cloverfield"" we see the ultimate portrayal of being able to run, but not hide.<br/><br/>""We're gonna wait here till this passes,"" Rob pants under a bridge in Central Park. Safe haven? Not in a post-9/11 world. ""I love you,"" says Beth. ""I love you,"" he replies. In the end, that's really all that matters in our short and fragile lives."

Cleverly juxtaposing scenes of destruction against more hopeful and positive memories through the use of the camera's old recordings, Cloverfield is able to invest its audience into the lives and character of its cast in very short time which puts us firmly on their side, while the exceptional sound design and sparing use of effects make this feel more like a VR experience than a movie."

","The good thing about Cloverfield is that it puts you smack in the middle of the action without any pretense. Not many found footage films do this and suffer as a result. This is good because the immediacy of the situation is well realized and the chaos truly captured. In a nutshell a giant creature wrecks havoc on the big apple(yet again) and we are with a group of 20 somethings when it happens. The pacing is what makes this film- I remember watching for the first 20 minutes nothing happens and then once the carnage begins it's a roller coaster. The actors are all adequate and the effects are quite good. If you want good entertainment Cloverfield is the movie for you."
"nitzanhavoc","9","1","1","2 August 2018"," I am NOT a fan of Found Footage, but wow... Simply wow!!!
","I've only recently grown accustomed to Found Footage films, giving them a chance as a Horror enthusiast who ran out on other Netflix options. I'm not yet a fan, but having recently had some positive experiences and remembering the finer qualities of 10 Cloverfield Lane, I've decided to check out the film that gave birth to J. J. Abrams ""Cloververse"". Wow, was I ever in for a surprise.<br/><br/>Cloverfield tells the story of a group of friends in their mid-twenties, celebrating protagonist Rob (Michael Stahl-David)'s move to Japan after receiving a big promotion. As the exposition progresses, it's made apparent that Rob is in love with Beth (Odette Annable), and the film jumps between the currently documented events and previous events filmed prior on the same tape (showing Rob and Beth). Suddenly, something huge and unnatural attacks Manhattan, and the group attempts to run for their lives while doing their best to save each other.<br/><br/>So far everything sounds corny, banal and mediocre, but trust me, it's everything but. Everything I dislike about Found Footage is beautifully improved upon in Cloverfield: the acting and characters feel authentic without presumptuous tendencies of being ""overly real"", the plot actually makes sense (minus, of course, the huge 1950's monster), and mty favorite - there is actually a legitimate explanation as to why on earth they keep the camera rolling while running for their lives (which is a lot more that the human crave for attention despite all logic).<br/><br/>Cloverfield got me really immersed, at the edge of my seat hoping for the characters' success and love's victory over disaster. Again, sounds corny, but I couldn't help myself. I was on edge the entire film (since the attack) and haven't for one moment felt anything ruining my suspense of disbelief (and I'm a cynical douche at times, especially when it comes to Horror, I have no idea how this film managed to disarm me so, but it did). It's been a while since I've watched a Horror film that felt like it ended too soon for me (not because it did, but because I enjoyed it so much). I'm in absolute awe of how fun great watching this was. Also, without giving any spoilers, the final touch is given towards the end of the credits, so stay tuned!<br/><br/>It is of course a matter of opinion. Some of you might hate this film, others might find it to be mediocre at best (a phrase I have used often to describe numerous Horror films), but I simply won't be able to forgive myself if I don't wholeheartedly recommend that you quit reading my fanboy rambling and go watch this. I envy you for being about to experience this film for the first time."

","I'm no fan of the 'found footage' format and have never understood the popularity of the original 'Blair Witch Project' movie, but I honestly don't think 'Cloverfield' is as bad as some of the other reviews would have you believe. The film is exactly what you expect it to be - a first person thriller full of scares, screams and CGI. It's unoriginal, uninspiring and unspectacular, but it was never intended to be in the first place.<br/><br/>If you can put your brain into neutral for an hour an a half, 'Cloverfield' is a decent if unremarkable piece of entertainment. Okay, the constant camera movement is nauseating and the characters dumb and annoying, but it functions well as a cheap sci-fi flick. 'Cloverfield' is nothing new and nothing special, but it's okay for what it is."
"PhoebeDay","8","1","1","25 October 2016"," Firsthand Experience
","The movie does an extremely good job of making you feel as though you're taking part in the movie. The creatures are a good mix of scary and interesting. JJ Abrams did a good job of creating a story that not only offered the viewer a first hand experience because of the camera style, but also the chance to connect with the characters. Even though you're only shown bits of and pieces of each person and how they act - they way they respond to things really gives us, the audience, a good view of who they are. The cinematography itself is intense, but interesting - some may find it hard on the eyes, but it does offer the viewer a unique firsthand experience of a monster attack and I highly recommend it."
"Malteser999","7","1","1","6 May 2016"," One word: Breathtaking
","Wow. I mean wow. I had really low expectations when in reality, it became one of my favorite monster movies of all time. A concept like found footage is still pretty new amongst the film industry after the insane success of The Blair Witch Project back in 1999 (picking up 3 times its budget). That's why we are still exploring with this new format of cinematography. Thus, a lot of them are utter garbage.<br/><br/>Let's go over what makes this movie phenomenal and, especially, why does the found footage style does fit as the cinematography. The main plot of the film is basically ""Cloverfield"" attacking Manhattan alongside with the filler love/family conflict just for the sake of the runtime. Even though I absolutely didn't find anything interesting or at the very least likable with the characters, the experience that they had to go through made my heart raise to the level I barely couldn't breathe. The camera-work was genius not because it's ""new and groundbreaking"", but because we have to witness the horror the stars of the movie had to deal with, mainly the big dude holding the camcorder. <br/><br/>Now for the ""not so great"" portions. Like I mentioned earlier, characters are just as bland as a plain yogurt you can find at your nearest grocery store, with the addition of being total unlikable d-bags. If there's a skyscraper-size creature demolishing New York, might want to hide inside the building or find an underground cellar rather than roam around the streets.<br/><br/>But hey, it's a monster movie that suffers similar issues like Pacific Rim and Transformers. You were expecting the monsters and robots to be the icons, not the people. Yet, you left the theater without a major let down.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this found footage movie (unless you have motion sickness) if you're into disastrous flicks. And believe me when I say it's worth on Blu-Ray."
"CrenshawPete","4","1","1","10 April 2016"," If you didn't hate shaky cam before, you will after seeing this!
","Despite being a cross between a rip off of Godzilla, War of the Worlds, and Alien / Aliens, Cloverfield (whatever that refers to) sort of had an interesting approach: make the viewer feel like they're along for the ride. Unfortunately the execution was horrible.<br/><br/>I've always hated this ""shaky cam"" approach to TV and film that's become a fad in the last 15 years or so. Although some of my favourite TV shows and movies have been filmed using this approach, I totally despise it. What is wrong with mounting the damn camera? People are going to look back in 20 or 30 years and roll their eyes at this idiotic fad. Was it supposed to make us feel like we're there, in the scene? It doesn't.<br/><br/>Well anyway, someone told the makers of this movie that people love shaky cam. In fact, they love it so much so that they want to see the effect put on steroids! And so we're treated with two hours of the camera bouncing up and down and zooming in and out of focus on random things. It's an abuse, not only on the eyes, but to all the senses.<br/><br/>If that weren't bad enough, the first 20 minutes or so of the film is just a party where a bunch of twenty-something hipsters babble on about the usual twenty-something he said, she said nonsense while looking at their phones and nursing their beers. This is what passes for character development. For me, it was about as exciting as watching a dog lick itself where the sun don't shine... on shaky cam!<br/><br/>After the monster is introduced into the movie... I don't know 30 minutes into the film... we follow Rob around town. Rob is apparently some genius who makes the world go round, because all we hear about throughout the film is ""where's Rob"", ""what does Rob think?"", ""what's Rob doing?"", ""Hey, Rob!"", ""Rob!"", ""Rob!"" Not since Mary Tyler Moore in the Dick Van Dyke Show have I heard someone say ""Rob"" that many times on screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Rob's an idiot. He decides to go against conventional wisdom (i.e. to get out of town) and instead goes marching straight into the carnage. His friends, who follow this guy around like David Koresh, go with him on his merry adventure to an early grave. When the group finally stumbles upon the military, the military allows them to leave the secure zone and go back onto the streets! Why? Glad you asked! In order to climb to the top of a skyscraper that's on fire and has fallen over and is now leaning against another skyscraper. Apparently these folks didn't watch ""The Towering Inferno"".<br/><br/>The cover of this Blu Ray had quotes like ""Terrifying!"" I think it should have had quotes like ""Stupid!"" or ""Absolutely makes no sense!"" Had I been at the theatre, I would have walked out. I couldn't have cared less about any of these people or their white upper-class, privileged, yuppie interpersonal drama.<br/><br/>The number one problem with this movie was the camera gimmick. It was like watching unedited vacation footage shot by a five year old on a Sony Handycam. NEVER again will I sit through a movie shot like this. The second problem was the characters and dialogue, or lack there of. I can live with the fact that the plot makes no sense and the film really has no point, but the former ruins what little redeeming qualities this thing has left.<br/><br/>I'll be generous and give it 4/10 for a twist on the themes it ripped off, but I don't think I could sit through a second viewing. All in all this film seems to be a marketing gimmick, rather than an original contribution to the science fiction genre."
"pfeiferlj","2","1","1","2 April 2016"," Dizzy
","Filmed as if holding a hand-held smart phone. Many scenes involved swooping back and forth, up and down, slanted angles, and sometimes shaky (emphasis on hand-held) which made me dizzy to the point that I couldn't finish the film. Rather than adding a sense of realism, the phone-screen filming approach felt gimmicky. It made me nauseous. I could see using the hand-held phone screen a few times for style, but the technique is way over-used in this movie, in my opinion,and tires quickly. The plot itself is a good story with good acting and script, but the confines of the smart phone filming limited how long I could watch it without closing my eyes, not from fear but from feeling dizzy. I wish I could have given this film more stars, but filming techniques shouldn't get in the way of telling a story. In my personal experience, with this movie, the filming techniques became the story."

","Yes, Cloverfield's pretty good. IT had fast paced action with quite a good horror/monster movie premise. The monster was very well done the story makes sense, unlike lots of horror flicks that is just full of dumb people. It was actually scary and quite intense, it is a faced paced movie not an excruciating and long horror movie of some creepy baby attempting to murder someone for two hours. <br/><br/>The found footage element was quite well done too, actually I feel that it elevated the movie a lot. In fact if we take that out it wouldn't be half as good as it was, obviously the whole mystery of not knowing what the movie is gonna be about was quite a marketing strategy. It really sort of creates an immersive and real-world vibe to the film.<br/><br/>I watched cloverfield just as many others, not knowing what I am getting myself into but the outcome was great. In fact I must reiterate this movie I feel is as good as it is because of the nature of it and that great marketing strategy. Because no expectation= positive outcome even if it's not as good as it is. This is an example of how a movie going experience does not always start in the theatre and in fact the entire marketing campaign building up to it really helps make the experience a much better one. <br/><br/>However I think that there are some flaws despite all of those positives, first of all as I have said the movie alone is not so good, it was quite well done but the marketing deserves a lot of credit. Second of all, I do wish that the monster was much better realised, perhaps more focus on the monster that could come with a slightly longer run time. But overall the positives definitely outweighs the negatives"

","Cloverfield offers a fast paced thriller without surprises but with a uncommon marketing that definitely helped to the success of the movie. This movie has to be taken as an entertaining affair, extremely hard filmed and not for those who are easy to faint.<br/><br/>Everything starts with a celebration that goes downhill after the city collapses because of an unexpected and brutal attack that will leave deadly marks for the future of all the involved.<br/><br/>The movies does a really good job by showing the anxiety through POV and the good performances of their actors.<br/><br/>The ending is a bit of disappointment and the movie totally lacks of a deeper or meaningful story, but it lives up to its marketing campaign delivering a well rounded tour of horror and chills."

","So I managed to wait till 1am on a Sunday morning/Sat night to see this film and I think that helped and worked better than say Tu @ 10 am or other times.<br/><br/>If you want a roller-coaster movie and you've read enough of the Blair Witch/Godzilla analogies to be interested, I'd say stop and just check out the movie at a time that works for you.<br/><br/>Spoilers may follow:<br/><br/>To me, while the idea of this being a visceral response to 911 is understandable, I took it in a broader sense of a response to death. Like death, the monster is mostly kept out of our view; arguably a better film and a better life comes from incorporating the monster more forthrightly, but this film is not the place to have that argument.<br/><br/>There's not time, there's a friggin' monster on the loose. Any sense of security is false, and death has many manifestations, not just the overwhelming black shadows cast from above....there are smaller crazier minions and even some form of micro-organism infiltration that can really get under your skin.<br/><br/>Death is inevitable, so the response from this film is a quest for love. And that seems fair enough for me. Death still sucks.<br/><br/>Plenty of ""Harrison Ford School of Acting"" (people physically damaged, never mind their mental interiors). The Gen Y dialog and Hud as an affable, goofy, overly talkative big teddy bear of an Ishmael might be a deal-breaker for some, but I found him as endearing as he was essential in this film.<br/><br/>I could see other interpretations coming out of this movie in film theory classes (the monster as celebrity, and Hud as the paparazzi?) could be fun to read over.<br/><br/>Really more of a 6.5 for me....tricky to balance how much to (over)think about this."

","Well, I cannot give a good review of a movie, so I'm just gonna be straight out about Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is about a monster attacking NYC without any purpose and explanation, the first 20 minutes of the film is about a boring party, and then the attack begins. It is a bad movie with a bad video view that left me dizzy and feel nauseous after watched the movie. Hudson, hold it more steadily please.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* What Cloverfield lack is explanation, where does the monster come from, why does it attacks, or why the monster can not be taken down by that series of bombing,nuking, and shooting. There is no explanation at all, the strangest fact is why the video camera survives from a nuclear explosion and it just works fine.<br/><br/>Beth was bleeding for like several hours, with her chest stabbed by some metal, then Rob saves her, and she can run like a horse, like that kind of bleeding doesn't matter. Hello, that's so unrealistic.<br/><br/>The scene where they are going with helicopter, the monster was bombed down very hard, and the monster fell down, the helicopter was like circling around it which is very stupid thing to do, and the alien/monster/whatever it is, just attack the helicopter that have been flying a skyscraper high, an it fell down, left no survivor except for the 3 main actors. Come on!! Impossible!<br/><br/>*Ends of Spoiler*<br/><br/>This movie is not the worst, but I suggest to avoid watching this movie after meal, it will makes you dizzy. <br/><br/>n.b Sorry for the bad English,Xp"
"jason-1869","4","1","1","15 October 2010"," A ""Godzilla meets Blair Witch"" waste of time
","I was really interested in this film when I first watched previews on TV, but I was bitterly disappointed when I actually seen the movie.<br/><br/>It is a combination of the Godzilla monster in New York and the ""Blair Witch Project"" camera work. The first **20 minutes** are of a silly party where we ""meet"" the characters thought their on-camera ""best wishes"" to their friend who's moving away. This was painfully boring and didn't really tell us much. (Think of watching home videos of people you don't know.) The whole movie has a short running time (about 1 hour 12 minutes without the credits), offers no history, and doesn't answer any questions at all. Many scenes are extremely dark ... and I wouldn't get your hopes up about the monster. Without going into too much detail, you mainly see the effects of it rather than the monster itself.<br/><br/>I highly recommend NOT wasting your time with this movie."

I mean in the context of did the world cease to exist? I want to know!!! But I can get over that, kinda. I loved the random creatures here and there and the 'virus' that people got. The monsters were sweet looking, almost realistic. I loved how you felt as you were there I had the urge to get up and run with the movie. I could feel the emotions and the adrenaline almost as if I was there.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 6 because I liked it but the ending killed it for me..."
"thesar-2","6","1","1","16 October 2009"," Godzilla VS. the Blair Witch
","What an achievement 'Cloverfield' was. From no-name actors, to no-name title, to one of the most influential advertising campaigns to the movie it mimicked: 'Blair Witch Project.' It also ranks as one of the shortest movies I've ever seen (actual screen time: 73 minutes) yet it seems 3x that. And this includes a 19 minute introduction that seems like 4x that. So, in total, you get a real 54 minutes of movie you wanted: Monster attacking NYC. Unfortunately, it's short on depth for characters, even with that lovey-dovey 19 minute prelude with yuppies we are supposed to care about, but don't. If anything, we care more about the fabulous view from their apartment(s) than their shallow lives. After the initial 19 shaky-camera minutes trying to find out who's who and why, you get an almost identical remake of the remake of 'Godzilla' (1998.) You're treated to a giant whatchamacalit who spawns off little creatures to get in those ""hard-to-reach"" areas the beast can't fit in. Okay, I liked the movie. It's fun, it's completely realistic; where there is complete chaos and without the news at your fingertips, you really don't know what's going on. You have to give it to the film makers to making possibly the most plausible monster B-Movie of all time. Unfortunately, even with (as mentioned) just 54 minutes of true footage, you get the feeling they stretched this out as thin as it would go. In addition, you get incredibly, and I mean down-right unbelievably stupid people to follow during this crisis. Half the movie is a senseless rescue mission. My friend and I made a pack following the film: if I were caught, leave me be, save yourself! Honestly, I would love to see a sequel, to learn more, but please drop the camera."
"gigan-92","6","1","1","25 May 2009"," Good and Bad Points
","This film may have been one of the most over hyped and especially over rated films of all time. The way it's shot was a clever idea and creates a sense of realism one could say. It certainly feels real watching it in a crowded theater. There are some scary moments and good terror scenes with our ominous monster and enjoyable characters even. However, I'm a monster movie fan, Godzilla being my #1, and this film was a little too short in my opinion. We never really get a back story of the monster or what becomes of it. Was it finally defeated or did it rampage through Miami next? Plus we never get to see the monster for longer than a few seconds without the camera shaking out of control. Very annoying. And did the couple survive or die like everybody else? Too many questions left unanswered for my taste but some will find it enjoyable."
"BlackenedGass","5","1","1","24 September 2008"," Average at best
","I didn't see this film until last week, and before it came out I spectacularly managed to miss all of the hype... never even saw a trailer.<br/><br/>In fact I wouldn't have seen the film at all if a friend had given it to me. I'm not a fan of Lost so I wasn't particularly thrilled when I heard the makers were making a film, but I digress...<br/><br/>The plot begins well, with the party and people talking to the camera wishing the guy who was leaving well, but then the monster attacked and it went downhill from there.<br/><br/>The thing is this: Although the film is done in an original manner (the hand-held camera) the special effects and all that don't disguise the fact that nothing that happened in the story that happens is remotely original. I have seen so many different films where the various things happen. The attack in the tunnel? Name a horror film, it's probably in there somewhere. The girl exploding cos of a monster growing in her? Alien.<br/><br/>I also found it difficult to accept some of things happening. Would you really film the entire thing? I could imagine it going up to say, the bridge but after that surely it would be destroyed in the confusion. I also found it unusual that there was a distinct lack of wreckage, or at least less wreckage than i thought. Hell, even most of the buildings were left intact, with the only one visibly damaged just having to be the one they want to get into. What luck. Also, the girl being pulled out and walking, running etc. after being IMPALED, with no loss of blood or anything, is also rather odd.<br/><br/>There were some good bits though. The moment when the monster lunges for the helicopter gave me a good fright, and the sequence in the party was also good as I mentioned before, but were these really enough to carry the whole movie? No.<br/><br/>Overall this is an original take on monster movies, albeit with a dull plot and the only original bit (wobbly camera) gets annoying after a bit. Worth watching maybe once but nothing to come back to.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I saw this after most people had, so my expectations we're high. After watching it, I had realised I never had so fun much fun watching a monster movie. I used to love Godzilla movies but after a while, the fun just was sucked away as I grew up.<br/><br/>Then, I went to see this. It was so adult and so personal, it packs a heavy emotional punch. It had me thinking what I would do in a situation like that, how I would react with my friends dieing around me while being stalked by a creature in one of the largest cities in the world.<br/><br/>The beginning makes you show compassion towards the characters, it shows their personal lives and drama's we've all faced at one point in our life, then, it all gets turned upside down. The hand-held camera doesn't catch everything so it's like your watching from a first person perspective so you see what the characters are seeing from there perspective like when the army roll down the streets and Hud the cameraman ducks behind the cars as you hear the monster roaring, it adds that fear and terror as you feel like you hiding with him.<br/><br/>Then there is the monster. The monster is the most important part of a monster film, of course, and the production team have really made a monster to be scared of. Also, the idea of it shedding off little parasite creatures adds to the fear and terror and confusion that the characters on screen feel.<br/><br/>A must see, but is best viewed in a cinema if you caught it or with a home cinema system for the effect.<br/><br/>A brilliant masterpiece of monster film making without the tacky cheesiness of a B-movie."
"ChaseIsPro","10","1","1","17 June 2008"," Better in the Theatres, but still good
","Back when this movie went to theatres, I went to see it. There, the experience was great, you felt like you were there with Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlene(spelling?)I thought the action, the thrills just everything was perfect. So after a few months, I decided to check it out on DVD, so when I got it I was excited to get to see the movie I have been waiting for so long. But after I got through about 30 minutes of it, it got kind of boring. It wasn't as thrilling, I felt as if I was watching War Of the Worlds(Not saying it was a bad movie AT ALL) I say that because it was just like watching a movie, it wasn't as if I were there. But still if you like Monster movies, and you have nothing to do, go up to the local Video Store and rent it. Still good, but not as good as in the theatres."
"phi-eagles","10","1","1","15 June 2008"," Intense
","It has its moments. The hand-held thing makes the movie very intense. Though Hud at some points just functions as the directer of the documentary, for example when he's being funny, he still adds some excitement to the movie, with his outrageous outburst sometimes.<br/><br/>The monster. Well. I think they did a good job keeping the monster relatively secret and hided by buildings in the first part of the movie. It makes you sit on the edge of your seat trying to get a glimpse of the monster and then we u finally get to see the thing going around in the city but also when Hud films it from the ground, u get a nasty but puzzled feeling in your stomach. You can't really put any words on it. That's why I think the monster is well-made.<br/><br/>The small creatures, which jumps off it, should have been cut out or at least been made more creepy. But they contribute to about 20 minutes of the movie. The night vision on the camera is probably stolen from The Descent, but it still freaks the audience out, 'cause you know, what u're gonna see, when they put it on. <br/><br/>The ending is acceptable. YOu are caught by a big surprise, when Hud is suddenly standing right below it and films it. YOu hope for a moment, that it passes by, 'cause u want someone to survive. <br/><br/>It's an ending, that makes you go ""It can't end like this"" or ""Was that the ending?"" Although you probably see it coming 30 minutes before the ending, you still want a rather happy ending and see the monster go down. But an ending like the old X-Files series. Can there be a sequel?"
"allergicreaction","4","24","82","19 January 2008"," Could have been very good
","If this movie had been filmed in 3rd person like a regular movie, instead of a character ""documenting"" the events on a video camera, I would've rated this 8 out of 10. The way it was filmed is headache inducing and annoying. Great premise ruined by poor execution. I used to love Japanese monster movies when I was a kid and was really looking forward to Cloverfield's unique take on the subject. This is better than that Godzilla remake from the 90's but like that movie I'll bet this opens huge and tanks on its second weekend. Maybe I'll give this one a 2nd chance when it comes out on DVD. A video game where the playable character has to rescue someone in a city being destroyed by a giant monster would be a lot of fun to play."

I have no idea how anyone could get scared in a piece of garbage like this. When the movie was over, I saw many people laughing. I heard the person sitting behind me say that Cloverfield was the least scariest movie he had ever seen.

","Cloverfield tries to emualte The Blair Witch Project and fails spectacularly. If you're going to rip off a movie, rip off a good one! Everything about this movie stinks. The ""gimmick"" of being recorded on home video gets in the way of actually telling the story. Literally there are plot points that cannot get across because of the films style. When one of your main characters is heard but hardly seen, it makes sense for that character to not have an annoyingly whiny and dumb voice. In fact, all of the male actors in this movie are stupifyingly annoying. So much so, they all mold into one person. I couldn't tell who was who for most of this movie, making it hard to care about any of the characters plights. All the cool stuff happens off screen or out of focus or the camera is filming the ground at the time. It is the cinematic equivalent of turning up ten seconds after a hot chick has just put her top back on. This will be a contender for worst film of the year- a film that is too bogged down in it's own cleverness and gimmickry to make sense or engage the audience."
"metallica1417","4","31","113","17 January 2008"," An unfortunate disappointment.

Rather than sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next you sit there yawning wondering when will something happen at all. However I will hand it to the person/s who designed the creature...it's interesting and very unique but it was still not enough to make up for the rest of the film being a complete waste of time which was even worse due to the immense hype surrounding the film. You feel nothing for any of the characters, there is no storyline to speak of really so I can't comment on it as it pretty much didn't exist.<br/><br/>Just my two cents on the film."
"craigb5277","1","30","109","18 January 2008"," hand held camera whole time confusing
","The whole movie is shot from a hand held camera, which is confusing and hard to follow. Kept waiting for the movie to start, and then it was over. It wasn't really boring, which is the worst thing I can say about a movie, but it was difficult to watch and had no story line to speak of and never answered any questions. There was some character development in the beginning, but that fell off. There were a few shots of the creature, but mostly just noises and explosions. As I stated before it was shot from the perspective of a hand held camera carried by one of the characters, like the movie Bell Witch. But, unlike Bell Witch, it was a lot more difficult to see what was going on. Topsy-Turvy jump around effect. All in all I was let down by the movie. And, I am sure there will be claims of $100 million spent on the movie, but it looked like a shoe string budget with no big name actors."
"bloodmane","3","21","72","22 January 2008"," I couldn't stop thinking about how silly this film was
","While the tilt-a-whirl camera style didn't make me nauseous, the fact that a friend paid for the two of us to see this film nearly did. If it wasn't for the last five minutes or so (which were wonderful to me) I would have gotten no real enjoyment out of watching Cloverfield. People walking out of the theater commented on how 'real' it felt. All I could think and say in reply was 'Oh, Please!' If this film was intended to excite, it failed in my case. It seemed ludicrous to me and had me checking my watch often. I can suspend my disbelief on the thinnest of threads, but Cloverfield turned that thread into a gnarled and tangled ball. Who in their right mind would carry, much less continue to operate, a camcorder while some gargantuan creature is tearing up the city? Danger is in X direction and safety might be in Y direction. I don't know very many twenty-something party-goers who would trot off in direction X unless they'd either had far too much to drink at the party or had just been dumped by their significant others and wanted to take a ride on the suicide express."

","Never have I felt so compelled to write a review of a movie but this one really ""takes the cake"" for being a great and over-hyped waste of time. The movie starts off with a ridiculously long opening sequence of the main characters at a party that fails in its attempts to, in any way, make you care about who these people are or why they are there. After this of course is when the action starts. Not to give away any of the storyline, although there was a limited plot to spoil, the movie turns out to be a colossal bore. The majority of the scenes are just drawn out with bad dialogue by the main characters as they stumble along, intermixed with various choppy scenes of people running combined with lots of screaming and yelling. The only truly interesting part of the movie is the fact that the 4 stupidest people in New York State (the main characters) seem to be able to survive and pull off greater feats then any of the other trained specialists in the area, i.e. Police, Military, and Emergency Response. If you are looking for a great way to waste a couple hours of your time, or perhaps catch up on some much needed sleep, this movie is a sound option."

Do Not Waste your time or money on this turkey of a film. I can't even think of one saving grace to the entire, quite literally sickening hour and a half.

","SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>OK, so I knew things before watching Cloverfield. It was going to be handy cam style, the ending was going to be abrupt and scenes of the monster was going to be brief with no explanations to its origins. That said, none of that bothered me. A lot of other stuff screwed things up instead.<br/><br/>It starts with preparations for Rob's going away party to Japan. His brother Jason hands the camera to Hud to document farewells from his friends. During the party, Beth arrives with her date which clearly upsets Rob. Beth leaves the party early. While Hud (cameraman) and his brother Jason are trying to convince Rob to go after her, an explosion jolts the building. Everyone rushes to the rooftop to see what's going on and more explosions sends everyone into a panic out into the streets. A building comes down and our gang hides in a shop. Dust clears and one of the girls from the party has seen something (right, this is where it starts NOT to make sense...). She says ""It's eating people"" and when asked what she saw, she clams up. Not because she's in shock, but she just chooses not to say anymore.<br/><br/>This is the typical kind of one line statement that peppers Lost and Heroes that's supposed to leave us hanging and make us think. It may work on a television show with a forgiving fan base, but not on the big screen. Why nobody presses her for more info is anyone's guess.<br/><br/>Jason dies when the Manhattan bridge is attacked. Concrete crashes, no monster. Rob gets a call on his cell from Beth saying she's trapped. Rod breaks away from his friends running back wanting to rescue Beth. His friend, cameraman Hud, his bro's girlfriend Lily and her friend Marlena try to stop him then follow along. The whole thing is so silly because rather than exercise common grown-up sense and head for safety, they go back into the into a battle zone to save someone who could well be dead.<br/><br/>Our heroes head into the subways where they meet offsprings/parasites of the monster. Dog sized spider-like things. Marlena is bitten. They run into the army makeshift hospital that is about to evacuate. Rob goes on and on about saving his friend and one army guy decides its OK for them to go off into the darkness. He tells them there's a helicopter pickup at 6.00 am.<br/><br/>It turns out Beth's high tower apartment block is leaning dangerously against another tower. They make it to the 39th floor, on foot. And would you believe it, Beths's alive. No other other bodies, just Beth amidst the debris of her apartment. At the chopper site, Lily takes off in the first helicopter. The second with Rob, Beth and Hud is taken down by the monster. This is is our first real look at the thing. Interesting to say the least.<br/><br/>Our three survive, and we hear the radio say the assault on the monster has failed. We see Hud run back to pick up the camera. The monster looms above and this is where we get the best look of it yet. It kills Hud. In the end Rob in hiding with Beth, and his face bloodied battered, speaks into the camera he's holding. Beth cries. Crashing sounds all goes black. The End.<br/><br/>Simple. What didn't work.<br/><br/>1. Rob's ridiculous decision to run back into the mayhem in the thick of night based on a call before his cell battery dies. He's either brave or an imbecile with a one-track mind. Unfortunately, if you're grownup he gets the imbecile vote. We don't empathize with Rob's decision because we don't feel anything for him and Beth. Nothing was ever developed there for us to feel a thing.<br/><br/>2. Actually finding Beth. It's unbelievable that they can make it to the 39th floor without any other dead bodies or wounded in sight and they find Beth.<br/><br/>3. Marlena dies, and it bugs you that no one blames Rob. Because you will. All my friends did. Even my girlfriend said Beth wasn't worth saving. <br/><br/>4. The lack of talk of the monster itself. Every time Hud says something, everyone wants him to stop because they don't feel like talking. If this really happened, I don't think you could talk of anything else! <br/><br/>5. The monster itself. Origins unknown. Ugly, but it doesn't look big enough to cause such a vast area of destruction. This is the kind of mayhem you'd get if it was Godzilla large.<br/><br/>6. The portable spider things. Really underused. We see them on the telly falling on soldiers and when they attack our heroes in the subway, its just all too quick. After that, they're not scary in the least.<br/><br/>7. The ending. Boy, that didn't sit well with the audience. Lot of shouts like they'd been cheated. Everyone walked out complaining. It was the first day, so I guess when word of mouth spreads there'll be less grumbling later on.<br/><br/>I walked out trying to think of all the redeeming qualities and all I think of was how pretty the women were in the movie. If that's the only last impression I have, a lot didn't work.<br/><br/>Sort of like giving a kid the mind-blowing budget, the actors the sets and asking him to come up with a story reality-TV style. So he comes up with a save my favorite pet story better suited for Nicklelodeon."

","""Cloverfield"" is a very weak movie no better than your slightly above-average Sci-Fi Channel Original Made-For-Television monster movie. It has so much in common with that kind of stuff--the bland, sub-par, no-name young actors; the same bland, lackwit dialogue; the same lame, clichéd, tacked-on love story; and the same halfway decent, but barely-glimpsed CGI monsters. The ONLY thing ""Cloverfield"" had going for it was the gimmick of telling the story through the ""eyes"" of a camcorder--and they blew that entirely. For that gimmick to work, you'd have to totally commit to the concept--ie, exactly what would this kind of thing look like if captured by an amateur with a camera? And this is the part at which the screenplay, producer, and the director totally fail. They mistake shaking the camera around for ""realism."" But ""realism"" is the exact opposite of the effect that the direction and camera-work of ""Cloverfield"" convey. The movie is supposed to look like someone shot this with a hand-held vidcam, but what it actually looks like is a movie shot by a guy wearing a camera on his head like a hat. ""We see what he sees"" is not what you would get if the cameraman is holding the camera in his hand. You'd get that only if he's holding the camera up to his eye for 90 minutes straightall the while running from a big monster, fighting off smaller monsters, climbing across debris, and jumping from one building to another. And he never drops the camera (though it does hit the ground a couple of times, though that's only because the guy holding the camera hits the ground. And the camera never breaks! That is some great damn camera! Must have a ""super-grip"" handle and be virtually indestructible! I want one!).<br/><br/>But that is not the only way that ""Cloverfield"" totally blows its own gimmick. The filmmakers also decided to put their little camcorder in the hands of a guy who, even though he is supposed to be a complete regular-guy dumbass, apparently has an innate gift for pointing said camcorder in exactly the right direction needed in order to catch each bit of clichéd dialogue and each clichéd reaction to said clichéd dialogue.<br/><br/>The people who made ""Cloverfield"" took a really lame giant monster story, cast it with your typical young Soap Opera actors, and knew that they would have to depend entirely on the ""shot from someone's vidcam"" gimmick to give the thing its oomph and interest. And they half-assed it all the way.<br/><br/>The trailer we all saw last summer was much more entertaining than the finished product."

","I won't even BOTHER going into discussing the utter disaster that is ""Cloverfield"". Pointless. But I feel compelled to speak about it's creator: JJ Abrams.<br/><br/>He's a hack. Period.<br/><br/>He's got practically everyone FOOLED into thinking that he's this ""genius"" when he's NOT. He's a master at ""cool concepts"" and ""fluff"", but that's it. The guy's not about SUBSTANCE in any shape or form. AT. ALL.<br/><br/>I may offend some readers with this next line, but take a pill. Breathe deeply. And embrace common sense. Here it comes: JJ Abrams' show ""LOST"" is the first show in television history that actually describes the people who watch it.<br/><br/>Own it. You KNOW it's true.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" was ALL HYPE and NO SUBSTANCE. See? There's a pattern here, people. JJ Abrams is a master of ""hype"". That's all. Take his earlier creations for instance--""Alias"" and ""LOST"". <br/><br/>""LOST"" started out with some measure of promise, but it, like its predecessor ""Alias"", was all hype and gimmick. Buy a vowel people. Can't you see you've been had?! That's why ""Alias"" lost most of its die-hard fans by the end of the third season. It ran out of steam. And quickly! The writers were seriously spinning their wheels, and like ""LOST"" is currently experiencing, they painted themselves into a very small corner. That's why most of the creepy and cool stuff is NEVER FULLY EXPLAINED. In ""Alias"", it was that Rambaldi thingy. In ""LOST"", it's EVERYTHING!!! (i.e, that mechanical monster, the appearance of a polar bear, need I go on?) JJ Abrams is that ""idea guy"" at the glossy boardroom table. He's got great ideas, but nothing SUBSTANTIAL with any staying power. He's like: ""Hey, you know what would be cool?"" And then when asked how this would work, or how that would play out, he simply responds: ""Hey, I came up with the cool idea. You guys figure the rest out."" And he gets paid gobs of cash for that??! <br/><br/>So it's no surprise whatsoever that ""Cloverfield"" is a MAJOR DUD!! <br/><br/>In closing, cut the puppet strings that JJ Abrams has in his greedy paws. DON'T continue to buy into the HYPE. Trust me, if you do, (like with this schlop of a movie) you will always, ALWAYS be disappointed."

We had been forewarned about the handicam unsteadiness of the film, so we sat in the back of the theatre so we wouldn't get queasy.

I felt like I was there and it even made me a little dizzy (which I liked). If you like roller coasters basically you will like this movie. It was completely different than the Blair Witch Project and comparing it to such a crappy film would be a huge disservice. In my opinion the acting and personalities in the film hit right at home and Hud reminded me of that annoyingly funny friend that we all have and love. I also felt like the movie did not sell out by giving up its ""first person"" experience. Some people will say the movie was nauseating but it just made it that more intense... shooting this movie any other way wouldn't have been the same. The only flaw I could think of is the battery life of the camera. However, most cameras have a battery life longer than an hour and 40 minutes... isn't that how long the movie was? It clearly show the camera getting shut off and turned back on later. None the less there are still going to be those people that are never satisfied with anything and can't stand change so I can't guarantee everyone liking this movie as much as me and the people I went to see it with."

","The movie made me dizzy and almost throw up soon after it started due to the shaking angles from the home video camera. The intro looked fine for the first two minutes, then I started wondering when it will finish and when the scene can change to something taken by a regular video camera. To my surprise, the intro went on and on with irrelevant details, and the camera continued to move violently for about 20 minutes before the monster came, when the shaking scenes finally became intolerable. I had been struggling of whether to give up, because I was tortured severely by the sickness caused by the shaking camera but meanwhile still hoped that the movie will at some point turned as exciting and spectacular as the trailer...<br/><br/>I was totally disappointed and left the theater half way of the movie, after several people left ahead of me.

"Caelin_Lobay","3","23","84","17 January 2008"," Over Hyped
","What can I say about Cloverfield? Well, first off, I didn't like it. I'm not trying to say it was a failure all together because it will surely rank in the dollars from Hollywood movie goers. The one thing that MUST be credited about it is the films promotion, the film was using this ""unknown "" monster as publicity and I thought that was amazingly well done and it was truly the talk of the town.<br/><br/>As for why I did not enjoy it, there are several reasons. First, the unoriginal idea whether it be a monster attacking a city or simply the portable home camera usage. I thought both of these ideas were perfected in other films and all around executed much better. Secondly, the ""scare tactics"" used. These were by far the most predictable and by the book as you can get. They seemed to follow the ""Hand Book: How to Make a Scary Movie"" and made a checklist. Restricted camera/view? Check. Dark environment? Check. And the worst of them all, LOUD SOUNDS? CHECK, and this was excessively done, almost to the point of putting your hands on your ears (and no, I'm not 60+ years old). Not to mention the non-diegetic sounds they used in the tunnels that relates to nothing around the characters. It's as if they found the sequence not suspenseful enough so they added their own sounds? Way to break their own portrayal.<br/><br/>One thing I will give this film is the juxtaposition with the 9/11 attack and how they either intentionally or unintentionally mimicked parts of real home footage taping the attack. This is definitely a better use of a scaring effect as 9/11 is still close in our hearts and memories. This is also executed by the original Godzilla with the Hiroshima attack, and I believe both films, Cloverfield and Godzilla were made 7-9 years after either attack which is interesting to note.<br/><br/>P.S: If you have bad motion sickness I would advise you don't see this or you'll end up wasting 9.50$, a total of about 10-12 people left the theater due to this."
"The_Void","4","4","9","18 February 2009"," You can make a boring movie about anything....even a monster invasion.
","Despite being hailed as one of the 'most anticipated movies ever' around the start of 2008, I have to say I was never really bothered about Cloverfield and as such never found myself in any rush to see it. So now the hype has died down and finally I've seen the film and all I can say is that I'm relieved I didn't rush out to see it because after spending barely seventy minutes on the film, all I really have to say about it is that it's boring! Cloverfield begins with around fifteen minutes of character building and it's a major turn off. The main characters are all twenty something good looking ""cool guys"" that say things like 'dude' a lot. One of them is going away and he fancies one of the girls or something like that...etc etc. It reminded me a lot of one of those American TV dramas that I never watch. Anyway, they're all huddled together at a dull 'leaving party' when all of a sudden; Manhattan is shaken by an ""earthquake"". However, it's not an earthquake and in fact New York is being invaded by CGI monsters.<br/><br/>The film's main gimmick is that it's all filmed on a camera held by one of the main protagonists - in the same style as that film from 1999 that shall not be mentioned. Surprisingly, this isn't one of the main things I didn't like about the movie. The film is basically a special effects-fest and there's two ways that the budget is used; firstly we've got the shots of buildings falling and various things being destroyed, which is fairly well done. But then we've got the shots of the monsters, which are awful! They're poorly designed and the effects just look cheap. The film has enough problems to ensure that cheap-looking CGI isn't enough to spoil it on its own, but it doesn't help either. The effects are generally shown briefly, and in the case of the monsters this is a very good thing. Undoubtedly the most 'interesting' thing about the movie is the shots of helpless people panicking; but even this is not used to good - or exciting - effect. I would imagine that this film will be a great watch for any movie buffs that live in New York; if the movie were set in my home town, I'm sure that I'd have a great time watching everything get pummelled, but for the 99.9% of viewers that live elsewhere, this movie is unlikely to deliver the thrills you're after."

","I think it's further proof (like we needed that after Mathew Broderick's example) that big budget + Kaiju= Bad movie. The monster was just goofy looking and less threatening than Jet Jaguar. One of the great strengths of the genre is that the movies have a message, this was just a bunch of tweens running around with a camera, being the dumb asses they are. Well, that plus it's painfully slow start makes getting into it, well, let's just say I'm glad the phone rang right as I started watching the movie. Kinda like having to suffer through an episode of ""Friends"" so your girlfriend will let you watch a monster movie. Yes, the characters were all ""Friends"" clones. So don't expect anything intelligent from them. Even considering all other stupid things they did. I mean, really, even if you're going to accept their premises, why is it even after being attacked and running through a military field hospital, no one even thought to grab at least a pistol to fend off the little ones that are going to make you explode? You don't grab a first aid kit because, you know, you're out to save your dying friend? But it's okay, it's only movie dying, once you get to her check point, she's okay. What really pisses me off is that there really was no ""movie"" to this movie. It's just a collection of different random events chronologically sequenced. There's no ""meat"" to the story."

I thought the camera use was pointless, the 9/11 type sense a blatant attempt to try and evoke those thoughts and memories when it really did not pull it off as good as Godzilla does for japan. It was just blatant. Abrams does his thing which works for LOST and other soap opera type shows, but I wanted to at least learn something about the monster. Key questions that remain unanswered, What exactly is the monster? where did it come from? what caused it? how is the government involved?. This movie is like so many lost episodes, it will answer one question (what does the monster look like), and offer up about 10 more questions without answering them."

I think if you are going to go for 'realism' through hand held home movie type filming then you should also be realistic about it and keep it to 30 minutes long which is when the battery would have died. It could have worked if they transitioned from the hand held 'Blair Witch' style to a steady camera early on in the movie - at the point at which the battery died thereby providing a reasonable explanation for the transition. The first part of the movie at the party prior to the 'event' intended to develop characters was too long and seemed even longer with the frenetic camera."
"spookydude139","10","4","9","19 January 2008"," Get the hell over your need to be spoon fed your horror, then you might like this film
","I saw Cloverfield last night and I have a few things to say, so I figured what better place to say em.<br/><br/>First, if you're the type that gets motion sick, wait for the DVD. I'm completely serious. This is a rough film for those who get motion sick and while I want everyone to see it, I don't want it to be lumped in with a nauseous stomach in folks' memories. And if you push it and go ahead and go, just the first 10 minutes of Hud's crappy video technique is gonna have you ralphing in the aisles.<br/><br/>Next, to those of you who are prepared to hate this movie because you think the marketing/game was dumb: Get your heads out of your behinds. It's been a breath of fresh air to have something different in film to look forward to. If you want things to stay the same, keep pumping your money into classics like ""This Christmas"" and ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" and let the real movie fans have the good seats.<br/><br/>Look, Cloverfield ain't a Disney ride type horror film. You don't see people cutting off their arms, legs whatever to get away from a murderer. You don't have some maniac chainsawing coeds into pieces. This is a thinking' man's (and woman's) monster movie. And if you take a few minutes to THINK about WHAT they were trying to convey with this movie, you might just like it a little better.<br/><br/>I have had to listen to so many nasty comments about this movie being ""stupid"" or ""gay"" from so many ignorant folks I'm about ready to barf. I'm not disgusted by the opinions these people have. I'm disgusted by their need to have story spelled out in detail in order to enjoy it. The movie going public has, in a large part, become so used to cut and dried stories with a beginning middle and end (which this one really did have if you pay the heck attention to the frigging thing) where everything is cut and dried that when they're shown something like this, which is basically a teeny tiny cut of a teeny tiny portion of an attack on a major city, they don't know how to react and immediately dislike it.<br/><br/>Look people, this movie is the monster film equivalent to 1. If someone had a handy cam with them when heading out on a trip where the plane crashes and kept the thing running all the way into the ground. 2. (I apologize for the 9/11 analogy. Gods, so many people have done this but it's kinda true) If someone had their handy cam with em on 9/11 and taped their own efforts to get out of the building and the cam was found but they weren't.<br/><br/>It's a split second view of what it was like for these yuppies, many of whom have probably never really faced true fear before, who got caught up in this weird, terrifying situation. The beginning is just to get you an idea of who these people are. The rest is a documentary of their fight to stay alive.<br/><br/>That said, I plan to smack the next person who says they didn't see enough of the monster. WTF are you ON idiot???? I bet these people didn't understand Psycho or any Hitchcock film since he didn't shove folks face into the blood and gore.<br/><br/>You get to see plenty of the monster: Just as much as the actual characters saw which is the frigging point! And, to be honest, that last scene where you get up close and damned personal with the monster, that was PLENTY for me! Between that scene and the parasites, I was THRILLED with the monster stuff in this movie.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm glad some folks hate this movie. Because those who do ain't the kinda people I want to watch movies with anyhow! They're better off in line for Hostel, Saw, Wolf Creek or the horrific remake of Halloween foisted on us by Rob Zombie.<br/><br/>We need to encourage Hollywood to keep making original stories like this (no they didn't invent the monster movie, but at least this wasn't a frigging sequel, remake or other.. it was something someone actually thought up on their own for a change). If we don't, we're showing Hollywood we aren't smart enough to watch original stories and we'll keep getting fed crap.<br/><br/>Give the movie a chance. If you want, go to www.cloverfieldclues.com and dig deep into the back story. No, the back story is NOT a big part of this movie, but it serves to make you really curious as to what's going on. The marketing/game was VERY interesting and probably will spawn some follow up whether audiences pan this movie or not. And I'd love for that to happen.<br/><br/>I'm just sick of the whiners, whingers and downright ridiculous comments calling this movie stupid from folks who have become used to having gore, violence and idiocy crammed down their throats. We've got to get over our need to see everything in full Technicolor every second. Otherwise we're never going to get a decent film outta Hollywood ever again."
"redline-14","6","4","9","19 January 2008"," Great at the start, dies after the subway
","WARNING: SPOILERS. I'll be honest, when I saw this movie's preview way back in June, I couldn't wait, all I wanted to know is what caused that destruction, and could it do more. I went into the movie hoping it would live up to the trailer I saw(I hadn't looked at it in previews or anything since i first saw the trailer for fear of expecting something it couldn't deliver.) I waited through the party, laughed at the main dude part, a little bit, and then eagerly awaited the head of liberty rolling through the street, feeling bad all the while that I was enjoying the (fictional) destruction of an American icon. It happened, I was happy, then something unexpected happened, I realized that up to this point, the entire beginning of the movie up to the point of the software store was brilliant. I didn't mind the camcorder shaking around and all, I watched the Bourne ultimatum weeks before, shaky cameras don't bother me, what did is that they kind of pulled what Doom the movie did, in relying on a first person for the monster encounter, not a good idea, although it was good for how all the characters reacted to certain moments. It's just after the subway part, the movie seemed to just die. Marlena had been bitten, they made it to the army area, and it just slowed down way too much after that. I also had a problem with the girl that was seemingly impaled on re barb, it looked like it had gone through a part of the chest that it would've pierced the lung, yet her breathing didn't grow more and more burdened, just tired (slight difference to me, tired you can recover from, burdened and your way too far gone to save, at least in the movies) At the end, the movie had fallen so far behind from what could've been that it couldn't save it. The characters and acting where great, the camera angle for that was great, the monster, not so much, the camera failed that too. The very end left much more to be desired and made the movie feel like it had failed epically, the monster was shown enough for me, but the end wasn't satisfying, can't even tell if it died. If they can make a sequel to answer some questions, that'd be great, they left enough loose ends to do so."

It was unique, but would not come anywhere near the top ""best"" of any list in my opinion.<br/><br/>Save your money and wait for the DVD at best."
"LauderdaleKid","10","4","9","18 January 2008"," Cloverfield Lives Up To The Hype!
","First off let me say, if people say they hated this movie, the only reason they could have possibly not liked it is if they went into the theater expecting to see a action packed movie with a simple plot. Getting that off my chest, CLOVERFIELD WAS AWESOME! It started out a little slow, only because it was introducing you to the main characters, and letting you get a feel for them. After that first explosion, the movie takes off! The visual effects are stunning, and despite the ""home video"" perspective, the shots were amazing and perfect! It truly felt as if this really happen. There was just enough action to keep your eyes wide open, and enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. On top of all that, the story was amazing! Besides the obvious documentation of the monster attack, there is a love story surrounded by tragedy, which really brings out a lot of emotion in this film. ***SPOILER*** If you are a fan of watching the heroes/main characters prevail, this might not be your type of movie. Cloverfield truly captures every emotion of the viewer. Horror, love, suspense, action, thriller, and even the comedic moments..it has it all. Go into this movie with an open mind. If your looking for a cheap action movie. Keep your money. If your looking for a movie with an incredible story (unlike any other monster movie) and amazing/believable acting..CLOVERFIELD will live up to your expectations without a doubt.<br/><br/>I SUGGEST EVERYONE SEE'S IT!!"
"John_Henry_Eden_II","9","4","9","18 January 2008"," Non-stop heart pounding suspense.
","Non-stop heart pounding suspense. It was so realistic. Especially if you go into a surround sound theater. Like AMC theaters at Universal Citywalk. The movie is still spinning around in my head like a CD. From start to finish you don't know whats next. This movie is a must see if your into monster movies or horror/suspenseful movies. It's not really scary because you sort of hear things coming in the movie but it is still a very intense-suspenseful movie. Of course it is very hard to figure out where it came from and why is it attacking NYC. Although Hud Platt mentions something about where it might of came from towards the beginning of the movie. Pay attention and you might find out. Out of all the other monster movies I've seen in my life this one would definitely be the best. It might be 1 hour and 34 minutes long, but it is a very intenseful 1 hour 34 minutes. That defiantly gets your attention. I think J.J. Abrams made this movie perfectly. From Special Effects to Sound and Visual Art."
"jordansky","9","4","9","18 January 2008"," Lives up to the hype
","So I just got back from possibly the most hyped movie of 2007, and 2008 thus far, (before Indiana Jones 4!!) and it amazed me. I almost don't know how to explain it. The entire movie was shot using only a hand-held camcorder, high definition, yes, but hand-held consumer quality nonetheless. Some people may criticize this, but I don't see how the story could have been presented any other way. Oh, and the story, nothing I've ever seen before, it felt un- scripted. But was it a bad thing? No. It wasn't like a bad Uwe Boll movie, but the whole feel of it was that this was actually someone taping the events as they unfolded. As far as the story goes...it starts off at a going away party for a friend, the camera man ""Hud"" is given a camera, and told to take confessions of all the friends at the party, and, not to spoil the movie, an explosion erupts from the center of Manhattan. The crowd guns it outside to the streets, only to catch the statue of liberty's head landing right in front of them. OK, if you aren't already hooked, then stop reading. Anyway the entire time I felt as if this was really a tape found by the US Military (as it was pretending to be). Sorry, I'm gonna stop there I got carried away. And because it was made to look as an amateur video, the camera is constantly shaky, and usually out of focus. The funniest part was before the movie when a staff member told the audience of this fact, and actually offered a refund in the next 30 minutes. All I can do now is wait and see how long it takes for a video of someone taping an already video taped movie, to be uploaded to the internet. As a ending note, many people compared this to the Blair Witch Project, which was also filmed entirely with a hand-held camera, to give the more personal and real effect. I don't know if this had anything to do with that movie, but a line near the end read ""I'm so scared."" A line almost the same, and made famous by BWP, ""I'm so scared I could cry"". I didn't."

","What can I say. I thought this movie was great. The movie Jarhead was not about a war or combat, it was about the bond that develops between soldiers. this movie was the same way. It wasn't about the monster and how they fought it. it was about the experience these people went through just trying to survive and the decisions they made along the way. after reading all these negative reviews I'm guessing a lot of people didn't get that. they went into the theater and expected Godzilla or some big movie about how humanity defeated another giant monster. I have to say it was a welcome change from your everyday film. Honestly I don't know how people expected the movie to end. When they said the movie was filmed like a home video, they meant it. I felt like I was right there in the action. This was one of those movies where I focused on nothing but the movie in the theater the entire time. This movie is not for everyone. Don't walk into that theater expecting another Godzilla type movie. U WILL B DISAPPOINTED! U have to appreciate that this movie is about something smaller than that."
"thickcarmelcuti","10","4","9","18 January 2008"," Great movie, but don't forget the hype backlash!
","I absolutely loved the film. It's been a while since I was at a movie where my mouth was truly open in shock, surprise, and excitement. Those of us actually around for the Blair Witch hype may find all of this familiar...but I even submit that the Blair Witch Project had an even more effective marketing campaign, right at the turning point of viral campaigns. Everyone (including me) who saw that movie in advance or the first weekend was blown away! After that, the story gets trickled down, and it becomes less impressive to the next audience and the next audience until it becomes pop culture fodder.<br/><br/>Hopfully the action and special effects aspect of the creature here (what the heck?? Part bat, part tarantula?? The offspring were VICIOUS!) will keep this movie from suffering the same fate as the BWP.<br/><br/>I know I saw some people who were like, Lily was running all night in those heels??? Any city girl worth her salt knows how to do ANYTHING in her heels. ha! That's all I have to say for now...we shall see the results of the hype in a month. At this point, a lot of critics hate it because of the 9/11 connection, but I don't feel they crossed a line. NYC, specifically Manhattan, has been depicted as the perfect setting for disaster movies because it is the city that never sleeps...and what would we do if disaster ever hit? Unfortunately, we found out the hard way...but we can't blame movies for following a proud NYC tradition. We banded together on 9/11 and should Godzilla or Project Cloverfield attack us in real life, we would band together again."

Show less of the most monster and more of kids who can not act running around New York city doing stupid things and getting killed did not make this movie scary just really cheap. This movie is not scary Godzilla is scary. And I am tired of how the first remake is so underrated and this movie is so overrated. Don't get me wrong I love the original Godzilla from 1954. Even thou I like the 1998 remake more I have that movie to thank for it. It is a great movie in it's self. But this movie is carp. It as an awful ending. It is badly acted. Badly written and cheap. A monster movie were led characters are not soldiers or scientists who are going to resolve the conflict in the movie. Instead it is just stupid collage kids who are all going to be killed. Give me a break. So J.J Abrams made it get over it."

I don't think the storyline had much substance and only reason I watched this all the way through was to see how bad this movie could get. I thought half way through the movie something interesting was going to happen but nothing. I felt the acting during most of the scenes was fake. I hate the fact it was shot in 1st person view this was really awful like another Blair witch meets independence day knock off. The actor TJ Miller who played Hud really annoyed me with his dialogue.

And the end...did it end. So glad I got this from the library and didn't pay a cent thus the only thing wasted was time. I did notice there is suppose to be a sequel so maybe that was the whole idea. You know, kind of like a soap where they entice you to come back to see how it turns out. Unfortunately for this sleeper it did not spark my interest enough to bring me back to find out if it really does end. If the writer of this dribble has a day job I suggest he/she keep it."
"hall895","4","3","6","8 April 2011"," So very stupid
","Cloverfield is what The Blair Witch Project would have been had Blair Witch been set in Manhattan and also been completely terrible. This movie is brain-dead, an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Perhaps you are willing to accept the basic premise of a giant, indestructible monster rampaging through Manhattan. OK, fine. But that doesn't excuse everything else in the movie which, by and large, is complete and utter nonsense. Things happen which simply cannot happen. Characters do and say things they absolutely could not or would not do. It's a giant mess of implausibility, absurdity and stupidity. And inanity. Let's not forget the inanity. As well as insulting your intelligence it may well also assault your sense of common decency. Manhattan skyscrapers crumble, people flee in terror from the ensuing debris clouds...gee, now where have I seen that before? In fact, the filmmakers actually brag about having studied 9/11 footage to make sure they got the look just right. Some people really have no shame. And why does it always have to be New York City anyway? You'd think just once one of these giant movie monsters would wash ashore in Boston or Miami or some random small town in Delaware. But then of course we'd be deprived of the sight of the Statue of Liberty's head lying on the ground. Because that's real original.<br/><br/>Absolutely the only positive thing you can say about this movie is that the visual effects are for the most part very well done. The story is stupid. The scary moments are a lot less scary than the filmmakers would have hoped. The main characters are so boring, annoying or moronic (or all three) that you may well be rooting for the monster to chomp them in half. A special mention for the character of Hud, who also serves as the shaky-cam operator documenting events. Stuck as he is behind the camera for most of the movie you hardly ever see him. And yet he still manages to be one of the most annoying characters in movie history. The guy just will not shut up. And he apparently has an IQ of approximately 12. On and on this blabbermouth goes with absolutely nothing useful to say. Certainly nothing funny to say even though the character is apparently meant to serve as comic relief. Just another way in which Cloverfield fails miserably. T.J. Miller is the actor playing Hud and I will be doing my best to avoid anything he appears in going forward. He's beyond terrible, the rest of the cast isn't much better. Probably the only one to come away with any credit at all is Lizzy Caplan who you get the sense is wondering what the heck she is doing here. Her performance gives off the ""I know this is a terrible movie, I'm sorry"" vibe. In fact Caplan has since stated that she signed on for the movie not knowing anything about it and in the future she would not do a film without knowing full well what it is. Smart girl. If you decide to watch this movie knowing full well what it is that's your problem. Personally I'm ashamed that I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this garbage."

Oh I get it, A bunch of people are resorting to their ""OMG The CAMERA IZ The SHAXZERZ IT MAYKEZ ME DIZZY!!!!!!!11!"" bullcrap. Well guess what? NOBODY CARES.<br/><br/>This film was meant to be shaky. You think you can run down a street and hold a camera straight??? If so, you're an idiot. I saw this on opening day and I'll never forget how much tension was going through me. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.<br/><br/>The story is: A group of people are throwing a goodbye party for their friend going away to Japan. On the night of the party, a monster attacks and terrorizes the city, and 5 people must fight to stay alive. The movie was taken from the point of Hud and the video camera, and this film is done in the very interesting style of filming an account of the attack.<br/><br/>This movie was amazing. Fantastic acting, straight and to-the-point action, wastes no time on character development, and has one of the most chilling apocalyptic endings since The Birds. The ending is rather left open, and that's a good thing, because I'd rather that type of ending than an ending where the monster dies and people celebrate like nothing ever happened.<br/><br/>Another thing I like was how there were NO clichés- there is no scene where the scientist steps into the frame and delivers a boring, 5 minute Shakespearian monologue about the origin of the Monster. You don't know where the monster came from... and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>So overall, in the time of cliché'd and stupid movies like Sex And The City, Shutter, Meet The Spartans, and 27 Dresses, we get a very tight and fast paced film that is very No-BS, has your heart racing, your adrenaline pumping, and your blood rushing. Overall, a very profound movie. And please kick yourself in the nuts if you didn't see this in the theater. I saw it in the theater on opening day and loved it. I own it on DVD. That very day I saw it, I was on the edge of my seat and felt like I was on a nonstop roller-coaster."

Had the look of a big budget film, but the acting of a underfunded high school drama class. I wonder, why doesn't the film tell us where the 'monster' came from? Seems like the director had a childhood nightmare that needed to made reality and a nightmare for the rest of the world. What an evening spoiler - don't kill an evening watching this like we did.

","This is the first film I've seen that is made in handy cam style and I thought that it was a very well made movie and didn't have that many shaky camera effects so you can see what is happening. Cloverfield gives you the true real feeling of getting stuck in a city that is being attacked by a giant monster and you have a handy cam. Movies like Godzilla & King Kong shows that where the monster came from and what is it's end but if you are in the city that is being attacked by the monster you won't know anything about it which Cloverfield did by not showing us the beginning and the end of the monster and they did a fantastic job. When the head of the statue of liberty went flying across the street was so awesome and breathtaking.<br/><br/>In the first 20 minutes before New York was being attacked there was just some friends being videotaped in a party which looked very natural then all of a sudden it got into action. The whole film was so lifelike and realistic that it seems you are actually watching a real life video. There were some shots of the monster throughout but there was a clear sharp image of it in the end and it looked like a giant bat. Cloverfield was about 70 minutes which was a good idea because it is made in handy cam style and should be shorter than the normal running length. Overall it was a very thrilling, exciting and entertaining movie and you just don't know what's going to happen next."

As the story unfolds, interest begins to mount, but I found myself already getting antsy by then. Farther along, the few glimpses of the threat are pretty cool and there is attempt to heighten the scary factor throughout by keeping the threat pretty much out of sight, kind of like what Spielberg did in 'Jaws', except this film fails at it. The camera work is jittery and amateurish, as it is intended to be. It is, supposedly, recorded with a hand held camera by, variably, different people in a circle of acquaintances who started out the evening attending a party when all heck broke loose.

","A party given by Jason(Mike Vogel)to his brother, Rob(Michael Stahl-David)whose moving to Japan for a spell is interrupted when a rampaging monster wreaks havoc on New York City leaving absolute devastation in it's wake, while also ""leaving behind"" little creatures to terrorize citizens on foot. Through the use of a camcorder, operated by Rob's best friend Hudson(TJ Miller), we are witness to the monster's attack and how the city appears once it leaves for other areas to destroy. Following the monster's attack on the bridge they're walking, Rob decides to return to find his beloved Beth(Odette Yustman), who sends him a call claiming to have been hurt, with Marlena(Lizzy Caplan), an unfortunate victim attending the party, Lily(Jessica Lucas)a dear friend set up the party, and Hud, taping everything he can.<br/><br/>I think the most effective moments are when we witness the aftermath of the monster's rampage with a city crumbling with buildings and cars destroyed. The monster itself didn't really impress me, to tell you the truth, and perhaps should've been left to the imagination. The little creatures which seemed like off-spring from the monster were pretty creepy, especially when they attack our heroes in a subway tunnel. The bridge attack was a bit effective and the the smoke and terror on the faces of those who just witnessed their city attacked rather works. But, to tell you the truth, Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" was basically made in the same fashion, except for the ""Blair Witch Project"" type of ""real footage found"" governmental set-up. The city is attacked, we witness the carnage and horrified people, and follow certain protagonists as they try to move to a desired location. I agree with others that the camcorder used is top of the line and takes a licking and keeps on ticking. I do digress..I don't think Hud would follow behind Rob, or Marlena, for that matter. Being best friends is one thing, but returning to find someone that's very possibly dead, Hud wouldn't be criticized if he joined those being evacuated...although, I realize we wouldn't have the ""Cloverfield experience"" if that was the case. You can read on this site the numerous factual errors that are looked over in impacting the viewer like Beth's damaged building leaning against another skyscraper or the Statue of Liberty's head. As far as the constant dizzying movement, it didn't bother as much as others, but there were times where I wanted him to hold the damn thing still..I guess we must understand the situation Hud was facing and take it from there."

","The build-up for this release has been immense, from the secretive non-title to the intense trailer released last year; so anyone wanting to go see it was expecting a movie to match the hype.<br/><br/>So does it!? - Sadly No.<br/><br/>The premise is good, using the lead characters Leaving Party to set up characters, relationships and most importantly the use of the camcorder before the chaos begins. The use of some of the camera angles are interesting too, helping to create the confusion of the situation and allowing the viewer snippets of the Monster (a leg here, a tail there) allowing you to try and piece together what is this creature destroying the City.<br/><br/>However this is where the interest wains. <br/><br/>The camera work is too clean (like it's shot in HD), so you do not get the feeling of any realism of the situation, with the character 'Hud' (who after a while starts to sound like Will Ferrell) opting to keep filming rather than dealing with the perillous situations the group are in because he was told to be the 'camera operator' at the beginning of the movie!<br/><br/>The movie tries to create a narrative (& purpose) from within the chaos for the lead characters but unfortunately the characters are wooden, boring and uninspired (with Lily & Beth seemingly interchangeable) so you don't really care what happens to them and simply want them to run into the Monster to see what is happening to the City!<br/><br/>As the movie starts to run out of ideas & places to go, they conclude with a predictable ambiguous conclusion and throw in a few clear shots of the Monster so not to upset anyone who came to see a Monster Movie (although this is poorly executed making it seem as though the Monster has changed size - which the director has tried to defend).<br/><br/>The movie was interesting in idea and attempt but ultimately (partly due to the mass hype) fails to deliver what the audience was hoping for..."
"duckbutcher-1","10","3","6","8 February 2008"," Relentless and disorientating - a fantastic cinema experience.
","Well, I thought it was amazing.<br/><br/>Looking up and down this board, I see that Cloverfield has really split the vote. Most of the comments seem to say that the movie was 'derivative' (of course it was, but that was besides the point. It wasn't about the b-movie monster, it was about how people would genuinely react to the b- movie monster) and 'didn't live up to the hype'. Well, I haven't been following the hype of this movie, in fact the only bit of promotion I saw was the trailer before Transformers, so I went in with virtually no preconceptions. Perhaps one of the problems lies in the ability of hype to whip fanboys into a frenzy to a point that they already have a version of the movie in their heads when they go into a theatre, and are naturally frustrated when the real movie is different to theirs...<br/><br/>But I was utterly blown away.<br/><br/>I've watched so many films in my life, and haven't been scared or bothered in any way by a film since I was 12. I think this is because, as a filmgoing public, we are used to all the set ups, all the knock downs. Every camera angle, music cue, every way a scene plays out. we're utterly fluent in the language of cinema, to such a point that we are never going to be affected by it on anything more than a superficial level. This movie throws that all out of the window - in a good way. No music. No set-ups. No cheap scares. Nothing in this movie tells you you're watching a movie. You're completely disorientated from start to finish, completely uncomfortable and on edge. And that is a hell of an achievement in today's de-sensitised movie environment. While I didn't jump once, like some of the people I was sitting with, I did find myself clutching the chair arms at various points.<br/><br/>And of course it's derivative. EVERY monster movie cliché is in there, and so it should be. The monster destroys landmarks. The military fight the monster. News reports advancing the plot. But it's delivered with such style and such punch that you can't help but be awed. You're seeing these events on an ant's eye level. There are no sweeping special effects shots of the White House being demolished by aliens, no aerial shots of buildings being destroyed - instead we get distant, unidentifiable bangs, fires obscured by the cityscape, an enormous leg moving behind a skyscraper - and a distant object which comes hurtling through the air, finally landing amidst chaos in a street, revealing itself to be the head of the statue of liberty.<br/><br/>This personal touch goes deeper - characters disappear from the story, and we (the audience) don't know their fate because the main characters don't.<br/><br/>The effects, with one or two exceptions (the money shot of the monster at the end springs to mind), are seamlessly integrated. A lifelong ""effects spotter"", I found myself not even noticing when something that MUST have been CGI was on screen (the leaning skyscraper completely passed me by - I only thought 'wow, that wasn't real' later).<br/><br/>And people are going to pick on the film because it doesn't tick all the boxes. You don't know why the monster's here, or what it wants. We don't find out what happened to the girl in the helicopter, or what really happens when one of the little things bites you. The monster could still be out there for all we know. But all of this ambiguity just adds to the realism, the disorientation and the hysteria. You want everything wrapped up in a nice little package? Go and watch one of those awful American J-horror remakes like The Ring, where they took all the ambiguity of the original and ruined the movie by ""explaining everything"". I want a bit of mystery. Remember, this is a very personal ant's eye view of the attack. The guy behind the camera didn't know all that stuff, so why should we? <br/><br/>I hate it when people tell me I didn't 'get' something, be it a movie, book or whatever. I find it intensely patronising, so I won't say the same to the droves of reviewers here who seem to have missed the utter genius at work in this movie. All I will say is let the hype die down and then go back and give it an objective look. You will be impressed."

","I must admit that I went to see Cloverfield not expecting to much. The old American city gets trashed has been done quite a lot over the last few years.However I was happily surprised to find myself quite riveted to the screen as events unfolded. However let me say this, Cloverfield has not one shred of originality in it. The old ""Monster attacks city"" has been done countless times in the old Japaneses Godzilla films, and the hand held camera work is a direct rip off of Blair Witch. Non the less the story was very intense, the effects very good with even the CGI monsters looking very real, and all the young actors turned in solid performances. Cloverfield may not be original in any sense of the word but it is a very well made movie from a familiar style of film.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","Every annoying action/horror film making cliché in the book<br/><br/>Cameras moving too quick to see what's happening - Check Filmed in the dark to prevent a good look at the creatures - Check Endless stupid, irritating screaming - check Camera-work jerky enough to give motion sickness - check Massive hype, underdelivered - check Vacuous, superficial American ""stars"" - check Unsatisying plot with sequel-ready, vague open ending - check 20 minutes of unrelated, wasted lead-in - check Frequently blurry, out of focus shooting - Check Long periods when the camera is pointing at nothing at all - check<br/><br/>People keep pointing to Blair Witch (which I loved), as justification for this stupid hand-held camera look, but that style has had its day, and even then it was done better and was more appropriate.<br/><br/>Are we seriously supposed to believe that in all of New York, the best camera footage available was from some loud mouthed 20 something, and that miraculously, it was even found at all, amidst all of the devastation?<br/><br/>The medium for movies is film, and to make it look like really poor quality film, is as stupid as choosing to listen only to poetry read by someone with a chronic speech impediment. It was a clever novelty once - even arty - but it really infuriates when it prevents you from appreciating what is happening.<br/><br/>It was bad enough that Robert Rodriguez made Planet Terror look like it was filmed in the 50's, but Cloverfield just S.U.C.K.S sucks!<br/><br/>Whilst the film is a REALLY great idea, I just don't feel that it delivered enough answers for all the build up, nor enough decent views of the creatures to satisfy sci fi or monster fans.

","I walked into this movie with an open mind, and left with a headache and nearly minus my lunch.<br/><br/>The first and foremost problem with this film is the camera work. It was a nice and inventive idea to have it told from the first person to give it a bit more intimacy but after about 10 minutes it just became incredibly nauseating. Literally at least half of the people at my screening had to leave at some point during the film for some fresh air or to puke.<br/><br/>I also felt that there was no where near enough screen time of the monster and not enough action. I realise that one of the major points of the film was to focus mainly on the journey of the people involved, and also less glimpses of the monster make it more suspenseful, but when I saw this billed as ""a completely original MONSTER MOVIE"" I was expecting a bit more than just people running and sitting about for most of the film.<br/><br/>On the few plus sides, I feel the actors were good, the characters (Hud in particular) were very likable and the monster did look quite cool and unique. But those factors alone could not change that this was a resounding disappointment for me."

"luke-sherratt","2","3","6","1 February 2008"," Not as good as I thought
","Well basically, the movie was not as good as I thought it would be. You get all hyped up about this movie, and the monster that goes out to destroy the city, when basically, despite it being a movie, most of the plot is stupidly unreal, and in some places, pretty boring and dull.<br/><br/>Firstly, why would anyone in their right mind want to go back into the centre of the city to rescue his loved one when clearly she would be dead - yet when he somehow manages to find her in her apartment located somewhat 30 floors up (climbing up 1 skyscraper then climbing over the roof top onto the next half-collapsed skyscraper into the apartment) and finding her alive with a metal pole of some sort stabbed through her chest, then lifting and moving, then she's still able to run and seem perfectly fine.<br/><br/>The acting of the characters was just terrible and in some ways pathetic. When they are walking along what's meant to be a 40 degree corridor, you can clearly see that it's flat yet they make pathetic attempts to make it look like as if they are really struggling.<br/><br/>There was no character build up throughout the film at all. You do not get to know the characters and don't even give 2 monkeys whether they die or live or not. In some points, you want to urge them to die and hurry up, especially the fat annoying guy who is recording all the ""action"" yet manages not to drop the camera once, while running backwards from some of the monsters offspring that looks like something out of starship troopers.<br/><br/>The people also somehow manage to survive a helicopter crash from dropping out of the sky from above the height of skyscrapers due to the monster being bombed and somehow reaching out and hitting the copper down.<br/><br/>Do not go and see this film even if you £6 to spare. You may as well put it towards good use such as buying some dog food for your dog. The 'jerkyness' and 'wobbleing' of the camera effect also became irritating after about 1 hour."

The build-up was great in making you ""feel"" the ""truth"" in the characters, but the character holding the camcorder was too fidgety to be completely believable (anyone that does a lot of home videos would understand) although I did like the affect. When the $%#@ hit the fan, things got really good with the exclusion of a few redundant, drawn-out parts. This may be the best movie monster in history!! Here's what got me, 71 minutes! The movie was only 71 minutes long and the build-up was a good 20 minutes! Who makes a feature movie barely longer than an episode of CSI? The ending at first really disappointed me, but I took in it's desired result and although it did not appeal to me, it did deliver. I just wish they could have thrown in another 15 minutes of action and/or development."

Unlike other monsters having done the same in Japan, this one comes with residual monsters that drop from him and do more damageBut they are not scary. They make sounds reminiscent of wounded cows that are simply funny. Nothing scary about them and it is simply way too easy to kill them.<br/><br/>The characters are shallow.

","I don't know where to begin with. Alright, when it began, I was completely oblivious to any upcoming scenes, and sat waiting at least a half hour before anything actually occurred. The first couple scenes are extremely long, and the main camera work is produced through a hand held. I was told the movie was suspenseful, and I found out why - you never know when he's going to put the camera down.<br/><br/>The monster attacks, a star for the effects and designs on that part, but the camera work is so shaky, you lose orientation and come to be terribly dizzy. I looked away many times, aside from the fact the camera focuses more rigidly on the surroundings than the monster and scenario itself.<br/><br/>The actors were alright, for say, and the storyline was decent. The ending, though, as well as the beginning, and many parts of the body, were terrible. The ending gave no clue as to what happened to the monster, the town, or the world.<br/><br/>The only way I could see the sequel being any good - if there is one - is if the camera is operated by an actual 'crew' who can focus the thing, and we possibly see the story, or the ending of the story, through another set of eyes, and encounter the past actors in a certain scene. An ending with any spec of information would be reasonably nice too.<br/><br/>Lastly, my most favorable part is that it's a considerably short movie. I sat through the whole thing with many hopes the camera would crash and burn, and we'd get a real view."

Blair Witch was also always in my mind, but it never scared me at all. The characters were not likable and you were left feeling that you wished the monster would hurry up and kill them!

"supramaxx","9","3","6","22 January 2008"," Cloverfield.....awesome monster movie
","This movie has been hyped up for quite a while, I remember seeing the teaser trailer during Transformers and everybody in the crowd questioning the trailer. The trailer depicted this movie as quite mysterious, but still very intriguing. I actually had no idea it was being filmed in a first person perspective (through a hand held camera) throughout the whole movie until I actually saw the movie. To some people it might be a huge turn-off, I actually felt like I was in the movie, as intense as it was, feeling every whim and emotion of the character, there is no third person here, you feel what the character are feeling, you see what the character see, you feel the terror that they feel and surprises at every corner. Basically it is a giant monster attacking New York City type movie (Godzilla and King Kong comes to mind) but much better filmed and one billion times more intense. I related to the character Hud, the most, as he was talking nervously and comically throughout the whole movie, thats just like me in real life, always trying to make light out of a serious situation.<br/><br/>The Good: I haven't felt an emotional rush in the movies since I can remember. You feel like you are one of the characters, going through the same confusion and mass panic that they are enduring. The guy who is filming Hud, is my type of guy, one who always makes light and talks excessively in tight situations. How the movie starts out is very light and I got to know the four main characters very well, at least for my tastes. Some will say there is a huge lack of character development and that detracts from enjoying the movie, I related with the characters very well (maybe because I am a young urban professional) and the trendy party atmosphere is something that I have seen in my own life. The back ""love"" story is also something that is welcomed between the two main characters (some may not like it). When the monster hits, you feel the same sense of confusion and what happened? that the characters do, to some (especially New Yorkers) it evokes images of amateur 9/11 videos. The first person adaptation then takes you through an hour and a half thrill ride throughout New York City as the four main characters try to survive, all while making a daring and romantic attempt at saving a damsel in distress. The sense of destruction, violence, disbelief, and fear is as real as it can get, as normal life gets disrupted by something enormous. The acting is perfect. The setting and images of a New York under devastation is also very well done.<br/><br/>The Bad: I guess this is one of those you either love or hate movies, one of my friends hated it, most others loved it. The shaking camera might be a turn-off for some, I loved it, it added such an intense sense of realism. The Monster itself was CG, but thats OK. Some might think also its tries too hard to be hip and the guy holding the film gets annoying, I liked everything. Also the movie might be too random for some.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Giant Subway Rats, and the Spider Creatures, plus the gruesome death of one of the main characters, and the monster itself was preety ugly resembling a cross of Godzilla, King Kong, and a giant Scorpion, Fly creature.<br/><br/>Overall, a breath of fresh air for film making, maybe they will make more of these type of movies, I think it only really works well in intense horror or monster movies probably. I also like the romanticized saving damsel in distress story line from the protagonist. But the strongest quality of this film is the sense of fear and panic the viewer gets, its like you are in the movie suffering and questioning with the characters. No other film has made me feel that way.<br/><br/>Supra Score - 8.5/10"
"musicmanjusino","9","3","6","22 January 2008"," J.J Abrams is a genius!
","Cloverfield was amazing. J.J Abrams is brilliant in the way he makes this movie seem as if it really happened. I love how he also used some ""beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" references. (for example, the little spider thingys that fall off the monster and the sickness it spreads. and also it came from the sea.) unfortunately, there are many viewers that don't appreciate this film and for the wrong reasons. of course everyone is entitled to their own opinion especially when it comes to films, i have heard a lot of comments in theaters from people and from some friends that are not good reasons to bash on this movie. for instance, ""The camera was shaky and really bad camera angles and it was so unprofessional."" ...duh...thats the point. this film was supposed to look as if it was being shot by a victim of this disaster. ""But there was no story!"" grab a video that you or a family member has shot at a family reunion or trip, there is no plot or stories to these right? remember the videos from hurricane Katrina or 9/11 or the tsunami, is there a plot to these videos and stories? in some ways yes, but they are no movies, they are videos in order for us to remember those horrific events and to capture images that no one else can see. J.J Abrams was nice enough to add some personality to these characters and add a bit of a story to it (in order for us to be more connected to this film of course.) the plot of this film is pretty much, get the heck out of New York City. and it very realistic. <br/><br/>all in all, J.J Abrams succeeded in reviving the monster movie genre. this film had me whipping out my ticket after i left just to make sure that it wasn't real and that I survived this film. It was a feeling i haven't had in years. you know, that feeling when you were a kid after you watched a monster movie you would always look over your shoulder and couldn't sleep? yes, that feeling. Id never thought id feel that again."

I also liked the fact that it was only about 90 min. because there wasn't as much filler that would slow down the pace.<br/><br/>The only things I didn't like were the jerky motion of the camera (which got a little old after a while but if you know the premise you should be expecting that regardless) & slightly too much time at the party before things really get started. <br/><br/>Overall I thought it was a damn good monster movie & would definitely recommend it to others."

If I'm paying to see a film, I want to know what it's about. Don't give me a teaser that creates an over-abundance of questions in my head. If it's a Godzilla movie, say so; if it's ET gone wild, tell me.<br/><br/>That being said, there were several things I disliked about the film, namely the plot. What was the point? Presumably, we are seeing footage recovered from a camcorder after it's all happened. Also, it's presented as U.S. Government DOD material... but that's all that's presented. All you get is the footage from the camcorder, then there isn't any ending, no explanation, nothing. If you've seen the trailers, then you already know all you're going to know... it's just stretched out and filled in with some cool cgi and other bits of eye candy. After seeing the film, I still couldn't tell you what it was really about.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad, but there's nothing special there either.<br/><br/>If you can get past the jerky ""handycam"" camera work, the special effects are very good... no disappointment there.<br/><br/>In the end, you're left hanging with way too many questions unanswered. If you're like me, you'll probably leave the theater with the burning desire to go punch the writers/director/producers/etc. in the face and ask for your money back.<br/><br/>When the closing credits appeared, there were more than a few ""what the ****?"" comments muttered."

Every movie now a days, has that stupid shaky camera work and they just can't keep it steady, if there had been some steady camera work, I would have enjoyed it so much more than I did. I got the fact that the producers wanted you to feel as confused as the characters, but dear god, they did a horrible job at it. If they would have shown the monster a little bit more, or even AT ALL, and cleaned up the dumb dialog, then I would have responded a lot better than this.<br/><br/>The only reason that I am giving this a 4 is because I really like the idea that they wanted to film this in a different perspective but they just didn't do a good job or succeed at doing it. Bad job producers, the camera work totally ruined the awesome potential that this movie could have had if you guys would have used multiple cameras and given us the multiple perspectives that we NEED to enjoy a film and not had the camera mainly focused on the ground when running, moving in a thousand different directions, zooming in and out and focusing unnecessarily, then I would have really liked this movie.

The overall effect is to induce nausea, eye strain, headache and upset stomach. Small wonder the theater was at least 97% empty on a Sunday afternoon. ""War of The Worlds"" had a much larger audience during the 2nd weekend. The word must be out that this film is to be avoided unless you want to waste your money and up chuck your popcorn! When it is available on DVD I'll rent (NOT buy) it because I can use the pause button. Whoever decided to use this filming technique should be slapped upside the head!"

This is a warning to all the others that might get sucked in by all the other high ratings. Don't waste your time or heaven forbid you paid to see this.

It was so bad that a warning was posted all over the place at the movie theater I attended. The sign read: "" Warning! This film will can cause motion sickness similar to that of a roller coaster ride!"" I have to admit, I thought at first the theater must be kidding, but when I ended-up getting Sea Sick, the warning was a gross under statement!<br/><br/>The acting was so bad that you end-up caring absolutely nothing for anyone in this pathetic film!

How dull and unimaginative can you get? <br/><br/>I guess the worst part was how much the destruction was made to remind anyone without amnesia how horrible the 9/11 disaster was! What a filmmaker will do to make a buck! Members of my own family missed being killed or injured by the skin-of-there-teeth, or from dumb luck! Do I, and tens of thousands of other movie goers, who were directly affected by 9/11 need to be reminded of this real life horror when we go out to be entertained?

","I watched ""Cloverfield"" few days ago and I have mixed emotions. Good is only the shoots taken with camera. The whole set of attacked New York is very good and actually the whole movie starts good by filming a goodbye party for Rob Hawkins, who got job in Japan. Suddenly all the party guests are terrified by something that at first looks like earthquake. But it's not. It is big monster that attacked NY. The atmosphere reminded me of the crashing of Twins and it's director dedication to that sad day. But hey people, they survived a crash of a helicopter!!! Big monster is killing everyone but our main characters are filming it (I would see them in that situation; they would run for their lives)!!! Gigantic monster managed to sneak upon our cameraman!!! That camera is made of some unbreakable material!!! We don't know nothing about this monster!!! Monster looks idiotic!!! But I'll wait for ""Cloverfield 2"" to get my questions answered. Can't you see that this movie is money making piece of nothing special. Where is the movie art in this so called spectacular film? The only thing that is spectacular in here is camera. Where can I buy one 'shock resist' camera?"

But that seems to be the only redeeming quality of this film school experiment (gone bad).<br/><br/>In short, the film sucks. It really did seem like we were watching an uninspired film school project. And, it would not get a passing grade. No plot, storyline, or character development -- oh, and no ending or resolution. <br/><br/>And even more important -- No MONSTER. When I go to a monster flick I expect to see..a MONSTER. Not suggested with low budget CGI effects, but very clearly realized on the screen -- A MOVIE MONSTER. <br/><br/>Instead we get a gimmicky camera effect that has been used many times before (and done better) and guaranteed to make you hurl your popcorn (if you're into that), along with every cinematic cliché since GODZILLA was first realized to BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and the 911 TAPES.<br/><br/>The awards should really go to the marketing team.

"erikgloor","1","4","10","25 January 2008"," Nauseating for all the wrong reasons
","The little puddle of vomit in the hallway leading from the auditorium back out into the cineplex when the credits rolled about said it all for 'Cloverfield,' the latest effects-driven thriller from Bad Robot and Paramount.<br/><br/>I remember it well: It was 1985 and my high school chum and I were talking about the latest Pepsi ads which featured the very first ""shaky-cam"" shots meant to imbue scenes with authenticity. As if anyone with sense enough to bring a tripod for their video camera was almost certainly setting you up. We knew even then that this was the worst kind of artifice and we both concluded that anyone who had tripods available but didn't use them for said purpose was DEFINITELY setting you up.<br/><br/>And setting us up huge was what the makers of 'Cloverfield,' have done with this picture about a giant monster that decides to take a bite out of the Big Apple and totally ruin the evening for a bunch of no-name 20-something hockey-pucks. Shot entirely point-of-view with the world's sturdiest pretend home-movie camera, we watch said hockey-pucks variously fleeing said monster or questing for the rescue of some hottie impaled on rebarb somewhere.<br/><br/>I think I would have suggested lending the film a little authenticity by hiring some F-ing AC-TORS!<br/><br/>Along the way, and with admittedly eerie and downright compelling realism, we are treated to a 21st century version of Godzilla with really nice images of army guys blasting away at the creature and dropping ordnance on it from Stealth bombers. Fun stuff and definitely a recipe for a good time at the movies. Technically, the film misses not a single note.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, rather like the technically savvy but depth-free characters in this film, the story-tellers got lost on their way to a decent theme and decided to substitute the always asinine, ""Dude, what if this were real,"" approach. See if it's kinda real, then you don't really need a theme, dude. No, for real! Otherwise these filmmakers would have to face the fact that the default theme for this picture is as follows: ""My girlfriend is so totally hot, I would totally fight a giant iguana to sleep with her again."" And naturally, as if this were ""Survivor New York,"" each character dies, one by one, in hideous fashion, in order of significance, as if voted off by the audience after each scene. Once again, only the extremely cute and cuddly survive.<br/><br/>Good monster movies are good because the monster becomes a metaphor for something. Screen writing 101, guys. Come on.<br/><br/>And lastly but not leastly, all of the above criticism will only matter to you if you somehow survive the colossally stupid and ceaseless jiggle-cam cinematography. See, someone forgot to tell the pea-brains who made this film that even though the jiggling didn't bother THEM watching it on a 19-inch video monitor in some editing suite somewhere where idiots edit movies, when the film is done, it is packed off to be shown in these places called ""theatres."" At these ""theatres,"" a person's entire field of vision will be filled with your stupid footage and when the camera doesn't stay still for a single instant, it can make the average audience-member a little NAUSEATED.<br/><br/>So thank you, Matt Reeves, director of 'Cloverfield,' for making a movie so bad it made one of your audience members puke. I've got you to thank for the dizzying headache I suffer still, nearly 24 hours after watching it. Thank you SO much.<br/><br/>Go back to directing episodes of Felicity."

","I absolutely loved this film. I entered this movie expecting something great and came out feeling like my expectations have been met. Like a couple have mentioned, there are some down sides. Random product placement is used in the film, but it doesn't really distract from anything, and the filming... I love the fact that it gives the feel of being filmed through a handi-cam... but at some points in the film you kind of get sick of looking at peoples feet, but it helps create the emotion and atmosphere that the film needs. I was also shocked to find that you get some pretty decent shots of the monster... i was expecting to only catch a leg... a tail, never the whole thing.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was downright stunning. It's original and actually stood up to the hype that was behind the movie.

"AliviaZombie","9","4","10","18 January 2008"," Well worth the wait.
","""Cloverfield"" is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw it tonight with a friend of mine not expecting anything too grand, but it really impressed me. This movie has an amazing sense of realism that leads its viewer to believe that the events within have actually occurred, and makes the seemingly far-fetched plot seem tangible. The aesthetics are simply amazing. I'm really into disaster films, and out of all the ones released in recent years, Cloverfield takes the cake. The special effects are unreal, and it makes you feel as if you are really wandering around a New York in crisis. My friend and I commented on the fact it gives a true insight to the terror of 9-11 and will definitely hit home for the people who lived through that disaster.<br/><br/>I have read many comments about the style in which the movie was filmed. I believe that the use of a camcorder really gave the movie an authentic touch, making the attack believable. For some, there are moments when the camera is shaky, but it's all apart of the effect. The use of small time actors was definitely a great choice for this movie. This allowed viewers to sympathize with the characters and form a connection to them which is not possible with the big buck actors. Lizzy Caplan's performance in particular was impressive.<br/><br/>I don't know how they got away with a PG-13 rating in the USA, here in Australia, only people over 15 are allowed in unless accompanied by an adult. The movie is truly terrifying and will keep you anxiously gripping the edge of your seat for an hour. Kudos to the director for portraying a plot line that was realistic, believable, entertaining, humorous, terrifying and aesthetically stunning all at the same time. You're missing out if you don't see it.<br/><br/>Cloverfield cannot be compared to films like The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla simply because there is no comparison - it sits on them all. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys being scared silly."

","So let's get one thing straight, a movie with a hand held camera theme is going to make you nauseous, it's a given. So get over it people.<br/><br/>Okay on to my comment. The movie is, as I see it, a masterpiece. Sure I'll give it to most, the ending wasn't the best but I'm not going to spoil it for you guys and gals out there that have yet to see this monster of a movie. This movie not only delivered the scares, but it delivers in nearly every other emotion as well. The comedic relief was genius, the sad moments were tear jerking, the action-y moments where suspenseful unlike any other movie I've seen in a long long time. I just wish it was longer, with a run time barely under an hour and a half, it had me sitting in my seat wanting more every second that passed. The monster was absolutely brilliant and the acting in the movie is some of the best I've seen in a long time especially from a cast of really young actors.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a wonderful experience and I hope Hollywood comes out with more like this. Maybe not so much hand-held cam but maybe a little more interesting and fun like ""Cloverfield"". I'm sure anyone who watches this will agree and say it is one of the best monster movies ever made, quite possibly the best."

","For fans of the genre, Cloverfield refines a not much ventured upon perspective in film making with a YouTube first-person style approach. Allowing the audience to almost experience a catastrophic and unexplainable event. It combines eyewitness documentary with sci-fi monster suspense without failing to deliver although brief, a deeper meaning of love, loss, friendship, and survival. The film gives the audience a realistic but fictional account of how the human psyche would react to the stresses of an extraordinary event while giving the viewers only as much information as acquired by the characters themselves. All this with the contemporary backdrop and the, ""Hey I was invited to the party too?"" immersion make Cloverfield a must see in its own right. *encore* <br/><br/><ul><li>""Man created God in his own image.""

","The way the movie was filmed really is what makes this so well done, you get the feeling that this actually happened, if you let yourself. The scenes of NYC being attacked were very well done, it looks very realistic especially when it is being shown to you through the hand-held camera. The sounds are all amazing, from the explosions to the sounds that you have no idea what they are they all add to the experience. This film really makes you figure stuff out for yourself, it doesn't really give you a direct, concrete answer but, leaves things up to you to decide. This movie is unlike anything I've ever seen and probably will ever see for a while. This movie seems to be one you either love or hate, personally I loved every single minute and will see it again at least 3 or 4 more times in theater and be sure to get it the day it is released.

This story revolves around five friends who document the night of NYC's destruction by an extraordinary being. The crew must work together in all means of survival.<br/><br/>This movie can get quite unrealistic and scary at times, but this one definitely keeps you on your toes. The shaky camera work can make you feel queezy (as it did me at around 50 minutes), but it's nothing too bad.

(Except the first 5mins of camera shake can be painful)<br/><br/>I had high hopes for Cloverfield and was worried it wouldn't live up to all the hype, but i'm glad to say that it does....for me at least!<br/><br/>It wasn't your usual ""America saves the day"" cheesy monster flick we've come to expect. Yes it's obviously set in New York, but that's not really important. You get so immersed into the film that you feel like you're there amongst it and the only things you're worried about are the people you're with and your own safety. You really don't care so much what the thing looks like or where it came from... all you know is it's not friendly and you need to get out...alive.<br/><br/>Usually I find things to complain about in these types of movies, like bad special effects, poor acting, unbelievably convenient circumstances, disappointing endings and cheesy lines or sub plots etc (eg: Transformers ""Are you the Tooth Fairy?""..urgh) <br/><br/>I could not find anything to complain about in Cloverfied. The effects were seamless, the acting realistic, the hinted love sub-plots and hair-raising situations are believable, the ending well done and there was no cheesiness or in-your-face American patriotism. <br/><br/>This movie is more intense than scary. There are a few scary moments and visually disturbing scenes though. Once the action begins, you are on the edge of your seat until the end. <br/><br/>I fully recommend it.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>I've read some comments where people are complaining that the camera battery lasts for too long. At first I also questioned it, but then realised the period of time was a little deceiving...<br/><br/>The movie plays in real-time, so the camera wasn't actually on for as long as it seemed, it was only on for about an 90mins all up, which was the length of the movie. It was switched off for long periods in between the action."
"chimera-4","9","4","10","17 January 2008"," Cutting Edge Cinema
","Cloverfield is a mish mash of several ideas, none completely original but everything seems to gel together nicely giving the viewer what feels like a fresh experience.<br/><br/>What we have here is the good old classic monster movie of old, you know, big man in monster suit (though the monster FX are awesome)up from the depths (although it could have been outer space, we never do find out for sure) because of some nuclear tests gone west. Monster proceeds to chew it's way through (insert major city here although this time round it happens to be Manhattan, big enough to give the creature ample stomping ground but small enough that if they have to nuke it there's plenty more America left to go around) and laughs off all manner of firepower in the meantime leaving the viewer wondering how the hell humankind's going to get out of this one (in other words which of the standard monster movie/invasion endings are going to save our butts, you know, micro-germs, superior firepower, monster gets bored and goes home etc). We've all seen this movie in one of a thousand iterations before.<br/><br/>What makes Cloverfield unique though is the perspective through which we see the events unfold. The whole thing is presented as thought it were a leaked (although they couldn't really hush up events of this scale)clump of handycam footage taken by a small group of people affected by these happenings. There's no credits till the end, instead at the beginning we get a Department of Defence watermark along with some official blurb stating what this ""found"" footage is. The movie then is this ""raw"" footage in it's entirety from the testimonials at a surprise party through the events of the evening to it's conclusion (?!?!) which may or may not be the end of the story. Now because of this, there are bits which feel a bit disjointed. I mean we get everything throughout the evening of the main characters and these things sometimes cross over with the whole monster stomping scenario but there are times you want to see more of what's going on but instead our limited viewpoint denies us these things. This isn't as big a problem as it was with Speilbergs War of the Worlds though. Here you get to see lots of things you wanted to see in that movie but didn't. Massive military might up against this thing, I mean up close and personal (which you did see in WotW but it wasn't as satisfying as it is here)as well lots of convenient and circumstantial encounters with the creature which give you either some ""Did I just see that"" moments or some real in your face OMG moments.<br/><br/>The parts without the main plot (monster) are still interesting enough though that most of the time you don't mind not seeing what's going on elsewhere though and the film does a good job in the first 10 minutes portraying normal people in a real world situation that when stuff starts going down you think ""oh yeah, the monster stuff"".<br/><br/>It's also testament that when the main event isn't on screen the story still continues off screen thanks to excellent sound design. One scene where our troupe are down in an underground station talking and stuff, you can still here stuff happening above. Explosions, gunfire, creatures roaring etc. You really feel like you're in the midst of this thing. Some of the jerky handycam footage might make some people a bit sick if you're sitting close to the screen but all up it really helped add to the ""in your face and personal"" nature of the format.<br/><br/>The look of the creature has been a closely guarded secret which was either because they wanted it be a total surprise or because it looked really pants. Well I'm happy to report that all monsters/creatures and things appearing in this movie looked really cool if a little bit derivative. You rarely see the big picture but you do see up close and detailed bits of the little picture. You're frantically trying to build a picture in your head of what the thing looks like, it's like trying to mentally piece together a jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>My only gripe (and it's pretty small) is that due to the way the action is framed around the smaller more personal story of our small group of friends there's little room for exposition and when it does come it's a bit obvious and set up but I really don't know any other way they could have done it. Also there's little real plot or character development but since the movie takes place mostly over the course of one night and again due to the way it's presented I didn't really find it that much of a problem.<br/><br/>J.J.Abrams and team did an admirable job giving the retro Monster Movie a solid reboot here. Some people might find the abrupt ending (which is realistic in light of how it's presented) a turn off but personally I think it's a good opportunity to load up the DVD with extras to fill in some of the blanks (like the Blair Witch Project did)...<br/><br/>There's some real iconic moments in Cloverfield and while this movie is being hyped up to the high heavens so can't possibly live up to all it's expectations, there's definitely a top flight experience offered here that most will surely enjoy."

Not only did I not enjoy it, but neither did anyone else in the whole theatre as at the end everyone began throwing their trash at the screen. I've seen basically every movie ever shown at the Thursday midnight showing at Universal Studios and needless to say unlike the crowd you saw it with who were clammering for a sequel, rest assured the rest of the world was not. The creature resembled something out of Gears of War or something some Full Sail movie production student whipped together an hour before a project is due as is normal there. A movie like this depends on you liking the characters as well, which no one in our theatres seemed to do, as the camera man was more like a whiney little kid and annoyed us from the first time he opened his mouth. All in all the character development was awful. The only other explanation I can see for your stellar review and praise of this film is you were part of the film and therefore are trying to dupe more viewers into paying their hard earning money thinking that its a great movie based on your review.

Through tragedy we see Rob's future sister in law loses the survivor instincts she had in the beginning, and decides to help Rob, who's also overcome with grief and regret, find Beth.<br/><br/>The cameraman is there because he has to support his best bud.<br/><br/>The special effects were incredible, you feel like you're on the front lines of this spic battle.<br/><br/>The script bounces from digression to situational, which is realistic for a group of friends scared, tired, and overcome with grief.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is very much Godzilla in its nature. But where Godzilla follows scientists trying to find answers, and being scripted to know everything about the creature, Cloverfield takes the approach of the collateral damage of a supernatural event; it follows characters who have no idea what the hell is going on, and don't want to know. They just want to find their friend and get the hell out of NYC."

The acting was so terrible! Please Hollywood-do not ever put any of these people in a movie because if you do, it is guaranteed to suck! If there is a rating lower than a 1, then that would fit this so called movie! The screaming and moaning for horror scenes sounded like sex scenes. OMG was the only phrase the writers wrote!

Confused on what is happening, and what is supposed to happen. I still don't know what was the message or purpose of this movie...i didn't think it had any. It is a waste! The topic was absolutely unclear for the first part of the movie, which got boring after a while and had to fast forward, and then the second half was just annoying. Left angry and clueless, and doubtful. Whatever that monster attack in New York, the ground shakes, and all they do for the rest of the movie...

","Only once in a rare while are we treated to a movie so innovative and unique. It's sad to think that there will only be so many film-going experiences like Cloverfield in my life while the void is filled with more generic fare. In terms of story it is very similar to the awful 1998 clunker Godzilla, but is a world apart when it comes to execution.<br/><br/>Everyone by now knows the premise of the filming of a loft party being interrupted by the arrival of a giant monster in Manhattan, so I won't go into loads of description over that. I'm a firm believer in the fact that the camera is the eyes of the person watching the film and with Cloverfield (like The Blair Witch Project before it) we are put right into the central character's shoes as he stumbles around the darkest corners of the city with his ever diminishing group of friends.<br/><br/>It's been repeated a million times, but I too believe that what we DON'T see is scarier than what we do. Once you bring the monster out of the shadows all the mystery and fear evaporates. For the majority of the movie we never really get to see all of the monster, perhaps a tentacle here or a foot there, but not much of the whole thing. We do get to see a lot of the ugly parasites that cling to its body however.<br/><br/>There are some brilliant and eternally memorable scenes in Cloverfield, the best being hard to nail down but I loved the idea of entering a crooked skyscraper via the deserted tower that it's leaning against. What a truly unique set-piece.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is going to have it's critics and there will be plenty who are not satisfied with the ending. JJ Abrams has said that he plans to do a single sequel from another point of view, but I feel this will ruin the magic.<br/><br/>In fact, JJ Abrams' marketing campaign and back-story has already tarnished the film for me a little bit. He has stated that the monster comes from the sea but I prefer to not know for certain where it comes from. I imagined it coming from outer space myself as the idea of a random creature arriving from the infinite darkness of space to far more terrifying than a monster from the limited environment of our own oceans. And the viral marketing is way out of hand. Let me put set it all straight.<br/><br/>Rob Hawkins has been made vice president of a company in Japan. That company is the Slusho soft drink firm. Marlena is seen drinking plenty of Slusho at the beginning of the film. The parasites on the creature apparently eat the secret ingredient of Slusho deep in the ocean. They smelled this on her, which explains why she is the only one of the group who is bitten. The near-unnoticeable 'splash' in the water at the end of the film is part of a satellite which has fallen out of space and apparently wakes up the monster somehow.<br/><br/>What a load of garbage! Is Rob Hawkins the centre of the universe or something? Why is all this contrived crap revolving around him? Why they came up with this drivel instead of leaving it all unexplained is beyond me. Nevertheless, I will still be looking forward to the sequel next year."

I heard many complaints about the motion sickness and just the movie in general. Cloverfield was also incredibly predictable. I mean, come on, you go on the Brooklyn bridge and its obviously going to either blow up or break. It was a surprisingly short movie and i was very glad. Practically the entire movie was Rob's going away party, only near the end did it get mildly interesting but even then i couldn't enjoy it due to the bouncing of the camera.<br/><br/>All in all, i almost wish i didn't stay till the end so i could have gotten my money back."

","This movie was a f**ked up Godzilla film.<br/><br/>Every cool scene is basically missed because of the idiotic first person shaky footage. You really never see the monster tearing up the city because the darkness masks what's going on and the camera is rarely watching the monster.<br/><br/>You never learn where the monster came from or what becomes of it. The movie has only good video quality at the beginning before anything happens during the boring part. Much of the movie is the cameraman saying the same thing over and over like ""Rob...rob...rob.."" it is extremely annoying.<br/><br/>The point of the film like this is to see destruction and killing in my opinion, but what is shown is just a glimpse and can barely be seen. If they had at least thrown in the occasional third person of the monster fighting the military or one of the characters being killed it might have been worth it. And the CGI was useless since there were no clear shots of anything.<br/><br/>What a cheap piece of sh*t. Go rent ""The BLOB"" it's better than this."

","This Godzilla/9-11 knock-off was one of the most unoriginal movies I have ever seen. In addition to numerous references to Japan, there are crumbling buildings in Lower Manhattan, and the face of the Statue of Liberty which conveniently falls right in front of the camera. This combined with unsuccessful attempts at humor and the incessant shaking of the camera makes this movie the WORST movie I have ever seen. The comic relief was forced. The hand-held camera that is supposed to make the movie seem more real, instead serves to make the audience nauseous and incredibly annoyed. After multiple collisions, the camera still will NOT STOP FILMING. Even the sounds in the movie were extremely irritating. At one point, my ears were filled with the screams of what sounded like an incredibly angry Donald Duck. After one hour and forty five minutes of being so annoyed and bored that I could have pulled my hair out, the end of the movie was a huge relief. The only reason I stayed through the movie was for the sake of the others with me."

Also, this movie is extremely dull and you might find yourself wanting to pull your hair from your head.

","Hollywood has spent the last 20 years mining the pop culture of the baby boom generation. We boomers grew up watching ""Flash Gordon"" serials on TV, and so George Lucas gave us ""Star Wars""  providing my aging generation with a chance to re-visit the collective innocence of our youth, while providing younger viewers with an opportunity to discover theirs.<br/><br/>But Hollywood seems to have decided that what film-goers want is a darker experience, even as they continue to sift through the childhood memories of fifty-somethings like myself. My memories of the Batman comic books of the 1950s and 60s bear little resemblance to the trip down psychosis-lane that the upcoming ""Dark Knight"" promises to be. And now monster movies are the latest film genre to fall victim to Hollywood's need to screw around with things that are better left alone.<br/><br/>Demonstrating yet again that there's nothing new under the sun, (or if there is, the suits in Hollywood won't invest in it), Cloverfield is the red-headed stepchild of the monster movies that we boomers used to watch at Saturday Matinees. Its antecedents include everything from ""Them"", to the ""Godzilla"" franchise. But what's interesting is not what ""Cloverfield"" has in common with these films  it's how it differs.<br/><br/>Monster movies are, at their core, films about crisis management. Traditionally, they begin with a revelation that the normal balance of nature has been upset. The monster is the antagonist of these films, representing mother nature aroused by something that we pesky humans have been doing, whether its exploding nuclear weapons (as in ""Them"", ""Godzilla"" and a host of others), or messing around with DNA, (as in ""Jurassic Park""). <br/><br/>The fundamental purpose of a monster movie is to reassure the audience that no matter how bad things get, Science, God and the US Military will prevail. The protagonists were often scientists (as in ""Them"") and all the characters (except for the villains) were fundamentally good people. They were willing to sacrifice everything  even themselves  in order to set the balance of nature right again, either by destroying the monster, (as in the first Godzilla movie) or by learning to live with it (see the rest of the Godzilla franchise).<br/><br/>Much has been made of Cloverfield's use of hand-held cameras, (what Roger Ebert calls ""Queasy-Cam"") and its refusal to observe ""film grammar"". I think it was Richard Roeper who observed, ""Never has so much money been spent on making a movie look like crap."" But in the end, these are just stylistic devices that were done more effectively in The Blair Witch Project. <br/><br/>The thing that really sets Cloverfield apart from other giant monster movies is not the way it looks - but the fact that its plot breaks virtually every one of the rules of the monster movie genre.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD!****<br/><br/>Cloverfield is, at its core, a pretty nihilistic exercise. It's not about managing crises so much as it is about being overwhelmed by them. It begins with a group of young people who are celebrating the fact that one of them is leaving (how self-absorbed is that?). When the monster attacks, nobody in the movie has any idea what it is, where it came from, or why it's here. When the film's hero (Michael Stahl-David) discovers that a girl whom he slept with the night before is trapped in the wreckage of her apartment building, his friends try to discourage him from rescuing her (so much for self-sacrifice). In the end, he frees her, but the two of them die anyway, along with everybody else, (including, apparently, but not necessarily, the monster).<br/><br/>The message at the heart of traditional monster movies is ""Humanity can survive anything, even giant lizards."", But the message of Cloverfield seems to be, ""Life is pointless, and at the end we are all going to die anyway, so why bother?"" Somebody should tell director Matt Reeves that if he wants to make a film about Nihilism, he doesn't need to spend $300 Million. ""Fight Club"" was a much better movie, and it was shot for under a third of Cloverfield's estimated budget.<br/><br/>And while we're on the subject of old monster movies, has anybody watched ""Them"" lately? Now there's a monster movie that's begging to be re-made. The script and dialog are so great that not even incredibly cheesy special effects could spoil them (""Make me a sergeant and charge the booze!"" is one of my favorite lines from a movie). But please keep it away from directors like Matt Reeves, or the ants will win and in the end, the scientists will be performing horrible experiments on the little girl. <br/><br/>Personally, I am looking forward to a sequel. What do you think we'll get first, ""Cloverfield  the Musical""? Or maybe ""Cloverfield on Ice""?"

Cloverfield sucks you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat from the second people start getting stomped on, in part because of the amazing incorporation of a first-person experience into the movie to add to the immersion factor. In fact, I think Cloverfield is the first piece of media to really rivet and frighten me in the way that it did other than video games such as Half Life and FEAR. My only gripes with the movie, of course, are with its lack of character development and over reliance on visuals over substance. But that's to be expected from a movie that's basically a homage to the Godzilla series.<br/><br/>Kudos to Bad Robot and everyone else involved in the filming of this movie.

It looks to conglomerated to visualize a creature toxified by the mans wastes. But some people believed that this creature was a result of cruel waste dumping and hid until it was time to surface. Others say it was something leaping in the DNA pool too fast or other...etc etc. But besides theories of what it is or was,the creature had no compassion or remorse of its own actions,seeing as it was nearly 300 feet tall with smaller drones to clean up the mess for its walk in the park. I have to say that this film was enjoyable,using blended arts of remote cameras with special effects not seen before and also not using once any type of music or music background to give impact for each scene. To keep the realism dancing in our brains no music was used. Whoever heard of a camera recording or hand-held harnessing music?.

I'm not following anyone to save their lover if it mean I will be putting my life in danger. Especially with a giant creature I have never seen before. It's not like fighting a dog or even an alligator. The city is being demolished by a creature that can knock the Statue Of Liberty head off!!!!!! 3.) The character holding the camera is absolutely stupid and finds time for humor in this situation even though everyone else seems to take the eminent danger seriously.

","I have never walked out of a movie in my entire life. I didn't even walk out of Battlefield Earth... that's not to say I liked it mind you, I just didn't walk. But all of that changed tonight. About an hour ago my wife and I got home from attempting to watch Cloverfield. A failed attempt.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of hand-held camera work in movies, but this was over the top. 90 minutes of constant, nauseating camera work, urgh! We didn't make it through even 30 of those minutes. After 2 minutes, I was annoyed with the shaky camera, after 5 minutes I was really getting anxious for them to start using a real camera and film the movie properly, after 10 minutes I was starting to wonder if the whole movie was going to be like this and seriously regretting having come to see it, after 15 minutes I had to close my eyes and listen to the movie only, after 20 minutes my wife leaned over and said she was starting to feel sick, so after 25 minutes we both walked out.<br/><br/>The manager was all to happy to give us free passes for a future movie. He asked me if there was a problem with the movie, and the instant I said we were watching Cloverfield he said ""Oh, too much shaking right?"". Obviously we were not the first to leave. He then went on to say that they had many walk-outs so far because of the shaky camera in the movie and that the janitors had been called to clean up vomit a number of times. Yes, that's right, a movie that actually made people throw up at their very seats not because of the scenery, but because of the filming. It really is that bad. I was walking a little slower than normal, waiting for my stomach to settle after enduring less than half an hour of Cloverfield. As for my wife, the instant we reached home she went straight to the toilet expecting to hurl. She managed to keep it in, but went to bed immediately after to try and sleep off the nausea. The forums here at IMDb are loaded with people who have had similar experiences.<br/><br/>I now rate this movie 1/10. And I really hate to do that. I was excited about it, I really wanted to see this movie and I wanted to like it. Maybe I shouldn't have deliberately avoided reading up on Cloverfield, I might have known that it was going to be filmed like that. But you see I like surprises... most of the time anyway. It seems like a movie that I would've really enjoyed, but unfortunately it turned out to be unwatchable. I would watch any other movie before this one, no matter how bad it was. It just doesn't matter how good a movie is when watching it makes people feel like puking. If I was the only person who felt that way, then I wouldn't blame the movie, but I'm not. Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to recommend this movie to anyone, even those who are not susceptible to motion sickness have had major problems with Cloverfield. My suggestion is this. Take a digital camera and switch it to movie mode. Then turn it on and play catch with it for an hour or two while it films. Connect it to your television and watch it while sitting 3 feet from the screen. If that doesn't bother you, then go ahead and buy tickets for Cloverfield, it was filmed in pretty much the same way."
"Kevin_and_Mario","8","3","7","22 January 2008"," You'll either hate it or love it.
","*** Alright, I usually don't do this when I review something. But Cloverfield is a movie that really needs spoilers to be understood when reviewed. Minor spoilers should help in deciding whether or not you should see the movie. ***<br/><br/>The first thing you need to know, is that the movie has a very shaky camera (although the visuals are VERY impressive). If you absolutely CANNOT stand shaky camera filming (which gets only gets really shaky when the monster comes around and causes havoc), don't bother watching it. My friends kept ranting about it, however I truly believe people exaggerate on that. I quickly got used to Cloverfield's shaky camera and believe me, Cloverfield wouldn't work without the first person view, or at least the effects would be less intense if it were in a third person perspective.<br/><br/>The second thing you need to know is, again, you're watching this from an ORDINARY EVERYDAY AVERAGE person's perspective. Don't expect Tom Cruise or Matt Damon as a character to save the day and raid the hell out of a gigantic monster. This is J.J. Abrams's vision of a monster movie and it really isn't your average monster (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Not everything in the movie is explained, because again, these are normal people, they're not the governments or doctors who quickly studies on the creature to figure out what exactly is going on.<br/><br/>The third thing you need to know is, the movie starts out pretty slowly, but nothing too harsh to be honest. I believe you can bare 20 minutes of character development, which is actually a good thing, because those 20 minutes actually made me care about the characters. Besides, after those 20 minutes, the movie becomes an intense joyride.<br/><br/>So I conclude, after months anticipation, the movie was filled with intense moments, had pretty solid acting (nothing felt forced or machine-like) and has a monster that SHOULD be an iconic monster for America (the monster looks seriously awesome)."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","7","22 January 2008"," A movie technology masterpiece; a unique experience for the audience
","Anyone considering oneself a regular moviegoer should experience this. I have chosen my word deliberately, for this is indeed an EXPERIENCE not to be missed. A regular moviegoer who has not seen ""The Blair witch project"" would at least be well aware of it. I understand that it is really filmed with a hand-held camera. But don't be fool by ""Cloverfield"". This one is high tech stuff that impersonates a hand-held camera, but doing it so successfully that it deserves to be called a movie technology masterpiece.<br/><br/>The entire movie is supposed to be a camcorder ""documentation"" recovered from ""what used to be known"" as Central Park after a major disaster ravished Manhattan. The two people who shot the film (one for the first 80 minutes and other the last 5 minutes) are dead. What the audience experience is the first hand POV of four (plus one more at the end) people's ordeal during a devastating attack of New York City by a monster creature the origin of which is never explained (nor is that really necessary). There is nothing that you have not seen before if you are a regular moviegoer who has watched the ""Aliens"" and ""Jurassic Park"" series. ""Cloverfield"" simply repackages all the familiar images that you have seen in these movies. The beauty is in the way it has been done, and this has to be, as I said, experienced first hand, something that no amount of IMDb user comments or film critic reviews can substitute.<br/><br/>Other comments you would definitely come across if you have followed written material about this movie are the obvious post-911 psychological complex and the love story aspect. But in the end, the lure of this movie is in the unique experience that no other movie has ever given you."
"darlybrito","9","3","7","22 January 2008"," Blow me away
","Cloverfield was beyond my expectations. I expected it this film to be good, but not really good.<br/><br/>The most common thing that fans didn't like is the shaky camera. The camera move quite a bit, but that really didn't bother me. If you have ""motion sickness"" or whatever they call it, DON'T see the movie.<br/><br/>What bother me was that the movie was kind of short. Other than that, it was all good.<br/><br/>One of the best things that the movie has, is the monster. It's huge, ugly, creepy, and original. I think this monster is totally cooler than Godzilla. The offspring of the monster were cool too. The sound that they make was kind of creepy and suspenseful. *Watch out the tunnel scene*.<br/><br/>Now, the story was very controversial. A lot of people thought the movie wasn't really a monster flick. Here is what I think. The movie is about party-goers giving a surprise party to Rob(Michael Stahl-David), who is leaving New York the next day for a vice-president job in Japan. But then, a monster comes out of nowhere and ends up screwing their party. Then the flick focus more on Rob and his friends reaching Beth(Rob's girl), who is trapped in her apartment when the monster hit. But I still thought the monster got good screen time in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Cloverfield is an entertaining intense thriller that will blow you away."
"edwie","5","3","7","22 January 2008"," I think....
","I didn't care about the hand-held camera stuff. The story, was... OK. The acting was quite.. good. The plot was... interesting.<br/><br/>What disappointed me the most about the movie was the monster!!! What the ?? I had seen this drawing of the Cloverfield monster (Spectacular, creepy, impressive whale-thing with bugs all over it), then I was told it was a fake, but then I assumed the real monster would be even more impressive, given the dimensions of the destruction (skycrapers falling, explosions, the noise, etc.).<br/><br/>Instead, we are treated to this anorexic version of the Harry Potter troll!! only thing missing was the log in his hand.<br/><br/>So when you see this effeminate monster strutting its Naomi Campbell legs all over Manhattan, with a head made of poop, you think again... can this flaming monster cause so much destruction? It didn't even look big enough.<br/><br/>That was my pet peeve with the movie."
"aznguy2004","10","3","7","22 January 2008"," This movie just feels and looks fantastic. (some spoilers)
","I'm about to do something i haven't done in a long time. A movie review. As i sit here, eating my buffalo wings, i will review what could quite possible be the most innovative, creative, different, awesome movie i have ever seen. I apologize in advance for any spoilers.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie, in between the beginning and ending, was done perfectly. More perfectly than i could even think of... i honestly cant think of a flaw (besides the fast camera, but that's more of the viewers eyes if they can take it) within the body of the movie. I didn't like the beginning or ending, but i know they were needed, there was no way they could have gotten away with leaving those parts out.. Also, the movie just felt short to me.. like the fun was over quickly. But time flies when you're having fun Cliché phrases aside, I will say, if this movie wasn't filmed the way it was. Like..with normal studio camera angle shots. This movie would not be as good. The source of this movie's greatness is with the style. Take away the creativity and the ""oddness"" of the film, then you just have, a new years opener of an OK action oriented film.<br/><br/>The point of view makes everything realistic..like what it would be like if this situation really happened to an unsuspecting group of friends. Don't think when you watch this movie... about stuff like ""where the heck is the monster from?"" ""What is it?"" ... yes, there are a lot of unanswered questions. But think that this movie was made in the POV of this small group.. they know nothing of what is going on. It saves us the dissatisfaction of dramatic irony. if we knew who, what, when, where, and why, it would take away from....everything. That's my opinion... If you're one of those who wanna be smart and know everything.. look online for all the speculation and theories. This phenomenon has been around for a year online. We were'nt supposed to know anything. It wasn't till a short time before the release that they decided to keep the name ""Cloverfield"". That was just a code name for the film in its production..<br/><br/>The characters are great.. none of them are popular and scene stealing, they are all on the same level. That means they all have an equal chance of getting killed. I wont spoil this but i'll hint... ""I don't feel so good""*KASPLAT* oh man, that was my favorite part.<br/><br/>And the action... spectacular. A major part of the film.. and we see it all. Unlike the Blair Witch which was filmed a similar way... and was nothing but darkness and screaming and major sucking. This movie just feels and looks fantastic.<br/><br/>It is a Classic A lot of people won't understand this movie. Everyone I saw it with didn't like it...(Toni (my friend)even lied and said she did, and later on took it back, calling it ""crap"") that's OK.. Lately I've liked a lot of movies everyone else didn't. And disliked a lot of movies everyone did *cough* Juno *coughwasgay* I give this movie a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>I'm gonna stop here because i'm getting the keyboard all... messy and icky"
"foppa6121","8","3","7","21 January 2008"," Absolutely brilliant!
","Going into this film I had already looked at reviews on IMDb and saw it had received surprisingly high ratings. To be honest I went into this movie with low expectations. I saw the preview and thought that it would be entertaining but the first person camera style would be too distracting from the actual movie. DEAD WRONG! The filming, however shaky, puts you in the movie. Halfway into the movie I had to remind myself that I was in a theater and not being ravaged by a horrible monster in New York. And after I heard that there was something at the end of the credits I had to go back to the theater and watch it a second time. Although I already knew what was going to happen next, I still found myself right alongside with the main characters in the movie. Last year, I saw at least 60 movies and I don't remember coming out of a movie as satisfied as I did with this one. I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
"dapeace_man","9","3","7","21 January 2008"," Take some Airborne and deal with it.
","This movie was done JUST FINE for the style they worked with.<br/><br/>What saddens me is nobody has a good excuse for why this was a bad movie, I see these things, mainly.<br/><br/>1. Style vs. Plot Explanation Take this into account if you don't get anything else from this review. It's done in first person style, so we only know as much as the kids know, whatever it is they are doing. It happens in a matter of a few hours, and I dunno about you, but all monster movies take a day or so after the initial attack to learn how it all started. Also, if you remember correctly, they had a discussion in the subway tunnels where hub suggested it could have been hibernating in the ocean for thousands of years without our knowledge. The truth of this we won't know.<br/><br/>2. Style vs. Reality Get a friggin grip. They couldn't win here. If they did the movie EXACTLY like a cheap digicam would be, EVERYONE would complain of the horrid video quality, the terrible sound, and the constant shaking (which i will get to shortly). Of COURSE they used an amazing camera to make this film. Of COURSE they stopped shaking the camera to see something cool. Who would go see a movie in Stereo? Who would go see a movie that's heavily pixelated? Who would go see a movie with almost indistinguishable text? NOBODY.<br/><br/>3. Motion Sickness You guys are the biggest sissies ever. What, do you have to vomit when you ride a bike, too?<br/><br/>The camera shaking wasn't nearly as bad as one of the fight scenes in Bourne Supremacy, and honestly, the theatre I went to was packed and no one complained about motion sickness, the theatre my friend went to was packed and no one complained, and none of my friends or their friends got sick either.<br/><br/>Take some Airborne or something next time and suck it up you pansies.<br/><br/>As for the film and my opinion of it.<br/><br/>The film was great with what they worked with. Granted the first 10 or 15 minutes were boring and served no purpose other than to show that the main character loved a girl and couldn't exactly tell her.<br/><br/>Once the ""earthquake"" (which I might add made me laugh, considering that no earthquake makes an enormous booming sound like that) hits, we're thrust into panic, AS WE SHOULD BE. The kids all run outside to see what's going on, then things blow up and debris goes flying and it's lots of mayhem. We learn that this guy is starting to get scared for the girl he loves and needs to get a hold of her, though the need to isn't so great until the Brooklyn Bridge deal, then he freaks out because he doesn't want her dieing without being certain she know he loves her.<br/><br/>THIS, FOR ALL YOU THICK HEADED MOVIE NOOBS, IS THE PLOT.<br/><br/>Simple as it may be, that's what it is. He is in a panic, his adrenaline is rushing, he is not thinking clearly; as no human being would be doing in that situation. They have their little adventure through New York, getting attacked and still remaining in the dark about what's attacking them. They go to get the girl against all odds, and it is when they pull her off the bar (WHICH DID NOT PIERCE HER HEART NO DUH) that the character has a clear sense of thought. They immediately go for safety.<br/><br/>The end of the movie happens, and it's very simple. Everyone is screwed, period. End of story, have fun with it.<br/><br/>I liked it, they dealt with it well, and even though the plot was simple, all monster movies have a simple plot. This was a monster movie, a complex plot would've ruined it.<br/><br/>Good work guys, next time you should actually enjoy the movie instead of grabbing your clipboards and analyzing every instant of it to see how perfect it is."
"superkat2010","10","3","7","20 January 2008"," Fantastic and Refreshing
","This film was truly epic. The pacing at the beginning was slow, granted. But after that, the whole film was a roller-coaster adrenaline rush. The effects were well done, the characters lifelike and realistic. When the helicopter goes down and you hear Hud praying to Jesus and god and whoever else happens to be listening, you think ""this is exactly what I would be doing"" The movie isn't trying to glorify anything, the heroes don't do anything too terribly stupid, or find a way, singlehandedly, to destroy the earth. Instead, they're just trying to survive. This movie was everything that the Matthew Broderick version of Godzilla and War of the Worlds SHOULD have been (Namely, massive amounts of destruction, and no Matthew Broderick or Tom Cruise) The ""Gimmick"" of having the entire film shot as if it had merely been shot on a home camera, was, in my opinion, pretty awesome. It made me feel queasy sometimes, but the overall effect was definitely worth it, by all means.<br/><br/>People who disliked this movie just didn't get it, or something. I don't fully understand their complaints. The action and pacing were excellent, and the characters were great. I only hope that there is... I hesitate to say a sequel, because those are rarely good. But, I hope there's another connected film. It seems like the start of a very promising franchise, akin to Alien."
"charchuk","7","3","7","20 January 2008"," Incredibly immersive and nearly flawless
","Well, I thought it was pretty terrific. The characters were likable enough to make me root for them and believable enough that I felt completely absorbed in the action. You won't find any outstanding performances, but they were solid enough and never took me out of the movie - which probably couldn't have happened anyway. The way it was filmed, while making the film incredibly intense and immersive, also allowed for the story to not center on the monster, and I found that really refreshing. Even still, the monster, when seen, is a terrifying beast, mostly due to the impressive effects, and I really loved that you never really found out what it was. This film wasn't about the monster. I thought the end dragged out the inevitable too long, and it got kind of ridiculous when Hud was attacked, but other than that, this is as thrilling a movie as you're likely to find."
"jiraf","10","3","7","20 January 2008"," Great balance between a monster movie and a love story - IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT
","Or maybe this is what the perfect love story look like ? The story is told from a very interesting, unique, point of view. Instead of the usual, chase the monster, find its nest and weakness, and kill it with a gazillion bombs, this movie finds a new way to explore a horrible (yet familiar through all previous movies) event. The film itself focus more on how ordinary lives are affected by an attack on Manhattan, instead of filming a bunch of superhumans who can always find a way out of a tight spot and escape unharmed. It makes everything seem so real. <br/><br/>Matt Reeves & JJ Abrams did everything absolutely right. I love the subplot of what happened between Beth and Robby. Flashbacks in the movie made everything seem so human and reminds the audience of more normal times,when the only thing that matter was love, and each other. <br/><br/>In the end, in the midst of all the destruction, that's all there is left."
"nsalz8","10","3","7","20 January 2008"," Cloverfield was amazing! One of the best movies I've ever seen
","Some people may have not liked this movie due to the abrupt ending and camera shot. Personally i enjoyed the camera work in cloverfield it made it seem very realistic. The seen in the tunnel where hud put on night vision was great. The ending had to take place where it did or else it would have drag on and the movie would have lost interest. Also surprisingly this movie had some hilarious scenes. By far Cloverfield is deserves 4 stars! they also a had some great camera work in the scene when they are on the roof and you down on the monster/alien fighting the army. If i were Rob i would have just left beth thinking she is already dead and head down to safety off of Manhattan."
"asleepordead17","10","3","7","20 January 2008"," Amazing...
","When I first saw the teaser trailer for ""Cloverfield"" whilst watching ""Transformers"", I was blown away. The movie looked awesome, but I didn't know what it was. Now, it's much later, in January. I have seen the movie last night and I guess it lived up to the hype and it did much more.<br/><br/>First of all, nearly every aspect of ""Cloverfield"" was perfect. The weird camera style was reminiscent of ""The Blair Witch Project"", but the camera style worked much, much better than anything ""Blair Witch"" could dish out. The camera style helped me feel much closer to the characters and it helped me feel like I was right there next to Hud (the guy filming the movie), running and screaming. The movie was very emotional, and I felt what Rob and Lily were going through when Jason perished. I felt Hud's sorrow when Marlena died her shitty death. I could totally feel Rob's determination to get into Beth's building to save her. I believe that ""Cloverfield"" would have been a worse movie had the camcorder not been used to film it.<br/><br/>For those of you that are wondering what the monster is, I'll tell you. It sure as hell blew me away when I saw it on the big screen. It looks like as if the Brumac (from ""Gears of War""), a slug, an Ultralisk (from ""StarCraft""), a praying mantis, and Godzilla had a baby. And the result is a terrifying piece of work that can only be called original. <br/><br/>The movie overall, was amazing. The intense action really kept me on the edge of my seat and Hud's comic quips provided a sense of laughter. The movie was emotional, a great addition to such an action-packed movie. Yes, the movie was more or less a love story, what with Rob going back to the middle of the city to get Beth. However, the movie mixed elements of destruction, action, romance and Godzilla to really create the great movie it is. The government opening (""multiple sightings of case designate 'cloverfield' camera found in u.s. area 447, area formerly known as 'central park'"") made the movie feel like a top-secret government document. It's too sad that basically everyone is dead, but ""Cloverfield 2"" is possible since the monster is PRESUMED DEAD. But if the government did kill the big monster, did they kill all of the little ones? Did someone else film the event, creating a new perspective of the disaster? Wink, wink."
"meeshac90","10","3","7","19 January 2008"," Intensly Interesting and ""Wicked Sweet""
","I went to see Cloverfield, not really knowing what to expect, knowing that there were commercials from the point of a first person camera yet not expecting to have the whole movie through that aspect. And yet, it worked. The music was replaced with the shaking and rattling, the fear and the turmoil created around them. It was the camera's story as the old tape behind the one being film told the past without ever having to have the characters directly re-tell or explain in detail what occurred. The character development in this movie was stupendous, every character feels as though they could be ""that friend you have"", or someone you can really, honestly relate to. What makes this film so great is not only the camera angles and the unknown veil of what may be happening and what actually occurred, but it is the fact that if it had happened then this is how it would be, this is how we would act.<br/><br/>There is even some sarcastic comedy but everything is completely suitable for the situaution and seems so natural to each character's personality. The ending was perfect, it left me curious, engaged, upset and even somewhat frustrated, however, not to spoil it, that is what a good movie SHOULD be doing. <br/><br/>It was created, different and interesting, I was listening intently, completely obsessing over finding out what was going on, and creating theories along with the characters, and like them, I never found out."
"xperteric","3","3","7","19 January 2008"," not great but not terrible
","I think the movie cloverfield caught our eyes due to the secretive parts of it. However it reminded me of The Blair Witch Project with its advertising and how the movie was made. The sound effects in the movie were almost identical to Godzilla when the monster was around. The first half hour of movie was pretty slow with some funny commentary. The monster should of been kept secret but they showed pretty much the whole thing in later scenes of the movie. Also the monster had smaller attacking monsters which were only a small nuisance to attack the people when they were on the run from the larger creature. Throughout the movie which is a camcorder filmed attack of NYC the effects were pretty cheap looking but the sounds were amazing. Acting was poor in some scenes but I believe they were acting like they were not acting which is very noticeable with poor actors. The monster was never explained and who was viewing the tape found was not explained except that it was military. Ending left me wondering what happened despite total destruction of NYC and the main characters. Also unexplained scene with girl who was bitten by little monsters that just left everyone confused and curious but it was not explained again. Basically I would call Cloverfield a mystery from the trailer till the end of the movie. Nothing was explained and nothing was revealed the viewers like myself just have to fill in all the unknowns and try to think if we are right. Overall I gave the movie a 3 out of 10. It kept me interested for about an hour and then I was waiting for it to be over. Thats pretty sad for a movie 1 and a half hours long. Good try but after seeing the Ironman and Hellboy 2 previews to hype me up the movie let me down in the end. Rent don't buy!"
"jermackey","5","3","7","18 January 2008"," Greatly Over-hyped
","I was so excited to see this movie because it just seemed like it couldn't be bad...I was wrong. Some people will really enjoy this movie just for the awesome visuals it has in the movie (Statue of Liberty's Head flying, Buildings leaning on others, etc.). However, if you go into this movie looking for it to have some resolve or even a somewhat happy ending, then you will be greatly disappointed as I was. The acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The hand-held camera shaking did get a little annoying at times where I found myself wishing they'd stop just so I didn't feel sick. I think it was a great attempt to make something that could have been truly amazing, but it fell way short of the expectations that I had for this movie. There were only about a dozen people in the theater I was in, but when it was over there wasn't one person who seemed happy about the ending, I heard many ""you have to be kidding me"" or ""you really know how to pick the crappy movies."" I would only recommend this movie to someone that is a realist and wants to see what it would really be like if a monster did attack, but not to anyone looking for a ""true"" ending or any answers to anything that is happening. I'm sure they are just setting it up for a sequel but hopefully they leave out the hand held camera's next time."
"peschy77","8","3","7","18 January 2008"," Simplistic but effective!!!!!!!!!
","Let me first start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of LOST, and I did want to see this movie because of J.J. Abrams. With that being said, this movie was in no comparison to that of LOST!!!! The movie got right into it!!!!!! The first 20 minutes sets up a little bit of background on the very few number of characters that were in this film. The last 60 minutes of the movie is about their will to survive this chaos that is going on in New York City. I thought the movie could have used a little bit more of a story line. I think the writers should have tied into the plot that the main character(who was leaving the Country because of a promotion) had something to do with what was going on in the city. He could have maybe worked with the government, and they knew something horrible might be coming. But, they chose(the writers) to just stick with a simple script. Cut and dry. There is something attacking the city that came from the Hudson River!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Whatever the thing(monster) was, it could be described as a hybrid dinosaur with a very long tail, tentacles like an alien, four legs like an elephant, a head that could turn on a 360 degree angle, 25 stories tall, strong as hell, a host for parasite spiders to drop from it, & overall just a big mean wrecking machine!!!!!!! I think it was left up to you to figure out what this thing was!!!!! <br/><br/>The action and special effects sequences in this movie were done very well I thought. It looked believable for a movie that was done on a fairly low budget(30 million dollars I believe).<br/><br/>I would love to see a prequel or a sequel to this movie, but I doubt very seriously they will retell this movie in any kind of way.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this movie is very satisfying. I will say that this movie reminded me a lot of The Mist(Stephen King's short story). The creatures looked a lot alike in both movies. Both had one huge creature and both had smaller creatures coming from the host. I'm glad I went to see it. Keep your eyes on the last few seconds of the movie. A lot of people I know that have seen it have said they show something crashing into the Hudson River on the videotape with Robert & Beth at Coney Island.........................."
"frankjames","4","3","7","18 January 2008"," Terrible.
","I don't know what movie that other people saw. But 'Cloverfield' was a joke. Is it a good sign when your suspense or horror movie has people laughing in the theaters? And there are no jokes at all. I wish someone would pay me millions of dollars to combine 'The Blair Witch Project' and scenes that look like 9/11 re-enactments. No spoiler here but you do get to see 'Cloverfield'. That is not what people were laughing at, but the movie was a rip-off. I should have seen Juno instead of this Godzilla remake.

","First of all, the movie is great. Great acting, Great Action, Great Effects. the monster is a little bit mediocre for my liking but its still very unique. This movie however was highly shaky on its cinematography, therefore it gave me a massive headache after watching it. The use of a handy-cam perspective was well effective on the interaction between the movie and it's audience, which i really liked. the conclusion was a bit of a downer, however its still forgivable.<br/><br/>After watching this movie in Australia's biggest cinema screen, I must advise you, that you must sit at the very back of the cinema, as far as possible, if you sit too close to the screen you will get a headache. Also have an open mind about the movie, don't eat while watching the movie, remember that the story is about the people escaping not about the monster, and finally, bring your favourite headache remedy for afterwards."

They tried too hard to constantly remind us that it's through a cam-corder what we're seeing, D'uh! We knew that before bothering to watch it. How many of you have filmed parties or nights out or kids playing etc ...? and in the midst of chaos and commotion didn't you manage to keep the camera steady enough so that anyone who'd bother to watch what you filmed didn't want to vomit from your dizzy camera work!?<br/><br/>Very disappointing IMO, after all that hype. I knew it was going to be a bit of a mesh between Blair witch and Godzilla, I just didn't think it would be SUCH a mix of both, and not in a good way either. I also knew that I'd hate every character in it and I'd be wishing them all to die horribly, just from the teasers released late last year. I hoped there'd be at least one likable character, and that the whole handy-cam thing would at least be realistic, as in, anyone can point and film with one without it turning upside down, sideways and going out of focus every 5mins.<br/><br/>They could have done so much better with this idea"

Sadly, this could have been a great movie; the story line contained all the necessary elements to capture the audience such as romance, a diverse cast, NEW YORK as a setting, and awesome special effects.

So, why can't the camera just stick for one second and that I can hear the sound a lot lot more better than the one that we usually heard from our very own handy-cam? The script is without doubt the best yet but the camera was like having a roller coaster ride (remember transformers? The camera circling and I just wonder since when that audience have become robots?). This ain't Blair witch and surely.. if u've been attack by a giant monster or let say an ultraman, would U carry Ur camera along? I mean for what? For viewers to see how U die? Haha.. I don't like the camera's angle at all, it means I HATE it and I will not going to watch this movie if they make a sequel, unless there's a mix between a hand+ache camera with a static ones.. Alrite then n uhm watch it and U'll understand but don't say that I didn't warn ya!!! he he..<br/><br/>P/s; the reason why people went to cinemas is because of the fact that people wants an entertainment. I did mentioned that I vomit.. so do you believe that I enjoy watching it? That's the reason why I'm giving 1 out of ten. Because I vomit!!!"
"bigbones33","1","4","11","21 January 2008"," this movie is gay
","okay this movie was about some people who went through an attack on in NYC. the monster was never really revealed in the movie. it was just about as good as snakes on a plane aside from the part where the guy gets eaten by the snake. it had bad drama like the Blair witch project and then ended terribly. i am glad that i bought a $5 DVD off a Chinese person on the subway. it spared my friends the entertainment of going to the movies. the only thing that was good was the bottle of southern comfort! this movie started out like a cheap skin movie from the eighties and then all of a sudden something blew up and the statue of liberty head flew by and everyone was drunk and people died. it was honestly a pretty terrible movie watched by several people who couldn't wait for it to end"
"blacknwhite337","Null","4","11","19 January 2008"," Worst movie ever
","OK so I feel like I wasted my money. The beginning of the movie was totally irrelevant, and then when they finally get to the monster, its the worst cg monster I've ever seen. I'm not even sure what it's supposed to be. Then half the time you can't see whats going on because the guy holding the camera has it pointed at the ground; then the shots you do see make you extremely nauseous. I had to close my eyes the last half of the movie and I never get motion sick. Trust me the ending was completely stupid, and anti-climactic (which I can't spell) It's the second worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies, so do yourselves a favor and save your money."
"brendansanatomy","9","4","11","19 January 2008"," wow!!
","I was honestly in awe the whole time. Never have I watched a movie for a full hour with my jaw dropped i couldn't believe it.<br/><br/>The movie seems SO real that halfway through i totally forgot it was fake. The way they film it and the way the characters die just makes it even more real because unlike other huge Hollywood budget films the filmmakers don't care how big the actor is they just kill them and then after there death is pretty much not talked about. Which makes it real because how many people would scream and cry for 3 minutes when a giant monster is attacking the city? You would want to save your lives and others.<br/><br/>The only reason i gave it 9/10 and not 10/10 was because i really wanted to know what the hell the monster was and i wish we just had a really good body shot of it but at the end we get a extreme closeup of it which is so scary.I hope they make something after the film to kind of give origins as to what it was something like a year later type video about how they found out what it is and where it came from.<br/><br/>Overall a GREAT film and i highly recommend people to go see it if there having doubts,one of my top favorites. Totally worth the hype and wait.<br/><br/>p.s- make sure to see it in a theater with amazing sound,its makes it so much better!!"
"nswasta","9","4","11","19 January 2008"," Cloverfield Sublime
","Cloverfield does exactly what I hoped it would do, and that is focusing on character development and keeping the frame of reference centered around them. Abrams appreciates a good monster flick, and he nods to those films, certainly. However, the PoV is what did it for me, because there wasn't the typical Hollywood brouhaha that answers every questions and sees everythingthere was no bottle feeding the audience, handing them all the details, because who actually wants to THINK when they go to the movies? The characters were scared and confused, and thus, so was I. Cloverfield, like the pilot episode of TV's Lost, places us right in the middle of conflict and then the pace keeps moving. What seemed to make the audience angry at my showing (other than the crazy camera movements) was when the PoV ended, so did the film. For me, that was wonderful. There was no Hollywood closure, and that allows me to make assumptions, keep questioning and thinking. Although, the last scene of the film, the video from Coney Island, did show a falling object in the upper right corner, this was approximately one month before the attack. I assume that the falling object was the creature hurling into the ocean, but then again, I can only make assumptions (and that's what I love about Abrams' approach--put audiences in the middle of an experience and don't give them time to question it). I absolutely adore this film."
"high_on_Cloverfields","9","4","11","18 January 2008"," First-person action? Awesome!
","I watched this movie with three friends: one of them hated it, and the other two said it was average while I thought it was just awesome. The whole uniqueness of the movie lies in its first-person perspective which is either a total turnoff or an incredible experience. It was the latter for me and I have absolutely fallen in love with this technique. You actually feel like you're in the action and participating with the characters. I've probably never gotten this involved with a movie before. I was literally gripping my seat through its entirety. The style can be compared to a driving video game. Some people prefer to play with the perspective behind the car so that they can admire the cars/scenery and have more awareness of the surroundings. Others choose to play in first-person mode which emphasizes the speed of the car and generally provides an experience closer to that of the driver.<br/><br/>Many people complain about the constant camera shaking making them uncomfortable. I have major motion sickness, but I got through and felt only slightly disoriented at parts. The rest of you should be fine.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those movies that you have to watch in the movie theater. The big screen and speakers allow for a truly immersive experience, so go out and watch it. At least see if you like it or not. Then you'll know whether to avoid these kind of movies in the future."
"orangeduck","7","4","11","18 January 2008"," Revolutionary, exciting, but a little disappointing
","I must begin by saying that, in my opinion, J.J. Abrams set out to revolutionize the action movie, which I guarantee he did. With the idea of the shaky camera already making headway, Abrams film will definitely start a new generation of hand-held camera films. In that respect, the film was very well done: while the camcorder was crazy, it wasn't so discombobulated that it became distracting, and the effect made me feel like I was really in the movie. I also highly recommend that you watch this movie in theatres, as I promise the effect is great. Plus, on a T.V. screen, I have the feeling that it might look more like a home movie than like a (somewhat) frightening action movie.<br/><br/>I appreciated the willingness to kill off characters (I always get annoyed with those death and destruction movies where everyone dies EXCEPT the main characters) and was often surprised by the humour of the cameraman. It was also a unique twist that I only rarely saw the cameraman, despite the fact that he was the main character.<br/><br/>However, I was rather disappointed on one fact: total lack of closure. While I do appreciate open-ended movies, this didn't address the one main issue I feel many people anticipate an answer to: what the hell was that thing? Was it an alien? Was there one or several (though you never see more than one at a time, there's no certainty that this is the only one)? Was it a Godzilla remake with a twist? Was it a government experiment? Was it a surprise to the government, or did they know it was coming? Did anyone know anything? Did anyone ever find out anything? I would have been okay with just a little idea, a hint, a musing; anything! I have been trying to guess what this creature was since I saw the preview this summer. Friends and I would have heated debates about it. And not only did Abrams never give an answer, he never even gave a hint. I almost felt like Abrams himself didn't know what would have been a satisfying explanation, and ended it before he would ever have to explain it.<br/><br/>Overall, unique, riveting, and well worthwhile; but I apologize to anyone who went hoping to discover what the monster was."

"misterembryo","8","4","11","18 January 2008"," Cloverfield: Midnight Showing
","At one point in the movie, one character echoes the famous words from the original home-video horror flick The Blair Witch Project: ""I'm so scared."" Only in Cloverfield what they encounter is much more scary and life-threatening than a crazy lady running through the woods. Cloverfield is a 90 minute roller-coaster ride that will increase your adrenaline as much as it will increase your dire need for a vomit bag.<br/><br/>Rob is leaving for Japan for his career and a surprise party is thrown on his behalf. Hud takes up the responsibility of cameraman, whose purpose is to document the farewell testimonies. This provided an interesting way to introduce the characters and gave insight into their personalities and relationships. Telling a story through this style of filming could be pretty difficult, but Cloverfield actually pulls it off. You even grow fond of some of the characters in the process, which is especially important for a movie that depends on the survival of the characters. It also helps that the actors gave likable and pretty convincing performances.<br/><br/>The party is interrupted by a series of tremors, a short blackout, and a flurry of fireballs flying through the air. New York is under attack. From then on you are sucked into a crazy trip through the panic of the dismantled city as Hud decides to continue videotaping the events, knowing that the world will want to see what exactly happened that night in New York City.<br/><br/>Although the movie offers a great story of bravery and camaraderie, that's not what anyone cares about right? Everyone wants to know what ""It"" is. Trust me. ""It"" is something far more ugly and terrifying than a giant cuddly ape.<br/><br/>Going into the movie, you of course need to suspend a little disbelief. Aside from the monster itself, you also have to accept their ability to somehow escape certain situations; otherwise it would be a much shorter movie. If I were documenting the whole thing the video would probably last five minutes. To make up for it, little details are thrown in to maintain the atmosphere of authenticity, taking pictures of the head of a decapitated Statue of Liberty with a cell phone camera for example, or the looters who horde the electronics store amidst all the chaos.<br/><br/>The special effects are completely mind-blowing. The Toyota Tacoma and ""Ratchet and Clank"" commercials really did something special when they combined special effects with the home video feel. Cloverfield takes this concept to the maximum extreme and does an excellent job making the surreal as real as it can get.<br/><br/>The suspense will get to you. There are times that make you jump and times that make you cringe. The end will either leave you wanting more or begging for it to be over. No matter what the case, Cloverfield is an experience you will never forget. (Word of advice: DO NOT sit in the first five rows, especially in IMAX. Big mistake.)"

Then, the stuff hits the fan and it's non-stop.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the trolls that gripe about the ending and the lack of explanation. Take it for what it is -- A realistic home-movie account of a monster attack on NYC. How are corpses supposed to keep making their video at the end? You see plenty of the monster. Just like in Jaws, you see just enough of it that it's still horrifying and not a distraction from the characters.<br/><br/>You'll never see anything like this as long as you live.

"wheazz-1","8","4","11","18 January 2008"," Intense, jacked-up, but only worth one watch
","i just got back from seeing the midnight Cloverfield with my friends at a local theater- so this is a fresh review right from the viewing. First off, I have no idea how they got away with making this P3-13. I think of my little 13 year old brother seeing it alone- and he wouldn't be able to handle it. That said, the movie was amazing (for the most part) <br/><br/>The first part is the camera work- It's entirely done with a hand-held camcorder in a first- person view. We follow the comic relief character for the most of the movie- and he does get the entire theater to laugh more than once. The beauty of the camera-work, though, is that it makes you feel actually IN the movie. It's grody, it's shaky, and I got dizzy a few times, but it puts you right in the action like the other 3rd-person movies can't. It's brilliant.<br/><br/>Secondly is the trailer, which although it was a giant, screaming cliffhanger, it described the entire movie. Short, with a giant cliffhanger and no explanation at the end. You really know how its going to end, since the beginning of the movie says ""Footage found in what used to be called Central Park"" or the like. so you know: a) Central Park gets owned, and b) whoever had the camera lost it- probably due to some gruesome death. That is the case, for every owner of it. <br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of the movie gets you chilled. It's a party, they develop characters, everyone's relaxing, except the few main characters for personal reasons. Once the action starts, though, it keeps on rolling. The monster is shown in clips, and the thing is so crazy you really can't piece together what it is until the camera comes face-to-face with it's bulging cheek-sacks and gigantic fangs. Then you get to see the inside of its mouth- guess why. <br/><br/>The scares and shocks are good too. The first bit with the parasites, where they're in the tunnel, and think it's OK until the camera turns on night vision and has all the bugs on the ceiling is crazy. The fights are intense- thanks again to the camera-work. When the girl was bitten, you think it's going to be OK- but then she dies in a matter of seconds- crying blood ""guys, I don't feel so good"" then being rushed to a tent to explode. That shook me like nothing else in the movie.<br/><br/>The characters rush into the city for a girl who's dying and dies at the end anyway, so it's pretty pointless, but the movie isn't about plot. It isn't about an explanation. It's a monster movie designed to get you involved and shake you up until the very end. A classic way of making movies, and done right in my book. Sadly, seeing it again is probably not going to happen, as I know what goes down and that ruins it, but it still was awesome on the first go- round."

","Man, today I went to the cinema to watch this movie since the trailer blew me out. With such high expectations, I hope this movie will deliver as good as in the trailer, not like AVP2 (quite disappointed..sorry) and it turns out that it was a great movie. Although the movie borrowed the concept from ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Godzilla"", it does delivered the people satisfaction. It feels like we, as the viewers are inside the movie, having the same situation as the innocent people of Manhattan. I can't imagine how we are going to survive the day. Anyway, every movie has its own pros and cons. The movie does delivered some unanswered questions, such as ""What did really happened to Marlena Diamond ?"", ""Did the couple died at the end of the movie?"", ""What happened to the monster?""..yeah, it does have a cliffhanger ending but overall, I found this movie is well worth of watching and job well done to the director and the whole crew of ""Cloverfield""."
"espymu","9","4","11","17 January 2008"," Great great movie with a little bit of 'Blair Witch', ' Godzilla' and 'Aliens' altogether!
","Just watched this afternoon and it was definitely the 3 shows put together. With the hand held video camera throughout the movie and the monster ( wayyyyy better than godzilla, Ultraman or Power Rangers would have a very tough time fighting against it ) plus the little creatures (face huggers wannabe ).<br/><br/>Frankly, the show was pretty interesting. There were minor flaws but still awesome nonetheless. The starting of the movie was rightfully slow paced for character building and it suddenly intensifies with a sound of explosion. It then went uphill after that.(Rob finding Beth with his friends help ) The ending was also great. Although it ended abruptly like 'I am Legend ', it had a logical ending. (Nuking the entire city. That is the most appropriate way of destroying a monster of such magnitude) The coolest scene would be when the statue of liberty head came collapsing on to the ground.One word to describe that. 'Breathtaking'! ( Not forgetting the Brooklyn Bridge got destroyed AGAIN!!!). HOW MANY TIMES DOES THE BRIDGE HAD TO BE DESTROYED? I could name ten movies where the bridge was destroyed! T,J Miller who acted as Hud Platt also stood out with his wits.Carrying the hand held video camera and making one liners with such ease.<br/><br/>To sum everything up, this is a show where everyone should never miss.Top Notch!I am giving it 9/10.<br/><br/>Enjoy the movie folks!"
"textile_fiend","10","4","11","17 January 2008"," Best disaster movie ever
","This film was everything we hoped it would be. We loved the trailers, but we were prepared for some disappointment (as we felt with War of the Worlds). However the film completely delivered. After a slow initial buildup to establish the characters the tension didn't let up for the rest of the film. Lots of monster shots, lots of scares; just a fantastic thrill-ride of a film. Will definitely go and see it again. The M rating in New Zealand doesn't accurately reflect how scary this film is in parts; at our screening there was a 7-year-old with his dad, and this is way too young (will be some nightmares tonight!). We wouldn't take anyone under 14, and they'll be terrified.<br/><br/>Hugely recommended; a triumph of its genre."
"snowmanwilly","10","4","11","17 January 2008"," Don't fall off your seat, it'll have you on the edge of it ...
","What distinguishes this film from others of a similar genre is its ability to make you believe it could happen to you, your friends and your family. But by the time you see what is causing the hullabaloo you can't take a sigh of relief, because you see what is causing the hullabaloo. In fact, a similar occurrence HAS happened in real life and in my opinion is the message of this film. However, this point has been alluded to by many people already and I won't reiterate.<br/><br/>The movie was exciting from start to finish. Even now after viewing the movie over an hour ago the adrenalin is still giving me a buzz and the beer I'm drinking is probably making it worse.<br/><br/>If you're into horrors and thrillers, then this movie won't disappoint. If you're into story lines, plot and little twists, then do not watch this film - get out a Jane Austen novel from the library instead."
"ramificating","9","4","11","16 January 2008"," The Blair Witch Project + War of the Worlds = CLOVERFIELD
","This film is one of those rare few where the plot really doesn't matter, your just completely blown away by the stunning visuals and realism of each shot of the movie. Just like Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez's Blair Witch Project, the film captures every scene on a typical handy cam in the hands of the 6 protagonists of the film, trying to escape the inevitable doom thats wrecking havoc in the city of New York. The plot overall is just like War of the Worlds, much closer to Steven Spielberg's version. It really has no backbone of any such, most of you will even question the protagonist's choices in the film that build the story, always choosing the worst solution over the best and ultimately showing us what we came to see. The story never feels like it is telling the audience much of whats going on, you learn everything the same way as you would in real life if such a situation could occur, on the news. However, If you think the film will be a cheesy action film then your sadly mistaken. The film really speaks to you through that camera as you are shown the spectacular special effects of building's collapsing, the explosions and the onslaught of damage by both the army and the monster. Certain scene's definitely reflect 9/11 and make you believe its almost real. You can honestly feel like being there, as their are no 2nd or 3rd person views, the camera definitely adds authenticity to the quality of the film, really acting out as a documentary than a pop corn flick.<br/><br/>The antagonist of the movie, the monster, was much more amazing than expected, you won't be disappointed, it truly doesn't keep you unsatisfied it definitely has a place among King Kong and Godzilla as a great sci-fi villain. As an unbeatable force, it truly has no weakness or match and completely leaves you wondering if it can even be stopped. You really do get to see it quite a bit in the film, enough to satisfy almost anyone wanting to see it.<br/><br/>I would suggest it to almost all ages, you will definitely feel like your on a roller coaster for some of the scenes and when you step out of the cinema you will probably hesitate to believe everything that you just saw was a movie and not real."

","On the back of one of the most intricate viral marketing campaigns of all-time, Matt Reeves directs the contemporary monster movie Cloverfield, one for the 'YouTube generation', as some have described it. Generating immense hype through the posting of ambiguous images on the film's own spin-off website (1-18-08.com), it almost felt as if Cloverfield had grabbed the entire internet population by the throat, and forced it to uncover the mystery of what exactly has caused so much unexplainable damage to Manhattan. Ultimately, however, the exploits of those who attempted to unravel this enigma seemed more entertaining and fulfilling than the film itself.<br/><br/>The film pits a group of beautiful, rich New Yorkers we've never heard of against a giant beast bent on destruction, its motives unclear. In fact, the secrecy surrounding the monster itself was one of the few positives of the film. We never learn where the creature is from, what disturbed it, or even what it looks like in its entirety. Positively, this gets the viewer interested and constantly wanting more (a fantastic environment for a director to work in). Unfortunately, the 'more' never comes, and we are left dissatisfied in every other department.<br/><br/>Not only does Cloverfield end far too abruptly, but it does so without really offering any sort of climax. Now, I'm all for innovation in storytelling, and sometimes that can be achieved to great effect with a non-linear plot, but not in this instance. A film built around suspense and senseless action needs to wrap itself up accordingly. That's not just my opinion; its common- sense filmmaking. Because of the final scene, many have criticised the way Cloverfield blatantly plagiarises The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>I feel this to be a rash statement. Yes, the similarities are there, but one can, in fact, see the direction Reeves has taken in ending the film this way. He tried to create something unique and unexpected, and he succeeded, but for all the wrong reasons. And unlike Blair Witch, where we feel the same sense of terror as the characters (probably because it doesn't feel like a piece of fiction), there is no effort made by the protagonists in Cloverfield to incite audience emotion; the poor acting and lacklustre screenplay keeping us from suspending our disbelief.<br/><br/>And of course, there is the camera-work. Once again, I can appreciate the effort made to give the film a point-of-sale, but if the hand-held camera (which acts as our only window in for the entire two-hour run time) dosen't give you motion sickness by film's end, it will definitely annoy you. I fell into the latter category upon first viewing, but it must be noted that I didn't watch it on the big screen. I can only imagine the effect it would have had on people watching on a screen fifty times the size of mine, with no surrounding lighting to minimise the nauseating movement on-screen.<br/><br/>That is precisely the type of blunder that can damage a film's reputation even before release, in both a critical and commercial sense. No film can ever be considered a critical success if its falls below the expectations generated through an advertising campaign, and this is the case with Cloverfield. <br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

","Most people will tell you Cloverfield is about a monster that attacks Manhattan. However, it's so much more than that. I would describe Cloverfield as a drama rather than a monster movie, but it really combines all these elements: Drama, romance, action, mystery, horror, and sci-fi.<br/><br/>When first hearing that Cloverfield is about a monster that attacks Manhattan, it would be likely to think of the movie as unoriginal, but it is the exact opposite of that. Cloverfield is directed using the hand-held(shaky camera) technique, which is a gutsy move, as not everyone likes the technique. The film is portrayed as if it's raw footage of the monster attacking Manhattan, found by the US government after the attack. Many people complain about the filming, and say that it's like an amateur filmed it, but I personally loved the cinematography. The hand-held technique also gives the movie a really mysterious vibe, because you only know as much as an average person would. There's no scientist there to explain the monsters origins and how to destroy it, which is really annoying to me in most monster movies.<br/><br/>Another original thing about Cloverfield is the viral marketing. Viral marketing is advertising a product through some form of media(in Cloverfield's case, the internet) indirectly and relies on word of mouth. Some of the Cloverfield viral websites: Slusho, Tagruato, 1-18- 08, and many others. Following the viral campaign was lots of fun, and added a lot to the experience of the movie.<br/><br/>People complain about the camera technique, the mystery, the plot, basically everything I like about the movie. I guess it's just a difference in opinion, and it can't be proved one way or another.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought Cloverfield was great. It's one of my favorite movies of all time. 10/10."
"kdnor2011","10","2","4","1 March 2010"," Truly the best Camcorder film
","Now I love the ""found footage"" style of filmmaking. Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch, Quarantine, all great films. But Cloverfield is not only my favorite of this genra, but it one of my favorite movies of all time, number 4 to be exact. How do I begin to describe why this movie kicks so much ass...<br/><br/>First the characters: Every single one of these characters are likable. Even the ones that are supposed to be annoying like Hud, despite the fact that he annoys the rest of the characters by never stop filming, he's actually my favorite character because he just so funny. I actually felt sorry for some of these characters when they died. I actually named my cat Marlena, you probably won't get it, so if you want to know why exactly why I named it after her, ask me in the comments. I guess if you want to nitpick, the characters are kind of cliché, Beth is the damsel in distress, Marlena is the weird emo like chick, Hud is the frat boy who doesn't know when to shut up, but this never bothered me.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch, these actors had not been in a lot of movies before this film started, but were absolutely great. Never did I think I was watching actors, I was watching real people, in a real situation. And the three actresses who play Marlena, Lily and Beth...smoking hot.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing, I mean it, there is not one part of this movie that I didn't believe was there. That doesn't happen, no matter how good a movie's CGI is, there is always at least one scene that I can tell is CG. That never happened here, maybe it was because it was dark, maybe it was the movement of the camera, but every special effects shot was perfect, and this movie did not have a big budget.<br/><br/>The ""found footage"" element is used very well here, I was never feeling motion sick. This movie has fun with the gimmick, as much as I love movies like Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch, and Quarantine, (hell I thought Apollo 18 was OK), those movies seem to take themselves to seriously with the gimmick, we know it ain't real, but they try so hard to convince us that they are. Cloverfield knows it's a movie and takes advantage of it.<br/><br/>Speaking of fun, not only is this movie really, really funny at times, but the main reason I love this movie is because it is so much fun. It entertains me every time I watch it, and by the end I want to watch it again.<br/><br/>I didn't get into the viral hype, and thus didn't see the movie until it came out on DVD. I really wish I had gone to see this movie in theaters. That's why I hope they make a sequel, I really, really want to see more of what happened that night. Please J.J. Abrams, I couldn't care less about Star Trek 2, make a sequel to this.<br/><br/>And if you have the DVD or blu ray, there are some really cool Easter eggs on them."
"palinlondon","1","2","4","28 February 2009"," Tripe
","The most irritating film I've seen in a long time. Completely unoriginal - those who have already compared it to a mixture of The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla are absolutely correct. Add a touch of Alien and that just about sums up the whole thing.<br/><br/>The whole film is unrealistic. I had no sympathy for the characters - most seemed to be selfish and unthinking. The events are unbelievable. The camera-work is appalling and I don't just mean because it's supposed to be shot on a hand-held camera - of course I understand that - but the camera doesn't just shake it judders, jolts, convulses - so much that the action is often obscured. I suspect this is a deliberate ploy to disguise the very poor special effects.<br/><br/>A very amateurish effort."
"Jerique","8","2","4","10 January 2009"," Blair Witch Meets War of the Worlds!
","For many people this is an avoided movie for the fact that the style of filming can create motion sickness. The film is shot with a perspective view of one of the characters trying to do a documentary. You get a first-person view of Hud (T.J. Miller)'s seeing.<br/><br/>The film starts off quite boring and remains so for approximately twenty minutes. You are introduced to Hud, Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David), his brother Jason (Mike Vogel), Hud's love interest Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), and Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman), and very quickly you catch on there's something between Beth and Rob. After Beth leaves with her date, Rob, Jason and Hud talk on the balcony until something like an earthquake abruptly stops them.<br/><br/>As everyone evacuates the building, the statue of liberty's head glides down the street right in front of the camera and Hud. Briefly seen is a monster -the monster- who caused it. As Rob tries to get to Beth to save her, tiny monsters attack multiple people, Hud continues to record the crazed journey and the roller coaster ride takes you for all you got.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is well casted, regardless that the cast is primarily unknown actors. The special effects are wonderful and the filming makes you really feel apart of the flick. The romance and comedy are great blankets that keep you tucked from the horror of the monster(s) and everything else has you on the edge of your seat just wondering what will happen next. The end of the film will ultimately leave you breathless and confused, but you will still enjoy what you saw.<br/><br/>With the monsters having a theme that fits War of the Worlds (2005) and the filming aspect being similar to Blair Witch Project (1999) the film gives you at least a little chunk of entertainment. You won't regret seeing the film if you can survive the possible nausea. If you did enjoy the film, hopefully you're on board for the sequel."
"williamalake","5","2","4","21 August 2008"," 1st person let down
","OK, for starters excluding the credits this film was 1hr 10mins long. That isn't film length, that's TV feature episode length.<br/><br/>For me, there was not enough bad guy action, you only saw little bits and then the camera often jerked whilst the camera guy was running. It would have been better if it used both perspectives 1st and 3rd person and mixed both. More action shots would also have been nice.<br/><br/>The film was quite fun for 1hr and for me, the last 10 mins really let the film down. This does, however, have a good user rating so maybe I am alone in my opinion.<br/><br/>In all, it wasn't a bad film but it wasn't particularly good. When it was good it was very good, but that wasn't often enough."
"trashgang","5","2","4","19 August 2008"," Is this worth a hype?
","After seeing the trailer for this flick we thought it was worth waiting for. At last, available here in Belgium but what a disappointment it was. Knowing the director for the sublime 'Alias' this flick is just one to see and to forget. It starts out fine by getting to understand the individuals and suddenly hell breaks out. After the first attack of the monster a cellphone is ringing and suddenly it's all about romantic. It made me think of that other crap 'Godzilla the remake'. there is no gore let's even say any suspense in this flick. It's normal that this one will be compared with Blair Witch but BWP was at least creepy. I understand that in the US people were talking about the attack on NY remembering 9/11. I'm glad that I have seen the movie but will not buy it and will never have any moment of wanting to see it again. And knowing that they are talking about Cloverfield 2 only makes me shiver, no thanks"
"tecxx","10","2","4","1 June 2008"," An extraordinary intelligent movie experience
","Whow - This is one of the best monster/sci-fi movies i've seen in the past. I've only seen the trailer beforehand and all I knew was: big monster - large explosions - city gets destroyed. Perfect, exactly my kind of flick - no expectations, just the usual action movie. <br/><br/>I was so wrong.<br/><br/>The ""first-person-view"" makes the entire experience feel very realistic and believable, especially with all the cuts at the right moments and the sporadic ""backflashes"" to the content that was already on-tape of the camera. The constant cam shaking, especially when people start to run for their life, totally adds up to the ""realism"" this movie tries to screen. You wouldn't stand still to film burning cars flying through the air, would you? Every now and then, small, little things are added in the background that you hardly notice the first time watching, but they add just another layer of realism. News channels start reporting on the current events, military aircraft fly by, sirens start to announce the state of emergency etc. The producers thought of countless things that would happen in real life - and you sit there and feel like you're in the middle of the story and everything is happening just around you. right now.<br/><br/>The sounds fit perfectly and are very realistic, and .... there is no music. seriously, i didn't even notice there's no music until i read similar comments here on IMDb. Added on top: special effects that look so real you won't even notice they're ""special effects"" - and at some point you start to wonder if maybe, just maybe, this did happen for real and you're watching *real* footage from a video camera.<br/><br/>Finally, not everything in this movie is being explained, like, where did the monster come from or what happens after the end of the film? I feel sorry for you people who hate this movie because of this, but thats the point where you usually start using your imagination. <br/><br/>Summed up, this movie is so well done. Contrary to the ""low quality hand-held-camera point of view""-filming style this is 100% intelligent cinema entertainment. Recommended!"

","I liked this! Cloverfield is basically Godzilla for the 21st century. There is no plot except for: Alien monster destroys New York and people freak out.<br/><br/>The movie lives of the way it's shot. The hand-held camera IS the movie. We've seen the carnage before, the monsters, the battles, the turmoil ... just never from this perspective. It works great! (Although it's not the reinvention of the wheel that J.J.Abrams wants us to believe - Blair Witch Project ... hello?) There is nothing much to judge ""objectively"". The camera-work inherently belittles any acting performance, since there's rarely a steady shot of any actor. The same goes for the special effects or the directing of crowd sequences, etc. But at the end of it all, experienced through the shaky first person perspective, the movie feels sufficiently realistic.<br/><br/>The only thing that I didn't like was the voice of the camera man Hud. He annoyed me. His comments were off and people mostly ignored him (rightfully so).<br/><br/>I'm giving it 8/10."
"laymonite-2","8","2","4","1 May 2008"," Much better than I expected!
","I had heard various things about this, but not much. That it ghoulishly used the NYC terrorist attacks to it's advantage. That it was pointless because it didn't explain anything.<br/><br/>Imagine if someone told you there was a film where a giant monster levelled NYC and it was really scary. You'd laugh right? Imagine those old Godzilla films with a man in a rubber suit and it all caused by radiation.<br/><br/>Now imagine watching the film and actually finding it a serious and scary horror film. Told from the point of view of the people being stomped on by Godzilla in an ultra realistic style. With friends and family and real fears. Imagine there IS no explanation for this. It's not a big rubber T-Rex - it's something slimily organic and alien. You are facing death at every turn, no-one knows what it is, nothing is working, society is effectively destroyed as far as you can see and people are dying all around you -it's real. This is what this film achieves.<br/><br/>I found the film personally all the more satisfying for not explaining anything. Moving from this or explaining the monster would have distanced viewers from the realism the film had established, to the extent of the whole film supposedly being filmed on a single camcorder by people living through the event.<br/><br/>This is from the makers of Lost, and of course a huge amount of speculation has appeared about almost everything in the film, including fake websites and violent fan arguments.<br/><br/>Just see the film Godzilla shouold have been or may have seemed to audiences 50 years ago, vastly improved.."
"brando647","8","2","4","1 May 2008"," ""People need to see this, you know...""
","When I first saw the teaser trailer for this movie in the summer of 2007, I was psyched. The image of the Statue of Liberty's head being tossed across Manhatten to land in the streets was enough to hook me. I had to know what it was that was tearing New York to shreds. When I finally got to see the film in mid-January 2008, I felt it lived up to the months of hype surrounding it. The movie puts a new spin on an old concept: it's your usual monster movie with a giant creature stomping through New York but it's told from the perspective of a group of people caught in the middle.<br/><br/>Some people are turned off by this film because it's shot entirely from the perspective of a home video camera carried by one of the characters, Hud (probably my favorite character, played by T.J. Miller). As a result of this odd style, the camera is frequently shaky and sometimes disorienting. People with motion sickness should probably just steer clear (or invest in some Dramamine). For those without inner ear issues, it's worth checking out. The home camera POV places you right in the middle of the action, as if you were running right there with them. We see the destruction and, more importantly, the creature from their perspective. At first, we're only treated to short glimpses of the creature...a tail here, a foot there. As the film progresses, we get to see more and more.<br/><br/>I personally thought this movie was awesome (even better once it hit DVD...seems easier to watch on the small screen). The unknown actors that were cast in this movie do a great job, giving you reasons to hope they don't end up creature-fodder. The creature is probably the coolest monster to come out of American cinema in years (and it's tons better than that Godzilla fiasco from the 90's). The somber ending (which I won't go into detail on) leaves you wanting more, though not in a bad way. I just wished the movie was longer; the 85 minute running time flies by. The movie take a little while to get into the meat of the action but it soars by when it finally does."
"fwomp","8","2","4","1 May 2008"," Godzilla Meets The Blair Witch Project? Sorta...
","It's always nice to see someone in Hollywood take chances and move outside normal filming practices. Although CLOVERFIELD isn't wholly original, it does have an original feel thanks to the incredibly myopic look the audience gets via its length through one camera lens.<br/><br/>Labeled as GODZILLA meets THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, Cloverfield definitely incorporates portions of both but comes out the other end as its own animal.<br/><br/>The myopic view was seen, as stated earlier, in The Blair Witch Project, which had a hand-held camera being buoyed around by an amateur film maker, allowing the viewer to get up-close and personal with the story. With Cloverfield, we get the same experience but with a bit more high-tech status along the way. New York skyscrapers crumble and explode. The head of lady liberty comes hurtling down the street. The Brooklyn Bridge gets twisted and ripped apart like tissue paper. And the ""monster"" causing all this ...well ...you'll have to see that for yourself. I will say, however, that it was nice to only get glimpses of the creature and its 'offspring' since that is the way it would truly happen if viewed through one person's eyes.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the Godzilla aspects of the film. Japan has that monster, and J.J. Abrams (LOST) gives us a new American one here. Unique is size, shape, and color, this new beast is just as tough to kill as Godzilla and has many smaller monsters (about the size of a regular dog) that it sheds like lice. And you don't want to get bitten by one of these lice; trust me! The more unique and intriguing thing about this new creature is that we know nothing about it since the story is all coming from one herky-jerky camera lens. Alien? Radioactive giant? Government experiment gone wrong? Who knows. This added to the realism of the story.<br/><br/>Although I understand the need for character development, I felt that the opening 20 minutes dragged on a bit too long. The love story between Jason (Mike Vogel, RUMOR HAS IT) and Beth (Odette Yustman, TRANSFORMERS) added to the story in the end but was overly forced upon us in the beginning (""We get it! They're in love already!"") Two other notable items must be mentioned. The first is the realism of the camera movements and the klutzy guy who carries it named Hudd (comedian T.J. Miller). Although why he continued to carry it sometimes bordered on ludicrous, his dopey demeanor helped make this easier to swallow. The second item is the sound quality. Absolutely amazing! The thumps, bumps, and explosions were an awesome thing to hear, and the dolby digital sound quality really shone through.<br/><br/>Certainly something to watch on a big screen TV with a great sound system. This one is sure to please monster movie afficionados."

"northwatuppa","5","2","4","26 April 2008"," viewer alert: crazy making camera work, otherwise good creature feature
","I am writing this review specifically to alert viewers who might not yet be aware of the camera work in this film. If you know about that and don't care, you needn't read what I have to say.<br/><br/>First, camera work aside, it is a fresh, engaging, well-done creature feature. I can find no fault with the script, the directing, the f/x, or anything like that. I kind of enjoyed that part of it.<br/><br/>BUT this film takes shaky cam to a new, nauseating level--to an insane level. The film is photographed ENTIRELY, BEGINNING TO END, as if it were shot using a hand held, consumer quality, video camera by someone who has never, or hardly ever, used a video camera before and who is, once the creature shows up, running and jumping for his life most of the time. The camera *almost* never stops moving and a lot of that time it is moving *wildly*. Once things get moving in the film, you almost never see more than a split second of still footage at a stretch.<br/><br/>And it isn't just that. They keep in all of the weird, random, accidental junk shots--pants legs, shoes, blank walls, stair steps, railings, etc., etc., etc., that most people would edit out of their home movies.<br/><br/>They might as well have suspended the camera from a slinky and bounced it off the floor and walls of the set. Let's just say I spent a lot of time wishing the kid with the camera would get killed so the picture would stop jumping around. It about made me seasick, literally.<br/><br/>Now, if you really don't mind that, if you really aren't expecting an actual movie with actual cinematography and professional-style camera work, where you can kind of see what is happening and absorb the acting and the characters and the f/x and kind of zone out and enjoy the mayhem and the weirdness ... if that isn't what you are looking for, then this film's for you. However, if crazy-super-jumpy camera work ins't your cup of tea, then take a pass on this one."

The only thing this movie had in common with it was all filmed on a hand-held camera, except Cloverfield did a a lot better job of it. The camera was less jerky than ""The Bourne Supremacy"", so I'd question if many of those panning it even really watched it.

The special effects are pretty cool however I would liked to have seen more of the monster getting hammered by the bombers and less of the yuppie kids crying.

","First of all, many many people bashed this movie for its ""cheap"" cinematography and acting. Coming into it, I honestly did not have very high expectations. But I must say, this is easily one of the most satisfying films I have seen this year. The camera work gave a sense of immediacy and suspense that was not present in the Blair Witch Project, which this film is often compared to, and the characters seemed pretty real and easy to identify with. I am admittedly not an Abrams fan, but this is a cut above his usual work. The special effects were excellent, the characters were pretty believable (despite several disappointing, cheezy lines), and the experience itself was totally thrilling. With Juno, the Coen Brothers, and Jesse James, this was a great year for cinema, but I definitely think Cloverfield is a film that should not be overlooked."

","The special effects are good and to some extend, in at least some of the scenes the whole thing seem almost authentic.<br/><br/>Apart from that, there's nothing new or special, it's a ""godzilla"" story where you hardly see ""godzilla"" or what actually happens to anything or anyone.<br/><br/>Most of the time you can't see what's going on as you mainly see sidewalk, asphalt, sky or a closeup of a wall or some other undefinable object.<br/><br/>Mostly it's accompanied by a lot of noise and screaming people, making it all confusing and pointless.<br/><br/>The ending is totally unsatisfying and inconclusive, this movie could as well start where it ends and vice versa.<br/><br/>All in all the only thing on the DVD that is worth watching is the ""Clover fun"" found under ""Special features"", the rest is a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Also the illusion that the whole thing is captured by a hand-held camera soon comes to an end, the guy who gets the camera is rather tall compared to everyone else, however the camera captures way shorter people at neck-height, pretty uncommon for the average Joe to use a camera like that, most people hold a camera in front of their face and not in front of their chest.<br/><br/>In addition the sound is way too dynamic and well defined to be captured with a consumer video camera, it lacks the more tiny and harsh sound and also phaser and flanger effect.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a mix of flaws and lack of substance, totally disappointing in every possible way.."

","Cloverfield is in my opinion a fairly good movie. Although the plot might suggest i godzilla rip-off, godzilla and cloverfield differ, and in a good way. The plot and production is in many ways richer and much better than godzilla, from my point of view. However, it is not hard to find elements to put my finger on. The camera work, is of the same type as in blair witch. Thus all footage is from a hand-held camera, and based on the perspective of one of the characters. This does not have to be a bad thing BUT, the main camera guy is a total nut job! He cant spend 5 seconds without whining or throwing stupid comments about EVERYTHING. The writers tries to legitimize this f.... up idea by introducing punchlines and apparently funny comments. It is hard to watch the movie, when after 15 minutes you hate the camera-guy with all your guts. I spent most of the movie thinking, pleas let this dork be whacked ... pleas let this dork be whacked. Summarized: Camera-freak spoils the capturing of cloverfield, which by many means has great potential"

Godzilla, King Kong, Independence Day...you've seen it all before the list could go on and on and you would agree once/if you watch this movie that it really was a waste of your hour and a half, definitely a waste of movie makers money, although i'm sure they made a buck on the hype. my rating is a 1 probably a bit harsh but mainly because all through the movie i was waiting for something interesting to happen. might scare small babies and sensitive children!!! definitely not one for a date when you want her to grab you! perhaps you would have better luck scaring her with the Simpsons Movie.

","The most stupid movie I've seen recently. It is like you start watching a really good movie but not from the start (you just drop in the middle) and before anything starts to make any sense power is down and you never see the end. The worse 70 min (!!!) in cinema ever (even Golden compass is better!!!). I don't mind camera shake or things like that but there is no story, no end, no explanation (government experiment!!!)no nothing... The text is 75%: Oh my God!, Oh God!, God,look at that! God this, God that. A lot of screaming an running away, the army is firing at the thing that is obviously from flesh and nothing gets through. In ""Independence day"" it is at least explained why the rockets don't work.

","Something is happening in escapist genre film-making, can you feel it? My zeitgeist gland started to vomit chemical nausea into my body twice recently and the reasons are obvious  like you my friend. It's this notion that escapist genre fare is starting to appropriate the language of cultural trauma in order to entertain us and a new kind of blockbuster is the by-product  a style in its infancy that is flirting with immorality. This is the kind of flirting that unchecked can lead to a violation of the audience and what it understands to be normal in terms of how it should get it rocks off. Be careful says I because like a dirty old uncle that whips out the little gentleman for his unsuspecting niece, the consequences are a potential warping of what we consider to be harmless fun  something David Director and Sidney Scribe must ultimately take responsibility for.<br/><br/>Rambo was at it recently, hijacking Spielberg's D-Day realism approach from Saving Private Ryan to murder the Burmese Militia. In Spielberg's film the technique had been used to strip warfare of its Technicolor entertainment value and give the battle scenes an unsentimental air of reportage. Stallone reversed this idea by applying the same tools to sate the blood lust of his seen it all before ghoulish adolescent audience  a corruption of the original style. What used to be fun about genre movies with high death rates and judicious dollops of wanton destruction is that it was escapism  larger than life, utterly ridiculous and therefore completely safe to enjoy.<br/><br/>Cloverfield may be a better film than Rambo but it uses the same methodology to get it jollies. Here its 9/11 that gets plundered to add an uncomfortable real world sensibility to the old monster on the rampage movie. Filmed from the perspective of a single camcorder, events unfold in fits and shaky hand held starts with the beast periodically glimpsed whenever the terrified documentarian gets the chance. The characters aren't up to much and are irrelevant in any event but their panic feels genuine enough and its in these scenes of fleeing, glancing upward to see a building topple and the like that déjà vu hits you in a very unpleasant way. One scene in particular  the collapse of a apartment block and the unfolding dust cloud is a direct lift from Al-Queda's greatest hits. This of course is a very effective device to make something absurd genuinely mortifying but when popular entertainment starts to play on its audience's real fears by appealing to direct experience rather than the base instincts that traditionally were its bread and butter (you didn't need to have seen real footage of a shark eat a man to buy into Jaws  the premise was primal in its efficacy) then arguably a line has been crossed. There's no doubting the filmmakers exploitative glee here or the skill in which the enveloping disaster is juxtaposed with the couple's day out recorded on the same tape and occasionally 'cut' to in the gaps in recording, to produce emotional punch but there's an air of cynicism about the execution. Fun doesn't seem well, fun any more."

","I took my 15 year old cousin to see this. He loved it. He reasoned that because the effects and the cinematography were good, the film must be good too. The cinematography wasn't actually that good and the CGI was too stylised. When the monster first started to rampage through the city they stole their ideas from the news coverage of 9/11. This was cheap in my opinion.<br/><br/>I couldn't care less if the characters lived or died and I was glad to see the end of the guy holding the camera. In fact, it wasn't until the brother died on the bridge that I realised these were two different people, so insipid was the relationship. Wasn't the girl from the video already at the party? Everyone looked the same and the film was too weak to tell what was going on.<br/><br/>Ho hum."

"lotus_chief","6","2","4","12 February 2008"," A good concept that ultimately fails..a letdown
","As like most people, I was intrigued to see 'Cloverfield', mainly because I wanted to see what was causing all the havoc in the preview. After finally watching the movie, unfortunately, I still can't tell you. What does that tell you? This is one of those movies where you just happen to drop in on an event of some kind and then decide to leave at some point. Things just happen, and then it's over. There's no explanation whatsoever as to what the monster is, where it came from, how it 'works' and what exactly happened in the end. We barely see it, which is inexcusable considering we've actually WATCHED (what we COULD watch anyway) the movie at this point. I could only guess that the military bombed the city but there's no indication as to whether or not the monster was actually killed. The shaky POV camera is a cool concept; it's creative.I could really appreciate the approach they were attempting. However, at some point it must be remembered that the audience is attempting to WATCH a movie, and it was damn near impossible to do so. There was just TOO MUCH movement with the camera that most of the time you couldn't tell what was going on.and after a while the whole shakiness of it all got pretty annoying. Again, I see where they were trying to go with this, but the audience has to make some sort of sense of what's going on, or else what's the point? I don't know if Marlena suffered from 'Alien fate' and a baby monster ripped through her, or if the soldiers actually put her out of her misery after realizing she was bitten.with only one viewing I thought it was the latter, but who knows? Speaking of the characters, they were all pretty annoying; especially the 'cameraman', Hud. His job, along with cameraman, was to provide comic relief throughout; but he's not funny at all and is just a stupid idiot. We're forced to listen to him say the most asinine things and repeat them 20 times. After a while I said to myself, 'enough already, shut up and run!' I really wasn't sorry for him in the end. We get a pretty cool close-up of the monster before he does away with one of the characters, but again, we're still left in the dark as to what it is exactly. Throughout the movie we get bits and pieces of it, never getting a definitive shot of it.<br/><br/>Another thing, how in the hell did that camera make it through the film? It should have been destroyed either by being dropped as many times as it was or, and this is much more likely, the battery dying.HELLOOOO!!!! There is no way that camera would've lasted through all of these occurrences. Also, maybe I'm behind the times, but.since when did video cameras have night vision? Anyway, the audience is left with as many questions as it had when it first saw the teaser trailer with explosions and the head of the Statue of Liberty (poor woman) flying through the air; with no movie title or nothing. HUGE letdown if you ask me. I'll admit, it all came off as pretty realistic due to the shaky camera technique, but that only led to the huge downside of the audience essentially not being able to watch the movie. I was really into it.but I was waiting for some answers and didn't get any. 'Cloverfield' had GREAT potential, but fails in the end.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Expect a warning outside your cinema screen that this movie has bad camera work. All recorded on a hand held device. Much worse than the Bourne Ultimatum.

Measure this alongside the fact that you hardly ever get to see the big monster and it's a crappy love story that just seems unbelievable and fake trash.<br/><br/>I love Sci-fi and love stories and lots and lots of movies, but I hate this. I do hope when Abrams releases Star Trek that it isn't like this.

"alicia-154","2","2","4","12 February 2008"," Unrealistic
","Monster attacks New York! Could a movie with such promise fail to deliver? Sadly yes.<br/><br/>I was expecting to see a scary monster, to be killed by the suspense and to be entertained by cool special effects. <br/><br/>Like many others I was let down. It could have been as great as Alien, Final destination or Predator. But it wasn't.<br/><br/>To sum my impressions up:<br/><br/>The shaky shots quickly became aggravating. The 20 minute character-introduction party scene was fully wasted. <br/><br/>The acting was terrible, the characters wholly forgettable. You really did not care who died and who survived. You even wish you saw more of their gory demise. <br/><br/>Logical reactions in the movie are extremely rare, if not non-existent. No woman (or man?) I know would ever agree to go through a dark tunnel of indeterminate length. After being attacked, they did not look for anything to defend themselves like a weapon (even though they had just beaten off the baby monsters with conveniently-placed bludgers) they did not look for a flashlight, food, drink, proper bandages for their wounds, painkillers, nada. <br/><br/>Not to mention the fact that no cell phone network would EVER continue working after such an attack. Was the scene where the protagonist (the name strangely escapes me) is on the phone with his mother really necessary? I think not. The Hud character developed some mean camera skills after 10 minutes! And, do you really want me to believe that they climbed 57 or how ever many flights of stairs. Beth can run normally with a gaping presumably painful wound in her chest? You have GOT to be kidding.<br/><br/>And of course, among other questions, how did Beth make it back to her flat so quickly after leaving the party? And NO I would have not gone back for her either. Why did the monster eat people? Where were the dead bodies among the debris? SO much battery in that camera. This is so unrealistic. Am I the only one who found it strange that the monster always appeared in the same place the characters were? <br/><br/>Believe me, you'll be disappointed. No suspense whatsoever, you knew what was coming and wasn't too sure you cared about seeing it happening.<br/><br/>I'll give the movie 1 star for a promising idea and another star for the shot of the statue of liberty's head on the street. And that's being generous."
"simonp81","7","2","4","11 February 2008"," Does what it's doing well, but what the hell IS it doing?
","Went to see this film last night with almost zero idea of what to expect, and ended up enjoying it. It's certainly like nothing I've seen before, and I think that the filmmakers pulled it of well. Experiencing events as the main characters do, not having any extra knowledge to them, really sucks you into the proceedings, disorientates you, and leaves you gasping for explanations... which unfortunately, you never get! <br/><br/>In parts the film is certainly an awesome experience. The effects combined with the direction of events on screen lead to some pretty intense spectacle (reminds me of some of the better video games coming out at the moment, which really make you feel like your right in the middle of some unbelievable action). The sound effects are brilliant, and definitely worthy of special attention. The ominous thumps and screams of the main monster at the start of the action, the sound of the cables on the bridge coming loose, the intensity of the marines gunfire, are a few of the noises used to set the scene and the mood.<br/><br/>I thought that the film starts well, brings you into what should be a completely unbelievable world excellently, and then goes from strength to strength for the first half or so (up till about the point they find Beth). Then like so many films with good set-ups, it all falls apart ""like a Chinese motorcycle"". The last half hour is COMPLETE GARBAGE. A few predictable, clichéd moments linked by running, explosions and ""I love yous"". While incredible sights, sounds and set-pieces, are what I remember from the beginning/middle of the film, when I think back to the end of the film, it's stupid, predictable, pointless moments trying to give the film some drama and emotion and failing terribly; i.e., finding the helicopter out of the blue, the monster taking the helicopter out with wild lunge, Hud getting some very personal treatment, and the truly awful, awful ending (""Oh I love you really""... KABOOM! - Death).<br/><br/>Hats off to the filmmakers though for trying something differently. Also, you've got to admire the technicalities of the film. However, it's got no substance, no intellectual stimulation, and no soul. Still, if you want to go ""ooohh...aaahh"" for an hour and then marvel at some truly terrible Hollywood plot twists/ending, then give it a go! 7/10"

Also how that monster managed to jump up... right for that helicopter which didn't even fire one shot at it, why was a rescue helicopter being flown so close to the action, no idea...<br/><br/>No story line... no background on monster, monster was invincible, took 100's of bombs and bullets and it kept on going yet his little ""terrible things"" were hurt by a kick from a person. Pointless film, monster invincible which means it probably destroyed everyone on Earth... and that's it The End... or considering someone found their camera the monster died... how?? no idea, Atomic Bomb?? but then the camera wouldn't work or it would have been destroyed, specially by EMP effect... so their film would have never been seen, OH I am soo stupid, I forgot the camera was also invincible and had it's own nuclear battery (note to self, find out what camera that was and get one).

"bluenautica","6","2","4","6 February 2008"," Good movie overall but bad start and ending
","I would've given this movie a better rating if it didn't put me to sleep in the beginning. I really think that the director was trying to make it more personal but that could've been done in less time. Let's be realistic (I know it's only a movie, and a sci-fi at that, but still), they definitely dragged the beginning out a bit too much.<br/><br/>Everything after the first 15 minutes was awesome. The camera man was a kind of annoying, but most people who love to film everything are. And even though most of us would've dropped that camera and just did what we had to do to survive, again this is just a movie and it was something different. Although everybody says it gave them a ""Blair Witch"" effect. I didn't think that at all. The cinematography was way better and the graphics were amazing. It had me believing that Manhattan was really under chaos.<br/><br/>The little monsters were kind of cool, but why were they coming out of the big one, that really didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>I like that the main character in the film was trying to find a girl; it gave it a love story in the middle of pandemonium. But, the end really didn't leave me satisfied. Now if they have plans to do a sequel and explain some of the things that we saw and then eventually defeat the monster, maybe then I would get some satisfaction. I can imagine that would be hard to do, unless they can come up with a twist to it all and be able to make another hour and a half of viewable footage. I don't see that happening because this movie felt really short. It just ended with them under the bridge and you don't even know if they survive.<br/><br/>So with the first 15 minutes being a total bore, and the end just abruptly ending (too short in my opinion), the movie was pretty good. I suggest seeing it for the 1 hour of good footage, unless you don't like watching a movie in POV style. And be aware of the first 15 minutes of boredom."
"sabenge","1","2","4","6 February 2008"," What to say, what to say...
","Here goes...<br/><br/>First and foremost, anything that relies on a gimmick as a major selling point is normally nothing more than a ploy. I'm referring to both the filming and marketing style.<br/><br/>The necessity of the party scene made sense. The introduction of the protagonists. Although, the characters offered the audience almost no opportunity to empathize or even understand who they were or how they felt. Instead, we were treated to people who had no real problems. They had no depth. If they intentionally weren't supposed to have depth, that would mean that the central focus of the movie would be on the monster as it is the other medium of expression. This can't be true, though, as the monster receives very little screen time and no back story.<br/><br/>The beginning shows the time stamp in the lower left hand corner. This only reoccurs as the snippets of Rob and Beth's relationship are shown. The rest of the film doesn't have this time stamp. Most, if not all camcorders, automatically show this unless the feature is turned off. Since this was turned on the last time the camcorder was used, I doubt it was turned off. It's appearance throughout the film, I'm sure, may have been offsetting, but it would fit in with the motif the director was going for and dispel some of the ambiguity that plagues the film.<br/><br/>The director seemed like he wanted to remind people that it was filmed with a hand-held camera at times. The camera would shake excessively for almost no reason.<br/><br/>Rob is obviously no older than 28. To get promoted to VP of a company is more than impressive (even more far-fetched) at this age.<br/><br/>Some people try to defend this movie based on the claim that it is original, unlike the majority of Hollywood films that have been made recently. Boy falls in love with Girl. Boy and Girl have a falling out. Boy is confronted with own mortality and loss. Boy feels stronger than ever about Girl. Boy saves Girl. Boy and Girl confess their love for each other. I rest my case.<br/><br/>The cameraman constantly repeats the same things over and over.<br/><br/>The monster hadn't been to the area where Beth lived when Rob arrived to save her. If it had, the destruction would have been greater. How then, did one building fall to the side to be braced by another building? If the resulting tremors of the monster's actions caused this, isn't it then logical that the second building would have fallen as well? If the building lost the structural integrity at it's base to fall over in the first place, it would have toppled over entirely regardless of the bracing affect of the second building. Of course, this is all hypothetical.<br/><br/>Beth gets impaled, yet can run around once they get out of the building. Adrenaline can only do so much, and can't logically be used as an excuse as she would have been nauseous from blood loss.<br/><br/>The sound effects made by the spawn creatures were laughable at best. Maybe they were meant to be a throwback to older science fiction films and not a theft of them.<br/><br/>When Hud goes to retrieve the camera after miraculously surviving the helicopter crash, the monster ""sneaks up on him"". To make matters more confusing, all but Hud's head is devoured by a monster that is the size of a skyscraper while Rob and Beth are able to run up and get the camera, that is unscathed, without being touched.<br/><br/>As for the claims of this being an allegory for the 9/11 attacks, that would have to imply that the writer has the capacity to understand such complex ideas as art representing life. This claim is as dumb as the woman who made a list of songs that have no subtextual correlation to anti-American values or in most cases anything violent and having them banned because she believed they reminded victims of the attack.<br/><br/>This list merely scratches the surface of a film that condemned itself to a sub-par story by it's own faulty mechanisms. The use of the first person POV limits the story more than forwards it. The Hitchcock idea of letting the mind draw it's own conclusions leaves this movie desperately wanting. I can formulate some sort of idea as to why the bites from the seedlings cause a person to ""explode."" I can understand why Rob decided to save Beth. I can even understand why the other three characters decided to go with him, but every explanation for every event throughout the entire film seems entirely too convenient."

","This movie had great suspense, I liked the characters, was a lot of fun and really had you wanting to see how it would end. Apparently the writers weren't sure either. I left feeling they forgot to add on the last five minutes of the movie. I would recommend waiting for the DVD. Of course, the filming was in the documentary, Blair Witch style and a little shaky at times. At first I was worried about this because of other comments, but I got used to it. It was a really great way to treat a monster movie, letting you get little glimpses but not a real great look for a long time. Totally fresh for the presentation of the story, but like I said, it didn't give a resolution in the end. A real disappointment, because I was rooting for it with the great story."

","The film ""Cloverfield"" seems to have a polarizing affect on most; people tend to love or hate it. Reading through the comments and reviews the past week, it seems that a lot of the folks who love it made up their mind before they even saw it. The folks who hate it all seem to list the same reasons such as the motion of the hand held camera, the ending, the lack of any sort of exposition, or elements they found improbable (i.e. surviving a helicopter crash, the battery life of the camcorder, or the survival of the video after the bombing). I didn't have a problem suspending disbelief for most of the film. I found most of it quite believable save for one element. The character Hud is videotaping the exploit because he feels it is important and people will need to see it later. This makes sense. The movie took place over a 7 to 9 hour period with Hud turning the camera off and on during this period and actually only recording less than 90 minutes of the experience. Apparently, nothing important happens at any time when the camera is shut off and the camera is shut off 90% of the time. And the camera is always on BEFORE something important to the story happens. I found this form of narrative extremely forced and felt it didn't work. Although I appreciate the effort to try something different, it isn't really original as it had been done in ""Blair Witch Project"". On the other hand, I found the novel way they mixed what was already recorded on the tape and the events being recorded over it to be extremely clever and interesting. That's the highest praise I can give the film, though. I thought most of it was a little dull and, being a fan of the genre, was really disappointed with it. It's understandable how the ending frustrates so many but most will realize how it will end at the beginning of the movie. So I'm one of the few who neither hated it or loved it. It's somewhere in the middle."

","This movie is very highly rated here at IMDb, so I guess I'm just out of the loop. Listen I'm not labeling the movie as ""bad"" I'm just acknowledging the fact I personally no longer am on board with what most voters here at IMDb think. The numbers here indicate that most people enjoyed this movie and found it refreshing. I didn't dislike the movie but I would not rate it highly, something like a 5.<br/><br/>I think it was directed well, and by that I mean, they set out with an objective and it was executed probably exactly like the blueprint they had. But the problem was the blueprint i.e., the script. That first 20 minutes of setup was so typical. This guy wrote Felicity and it felt like Felicity. Like any one of those WB, then UPN, then CW shows. It had all that typical ""young people"" dialog that's a staple of Hollywood's version of young people.<br/><br/>I had no care for any of those people or their plight. I just watched them do stuff. It's hard to explain what's missing in the writing that makes that happen. But I think if none of the characters on screen care about a character then I don't care. And the people in this movie who did care about each other either weren't in the film at the same time OR if there were on screen together it was during a fight with each other. That's just a guess, but to reiterate; I didn't care about any of these people. And so much of the plot was predictable from my viewpoint. For exampleÂ…<br/><br/>Who didn't think that the guy who rejected the camera would end up holding onto it for dear life? Who didn't think that the minute they got on that bridge the bridge was a goner? Who didn't think the minute they entered that tunnel you'd get monsters? Who didn't think the minute the girl got bit that it would end badly? Who didn't think the girl would be found but it wouldn't be a happy resolution?"

"dfranzen70","3","2","4","19 January 2008"," ""Amateur"" film looks like a crappy home movie
","Some people may remember the heady days of 1999, when there was slow Internet hype of a low-budget first offering by two unknown filmmakers named Sanchez and Myrick. When it first hit theaters, The Blair Witch Project, was a welcome change from the almost-antiseptic approach that directors were taking to movies; most scary action movies seemed almost too stagy, too unreal, to implausible. Blair Witch used a hand-held camera and was marketed as lost, recovered footage of an experience in the woods gone awry.<br/><br/>Here in 2008, though, the anarchic, subversive idea of hand-held, intentionally amateur cinematography is almost passe', isn't it? Since 1999, audiences have seen reality television shows and gritty, dirt-in-your-face movies that aim for an ultrareal effect; consequently, the novelty has worn off. We're no longer amused by footage we could have shot ourselves, and we're no longer automatically terrified when something scary is filmed with a camcorder.<br/><br/>In Cloverfield, a group of young people is throwing a going-away party in New York City for one of their own; Rob, who is assuming a high-paying job in Japan. Naturally, one of his best friends, Hud, videotapes the party, asking various guests to offer testimonials to Rob, sort of as one would do at a wedding reception. Then BOOM, there's a loud explosion, and the guests flip on the TV - looks like a giant something or other is attacking the city.<br/><br/>Because everything is seen through the camcorder that Hud is lugging around, we're supposed to feel a kinship with these pretty twentysomethings, although to be frank they look and act a little more like teenagers. Using Hud's camera, director Matt Reeves introduces us to a few characters who may or may not make it through to the end of the film. We're told very little about them, but it's quickly evident that the people on whom the camera does linger will be characters we'll follow after the tragedy strikes.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the monster is hardly seen at all, really just in shadows and the like, until near the very end of the movie, and no explanation is offered as to where it came from. The result of this, though, is that the focus is shifted to the game effort put forth by our survivors as they attempt an inexplicably dumb quest. The instant they decide that's what they're gonna do, you start guessing which of them will be killed off.<br/><br/>At any rate, such a focus means that it's pretty important that the actors themselves turn in strong, evocative performances, and no one here does. The impression one gets is that the actors were hired mainly because they weren't supertalented thespians, that producer J.J. Abrams was going for amateur-looking acting to go along with the amateur-looking camera-work. I get that, I really do, it's just that watching a 90-minute home movie isn't all that interesting when you can tell a lot of the special effects were done with CGI.<br/><br/>This movie represents some of the worst aspects of cinema verite. The haphazard, slapdash camera-work is, of course, how you or I might use a camcorder, so it's realistic; on the other hand, most people don't want to watch a homemade film to which they have no connection. If my friends had made this, I might have been into it a bit more, but the film never engages its audience. (The party is an obvious contrivance to attempt to engage us, but it just shows me a bunch of pretty young people acting like doofuses.) And because there are all of these zooms to the left and right and up and down and whoops here we go, falling and gasping, it's tough to make sense of what's going on. Sure, I know, that's how the characters feel, too - what's attacking us? Where should we go? What should we do? - but I am not the characters, and in this case, seeing things through their eyes just makes me dizzy and not care about them much at all.<br/><br/>And that, dear friends, is the crux of the problem. The movie wants you to be right down there in the trenches with the characters, but to do that it's got to make you like the characters, root for them in some way, and it just plain fails to do so. Instead, we're treated to nearly 90 minutes of people running here and there and getting attacked by who knows what, and so forth (there are a LOT of shots of feet, as Hud's camera is pointed straight down a lot of the time). To put it simply, it's like watching any other loud, dumb action movie, only instead of excellent camera angles and world-class cinematography that grabs you by the throat and never lets go, you get some brain-damaged diphthong toting a home video camera like it's 1990 and he's at his first no-adults party.<br/><br/>I initially thought that the long buildup to the monster attack itself was a bad idea in itself; we get endless shots of the party and the people in it, merely for exposition and empathy. ""Bring on the monster!"" I shouted, internally. And then the attack comes, and for the rest of the film you feel like you're on a roller coaster ride after having eaten fourteen hot dogs.<br/><br/>Cloverfield isn't worth the endless, smug, metahype it generated for itself leading up to its release. It means to be edgy and groundbreaking but winds up being tired and played out. The monster does look pretty cool, and some of the stunts are worth watching, and there are some genuine scares, but overall it misses its mark by quite a bit. The rolling head of the Statue of Liberty is clever, but that's about it for wit."
"ehopkins9384","5","2","4","21 January 2008"," Definitely not the best.
","I'm all about a fun movie that is intense and has me on the edge of my seat, which it was. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie and it is pretty significant, is that there was a critical lack of information. I like to know what happens before the conflict, that way I have a better understanding of what is taking place. In this movie there is no information prior to the conflict. So in retrospect, the movie was great as far as effects and keeping me on the edge of my seat, but it also had me thinking, ""What the heck is going on and how did it all begin?"" Overall the movie was mediocre and I think it is safe to say it is definitely a rental. Save yourself some hard earned cash and wait to watch this film when it is most affordable."

"walkingwithprimeval","9","0","0","3 July 2020"," The Blair Witch Project for the kaiju community
","I'm pretty sure once Cloverfield was released, everyone who saw it thought that it would be the ""monster movie to end all monster movies"", what with it being so far-removed from the cliched-but-familiar norm of the traditional giant monster movie formula by having the unique distinction of it being a survival horror thriller shot entirely in a found-footage documentary style (a novelty which really got overused and outstayed its welcome, over the course of the 2010s decade). When I watched it for the first time on home video, I didn't really like it all that much (probably because the idea of a ""found-footage"" format was still a relatively new concept to me, at the time). But as the years have gone by, I now see it as revolutionary masterpiece that actually made the kaiju genre feel genuinely scary again, after having numerous child-friendly, entertaining Godzilla and Gamera movies.<br/><br/>I think the film perfectly captures that same chaotic sensibility of a tragic 9/11-type disaster, in which your irrational paranoia gets the better of you and you feel totally disoriented standing in a large crowd of panicking bystanders running for their lives (it really does put the audience's mind into that perspective, to see firsthand how the destruction events occurred from the point-of-view of the petrified onlookers). I'm only assuming that director Matt Reeves drew upon some inspiration for this from the real-life 9/11 terrorists attacks, kind of like how Ishiro Honda was inspired to make the original Godzilla after the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.<br/><br/>The filmmaker's made the smart decision to shoot the movie from a human's viewpoint with a handheld digital camera, as it makes the towering behemoth that's terrorising New York City seem more real and creates a foreboding mood (they use it to their maximum advantage). The most effective scenes where the film's ""shaky-cam"" cinematography looks best are when you're at ground-level looking up at the monstrous destruction or seeing it take place from a distance away, shrouded between the semi-demolished buildings. They also keep you in constant suspense by only giving brief glimpses of the creature's body (like an elbow here or a knee there), but they never relentlessly tease in the same way Gareth Edwards did with his murky Godzilla movie. And by the end of it all, there'll be a payoff that's been well worth the wait (""all good things come to those who wait"", as they say). Even the titular monster itself has an otherworldly design, making it totally alien in appearance.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, I want to address a couple of complaints that people bring up when discussing this film, with the first one being ""why do they still keep recording when a normal person would stop and put the camera down"". I think it's just imbedded in our human behaviour to be naturally curious about any and all strange stuff we come across and instinctively want to document it down by recording the shockingly catastrophic events we bear witness to. Then there's the central young adult characters who honestly, I thought were passably serviceable to the film's plot and I didn't find them to be anymore annoying than any other mindless partygoer characters you'd normally see in most horror flicks out there (besides, the camera guy did give us a good dose of some much-needed levity, which I found to be a tad funny at times).<br/><br/>Another pet peeve of mine is when dumb people complain that ""they didn't explain what the monster is or where it came from"" (I'm getting so sick of hearing people say that). This should in no way be the slightest bit of an issue, because we don't need to know! The more knowledgeable you are about something, results drastically in you becoming less and less scared of the thing in question because then, at that point, you'll understand the creature too well and it'll start to take the essence of fear away from it being a creepy spine-chilling, unexplained mystery (it's the simple, age-old ""fear of the unknown"", which in-turn leaves it up to your own wicked imagination to fill in the blanks as what you don't see is often more scarier than what's right in front of your eyes).<br/><br/>Without ruining what happens, this rollercoaster thrill ride of an immersive cinematic experience (let's face facts, the movie was always best seen on the big-screen in a cinema with a quality sound system) ends on an exceedingly haunting high note, with the only piece of musical score heard in the whole film played over the credits. Composer Michael Giacchino's eerily classical operatic soundtrack truly evokes an immensely strong sense of dreadful hopelessness (it helps amplify the grim tone).<br/><br/>Rather than putting a permanent end to this worn-out, tired genre for good and let it rest in the past, Cloverfield was so popular that it singlehandedly managed to revitalise the interest in giant monster movies for a new generation of younger fans (once again, history has repeated itself because this situation is exactly like what happened with Wes Craven's Scream and how that brought about a rejuvenation of sorts to the stale, monotonous slasher sub-genre of horror films during the late-1990s and early-2000, as they made a big come back after the first one's release in 1996)."

","""Cloverfield"" is a truly top-notch monster/horror film in the ""found footage"" genre, which means you're probably going to love it or hate it. I enjoy all kinds of films, although horror isn't my favorite film type. The biggest problem I had with the film was that the protagonists were a bunch of smug, spoiled, young, New York, hipsters. I never felt particularly emotionally invested in their fates, because in real life I tend to find these kinds of people to be aggravating and self-important. To my way of thinking, in this film a bunch of people at the top of the metaphorical food chain get to experience what it's like not to be at the actual bottom. Setting aside those admittedly snide remarks, I still found this film to be a compelling film experience, and, as an added bonus, the run-time was about perfect. So, if you're into the ""found footage"" stuff, you owe it to yourself to see this one, but if that kind of film only makes you nauseous, there's nothing here that you haven't seen in any number of monster movies before, just shot from a different perspective.

While I totally understand why people we're so hyped about this movie back in 2008 and why they ended it loving it (myself included but years after it's release), now that I rewatched it, I have to say that it has a lot of problems.
The main complaint that everyone has while watching a found footage is ""why the hell this guy keeps filming this? Drop the camera and run dude!"", and yes it applies for Cloverfield too. The character behind the camera has no real reason to keep filming, in some instances it's extremely ridiculous that the guy is still recording. And talking about that guy...the writter couldn't write him to be even more hateful? The guy is annoying at the point that you ask yourself if he has mental problems or something, even his so called bests friends can't stand him.
Now that I mention his friends, they're not that great either. The motivation of our main character is as thin as a piece of paper, even if I was in that situation I would not risk my life or the life of my brother and friends just to try to save my ex, I mean he really loved her because even when his brother dies he shows zero emotion. I blame that the characters are not so likable more on the part of the scrip that on the acting (except for you camera guy).
But if we ignore those aspects a little bit while watching the movie you have a very enjoyable monster feature. The design of the creature is very original and creative, they did an amazing job at giving America a monster that is not King Kong. The action scenes keep you interesting on what's going on, and cosidering that the movie is so short, you find yourself glued at the scream until the movie finishes.

","The thing with found footage films is that I tend to equate them with low budget attempts to break into the film and television industry - like with films such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity (though I'm not all that sure how well such directors go after that initial attempt - as far as I can see Hollywood is still very much a closed shop union town). This actually isn't the case with Cloverfield, since it actually appears to be a big budget monster movie (if $25 mill can be considered big budget), yet done in a way that happens to be a found footage film.
I guess such a style does add an extra dimension to what is going on. Basically we are watching events unfold from the point of view of a small number of characters, and particularly we really only know what they know. The film starts of, well, sort of strangely because we have the main character Rob, and this girl Jesse, as they go on a day trip of Coney Island. However, it turns out that somebody recorded over this for a going away party for Rob. Basically, he has just scored a job in Japan. There are a few other things going on, but a sudden shaking brings the party to an end, and then an explosion in the harbour brings about a new danger - a monster.
The rest of the film is them basically attempting to escape New York City - sort of. The Brooklyn Bridge is destroyed by the monster, and then Rob learns that Jessie is still trapped inside the city, so they decide to go and rescue her, much to the displeasure of the military. Another interesting thing is that this monster is also carrying parasites, which start to fall off it resulting in more nasties running around the city.
I guess the thing about this film is that it sort of gives a new dimension to the found footage genre, and sort of goes further in it being somewhat more professional (that is with a professional studio behind it as opposed to a couple of people attempting to break into the scene). Another thing is that this does suggest the modern world's propensity in basically recording everything, but then again I suspect that this has more to do with the price of technology not only coming down, but also getting a lot smaller.
This film, well, it isn't too bad. At first I was hesitant in watching it because, well, I really don't like found footage. Sure, it was a new direction back in the late 90s, but to me it is still very much in the realm of experimental, and honestly, I really hope it doesn't go too mainstream. In a sense, it is one of those genres that really should be used sparingly, though I am sort of wandering when somebody is doing to do this using a simply moble phone camera?
As for the film, well, it is basically your typical monster movie, though making it found footage certainly adds a different dimension to it. Further, by having the main characters as simply ordinary people means that there is a lot of mystery surrounding what the monster is or where it came from. Sure, there are hints as to its origins, but nothing is ever said about it outright. In a way I thought the film was good, and somewhat enjoyable, but I would be hesitant in saying that it was great."

","I absolutely loved Cloverfield even though I am no fan of the shaky cam. The movie is interesting because it's so damn different. It takes a worn concept and invigorates it by applying an innovative approach. The style will anger and offend some viewers but, if you're able to accommodate the camera, the movie delivers. There are moments of high tension and the sense of danger feels closer and more real than in any recent motion picture. The missteps - the greatest of which is the interminable introduction - are forgivable because the payoff is strong. In some ways, Cloverfield gives the impression of having been produced on a low budget, but the special effects are first rate. The monster and the devastation it causes look real. We believe. And, ultimately, that's the reason why Cloverfield works - because this film takes you into the heart of the maelstrom and leaves you there."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","0","0","19 October 2018"," Frenetic and in-the-moment but ever-so-slightly one-note.
","'Cloverfield (2008)' is an insular alien invasion film that puts its focus on its in-the-moment, frenetic action as our characters scramble to survive the large-scale situation in which they're placed. This is really all it does with any degree of certainty - or confidence, perhaps - as it lacks the character depth or narrative prowess to provide any deeper investment or, even, enjoyment. The hand-held, found-footage style is usually handled well and most of the piece is believable (a few dodgy effects aside). It's no more believable than it would've been if filmed traditionally, though, and the lack of any extra personality or intimacy, which could've quite easily come with such a conceit, makes it feel ever-so-slightly one note; it's certainly no 'Searching (2018)', that's for sure. However, there's entertainment to be had when the alien threat puts our core players - and almost, by extension, us - in real, hectic danger. 6/10"

It's also a very intense movie that grabs your interest near the beginning, seeing how the characters act before the Clover attacks New York City. And when the it does attack, it is as exciting and intense as it can be. When you see the Statue of Liberty's head land on the ground all scratched up, you know how powerful this thing is.

","A first-person-type movie... familiar? Yeah, let's not talk about the fact that this idea has already been done by other movies, as long as it's done good.
So, what we got here is a giant monster and its origins are unknown. Initially I presumed it is an aquatic creature - I noticed the tentacles and at some point in the movie, even some kind of external gills near its head; but then, I saw its incredibly non-hydrodynamic body... maybe from outer space? It actually doesn't matter; it matters that it's huge... and it's on the rampage!
The characters in this movie are pretty well-contoured and credible. In a giant monster/disaster movie, its greatest challenge is to aim at the reaction of masses during any form of cataclysm. Where ""2012"" failed, this one succeeded. Well, I'm talking about loosing sanity, the well-known self-preservation behavior etc (See ""The mist"", a movie which relies more on that than the creatures themselves).
Oh, I forgot to mention the subliminal messages scattered throughout this movie; all I'm gonna say is ""Them!"", ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", ""King Kong"", and also something crucial that happens at the end of the movie. Do the research yourself!"

Not completely, but Reeves' directing and the length of the movie went a very long way in cauterizing the bleeding, especially for the viewer's eyes.<br/><br/>That camera, that damn camera. The camera is more of a survivor that Tom Hanks in Cast Away, with Destiny's Child playing in the background and Jeff Probst narrating the whole thing.<br/><br/>There were some issues I had with the acting, however there were other parts where all the main actors involved redeemed themselves to satisfactory levels. There was also one scene, the tunnel scene, which felt a bit out of touch with reality, given how Cloverfield did such a stellar job at creating a natural and authentic panic.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is actually not about the creature, it's about the consequence of it. This film is a prelude, it's an entire movie about depicting an aftermath. It's the movie before the origin story, but not a prequel, and I believe that was a pretty brilliant stance and angle to take.<br/><br/>Another awesome touch, is introducing the main couple and telling their story as a recording being recorded over by the current event. A creative way in recounting a flashback.<br/><br/>Also, the way Cloverfield ends is, somehow perfect, because though it doesn't provide any kind of closure what-so-ever, it does however, fit extremely well within its approach.

"yourfavoritecritic","6","0","0","19 February 2018"," The Movie That Could Have Been
","Cloverfield, is the first feature length debut for Matt Reeves that was released in 2008 and was a film shrouded in mystery. The very little detail released beforehand, left audiences stubbled and intrigued to check the obscure movie out. Upon its release the film was met with mixed, but mostly positive, reviews; and almost a decade later I finally got the chance to watch Cloverfield for the first time. Overall my experience with the film was mostly good, it didn't do anything to blow me away, nor was it offensively bad.
 Cloverfield tells the story of a group of friends trying to survive a monster attack in New York City. The film stars actors who were, at the time, mainly unknown, like a very young Lizzy Caplan and T.J. Miller; the acting itself was serviceable, save for a couple weak performances, everybody at least felt convincing, like they were going through some shit.
 Now the main spectacle of the film, is the setting and monster. Although we never get too many good glimpses of the creature, it is a neat design and felt threatening. Despite actually taking place on a sound stage, I felt the filmmakers did a great a job at faithfully recreating New York, as I was totally immersed in the world. Also the use of very little CGI was great, it never took me out of the movie when I saw something that wasn't practical, the FX were used when it needed to be and that was great. 
 Now the biggest issue in the movie, is its story and character motivation. The story centres around three friends travelling across the city to save their friend, despite numerous people telling them that part of the city is lost and if they hope to survive they're better off following the hundreds of people in the military advised rescue plan. The motivation to save this one character is extremely weak, and out of the three friends who tagged along, really only one of them should have gone to rescue this other individual. Along their trek these characters also make really poor decisions, that left me shaking my head on multiple occasions. I felt that many of the deaths that occurred in this movie could have been avoided if the character's the audience is supposed to ""root"" for weren't so dense. With a couple decisions made early on, the events in this film could have totally avoided. It makes me wonder why there weren't revisions to the script to make it tighter, so that every action in the movie feels plausible, rather than the result of bad character writing.
 So although the film has many issues in many respects, I did find enjoyment in it, despite the overall forgetfulness of the film. I do see myself rewatching the film sometime again as I enjoyed the setting, and the lore behind the Cloverfield universe is quite intriguing. If you have not seen this film before, I do recommend it, it's an enjoyable monster movie which I'm sure you'll get a few kicks out of. As for me this was somewhat disappointing, as many of the films flaws could have been avoided, so with that being saying said, Cloverfield gets a 6/10."

","Cloverfield, in short, is shot like a ""found footage"" documentary and follows a group of friends around Manhattan during a monster invasion.<br/><br/>Still interested? Read on. It's New York City, the site of many disasters (both imagined and real, unfortunately). One can assume that the events we are about to witness happened at some point in the past, because we're watching a video seized by the Department of Defense. The footage, recovered from an ""area formerly known as Central Park"", is clearly taken from a camera once owned by a young couple. We know this because we see them, on video, before and during the day of the invasion.<br/><br/>The couple attend a going away party for a mutual friend who is moving to Japan. It's at the party where we meet the cast of characters who later become the video journalists when the real fun begins. The building shakes, there's a power-outage lasting a few seconds, and there's a report on TV about a possible earthquake. Seems harmless, right? Like some giddy school children, the cameraman and his buddies head up to the roof to get a better look at a foundering ship spilling oil into the Hudson River. That's when all hell breaks loose. Luckily, they bring the camera along for the wild ride.<br/><br/>And so begins director Matt Reeves's ode to big scary monsters. Think of the videos you've seen on the news of war photographers running for their lives, all the while continuing to record. That's what Cloverfield is like except no one is dodging enemy fire; here it's giant bug-things they're running from. The ""found-footage"" genre of filmmaking isn't new, not even when Cloverfield was made 10-years ago. It's actually kind of lame, too. However, when I first saw this movie in 2008 I enjoyed it. Who doesn't appreciate seeing an apocalyptic monster invasion? They are magnificent!<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a good action, sci-fi, horror film that's fun to watch, even if the camera work is a little too jarring at times. I like how the movie uses very little CGI (but when CGI is used, it's excellent) and relies mostly on creative, budget-friendly filmmaking. Loud monster noises, blood-curdling screams, and one's own imagination fuel the fright. Think Jaws (1975): you knew there was something scary out there, but you couldn't see it. Everyone fears what they can't see.<br/><br/>Check out 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) and Netflix's The Cloverfield Paradox (2018). All three movies are related."

","Perspective from the street-level as a towering, rampaging monster plows straight through the heart of Manhattan. At the time this was released, we were roughly a decade past The Blair Witch Project, long enough for the found footage trope to have thoroughly played itself out. Yet in many ways this feels like a revelation, one which would collapse without that same central gimmick. Like bystander footage from a major disaster, the placement of the camera makes the chaos and mayhem of this sudden, citywide catastrophe feel completely vivid and tangible. It's like we're there with the victims; our pulse racing, our eyes widened by the dead and injured, our skin coated by the dust of so much collapsed concrete. Moments that would've certainly felt cheesy from a traditional POV, high above the action, now deliver beyond any reasonable expectation. We get to know the core characters well, their thoughts and quirks and feelings, and we mourn when they're abruptly taken from us in the confusion. It tells a desperate human story in a genre that usually struggles with such elements, and doesn't shy from the profound, lasting conclusion that everything seems to be building toward from the start. The plot does have holes, some larger than others, but given the frenetic pace and rapid developments, those are relatively easy to shake off and leave behind. I was surprised by how Cloverfield moved me today, nine years after the fact. Surely one of the most memorable, ambitious, effective films of the decade."

I can see why this film engendered so many negative reviews, but I can also understand why. This picture IS NOT your typical movie, in that it attempts to portray real time events with absolute realism, instead of following the time-honored script of a definitive beginning, middle, and end, with a well-defined purpose of meaning. It is also totally shot 100% HAND HELD, so it has the frantic, authentic feel of an actual homemade video movie, which certainly fulfilled that aspect. And the special effects are totally world class, on a par with the best CGI big budget films ever made. The utter realism of this picture is worthy of note. With many creature movies of this ilk, the acting often suffers, but these actors, mostly unknown, all delivered star quality performances all around, with no deviation from realism or drama. If you're expecting the same kind of Hollywood monster movie as say, ""Godzilla,' this might not be your cup of tea.

But suddenly something like an earthquake interrupts them and from here (about the minute 20 or so) he action and the tension starts as they try to cross New York to find one of their friends who is trapped in her own apartment. The story may not be the best but it truly gets you into the action quickly and makes you feel scared, tense, happy or sad, as the characters are. The actors made a really great job, because they feel like they're really in danger. Lizzy Caplan, T.J. Miller, Michael Stahl-David & Jessica Lucas as the main characters they are all amazing.<br/><br/>And the other thing I have to mention is the amazing visuals and all of the cinematography. It feels very real and the camera work gets you into this monster attack. The music here is missing because the movie wants to make you feel it like a real record of this, but in the end credits you get to hear the Cloverfield Overture by Michael Giacchino and it could have really fit well in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie isn't for everyone, but that's not necessary a bad thing, because I loved it. just watch it and then you will discover an amazing movie made in a very original way, or maybe you will discover an awful movie that will bring you headaches, but I'm pretty sure you won't regret watching it."

","Matt Reeves' Cloverfield remains popular for all the wrong reasons. Many know it as ""the monster movie that causes motion sickness"", and as many don't give the film a chance because of this, they are missing out on a chillingly effective monster movie.<br/><br/>The concept of a found footage monster movie is quite ambitious. How can the sheer scale of a monster movie be properly showcased without the use of cinematic camera-work? In many ways, Cloverfield is brilliant, becoming on of the most intense monster movies I've ever seen, without the use of these grandiose cinematics and overblown action. Nearly all of the film remains on ground level, which adds copious amounts of tension and works at making the viewer feel utterly helpless. The scenes in which the monster towers almost directly over the camera are heart-pounding as we can't help but marvel at the technical scope this movie achieves. And while many complain that the monster remains hidden for the majority of the film, that only makes these surprise appearances all the more terrifying. The special effects are nothing short of spectacular, despite what the direction gimmick may lead some to believe. <br/><br/>Cloverfield features a cast of characters that are surprisingly likable, even if they are walking clichés and remain underdeveloped by the credits, but in a film like this, I would be lying if I said it wasn't fitting. <br/><br/>The only real issues I had with Cloverfield was the incompetent story and, at times, the camera-work. The story of Cloverfield is reasonably simple, as it should be, but even as our characters set themselves a definitive goal, we keep getting pulled into tiring side stories that don't seem to have much affect on the film whatsoever. The sequence in which our characters are rescuing a friend from an almost horizontal skyscraper, drags on and isn't particularly engaging. While it does serve as a breather from the rest of the film's intensity, it does effect the pacing of the film as a whole. While I do believe that the infamously shaky camera-work benefits the film more than hinder it, it does at times go too far. The scenes become almost incoherently shaky at times, not really adding much to the viewer's experience other than a migraine.<br/><br/>While the young adult drama and jittery camera work suggests a quality no less than amateurish, the masterful use of scale and sparing utilization of the nerve-racking creature sightings makes Cloverfield anything but."
"thelastblogontheleft","7","0","0","2 April 2017"," A found footage gem
","I first saw this movie maybe a couple years after it came out, so this was a re-watch for me and I had forgotten how TOTALLY AMAZING THIS MOVIE IS. Like shockingly good, really. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I am a huge fan of the ""found footage"" style of horror, but this might be the best example of it that I've personally seen. It's terrifying, it's chaotic, it leaves you breathless in some scenes it's just well done. It's the first in a series of three movies that are all part of the Cloverfield franchise. I think they did the series in an interesting way — it's not a movie plus two sequels, but rather three movies that all take place in the same alternate universe.<br/><br/>The storyline is fairly basic, as I think a movie like this needs to be. A bunch of friends are at a going away party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who is moving to Japan. There's some typical drama at the party itself (and it's a bit slow and painful to muddle through) but it's later on when things start to get really crazy as the party-goers hear experience what feels and sounds like a brief earthquake followed by a city-wide power outage. They all head downstairs to the street to see what's going on and it's just pure chaos. They start to realize that some kind of monsters — some massive and some small — are attacking the city, and it's a rush to escape alive.<br/><br/>** SPOILERS! **<br/><br/>Like I said, this movie is just a thrill ride from beginning (well, almost beginning) to end. I really think the ""found footage"" style — the feeling that we're right along with them — adds significantly to how much anxiety and panic you feel as you're watching. When they first hear the ""earthquake"" and go downstairs to find a street full of people all wildly speculating (was it an earthquake? a terrorist attack? was that it, or will there be more?), you feel like you're among the crowd. It was very reminiscent of the videos I've seen from the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in a way — just blind fear and trying to piece things together as you go, which is terrifying when you have no idea what you're running from or where is safe to go. And then DOWN COMES THE HEAD OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY and it's very Escape From New York and pretty cool.<br/><br/>The scene where people are SPRINTING to get away from the massive debris cloud rolling their way is well, again, very 9/11, which I think just naturally strikes a nerve in all of us. It's this massive, inanimate object that is hurtling towards you and everyone tumbles into buildings and they're somewhat safe even though the sheer force of the cloud implodes the windows. Just insane.<br/><br/>The combination of just sober disbelief, sirens wailing in the distance, seemingly everything (and everyone) covered in this layer of white snowy debris, military barking orders from helicopters, the sound of explosions echoing off the skyscrapers, the inhuman roar of some kind of monster shifting from building to building it's like you don't even know where to look or what to focus on, and on top of that you can hear the cries of fear and panic from the group you're following (which I think they did very authentically).<br/><br/>I really preferred when they kept the monster(s) more vague just glimpses here and there. As is often the case with monster movies like this, looking too long at them can take the mystery away and make them less impactful. Just seeing a tail crashing into the Brooklyn Bridge is effective but when they stop in the store and watch the news cast and see the smaller monsters, it's still crazy but you can kind of see the seam in the special effects and it takes me out of the fantasy a little bit.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes is when Rob is on his way to rescue Beth (the forgettable Odette Annable) and they get caught in the crossfire between monsters and military. It's just explosions and gunfire and a freaking TANK and I mean if you weren't glued to the TV for that there's somethin' wrong.<br/><br/>Everyone talks about the tunnel scenes and they were okay but I dunno, I preferred them out on the streets, personally. <br/><br/>But when they go inside the department store and the military guides them to the outpost and then Marlena (Lizzy Caplan, who bugs the crap out of me) starts bleeding from her eyes because she was previously wounded by one of the tiny monsters and it's just CHAOS as they rush her into quarantine that scared the HELL out of me. It definitely plays on one of my biggest fears in general — some kind of outbreak where there's CDC in hazmat suits all around — but imagining her utter panic and helplessness as they rush her away from her familiar group is intense. And it was brilliant how they got her riiiight behind the curtain and then ""pop!"" she explodes. Oh man. My jaw was on the floor.<br/><br/>I also really liked when they finally saved Beth and had gotten into the chopper for rescue and then BOOM, monster's comin' atcha and the chopper is spinning out and it is C H A O S, just screaming and praying, as they are hurtling toward some uncertain future. That was really the last cool scene before the kind of cheesy monster slurping up the man behind the camera, Hud (T.J. Miller), or the definitely cheesy exchange of I love yous between Rob and Beth (gag).<br/><br/>Overall, a really awesome, action-packed, genuinely scary ""found footage"" gem!"

","When I watched this (years after the actual release of the movie), I did know what this was about, as opposed to the people who may have gone with little knowledge into this. I still think it works out pretty neatly and even holds up after all those years. You can call this an adventure if you want to.<br/><br/>So it is mostly pretty people doing their thing and it is ""found footage"", but this never really bothered me much. I was surprised by the different endings on it. Some not that bad to be truthful, but that's up to you to decide if they chose the right one. But before that you get a tension filled movie, that could've been a romantic comedy, but has as you probably know a twist to it ... Enjoy the (well executed) mayhem!"

","Review: Before I started to watch 10 Cloverfield Lane, I thought that I would watch this movie again, and I must admit, for it's time, it actually wasn't bad. I'm not one whose into paranormal movies, and I hate when films are filmed through a camera, so everything was against this movie right from the beginning but once the massive monster started to attack New York, I actually felt the intensity that the leading characters did. I must admit, the teenagers did get on my nerves after a while, and the camera seemed to have a really LONG battery life. Anyway, the action scenes with the army were quite realistic and the whole evacuation was put together well. I would have liked to have seen more attention to detail with the huge monster, and the little mini monsters but as it was filmed through a hand-held camera, I can understand why it looked sketchy. For a film that was made 8 years ago, it certainly didn't look dated, and you could easily release it today. Personally, I would have used some A-list actors, so they could bring the tension across more effectively but with that aside, I still enjoyed it the second time around. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: After making such a profit at the box office, I'm surprised that it took so long for a sequel. The movie was directed by Matt Reeves, 50, who also brought you Let Me In, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and is due to direct War in the Planet of the Apes, which will be released in 2017. With J.J. Abrams in the producer chair, who is known for directing Mission Impossible III, Super 8, the new Star Trek franchise, and of course, the new Star Wars movies, there certainly was a lot of experience behind the camera. I just wished that they filmed it normally! Anyway, it's definitely one to have in your collection, if your into movies in this genre, and I'm sure that people will be going back to it, in the future.<br/><br/>Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $171million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/horrors, starring Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Michael Stahl-David, Mike Vogel and Brian Klugman. 6/10"

","Cloverfield is without doubt one of the strangest films around, and gives a very particular perspective, but it is incredibly annoying and, from my perspective, boring. From the start my only hope was that the camera holder would stop shaking the camera uncontrollably. Yes, I get it, it is in first person and you're scared... but even with a smartphone there is no such amount of shaking. The story is equally wound up and chaotic. The insights of the viewer are extremely reduced All in all the film seems like a high budget production trying to imitate a low budged B-class film, and i honestly don't get the point.I recommend to watch the film only early in the evening to avoid sleep. Also, if you really want to watch it, be prepared for the shaky camera."

","When you see this in 2016, the first thing that jumps at you is the found film footage: this concept has simply aged badly. The camera work is voluntary choppy etc. but we've seen it so many times by now that it's old and stale. By 2008 it wasn't exactly revolutionary either - that's really the main issue with Cloverfield. It's a shame because it is a cool rewrite of the classic Godzilla concept: the monster is cool, the FX are cool, the cast is cool... lots of things to like really. It does follow the tropes: idiot characters going upstream to find a girlfriend, lots of carnage... but it works. To be honest, I think I prefer the sequel: it's cleverer but this is still a cool way to spend a Sunday afternoon."

","Yes, I really believe in my headline. This was and will be one of the best found footage films you will watch, why? because it very enjoyable. Maybe, i'm a little bias and don't like the whole point of Paranormal activities, etc... this film is enjoyable from start to finish, it has its feel of realism, but never sway's into the whole ""Could this have been real?' territory. Which is great. I think I saw this twice in the cinema and bought the Blu-ray too. <br/><br/>When 'events proceed', the camcorder style filming instills a genuine realism to events, and the films definitely feeds off the mass concern and shock at global events/terrorist attacks/disasters, and the disjointed way news feeds through. What is the monster? Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 9/11 inflicted on New York, much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb. There are moments seemingly recreating the documentary footage from 9/11, and they give the film verisimilitude. Touching upon real life horror, plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about, and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over."

","Cloverfield came at a defining moment in viral culture. YouTube was really getting big, and smart phones hadn't even been around for 2 years yet. So give credit to the awareness of the filmmakers, including producer J.J. Abrams, to take a chance on something that spoke to a new generation--perhaps the first film to do so (based off memory so don't get mad if I'm wrong). It was modern and cool and what people actually wanted to see, but not like in a cheap way when some rich old guy says ""Ooo, I bet the kids'll really dig this."" But in a totally conscious way.<br/><br/>It's a monster movie with a modern flair. Set in New York City (where else?), it features a group of friends trying to escape Manhattan away from this large unidentifiable creature.<br/><br/>The acting isn't the best--save for Lizzy Caplan and T.J. Miller (the latter of the two having his career essentially launched by this movie alone)--but that may have to do with the completely exposed and unrealistic dialogue. It's obvious that the filmmakers chose to focus more on concept and narrative. And that's fine.<br/><br/>During the movie's setup, before the monster attacks, a party is being held to bid farewell to Rob (Michael Stahl-David) before he leaves for a new career opportunity in Japan. Rob's best friend, Hud (Miller), is documenting the whole thing--including the rest of the movie--on video camera, which may be the best decision by the filmmakers in this whole film. Miller arguably carries the movie and provides great comic relief, proving why he deserves to be such a dominant figure in these types of roles these past few years.<br/><br/>Director Matt Reeves does a good job moving the story along and not leaving behind much wasted space. It constantly feels like this is what might actually happen if there were some sort of monster attack.<br/><br/>One allowance you'll have to make, however, is the corny love story amidst all the chaos. Rob convinces his friends to venture back into ground zero in order to save the one-that-got-away, Beth (Odette Yustman). But thankfully Cloverfield never takes itself too seriously. Or maybe it does, but it's so much so that we just laugh and enjoy it anyway.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 86"

","This is like one of the best monster movies I've seen. I really do wonder what it would be like if that monster got into a fight with Godzilla. That would be so awesome if that happened. There should be a crossover movie between the Cloverfield monster and Godzilla. Also those little baby monsters are sorta like in the Godzilla movie when Godzilla laid eggs and had babies even though Godzilla is a male. Also I know that when my brother watches this movie it sometimes gets him a little dizzy cause of all the movements with that guy and his camera. Now if I was in a situation like that where some monster invades New York or some other U.S. capitol city, I'd be running like heck and have proof with me so that all my friends and family can see what exactly happened.

","I am not a typical viewer of related works, but, from time to and ""on request"" from friends or relatives, I am in for them - especially when they are not long.<br/><br/>As my prior information did not include any famous actors and I was briefed about the basics, I decided to focus on scenes and their structuring. The ""introduction"", however, was too long, and when ""the hell broke loose"", then odd things occurred not possible in such situations, e.g. maintenance of lighting or GSM coverage, and if/when explosions widen and buildings crash closer and closer, people do not remain on the streets and follow them, but run away or find shelter asap. Thus, many of subsequent scenes were airy-fairy, and the found- footage style just added tension (true, I have to admit, quite capably), but again: no way the cam and the film inside could last until the so-called end.<br/><br/>So, all in all, Cloverfield is just another mind- and technology- twisting creation meant for them completely in following the events, moods and twists. For me, it was a slightly-more-interesting The Blair Witch Project, and its huge popularity remains mystery to me."

","Even though it supposedly doesn't have a ton of links to the original, I thought it may be a good idea to take back at Cloverfield in preparation for the forthcoming 10 Cloverfield Lane. Cloverfield is about a group of friends attending a going away party in New York City when suddenly a gigantic creature attacks the city. The group is thrust into the unbelievable task of making their way through the streets of New York in hopes of saving one of their friends.<br/><br/>In an era where the term found footage films started to become a gimmick that people scoffed at, Cloverfield manages to make use of its filming technique to perfection. More impressive though, is the filmmakers ability to get us to care about each and every one of the main characters so that when an emotional scene arrives, we feel for them. Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams did a wonderful job of bringing this film to life as the director and producer respectively. Not only is the film incredibly original in its story telling, but the special effects and realistic take on a monster invasion felt so refreshing to watch. Not everybody makes it out alive and when people die, you don't see it coming. That to me, is a film that nails exactly what its going for.<br/><br/>The cast wasn't and to a certain extent still isn't all that well- known. TJ Miller and Lizzy Caplan being the exceptions as they have broken out into fame. Even with that said, I thought the performances all around were exceptional. I got the vibe from all of the characters that they were really seeing a monster/creatures for the first time and the decision to use hand-held cameras was extremely effective. Miller was perfect for the character who filmed everything as he brought just the right amount of humor and terror to every scene. I also believed and cared for the love story they were trying to sell me on with Rob trying to reach Beth for a good portion of the film.<br/><br/>In many ways, Cloverfield is a look inside the lives of people who would be on the streets in any invasion/superhero film. Perhaps rightfully so, we don't really ever get a chance to see from a normal person's view of the events. The emotion and humor are definitely present, and the action is also handled extremely well as there are a fair share of necessary jump scares. Cloverfield is easily my favorite found footage film along with one of the best invasion sci-fi films of the last decade or so.<br/><br/>+Reeves & Abrams direction<br/><br/>+Scary & haunting at times<br/><br/>+Performances<br/><br/>+Found footage choice made sense<br/><br/>+Balance of humor and emotion was on point<br/><br/>8.7/10"

The exception was the camera guy - don't know if it was his acting or just the character but I found him annoying.<br/><br/>As for the monster - I like how it was not seen much at the start - tantalising us as to what it might be, but needed far more work around the background and reason it was there, this lack of necessary detail loses several points for me.<br/><br/>Worth watching but don't expect much around the monster story, this is about the group of peop0le caught up in the action."
"TxMike","Null","0","0","25 September 2015"," Japan has Godzilla, now New York has its own monster!
","I had heard about this movie but had failed to see it until now, on DVD from my public library. For anyone who likes this movie the extras are interesting from the design of the monster to JJ Abrams talking about how Japan has Godzilla and it seems to be in their popular culture, so maybe the USA needs its monster. It seems Abrams was hoping that this one would become that. Pretty lofty expectations, eh?<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the story focuses on a small group of shallow 20- somethings in Manhattan. They are throwing a goodbye party for one of the gang, Rob, who is going to Japan as a V.P. with some company. The party is in progress, petty gossip fills the air, when about 11PM and exactly 18:18 into the DVD we hear and feel (for those of us with a powered subwoofer) something that might be an earthquake. But we soon find out it is a 300-foot-tall monster that is as menacing as Godzilla (but looks more the MUTOs of the most recent Godzilla movie).<br/><br/>So all the characters switch from party mode to survival mode, trying to escape from Manhattan to Brooklyn via the bridge. The effects are very authentic, borrowing a lot from actual footage of the 9/11 attack with buildings imploding and dust clouds being pushed down the streets. <br/><br/>The storytelling mode is shaky camera and found footage. For those who like this sort of move it is very well made. I am not a big fan, the footage shown contains a lot of them walking, running, climbing, fighting off smaller monsters released by the large one. There is no real resolution, footage cannot be ""found"" unless the filmer perished. Maybe the monster is still out there?"
"highwaytourist","7","0","0","10 January 2015"," The film has serious flaws, but it's best scenes are terrifying
","This movie had me on the fence. This film is shown as hand-held footage of a camera-phone found after the fact, like with ""The Blair Witch Project."" The first 15 minutes of the film are so boring, I nearly gave up on the film. But when the action starts, it takes off. Unlike most monster films, this shows an on-the-ground view from beginning to end. The hand-held camera is a truly mixed bag. On the plus side, you get a convincing ground view of what it's like to be caught in a city being attacked by a giant monster from outer space. The truth is that most people caught in the middle would have no idea what's really going on, only that the city's being destroyed and they need to run for their lives. On the down side, the camera is so shaky, it's often hard to watch. While the monster itself is nothing great, it's filmed so effectively that it scares anyway. As the lead characters risk their lives to save a semi-girlfriend who's trapped in her apartment, the fear and chaos are very real. On the down side, some characters recover from injuries far too conveniently to be believable. Then, when the end comes, it's so abrupt and leaves so many unanswered questions, it almost ruined the film for me. But by then, I'd gotten enough thrills and suspense to satisfy me."

","I thought I would be able to like all found footage films. However, this disappointed. The voice acting by the cameraman was so horrible like he was just making fun of it. What's more, there's so much sensationalism in the obviously Hollywood high-budget movie which strips off the suspense and realism. The numerous ""Oh my Gods"" are extremely annoying. Plus, the storyline was so bland that it would seem the movie was primarily for showcasing the impressive graphics and simulation technologies at the time. Whatever the case, this isn't even a scary or thrilling movie. So I wouldn't know why they made such a pitiful script for such a high-budget movie. I would like to think of it as a waste of time, but at the very least, it opened my eyes to see how big and wealthy production companies venture into the found footage genre only to end up mostly creating a trying-hard or trying-to-impress movie full of your usual mainstream movie elements; extravagant graphics and annoying sensationalism, two key elements not typically found in the REAL found footage genre."

","This movie could have reached a 9 with slight improvements...<br/><br/>The opening is not too slow like a lot of films, the plot is simple but entertaining. The first oh s#%t moment is when you first hear the monster. At this point you start to realise that this jerk carrying the camera is going to be operating it the whole film, this meaning essentially the film is going to be narrated by a character void of any personality, basically a bit of a prat who is the main stars best friend, he struggles to show any redeeming qualities that a best friend would have and as my very young child quite rightly pointed out why we he carry the camera the whole time, some sort of helmet/head camera wouldn't have been to difficult to have written into the story therefore making the 'Blair witch hand-held' style more realistic.<br/><br/>The army scene when they are moving through the streets is one of the better scenes I have ever seen just for its realism, the monster is slowly introduced to us which is not too teasing, just right I would say. The fact that we don't get the typical happy ending is another plus point for this film.<br/><br/>If the character holding the camera was better, the film a touch longer and maybe one or two more improvements here or there this could have been a movie that would stand the test of time.

Granted, the effects and the city set designers did amazing, I enjoyed that. I was totally prepared for the whole movie to be shot from a camcorder, though I didn't care for it. I think the movie would've been a lot better if it hadn't been from the perspective of a camcorder. Hub, the guy with the camera was the character that bugged me the most. All of the characters really had their ""I hate you I hope the monster eats you"" moments, but Hub was the most annoying person ever I wanted him to die so bad! And the best part of the movie was when he actually did die. One of my biggest complaints of the movie is that we get no kind of sense as to what happened after the two lovebirds are killed by the bridge collapsing under them. I mean, the movie was only an hour and 15 minutes long, I think the writers would've been wise to add in some news footage from CNN or something at the end explaining what happened and what they figured out about the whole situation. Also, the writers could've taken out half of the party scene in the beginning of the movie. I mean, the movie is an hour and 15 minutes, and 20 of those minutes are all about the party. As the party was going on, I just kept saying ""okay let's move on now."" Really, the only reason this is getting any positive reviews is the effects.

","I watched this movie for the first time with no expectations going into the movie. But I have to say, it has quality! I was blown away by how realistic this movie was. At times, though, it looked like a green screen, but if you don't pay attention, you won't notice it. The beginning was pretty slow, but it's like that with a lot of movies. However, it makes up for it in the last hour. J.J Abrams and Matt Reeves took a risk with this movie, but it ended up going well for them. I'll start reviewing the movie. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS: They were awesome considering recent monster movies from 2005-. Especially when you compare them to Syfy original movies, which could have been made up by a six year old boy. They used practical and CG effects, and used the different ones at the right time. The crab-spider creatures were totally unexpected, and very real. The monster was seen little, but it was a good movie nonetheless. THE ACTING: Very good all the way through. It was cheesy at some parts, but only if you pay close attention to it. Hud (T.J Miller) did a good job to his role of a typical New York nerd who has trouble talking to girls sometimes. He also takes his job ""documenting"", as he says he's doing numerous times throughout the movie. Lizzy Caplan does a good job acting as an unpleasant at times, sarcastic, drink-loving New Yorker named Marlena Diamond. Odette Annable (old fashioned name, huh?) does an OK job as a scared and injured innocent civilian named Beth McIntyre. Jessica Lucas does a good job as a kind-hearted lady named Lily Ford. Michael Stahl- David does a great job as a courageous guy who will stop at nothing to save his girlfriend, Beth McIntyre. That's enough for the acting. THE STORY: A little bit cliché'd, but good anyway. Original in some aspects, like how spider parasite crabs drop off the monster and kill people. It is an unpleasant movie, no doubt, but still one of the best found footage movies I've ever seen. 8/10"

","Rob, the lead character, was very identifiable for me. The direction was spot on all the way through keeping the tension at unbearably high levels for most of the time.<br/><br/>For me, some of the monster attack sequences, particularly one in a subway tunnel, were among the best edge of the seat moments I've witnessed in a theater since ""Alien""'s re-release a few years ago.<br/><br/>I thought the movie had more substance than you'd expect it to, even beyond the obvious 9/11 overtones. I heard someone call this the ""United 93"" of monster movies and I agree with the assessment as this is a movie with of course a lighter tone but the same sense of relative realism and utter uneasiness which prevails throughout.<br/><br/>I disagree with those who say the love story was tacked on or shoe- horned into the script. Besides serving a crucial plot point, it was simply the emotional underpinning of the movie.<br/><br/>I thought the hand-held camera perspective was used far better here than uh... a certain movie released in 1999. ""Cloverfield"" is as creepy, scary, and relatively realistic as any 'giant monster attacks city' movie can be. It's also very well-written in comparison to many of those. I've read up on some alleged plot-holes and decided that it is unreasonable to expect us to get more closure and a deeper understanding of what was going on than the characters. This is a point of view movie with the leads being a bunch of twenty-somethings. What, did you expect a guy in a lab coat to pop up and explain everything? Perhaps an orangutan in an armchair would've been nice, right? Really, ""Cloverfield"" makes you feel like you're there. It's a formidable relatively low-budget sci-fi flick which delivers the goods. Frankly, the arguments against it are mostly due to unrealistic and silly expectations. It's thrilling, tense, and runs for just as long as it needs to. Plus, it's got a great ending."

","First of all, I like the movie. It has really good visual. Events are told realistic, and this really impresses me. We have to see J. J. Abrams' writing in the beginning. Everyone said that the movie does not finish, but I do not agree with them. J. J. Abrams never explain anything in his movies. I think the movie is wonderful like past. To me, it has to be in everyone's archive, and it has to be watched. Because the movie is shot with the camcorder, we do not meet the monster very often. Actresses and actors, and flow of events are really good. I think the movie is worth to watch. Especially, I like to realize the little details and the views at the end of the movie. In my opinion, we have to respect to J. J. Abrams. People who like this kind have to watch it."

For this reason, the monster is very mysterious in the film. Also, the film was recorded by hand camera. So, I don't like very much. It was not bad of course. Cloverfield is not a movie to be called absolutely as the worst film. But I found a trouble in the film. I didn't understand where the monster came from. My friends think that the film was not fascinating. I don't think so. Moreover, the film was flowing. The film's director is successful man. The film was very designed by Matt Reeves. I advise that you can watch certainly with close friends in the house. Also, I suggest that before you start to watch the film, at first you can search information about the film. For example, you can watch the fragment, look film's subject. Thanks to that, you can comprehend very well."

","I was so excited about seeing this movie. I thought ""this is going to be a great movie"". Why? Because the previews hadn't revealed any vital plot or character details! It appeared to contain elements of the destruction of part of New York by some sort of monster or god knows what, from who knows where and who knows why! The potential therefore to be completely surprised and exhilarated. The movie takes a surprisingly realistic approach, and even though you can still feel that it is acted, the movie serves a nice survival experience.The actors also do a nice job, although some scenes feel more acted then others.I found myself saying: ""Run faster fat ass, I want to see the end of the movie!"" several times. The first person angle got me so engrossed with this movie that, among other things, I sometimes forgot myself and worried about the ""cameraman"" surviving so I could see how it ended. I had a three friends over watching the movie with me, and a couple times that I yelled that they actually yelled along with me instead of just laughing. Other than the filming style, this was a great movie. It was totally engrossing and fast paced. It created a great air of tension but only sparingly used the ""jump out and say boo"" element that so many other movies abuse and overuse, making it meaningless. Actually, there may have only been one of those in the entire movie! When the movie ended I wanted more, the hallmark of a good movie experience."

After the man went upstairs of her apartment, an explanation occurred because of monster's smashing the sea. Then, the monster was a huge creature and it was eating people. In addition, it was destroying the buildings and bridge. Everybody was trying to escape from it and not to be eaten by it. At that time, the main character and a few friends of his was truing to find the woman who was the ex-girlfriend of the main Chara. After a huge effort, they arrive at the apartment where she used to lived and rescued her. Next, they went out with their camera. The main character introduced himself to camera.

","Those who know that they do not like seeing monsters or some other kinds of creatures should not watch that one because you will probably get bored till movie ends. Beginning of the movie seems to me quite fascinating as I'm not familiar with the movies which were shown as if they were recorded like a home movie. But, toward to middle, it will not be too difficult to realize that visual effects were not pay attention a lot. Especially for the creature which tries to destroy everything could be more convincing. Apart from this, the flow of scenes can be seen a little bit problematic also.

This movie includes six young New Yorkers attending a party on the night that a monster attacks the city. When people try to escape, New York streets burn down in flames. For me, the film is the most impressive scene that when Manhattan was a violent explosion, statue of liberty's head snapped.

","If you haven't seen this movie yet I very strongly advise that you do. The movie got high ratings because its new and unique presentation. There was so much hype for this movie that you didn't need to know what it was about to see I think many people will be put off by the fact that so little is actually learned about the monster, but I think this might be the film's strongest point. Film also delivers more realism than other films can, it made me actually believe what happened in the film was true.The beginning makes you show compassion towards the characters, it shows their personal lives and drama's we've all faced at one point in our life, then, it all gets turned upside down.When people realize what they do and what their mistakes are,they decide to jeopardize even their life and try to correct their mistakes. The camera is controlled by a member of the cast, it is shaky and nervy, and gives you a real sense of panic and disbelief. Mostly it's accompanied by a lot of noise and screaming people, making it all confusing and pointless.<br/><br/>The action was intense.The monster is destroying their city but it doesn't show why the monster is doing it or where the monster is from and how it got there without anyone noticing. Also the movie is incredibly slow off the get go."

While the guests down the stairs ,fire and demolition occur all over the country. Then , it is a more violent explosion. The statue of liberty's head is broken.

","Some people have derisively compared this film to The Blair Witch Project because it was all told from the point of view of someone's shaking camera. Unless you have motion sickness, I don't think that's a bad thing. What matters is who's in front of the camera. While The Blair Witch Project featured annoying people screaming at each other, this movie actually made me care about the characters. In fact if it had continued with the romantic drama tone established during the first half hour, I STILL think it would have been worth watching and that's the biggest compliment I can give it. After that...I feel like there isn't much that can be said about the acting, and that should be a credit to it. It absolutely feels like you are experiencing this with the characters, who feel more or less exactly like real people. After leaving the theater I was on edge for a good deal of time, as I tried to shake that level of immersion. The film is also surprisingly humorous, and I would say that our crowd laughed more than they screamed (although the screams were definitely there).<br/><br/>Cloverfield definitely will not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you're already excited about it, I have no doubt that you'll be satisfied. It was a relatively unique experience, and again I want to applaud the decision to make it in that manner."

","First of all, ""Cloverfield"" is probably the last title that I would envision for a horror/sci-fi movie. But aside from the fact that it is, there are two specific things that I find very impressive about the film. The main aspect of course is that it's shot with a hand-held camera and contains a cast of unknowns so as to create very realistic sense. But I also would say that it follows the same structure as Alfred Hitchcock's movie ""The Birds"". You see, during the first fifteen or so minutes, both movies look as though they're going to be romantic comedies. But then the horrific element arrives and dominates the rest of the movie. And both films have the same sort of ending (although different things happen). It took me some time to finally see Cloverfield despite it was pretty hyped movie when it originally came out. The reason was, I really didn't like the style that was shown in the trailers. And now, after seeing it, I still don't like the style, but the movie has aspects in it, that makes some of it a fun watch. Though, I did find the movie a bit boring, despite it was trying so hard to be frantic and portray a feeling of a great urgency. And that isn't a good thing, as the movie isn't that long either."

But in my opinion it is not like that for this film. This film only shot with a hand held camera. For this reason audiences might not face with monster. It can be slightly risky, because this is absolutely dizzy. On the contrary effects are really fantastic. Films' tension was high. Story line and acting was very successful. This film was so fantastic that i have ever seen. On the contrary, if you watched this film unwillingly, this film would make you so bored. Additionaly there are fine details and old records.

And the monster action was appalling.Also it was awesome. The only disappointment I had that was the lack of connection to the viral material. The movie certainly has a good premise, but unanswered questions in the end and a camera that is way too shaky disrupt the experience. In the first 15 minutes and side lying outside the building to rescue scenes quite gripping and makes a great job, occasionally had stage Gala film. Monster mostly attack the movie moments of what happened in Nice. Cloverfield brought on those same emotions but for opposite reasons. After seeing it I frequently got into debates with classmates who just didn't get it. The monster was considerable cool and scary . I l loved this movie.

Don't go finding too much out, just watch, and get taken to a place most fiction movies aren't able to transport viewers to.

","Although Cloverfield is filled with action from the beginning to the end, its story seems to be the least important aspect as it focuses only on the fact that New York is being attacked by alien entities. Because of this, Cloverfield does not require much attention to understand the overall plot. Therefore, this cinematography is clearly intended to showcase a new approach in film style, not to depict an effective story or theme. With this in mind, Cloverfield's straightforward story makes this movie quite enjoyable because it engrosses me with the impressive visual effects and the danger that the protagonists are being exposed to without keeping track of the dialogue or the story sequence.<br/><br/>This revolutionary yet classical film starts with the armed forces' description specifying that a personal video showcasing the inexplicable incident was recovered. Then, it continues with a vague homemade video of Robert Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) waking up after spending the night with his girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Annable). Then, it suddenly cuts to the preparations of a surprise goodbye party for Robert. The man in charge of recording the party is Hudson Platt (T. J. Miller) who is only seen less than a minute throughout the movie. Right in the middle of the party, a harmless earthquake seems to hit New York. After that, the protagonist notice that they are being attacked by aliens. Worried about his girlfriend's safety, Robert, along with his friends cross the streets of New York in order to save her. From this point on, the climax consists of a series of impediments to save Robert's girlfriend.<br/><br/>One of the major key elements that makes Cloverfield effective is definitely the suspense involved. First of all, the film's art cover, which is the aftermath of a violent war in the iconic New York landscape, implies that its content is about violence of some sort. After that, Cloverfield starts with a romantic scene of Robert and Beth waking up after having spent the night together. Oddly enough, the film suddenly cuts to a party. With all this in mind, these scenes tend to get a little hazy, but at the same time these unusual scenes cause me to speculate on how or when the violence is going to occur.<br/><br/>Another important key element is the innovative homemade style film. This transcendent and unprecedented style of cinematography brings a completely new approach of the monotonous theme of alien attacks.<br/><br/>Cloverfield's story is simple, yet it does not affect the outcome of the entertainment experience since it is filled with action throughout the movie. This film is intended to amaze the audience by showing the extraterrestrial creature as life-like and as gruesome as possible, producing realistic war and alien sounds, showing the destructive missiles of the army being fired one after the other, and most importantly show the protagonists experience all these situations for a heartfelt reason. In addition, the brief dialogues and the few characters are an enormous advantage when it comes to straightforwardness. Throughout the movie, new characters are introduced; however, they do not alter the simplicity or the sequence of the movie.<br/><br/>It would be remiss not to mention some of the flaws that seems to impede the overall faultlessness of Cloverfield. First of all, one of the biggest enigmas in Cloverfield is the video clips of Robert and Beth being together. These clips are irrelevant and inopportune; therefore, they produce confusion. Moreover, the reason for the extraterrestrial entities' attack is never explained, nor their origin, or the reason they invade the earth. Maybe the director's aim was to create an even greater confusion to increase the intensity of the suspense, but it resulted in a big mystery that was never solved."

It's a good, old-fashioned action/horror with the special effects of today and the traditional ambiguous ending that these genres are known for, a winning combination for monster movie fanatics.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the camera work has ruined an otherwise solid film for so many viewers and I can sympathize with those who experience head aches and/or nausea.

","An interesting take on the horror genre, Cloverfield was not my first ""recovered footage"" film. I have to admit, once I got through the first 20 minutes of the film, it moved pretty well. The dialog was interesting and the actors played their parts well. Since the entire film is comprised of ""recovered classified footage"", the film is not of the quality you would expect from a big budget production. But the story is both plausible (except for the creature, which is never fully identified) and real. How would you react to that level of chaos and panic? This is an interesting character study which looks for the best in the participants, who are willing to sacrifice their lives to save another. While certainly not a huge collectible for the mainstream, I think this will be a favorite of lovers of the Blair Witch Project and Apollo 18. Rated PG-13 for terror, violence and disturbing images, I think this is one time you should heed the warning and watch this one after the little ones are asleep."

","One monster movie that aims to be just as fresh as Japanese Kaja films, such as the amazing Godzilla starting in 1954. This movie however uses monster movie elements that were not original, but that's acceptable because no story is original.<br/><br/>The plot is as realistic as it aims with the exception of how the characters experience the story of the movie. The characters were the only human beings who have encountered the monster 3 freaking times. The first was when the military was trying to kill Cloverfield with very loud gunfire and monster screams in the battle. The 2nd was that the monster crashed down the helicopter the main characters were on. The 3rd was when Hudd got eaten by the monster, and the camera actually survived the fall. How the characters keep getting unlucky more than the other unseen citizens of New York is far from realistic, just to decorate the plot.<br/><br/>There were 2 weaknesses in the film. The parasites falling off of Cloverfield only had 1 scene in the film and were an unnecessary part of the story just to keep the audience paying attention before the monster strikes. Also, the Nuclear bomb that was dropped on Cloverfield was not technically explained in the film, the audience was not told that of the military's ultimate plan to kill the creature.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is a pretty good movie.

Next, the tension is pretty interesting because you'll never guess how this 'thing' is going to appear. The attack hits, the movie progresses, and some pretty cool scenes play. I was fully immersed in the action, and I surely enjoyed myself. The main problem I had with Cloverfield is how hard it tried to be something creative, or new. I was fully into it, and such, but at times I was asking myself why did they even do this? Not in a bad way, but sometimes it annoyed me. Otherwise, the movie was pretty good. The acting was pretty average. For new actors that I have never seen, they did good on their part, and I wasn't yelling out how 'unrealistic' it was. The special effects were the highlight of this film. It looked so real at times, but others fell short. The 'found footage' aspect gave the special effects a more realistic and intense feel to it, which I loved. All in all, I enjoyed my thoroughly. If your looking for something new in these found footage films, or even action in general, you will be surprised. Some parts MIGHT set you off, but overall it was good. 7/10."
"Vomitron_G","7","0","0","5 November 2009"," A concept that isn't new or refreshing,... but it worked all the same.
","The first 20 minutes or so of the movie, it wasn't the camera work that got on my nerves (it never did, really), but the characters who were introduced to us. Yes, I know, it was necessary, as we're supposed to feel for them, care about their problems, pick up on the romances & sex-talk, etc. etc. But I still saw nothing but a group of shallow twenty-somethings that had nothing substantial to say. Just a bunch of wealthy, modern day yuppies. Not exactly the most interesting social group of our population (although they always think they are). Why not have different groups of people (filming the events with digi-cams & cellphones) and have a couple of their story-lines cross each other at some point. Would have made things a lot more interesting, if you ask me. So, considering this film's high rating on here, I think most people fail to see that behind CLOVERFIELD's impressive façade, there's a better film hidden that simply wasn't made (or the film-makers didn't think about making). Just look at the Korean THE HOST, and you'll know what I mean with a better film. More interesting characters and better monster action. In CLOVERFIELD the monster didn't even form a direct threat for the main characters. There never was any interaction between them and the giant beast. So, one could argue that this isn't really a monster movie, but pretty much an old school disaster flick. Either way, what eventually saved the film, was its up-tempo pace. Aside from the lingering opening 20 minutes, the events followed one another tightly enough.<br/><br/>The special effects were fine and the action throughout the film decent enough. And with the hand-held camera swooping around, rest assured: It's not at all nauseating and there are enough shots where you can get a decent look at the giant beast (and some other thingies too). But the only way CLOVERFIELD works, is when you don't think about things. When you do, you'll discover flaws or think of things you would've preferred to have seen handled differently. You'll basically discover scenes & shots that are just too conveniently set up, too well-directed and just aren't very realistic (and with docu-style realism being the complete blue-print of this film, you can consider that a flaw). To add to the implausibility, the character who's filming all the footage practically filmed like everything the whole time. I doubt in reality anyone would be able to do that when trying to save your own life and that of your friends. To ""solve"" this problem, the scriptwriters just had him say things like ""I'm documenting! I have to document this! I'll keep on documenting!"" one too many times. It had me thinking ""Yes, I know this is supposed to be real found footage"", so instead of enforcing the authenticity of it all, it kind of took me out of the action and made me more aware of the fact that it was just a normal movie. I'm sure I wasn't the only one experiencing this.<br/><br/>But who gives a damn about these minor quibbles. I even ended up being forgiving, because I did enjoy the ride. So, regardless, CLOVERFIELD still is a fine GODZILLA-inspired monster-flick. And due to its bleak ending (of which we already get a pretty good hint because of the footage having been labeled ""The Area Formerly Known As Central Park"" at the beginning of the film), it's a whole lot less sappy than Roland Emmerich's blockbuster from 1998. That one ""feelgood summer hit-film"" true GOJIRA fans refuse to speak of and had the tag-line ""Size Does Matter"". At any rate, if you take out the popcorn and switch off your brain, you can have fun with both films. Big, dumb, loud, stomping grounds & levelling buildings. Works for me. The only real problem with both CLOVERFIELD and the American GODZILLA, is that they also pretend to be something else. Delusions of grandeur. Happens in all lines of work, I guess. I can forgive that if enough entertainment is provided.<br/><br/>Oh yes, why isn't this concept not all that new or refreshing? Just check out a film like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST (1980). Heck, the concept of a ""faux documentary"" even goes back to the days of silent film-making, with a film like HÄXAN (1991). So, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT may deserve some credit, but sure as hell not all of it."

WYSIWYG so just go with it.<br/><br/>This movie is a bit slow for, say, 15-minutes. After that it takes off and due to the (no longer a gimmick, but a bona-fide cinema school accepted story-telling vehicle)-jerky camera method keeps you straining not to miss anything. If your a fan of sci-fi and, in particular, the monster genre you are going to definitely be ""in"".<br/><br/>Now, since you have a commitment it's going to be a fast past rocky ride so you...Just go with it. And it really doesn't disappoint as even things that seem annoying pass quickly due to great tension. Unlike ""Lost"" we pretty much know what our protagonists are dealing with, an unexplainable unthinkable creature whose appearance has changed everything in short order. What makes it work is the jerky camera, the quite serviceable acting from the heretofore unknowns, and decent special effects. It is, I feel, hard to make a horrific monster that isn't campy, but the producers have succeeded in doing that with the limited revealing segments showing it and it's offspring(?).<br/><br/>If you like sci-fi see it, if you are enamored with ""creature movies"" definitely see it...Just, if you're like me, don't expect it to be better or more revealing a second time.

","I had no idea what this movie was about until I watched it. You will have read the various comments regarding the hand-held filming etc so I will not delve much into that. You will have to judge for yourself whether it works for you or not. This is no amateur movie however. It is extremely slickly filmed and edited. The lighting throughout is superb as is the so called amateurish camera work. Just enough light and just enough dark. Someone who knows their stuff very well indeed was responsible for the lighting and camera. I would liken the technique to a grand pianist who, just for the hell of it, one day decided to play a symphony perfectly out of tune.<br/><br/>You will like the movie or hate it, or, perhaps like me, be right in the middle with mixed feelings. I don't really like horror movies, because I usually end up feeling sorry for the monster or laughing at the pathetic special effects but this one was just that little bit different. You never really get a good look at the monster except for one short scene but that is no bad thing as it keeps you wanting, as an outsider looking in on the devastation, to know more. If it was actually happening to you I think you would be running for cover as far away from the monster as you could get. There is a kind of death wish feel to this like you were standing on the edge of a cliff and wanting to jump off.<br/><br/>I felt that the first 15 minutes were just too long, bordering on boring and I nearly gave up watching because of this. Get through this part and you will experience a unique piece of movie-craft. I have watched many many movies and can say that I have never seen one quite like it. This is not a copy of anything else. Truly unique. The big disappointment will be when they bring out the blockbuster sequel traditionally filmed.<br/><br/>We never really know if this is an alien monster or home grown so my little joke about killer lobster or is it killer lobster from space? Whether or not you like the movie for its storyline you will if you appreciate the craft of movie-making appreciate this one for the skill that has gone into making it."

","Let's get the obvious quibbles out of the way first: that someone, even someone as apparently irritating as Hud, should carry on filming come what may in they way he did is, well, very hard to swallow. And that battery life! As one of the characters might say: Oh my God! But, of course, without him doing just that there would be no film. Second quibble: surely to goodness Manhattan, what with all its gossips and their cells passing on the latest before it has even happened would surely somehow know a monster is on its way, especially a monster as extremely ugly as the one in Cloverfield. Ugly in Manhattan? Impossible. But apparently not. Having made those two, points, however Cloverfield isn't half bad. And the special effects/visual effects are quite remarkable. I'm assuming, of course, that they were special effects and that Manhattan wasn't destroyed for the sake of art. Plot there is none. Dialogue, only what you would hear from any gaggle of self-regarding yuppies fleeing a monster. Beyond that, well, nothing really. But it could have been a lot worse. Quite what the point of Cloverfield is is hard to say, so just enjoy the ride."

","I was lucky enough to see this film without knowing anything about it, and so, even though i am going to be economical with the truth, i have marked this post as containing spoilers for those who haven't already seen the film. <br/><br/>The film opens and we are lulled into a sense of security and the mundane as we explore the lives of our main characters, a relatively well off bunch of normal American 20 somethings. The whole thing is shot on what appears to be a hand held video camera. And then something Happens. Chaos ensues, and we begin to get to know our characters more intimately as we follow them through unfolding and seemingly inexplicable events. It taps, very uncomfortably, and unlike any other disaster movie I have seen, right into the vein of psychology associated with the imminence and possibility of terrorism, which is so prevalent in todays society. It deals with a huge, unnamed fear, which seemingly cannot be fought or escaped. <br/><br/>Although Cloverfield has split opinion quite widely, I find it to be an interesting, refreshing and in my opinion extremely relevant film, and truly a monster movie of today. Where another film would go for the gore and the jumps throughout, Cloverfield tempers its shocks with long periods of darkness, confusion and character development, letting us draw our own lines and conclusions. But the real strength of this film, and what makes it so genuinely frightening, is what is left unseen and unknown."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","0","4 June 2009"," Exhilarating and relentless experience that echoes the first-hand, hand-held footage of 9/11 and transforms it into a thing of pure terror and threat without exploitation.
","There is a scene in Roland Emmerich's 1998 film Godzilla in which a character is holding a video camera as the aforementioned monster walks towards him, eventually standing on him, but seeing the character survive. The notion of an individual with a video camera as a large monster gallivants towards them will almost certainly never be seen in the same way again following Cloverfield. Films like Cloverfield are the reason films like Godzilla age; they take the idea to another level and render a prior project, that wasn't done sufficiently well in the first place, close to complete garbage. If, in the past, we were supposed to chuckle at said scene in Godzilla with our tongues firmly within our cheeks, then viewing it again after Cloverfield will produce full-blown laughs; specifically AT the text rather than with it.<br/><br/>Some of my favourite films from last year carried a very brooding sense of both overall menace and danger, specifically: There Will Be Blood; Lust, Caution; No Country for Old Men and 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days to mention but a few. Cloverfield is additionally one of my favourites from last year, in the sense it carries a brooding sense of danger and menace but maintains a certain style; a certain craft and a certain aesthetic that makes the experience exciting, memorable and equally engaging but through different techniques. Shame on anyone that dismisses this as a shaky-cam, substance-less and seemingly mindless piece of entertainment that cannot rank along said films when in actual fact, it carries the necessary conventions to make it a worthwhile piece.<br/><br/>Cloverfield sees a group of contemporary Americans, armed with one of the most durable diegetic cameras in cinematic history, flee their apartment building on the night of a party as a huge explosion and subsequent events both horrific and mysterious transpire. They make their way through the ever-increasingly swamped city of New York, as populated by innocent by-standers trying to fathom what's going on, in the meek hope of finding Beth (Yustman), one of the character's partners. In every sense of the word, the film is punishing, but in a positive sense. The camera in Cloverfield takes more punishment than either of the two featured in The Blair Witch Project; the characters take a battering, the city of New York takes a battering through some impressive special effects and basic-as-you-like generic horror conventions take a battering. Take for example, the scene in the underground railway system in which the lights are off and something's in there with you: a set up so ordinary and so basic is actually made to feel fresh and quite frightening.<br/><br/>The film begins in an ominous fashion, with a subtitle telling us the following footage was found in an area 'formerly known as Central Park', planting seeds in our minds that suggest destruction and devastation - something seems to have happened that renders Central Park of the past tense. This additionally introduces the audience into a sense of viewership, thus placing us in the bodies of a highly ranked government official or someone else of vast importance as we sit down and prepare for footage of top secrecy. The film then goes down the very effective route of unfolding all this entirely from a first person perspective, that of a character named Hud (Miller) who is holding the camera, which really immerses us in this unfolding, ensuing action-come-survival film.<br/><br/>The point of attack, in the nicest possible way, sees a surprise party held for Rob (Stahl-David) as he heads off to Japan (a reference to the nation that gave us Godzilla) to start a new job. The opening features all the typical, hand-held shots as shot by someone at a party and sets up the shooting style for the rest of the film. During the set up, we get various paper-thin introductions to various people that do not necessarily require immense introduction, but need enough on them for us to be able to invest time with them. This, however basic or mundane, Cloverfield achieves during this segment. The characters that we do follow, along with Hud the camera man, consist of: Jason (Vogel); Marlena (Caplan) and Lilly (Lucas).<br/><br/>The film deliberately lacks that narrative drive, with escape from New York and general survival the aim of the game. Primarily, the film sees its characters try as hard as they can to rescue Beth from her apartment in a part of town that has been hit by the destruction hardest. What unfolds is a street level drama that sometimes delves below ground or into the nether-regions of an apartment block in order to get a cross further thrills and chills and it actually works really well. A word on when they actually go below deck; in a scene that sees them begin in a subway station – a further stomping of 1998's Godzilla into a hole that it now thoroughly deserves to be buried in, when, you'll remember, the climax to that film saw equivalently-sized beasties stalk the lead characters through a subway station. Oh, how that is looking old now."

","It could have been a very banal horror movie. Or it could have been a special effects blockbuster. Yet director Matt Reeves chose to do something different here. He put a video camera in the hands of one of his rather uninteresting yuppie characters and pretended that the whole film is a documentary starting with a good-bye party in Manhattan and continuing with a monster attack that plunges into pure horror, sometimes looking painfully similar to the amateur shots of the terror attacks on 9/11.<br/><br/>This improbable combination works better than expected. The amateur camera pretext beautifully compensates for the low budget of the special effects. With the course of action cut every few seconds by the pretended lack of skills of the camera handler or better said handlers the linearity and simplicity of the characters are hidden and the holes of the plot not so evident. We never see too much of the monster because as soon as we see him the human holding the video camera needs to run for his life, but this adds to the unknown of the story. And by the end it looks like the camera may be the only survivor of the bloody series of events.<br/><br/>This film could have been yet another teen horror or monster flick. It tries, dares, and succeeds to be something different."

Nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>Think ""Godzilla"" through the eyes of ""The Blair Witch Project."" What the makers of ""Cloverfield"" were going for was an American version of the infamous Japanese monster and to that end, they succeeded. Through the eye of a single camera, all the necessary tension and chaos is captured in a realistic manner. Forget the fact that the CGI on the monster is, well, unconvincing. In line with another like-minded movie – ""The Mist"" – the dodgy effects are redeemed by solid storytelling, tight pacing and shocking visuals. Lord knows, Hollywood loved destroying major cities on film in the past, and in a post 9/11 world, seeing buildings crumble and fire-balls raining down on the streets of New York City is all the more shocking. There's nothing overly glossy about ""Cloverfield,"" which is a testament to its genius.

I was prepared that this movie may suck after reading some comments here at IMDb.com, but it was better than I had expected.<br/><br/>The film already told us that the guy who holds this camera is not very smart so I didn't expect anything documentary-like or any good cinematography, just some home video that happens to record a monster-attack event in Manhattan. I think that all the characters and their stories are convincing enough. Rob loves Beth so he tried to go back and save her. (I would feel guilty for the rest of my life if I were him and didn't go back to save her.) Hut, the camera holder, was somewhat a stupid and annoying guy but he really does care about Malena. I can feel that in the way he talked to her after the attack happened. So, I did care for these characters, not very deeply, but I did. At least they seem like real people to me.<br/><br/>Next, this film makes me feel like I'm really watching a footage. I think that's one of its best success. The picture blurred and broken at times. Sometimes it was such a big mess and you almost couldn't see anything but chaos. Sometimes you only gets to see unimportant things like people's feet,and you have to use your imagination about what is happening at that moment.But that's what makes the movie feels very real as a footage.

No other monster/disaster movie can claim that. People want to see the famous city of N.Y. get crushed by a giant alien because the people who live and have visited N.Y. can say 'hey, I know that place, that's pretty cool!'

However there're too many differences between these two movies, and almost all of them, in a good point, in favour of CLOVERFIELD. I can tell two of them: First, CLOVERFIELD never tries to induce the viewer that what was been taped was real, was actually truth, unlike BLAIR WITCH which tried to do so with terrible consequences... Second, the plot is very different and definitely CLOVERFIELD has a lot more of action, interest and suspense.

","Cloverfield surely has to rank as one of the better ""monster"" movies made in a long time. It's filmed in a style reminiscent of ""The Blair Witch Project"" - one of the characters has a hand held camera and records the unbelievable events surrounding an attack on New York by a huge, somewhat dinosaur looking monster (although we never really get a clear look at it) that somehow drops little ""mini-monsters"" that create their own havoc. The film is then supposedly discovered by the government after the event. The weakest part of the movie, I thought, was the opening 20 minutes or so, focused on a party being given for one of the characters who's moving to Japan. To be honest, I found that whole thing a bore (and some of the rather unimportant material introduced in that opening kept seeping into the rest of the movie unfortunately) but once the monster is introduced (by way of what seemed to be a sort of earthquake that rattled everything and even made me jump) it becomes a very entertaining and at times rather frightening movie. It's at times confusing - and deliberately so, since it's attempting to draw you into the absolute chaos and terror that has suddenly engulfed this group of people. There's an eerie resemblance here to scenes of 9/11, with buildings collapsing and clouds of dust choking everything and papers flying through the air. Overall, it's very well done, definitely draws you in after that slow start and maintains the atmosphere of panic all the way through. 7/10"

So yes i loved this slapped together hand held - home movie type of film - with the most excellent effects for a long time. Loved it 100% only marked it down as it was a little short for me - i'm a bit of an epic freak - 3 hours is the amount of time i like to watch a ""super"" film ( green mile, schindlers list for instance) But i recommend it, if your into nail biters and action and a little of "" not quite sure whats happening!"" you'll love it. I did. I really must admit that i didn't know where this was going for the 1st 20 minutes or so - but once it all started to go ""so horribly wrong"" it was excellent. Well worth the hour and half it takes to watch it."

","I watched Cloverfield with a big, big delay with respect to its premiere. I was sort of turned off by all the very geeky hype surrounding this movie: nerds commenting on the trailer frame by frame, wasting their time on the Internet browsing through ""secret"" websites with mysterious numbers and code-names... moreover, ""Lost"" getting boring as hell shed a dim light on the whole J.J.Abrams world: did he lose his magic touch?, what if this is another invisible nonsense monster terrifying people on an island (in this case: Manhattan)? All these doubts prevented me from going to a theater, and so I only rented ""Cloverfield"" on a particularly dull evening. The movie? Not dull at all! The steady-cam technique gives a sense of reality and not, like in previous attempts, nausea. Never over the top, very effective special effects ensure more than a chill. Finally the nice unexpected gem: the acting. The young and not very famous cast delivered a very solid performance: we never had the hysterically screaming crowd on screen (and with a monster movie this is a strong temptation), but instead constantly tense and utterly believable drama. Bravo! The ultimate test for an excellent monster movie? When your friends who hate sci-fi tell you that the movie wasn't bad at all. Definitely a go on your home theater."

","Having been in the crown of the Statue of Liberty, and lived in NYC, the entire head being in the street seemed smaller than it actually would be if it were placed in the street. I have read reports that this was made 50% larger then it is in reality because of similar complaints, but since this happens in the beginning of the movie, it totally took me out of the movie and I just kept thinking, ""That was such a cool effect, why did they make it so small?"" Was it really 50% bigger? I was in it and from the angle; it looked like the people would barely fit in the crown if they were turned sideways. In the end, I guess it was just the angle, but I am still unsure and would need to do research. Anyway the effects were awesome and it was really a great idea and movie. The reason I did not give it a 10 was because they beginning of the movie almost made me walk out with the party scene just dragging on and all of the people gossiping and just being snobby. It seemed more like an LA party then one in NYC (except the music). I would have left that party. SNORE. It just went on too long and the Statue of Liberty head still has me questioning. The fact that it happened early on took me out of the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects, it was great, a great thriller. Definitely a buy as opposed to rent or pass."

It is NOT for those that know Lovecraft. But I digress.<br/><br/>The movie was wonderful and did exactly as it was meant to do. It gave you a snippet of a terrible happening that we will never know the meaning or origins of. We can only, as in any other movies, try to empathize with the characters if the directors and actors know what they are doing. For not having any BIG names, they all did quite well as actors in putting me right into their shoes.<br/><br/>Yes, there were questions all along but that made it even more suspenseful and intense. I am not a person who questions everything. I get on a roller-coaster and ride it. I don't wonder while I'm riding it HOW it works and how this and that, I JUST RIDE IT!!<br/><br/>Do the same and you will enjoy this movie.

","There's not much to comment on about the film, this is one that the majority of people will either like or hate, based on the expectations one has.<br/><br/>The acting is all well done, though the cast is full of unknowns and some are too pretty.<br/><br/>The directing is very well done, though the monster is rarely seen and the film could've been slightly longer with more plot devices utilized into it, instead of situations that are basically out of every other monster flick.<br/><br/>The shaky-cam is beyond annoying after a while. I didn't get the usual motion sickness and puke all over the person sitting in front of me. Nope. Instead, my eyes just got incredibly screwed up for a couple days, and I suffered a little dizziness. There's moments when the camera settles down, but it's so brief that it made me want more. If there is a sequel and it is done with the same techniques, please learn that not everyone has nerves like a 10.5 earthquake is going through them, some actually know how to keep steady when action is in front of us.<br/><br/>The music... there's hardly any music. Except for the nauseous background music our protagonists listen to, and the overture by Giacchino during the end credits.<br/><br/>The writing here is pretty original considering the genre this film is in. The comedy works well, mainly with comments from the cameraman. There's not much blood -- though a girl does explode, people are slammed with tails, and some are lifted into the monster's own jaws.<br/><br/>Overall, Cloverfield was a pretty good movie. It met all my expectations, and it was pretty satisfying -- it provided some nice chatting at school the next week.<br/><br/>Worth a rent, and maybe a buy. Really is worth 3 1/2 stars.<br/><br/>**Be sure to keep your eyes close to the screen to see the object that falls from the sky at the end of the film during the Coney Island footage."

The story goes on to describe how they spend their night trying to save themselves from the worst nightmare of their lives on the streets (and below them) of Manhattan. The entire mayhem created, has been made to be more realistic by the use of the 'Blair Witch Project' style, and kudos to the entire team for putting in an effort that makes you feel that its all happening to YOU!! <br/><br/>Its scary,its thrilling, and its a must watch for people who love Real life action/ horror flicks."

","I don't get why this movie either gets, like, perfect ratings, or really terrible ratings. It wasn't that bad and it certainly wasn't the best movie of the year. <br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" is about a group of young adults at the main character's, Rob, going away party. Then, suddenly, there's an ""earthquake"" and a quick blackout and the characters go out of the apartment to see what has happened. Once they reach the street there's a huge crash and an object falls in the middle of the street, which is revealed to be the head of the Statue of Liberty. And they try to escape and then the main character, Rob, realizes the girl he loves is still inside the city, so they go back to save her even though the monster is still attacking, and blah blah blah. You know the drill. <br/><br/>Too be honest, I found this movie only okay, because, well, it was very disappointing. I guess there just wasn't enough suspense or something, like it wasn't bad, but it was great, it was okay. An okay movie. The type of movie you'd watch once or twice. Like, it was a unique idea, first person camera work, and a huge monster attacking New York city, instead of Japan. But, it could have been done much better. Much better. <br/><br/>I liked the movie, but I didn't love it. <br/><br/>If there's one thing I gotta say, it's that the monster ""Clover"" is actually really cute, towards the end of the movie where the character Hud (the guy with the camera) comes face to face with creature I couldn't help but think, ""Aww, he's the one attack the city? But, he's so cute!"" Haha, but then of course he eats Hud's upper body so then it's not so cute. <br/><br/>And credits song ""Roar"" is really good, too.<br/><br/>But, yeah, all in all, it was an okay movie. Could have been done better.<br/><br/>Hopefully, if they do a remake (which they always do in Hollywood, just wait, like, 10 years,) it's better then the original.

","I had absolutely no expectations about this film since I knew nothing about it. This is not a film for analysis and intellectual criticism. It held my interest by the unexpected turn of the plot and the action. I agree that the party scene seems superfluous at first, but it sets the mood for a care-free hedonistic atmosphere of young people in Manhattan who are suddenly faced with death and destruction. OK, let's just say it, this film plays on our 9/11 sensitivity, and frankly, if I was a new yorker, it might have offended me. I should feel guilty for not having turned it off, but I could not. The film speaks for itself in that it reminds us not to take anything for granted as well as how fleeting and ephemeral a carefree existence can be. The sci-fi aspect is not the point. Although it is quite terrifying. The symbolism of the decapitation of the statue of liberty is chilling in view of what has happened in the past 7 years. This film is a new twist on the 1950's sci-fi films which were sublimating the fear of a communist takeover, although here it is terrorism. I agree with other reviewers on the lack of coherence and the been-there-done-that camcorder (Blair Witch) thing. However, the malaise and lack of a happy resolution make this film a cut above the ""War of the Worlds"" and other similar flics. The acting is as good as can be expected in this type of film and the effects are terrifying. I just have one question: who would ever have held on to their camcorder and filmed all of that while going through complete terror? But, like I said, one should not ask too many questions. Just go with it."

","JJ Abrams kept us in the dark with his film Cloverfield. Now that it's here, it's safe to say it lived up to expectations-and then some. Abrams gives a monster we've never seen before, a camera view we've seen only once before (The Blair Witch Project), and a film we probably won't see for a long time.<br/><br/>The film centers on a going away party in honor of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David), who is moving to Japan for a job. The party is being thrown by his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and Jason's girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas). Rob's best friend Hud (TJ Miller, in a role that seems like it was written for Rainn Wilson) is given filming duties for the evening, and we see the night's events from his point of view. Later that night, the party ends early when a huge monster attacks town. What makes this film great is that not only do we have a huge monster, but we have little monsters too. Rob and his friends later go searching in New York for Beth (Odette Yustman), his ex-girlfriend, whom Rob clearly still loves.<br/><br/>While the film has its good qualities (The monster(s), the special effects, Hud), it is sadly held back with its few problems. For one thing, it left more questions unanswered than it did answered. Sure that's fun, but this movie just went overboard on the unanswered questions. Another thing, with the exception of Hud, I found the other character quite annoying. And finally, the movie is just way too short.<br/><br/>Overall, a great and fun film. Please, please, please, JJ...make a sequel."

","I knew very little about this movie before entering the theater to go see it. All I knew was that somehow involved a monster attacking NYC. The story starts out with a going away party with characters that seem to reflect the modern day ""myspace generation"". We get a few laughs and a bit of some background on the main characters.<br/><br/>About twenty minutes in, we begin to see the path of destruction unwind as the monster begins to attack the city. The hand-held camera antics may bother some people but I thought it added to the realism of the movie. I really like the ""Jaws"" effect of not really getting a good glimpse of the monster until the end. Of course their were parts of the movie where you had to suspend your disbelief, but sometimes that just adds more drama and intensity to the movie.<br/><br/>I was on the edge of my seat most of the time and the total running time of 80 minutes was perfect for this flick. I've read some of the previous comments and I see that there are people who didn't like this movie just because they either ""don't get it"" or they just find it stupid and non believable. Remember, its Hollywood people, not a documentary!! I tip my hat off to JJ for being original and giving us something different for a change. I'm hoping for a sequel or prequel."

","OK, so it's not Oscar material, whatever that means, but all in all Cloverfield was by no means a waste of 80 minutes.<br/><br/>I only vaguely remember the TV ad campaign so I was going into this one pretty open-minded, and thankfully so as if I had read a few of the reviews on IMDb I may never have pressed play.<br/><br/>As far as shock/horror films go, it had all the basics. You've got some great ""holy sh*t moments"" topped off nicely with good but not excessive use of CGI and rather surprisingly, a cast of characters that I actually cared about.<br/><br/>This was the first film I've seen since the Blair Witch Project that uses the 'handy-cam' viewing angle throughout the whole film, and I think it worked extremely well. At the time I thought the 20 minutes spent on introducing the characters at the beginning was a little excessive, but after watching the whole thing it really balanced out well.<br/><br/>In summary, having no expectations of this film always meant I wasn't going to be too disappointed.

"jzappa","8","0","0","21 July 2008"," Truly Brilliant Technical Film-making Applied To A Usually Dull Class Of American Cinema
","Cloverfield transcends the reputable superficiality of Hollywood monster and disaster blockbusters. It goes beyond the simple eye-rollingly indulgent gimmicks and effects. The combined effort of the filmmakers results in a technical masterpiece in terms of suspense. There is an incredible intensity to the story and an extremely impressive relentlessness overall. This is due to the effect of revealing only what is observed through the camcorder incidentally held by only two or three of the film's characters, the reason according to the story why we are privy to any of what goes on at all.<br/><br/>It is preposterous for any consumer camcorder to endure past a 300-foot drop as it eventually does here, but nevertheless this technical device does so many wonders for this riveting monster film. It causes the viewer, if the viewer does not remain obstinately opposed to the film's identity as a Hollywood disaster movie, to be absorbed entirely in the story rather than the film-making. The movie's world becomes all too important to us because of how immediately and naturally this gimmick tears down the tangible obstruction between audience and on-screen life. Cloverfield succeeds at something the vast majority of American movies strives to do in this generation, which is tell a story while flaunting directorial style that appeals to the young eyes trained by the high-tech nature of this day and age. The film's premise, a video file recovered from a digital hand-held camera by the US Department of Defense, relies upon the organic use of a camcorder's perspective, a perspective which because of its accessibility ironically seems so much more immediately familiar to our eyes than 35mm film or computer-enhanced color-corrected hi-def video.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a truly scary movie that, despite its depiction of college-age characters with a huge social circle and a Manhattan setting, achieves a nightmarish claustrophobia. Though so much happens and on such a large scale, we only see so much, which is the object of unfolding a story on film. One cannot deny the effect of a giant monster that military is firing at with desperate force yet we cannot see, or destruction seen vaguely from the realistic faraway vantage point, or seeing straight from a character's perspective when they fall victim to alien predator."

","I really enjoyed this movie, though I am glad I waited for it to come out on HD disc before watching it.

I found myself saying: <br/><br/>""Run faster fat ass, I want to see the end of the movie!"" <br/><br/>several times. The first person angle got me so engrossed with this movie that, among other things, I sometimes forgot myself and worried about the ""cameraman"" surviving so I could see how it ended. I had a three friends over watching the movie with me, and a couple times that I yelled that they actually yelled along with me instead of just laughing.<br/><br/>Other than the filming style, this was a great movie. It was totally engrossing and fast paced. It created a great air of tension but only sparingly used the ""jump out and say boo"" element that so many other movies abuse and overuse, making it meaningless. Actually, there may have only been one of those in the entire movie! When the movie ended I wanted more, the hallmark of a good movie experience.<br/><br/>I might have to say that the acting was aided by the filming method, not relying on the actors to do much more than look scared and yell many times; but I couldn't actually tell you if they were good actors or not. It doesn't matter. This movie didn't need much acting as the story and direction were the real stars.<br/><br/>Took 2 points off because the camera work made me very dizzy in several scenes and I had to pause it and settle my head.

You (if you're optimistic and not close-minded)get somewhat into the human characters' lives(intentionally hum-drum for realism)that when the monster appears, the dynamic strikes home: is this what panic-stricken Urbania looks and feels like when confronted with an overwhelmingly hostile circumstance with no way out?

"Mike Astill","8","0","0","18 July 2008"," A fantastic monster movie!
","Let's get this out of the way right now. If you don't like monster movies, you're probably better off not bothering with this.<br/><br/>If you ARE a fan of monster movies, this is probably what you've been waiting for - a genuine attempt to reinvigorate a genre that's considered something of a bad joke (by movie snobs at least). Emmerich tried it with Godzilla a few years back and, while that was a good monster movie, it fell victim to pompous reviewers who clearly didn't have a clue what they were supposed to be enjoying. Similar comments seem to be getting fired at this movie, by people who unfortunately are not prepared to suspend their disbelief for a mere 80 minutes.<br/><br/>Their loss.<br/><br/>Cloverfield tries a different tack than your standard monster movie. With perhaps a nod towards Korean flick 'The Host', the movie focuses on the humans rather than the beast. It's all shot from the point of view of one of a group of (rather tedious) party guests, who tasks himself with capturing events as they occur on a camcorder. What we're witness to is everything that you usually get in a monster flick, but from this unique aspect - the merest glimpses of the creature to start with, followed by mass panic and, eventually, the wholesale destruction of a famous city and its national monuments.<br/><br/>The nature of the film being played back from camcorder footage allows for a couple of neat tricks, and an ending that raises a smile while at the same time being quite poignant.<br/><br/>The film - at a brisk 80 minutes - offers little backstory or exposition, which is something of a relief. While dry explanations and dubious scientific mumbo-jumbo are a monster movie staple, I can live without them, and they had no place in this particular movie. If you need to know more, there are a number of websites you can have fun with, and apparently a manga, that chart the lead up to the attack.<br/><br/>It's a brave movie that destroys New York in such a fashion these days, but I for one heaved a sigh of relief. Filmmakers should never be afraid to trash a national monument or even a whole city for fear of being insensitive, and in this genre it's nothing less than essential. I personally believe the film's choice of location is a bullish 'F you' to the idea of post-attack skittishness affecting media, rather than some kind of tasteless metaphor.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I had a lot of fun with this, and I'll be watching it again real soon.<br/><br/>Keep watching the credits to hear a fantastic, if slightly cheeky, monster movie theme."

Then those kids started to run. Run, chumps run! Of course, they acted just like movie characters act in monster/horror movies, not using their heads. Then again, if everyone had sense then there would be no movie. I wish for a sequel because I like the concept of Cloverfield. That monster has a lot of possibilities. He could become American's answer to Godzilla. Picture it. Godzilla vs Cloverfield. I'd buy tickets to see that. The filming the movie with a hand held camera would have been cool in parts, but it was used way too much. One thing that amazed me was how Cloverfield was shot with just 25 million.

","I didn't buy this movie. It was given to me by a friend to add to my DVD collection which I have catalogued on my computer. I rate each movie on a scale of 1 to 100 as I see it (which, of course, doesn't always agree with how the pundits rate movies) but when it comes to rating this movie, I am totally bewildered! Is it brilliant or was it a total waste of time? One thing's for sure, the producers were extremely brave to commit finance to it (especially when one sees the size of the crew in the credits)! The style is certainly unique (to me) and, for that reason alone, I found myself having to ""see"" it quite differently. Had I looked at this as a ""feature film"", I think I would probably have given up after the first ten minutes because the ""amateur videographer"" style is rather like visiting someone-you-barely-know with a mutual friend and, out of politeness, being obliged to watch their home videos! However, once the monster appears, the movie takes on a totally different perspective. When I looked at the ""alien invasion"" in the same sort of light as, for example, the events of 9/11 - that is to say, something that really happened, it took on a whole new sort of meaning. I found myself imagining that this had been a REAL event and, just as the movie is portrayed, a camcorder that had belonged to someone who had had the presence of mind to run it right through it had been found and the footage was being shown on TV afterwards. Now THAT was scary! I don't feel qualified to either criticise or applaud this movie (except, perhaps, to say that the ""pre-monster"" footage is way too long) so I'm not going to either encourage anyone to watch it nor am I going to warn them not to. All I'm going to do is admonish potential viewers to prepare themselves for something very unusual and, if they let their imaginations loose, something quite terrifying. Maybe, just maybe - IT COULD HAPPEN!!!"

","I just rented this movie, and I must say that I'm quite impressed. The movie takes a surprisingly realistic approach, and even though you can still feel that it is acted, the movie serves a nice survival experience. There is much CGI used in this movie, but fortunately it never gets to the point where you think you're watching video game-footage. The CGI is impressively good integrated in the film. The actors also do a nice job, although some scenes feel more acted then others.<br/><br/>Some might say that the basic idea of shooting a movie that is filmed by the actors (most of the time) is directly borrowed from The Blair Witch Project, but it doesn't share the same atmosphere. Unlike The Blair Witch Project, this movie offers much more on screen-action instead of hiding away all of the monsters (which I usually hate). The monsters are not spectacular realistic when on screen, but they could have been a lot worse.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of people, I didn't have too many problems with the ending. I think the characters were about to die anyway sooner or later since the film-footage was supposedly the only thing found at the site. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was the running time, which felt kind of short for my taste. But overall, if you want to see a movie that is finally different then the usual pile of typical cliché-filled Hollywood-movies then you should definitely watch this."

","This film is pretty effective in accomplishing what it's trying to do. It obviously is inspired by Blair Witch Project in its ""amatuer filmer involved in the action"" approach, but is more adept in utilizing it to tell a story than Blair Witch was.<br/><br/>New York gets it again, as in all the films that this one ""borrows"" from. (Cliché alert: the decapitated Statue's head lands directly in front of our heroes?) A bunch of twenty-somethings are having a beer party, when they're interrupted by the Blair Witch--I mean explosions. The guy who's filming the party wisely keeps the camera going, and through the footage, we experience what's going on as the characters do, through their eyes.<br/><br/>The one glaring goof in the movie is that situations arise requiring the guy to put the camera down! Of course the continuous footage is intended to show the audience everything these characters experience, but only a retard would be handling a camera while having a fist fight with a creature in the darkness. The movie makers could have found a better way to solve this problem. The fleeting glimpses of the menace are cool and avoid showing the monster until the time is right; but again, that same unsolved problem: the person taking the footage ""in real life"" would make more of an effort to film this strange invader.<br/><br/>The characters, although we learn a little bit of their back story through old footage partially erased (a very clever idea for expository flashbacks), are neither interesting nor likable enough to be identified with. After enduring their endless arguments, dim-witted choices, knotted hair, irritating voices, etc., I was ready for the creature to squish them all. Also, nobody handles a video-cam this poorly, not even the very first time they use it. Was he busy with a can of beer in his other hand throughout this entire episode?<br/><br/>In short, I pulled for the invader to win. At least it had some creativity in its actions. And some intelligence.<br/><br/>Even with the minor pratfalls noted above, this is an interesting and entertaining film to watch. Note that the abrupt ending with many unanswered questions points directly at a sequel. I hope the guy filming the sequel actually knows how to use a cam-corder."

","If anyone is familiar with the old Godzilla movies, you'll understand. The parasites and the shape of the clover field monster reminded me of the three combined with a common trait of destroying New York and the bridge and being Immune to weapons except a nuclear weapon at the end.<br/><br/>It got annoying at some parts, such as the way how the camera lasted for more than 10 hours, and the continuous jerky movements of the camera. Though it is the first movie (from what I have seen) that they presented it from a victim's point of view, the plot was slow and not understandable, such has how the monster got there, and why did people burst from a bite from a parasite? it seemed more of a thrill ride with a slow beginning, a few spots of excitement, a slow ending.<br/><br/>Rent it first before buying it."

","This movie had the point of view of a video camera, so it is disjointed. This, of course, is the point. It is also an excuse for sloppy film making. I can live with that.<br/><br/>The story benefits from never really explaining where the monster came from or what it is. It is very reminiscent of a nightmare one might have. It is an unfeeling, noise making monster just bent on destruction.<br/><br/>We never really get into the characters, but they do seem to work together fairly well, and are likable enough. They are superior to the cardboard cut outs of the usual delinquents and absolute video arcade characters we usually get. They seem to have genuine feelings, and no unexplained hostility that we get all too often.<br/><br/>It revolves around New York City, and seems to dwell on that, even to a chauvinistic effect, so it does turn off non New Yorkers. Not a good idea, as New Yorkers are not close to the majority of the world population.<br/><br/>It also seems to have little monsters with the big monster. Not much sense, but at least the movie doesn't try to explain it. We are simply on the ride, so to speak.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes are almost always fatal, so the credibility factor dropped a notch, but not enough to really hurt.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is an in between sort. Not great, not bad. It takes chances, and has some assets. Probably better than most crap produced by the morons in the industry. These people have some sense. It would rate higher if it was more interesting. Still, not a bad movie."

","The movie was definitely well thought and done. I give it high marks because of the actual thinking that was involved in creating the concept of the movie. After all, anything else in a film is secondary to the main concept. The actors played well, the music score was suitable and the special effects great.<br/><br/>However, something was missing from it. Or something was extra. I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Whenever I got closer to their state of mind that annoying guy would start shouting 'Oh, my god' again and again and that spoiled it immensely. What can I say, maybe Americans or at least New Yorkers would feel differently watching the film. The greatest problem, I think, was that they first 20 minutes were completely useless. If you watch the movie from minute 17, actually, you are not missing anything relevant.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it is a great tension movie. A bit of horror, a little monster here and there, lots of 'out of control' fear... I think it worth watching and definitely one of the best horror movies around."
"Stevek-48","8","0","0","25 June 2008"," Very good, but I wanted it to be better!
","I'd heard lots of good things about this film and have just watched the DVD version of it. I enjoyed it enormously - the writer, director and actors did a great job, but somehow there was something missing for me.<br/><br/>There are a couple of conceits in the story that are necessary, but just a little annoying. Why do these outer space monsters always attack big cities? Why is it always New York? Yes it looks good having the Statue of Liberty's head rolling down the street, but... And I defy anyone to be under attack from a hardly seen monstrous creature and still try to film it rather than running for their lives. But they're small points.<br/><br/>The hand-held thing is good - it's kind of Blair Witch, but with an actual plot. Occasionally it's a bit wearing, but I really like the way it allows us to see glimpses of different parts of the story and just a hint (mostly) of the monster. The monster itself is a bit bizarre. It's not actually that scary, except for the fact that it's incredibly huge. You don't see that much of it, just the results of its actions. Not explaining where it comes from or why it's here is a great way to unsettle an audience. There's nothing reasonable or even credible about what it's doing. It's just on a rampage and we're in the way. Is it eating people because it's hungry or just because they're there. Given the size of it we can't be much more than an olive starter for the monster, so it's not really clear why it would even bother.<br/><br/>The actors do a great job, with what is really almost an improvised piece (or it sounds like it is - no offence to the writer!) Trying to make these characters real and making an audience care is not easy. And the fact that any one of them can be killed at any time ups the tension (not like your normal stalk and slash film where you can just about tell who is going to die and who'll be in the final reel). And those parasite things are a little too reminiscent of the facehuggers in Alien.<br/><br/>It's a bleak film - there's no happy ending, no tidy tying up of all the plot points and no explanation at all of what actually happened.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film - and I can't even really put my finger on why it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. The tension is high, but it didn't leave me gasping in amazement. it just lacks a certain something that would have really racked up the suspense and I think that's a missed opportunity. Still it's definitely a film worth watching."

","The only bad part about the movie, was the guy filming and his GO**AMN COMMENTARY. Amazing movie apart from that. He made the most annoying comments, had an annoying voice, and says the worst stuff at the worst moments.<br/><br/>Apart from this I thought the movie was great. I am a fan of the hand held camera style (although Blair witch was bleh). Cloverfield contains suspense, a lot of unknown stuff which is cool, you know exactly what the characters know, nothing more, which adds to it a lot. The special effects tie in perfectly with the way it was filmed, you'll know what i mean when you see it. I recommend the movie, just be sure to take his commentary for what it is, annoying, and unnecessary."

","After seeing no trailers for this film or hearing any of the hype, I had no expectations or idea what the film was about. I was pleasantly surprised at the suspense of the film. I agree with some of the other people on here about it been slow to start off and certain parts of the film could have been explained in more detail i.e. why did the woman's head blow up after she was bitten? All in all it was a fairly good film, some good jumpy bits, humour and special effects. To all the people who are saying stuff like ""how could a camera withstand a nuclear blast"" and ""The EMP Pulse from the nuclear blast would have destroyed the circuits in the camera"" i ask 1 simple question.....At which point in the film was a nuclear attack ever mentioned. The military dude mentioned ""Hammerdown at 0600"". But at no point during the film was it said that this hammer-down would be a tactical nuclear missile (or any other nuclear device) Right at the end, under the bridge you can hear bombs been dropped, BOMBS, not BOMB. Why drop several nuclear bombs? Answer: You wouldn't. You would drop numerous conventional weapons. With what I have just said in mind, i do agree it is a little far fetched that a small bridge would provide enough protection to save the camera but hey, never mind.<br/><br/>Also, the ""goof"" about ""At the beginning of the movie the caption reads 'Digital SD Card' as the format for the recovered video footage. However, the actual playback MUST be coming from a tape and not a card as we get occasional glimpses of the footage previously recorded on the tape. SD cards don't work like that"" - Yes, the playback will have been coming from a tape but isn't it obvious that you would transfer the footage off a corrupt able magnetic format i.e. TAPE onto a more stable format i.e. solid state memory. I don't know, maybe its the IT Professional coming out in me but I know i;d rather consolidate a number of tapes onto a SD card or other type of media instead of keeping hundreds of different format tapes lieing around.<br/><br/>Also, at the end of the film, in the big wheel, look to the left of the boat in the sea, there is something that splashes down...<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the point, i liked the film but it could have been better.

","Seems like people either really loved or really hated this movie. I wonder if that depends on age, previous exposure to this type of hand-held camera filming, or level of cynicism. I thought it was a great love story, an exciting monster movie, and had a memorable ending. But I also thought it was filmed for 20-somethings, who are the only ones with brains jittery enough to catch all the dialog, asides, incidental events and so on that are thrown at you. I'm in my 60s, so the jitteriness was hard for me to follow, but I still loved it.<br/><br/>The camera dude, Hud, was an interesting character. He reminded me of Samwise, not too bright, but dogged devotion, and he had a goal, he knew it was important to film everything so people would know what happened. I kept waiting for him to drop the camera and run, which anyone in his right mind would have done about 6 minutes into the attack, but of course there would have been no movie then. I found him pretty amusing.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Rob's character, he was heroic in his determination to rescue his girlfriend. It was admirable, and a sweet love story in the midst of the destruction. Many have said it was cheesy and clichéd, which may be true, but love is still a potent force and I love watching heroes. Anyone who wasn't moved by the ending has to be heartless."

","Yes, I was unimpressed by Blair Witch and I am equally unimpressed by Blair Witch 3: Cloverfield. The characters are shallow and frankly I hoped the monster would hurry up and kill them off so the camera could be picked up by someone INTERESTING who might actually know how to hold a camera, take a decent shot of the monster and most of all shut the hell up. Those army guys all seemed to have good quality helmet cams, why did we have to see the event through the eyes of these cretins? This might have made a good 15 minute web-film but it drags on and on as an almost normal length film. The rats in the subway tunnel had the right idea, run away (from this movie). Borrowing the worst from Blair Witch the film tries to make up for it for ripping off Godzilla and Alien while constantly recapping what we've just seen 5 seconds ago for posterity and asking questions to which the answer is blatantly obvious. Would have killed them to actually turn the camera towards the monster? Scenes where the monster could be seen if the camera was pointing at it, instead follow the lame character's we've been forced to watch the whole time, for someone claiming he wants to document the event, Hud seems to be allergic to actually doing so, we tend to get 1-2 seconds of monster followed by 30 seconds of whining reaction shots from the characters. The effects range from very nice to absolutely pathetic, the angled shots were worse than old batman episodes, if your actors are supposed to be walking at a harsh angle using walls for support, make sure the clothes and hair on them doesn't reveal that they are on a flat set with a tilted camera. My idea of a good exciting monster movie is not following a set of random victims who wouldn't have even rated names in the credits of a real film but one have been ""Yuppie victim #1"" etc. The good news is that the boys at Rifftrax did an alternate audio track you can download and run with the film to make it watchable.

Better then anything I have seen in a while, yet the film lacked a story and in the end you are left with nothing, with no ending, probably due to the fact that they want to make a sequel that will most likely be horrific like the rest of the movie sequels. We never find out what happens to Lilly, who or where the monster came from, and most importantly what happened at the end? Before the movie begins it will come to an end, yet it still had some great visual effects, it was suspenseful and it was unique, a type of movie that you probably have never seen before. Overall the movie was definitely above average yet the public and mass advertising of this movie made it seem like it was the best of the best, which it didn't turn out to be.

It's not about compassion - of course you'd have it, but it is about survival - yours. And New Yorkers know better than anyone that self-preservation is the number one thing on their minds. Especially when Godzilla - or a reasonable fact similar - comes to town.<br/><br/>Again, this was NOT a feature film. I could have seen this in the SCI-FI cable channel and have been thoroughly entertained. Especially with it's running time.<br/><br/>There is something marketable about the idea of this film, but when you pay upwards $15 to sit down and look at it, you're pretty much ticked. The beginning of the film - the set up - was plausible enough - but it just went on too long for my tastes. And there were a few plot holes left for the viewer that could have easily been worked out more for the suspense of it all, which it was not. Sorry, but I felt that the film was ""going somewhere"" - - then the strike happened and they had it end it abruptly to get it to the theaters.<br/><br/>They're doing a sequel and for the first time I'm going to write: GOOD. This is one film that needs one, and my fingers are crossed that they don't fall into the same mistakes as before.

","I watched Cloverfield the other night and have to say that I did enjoy it. The movie is all told from the viewpoint of a group of friends with a video camera so maybe avoid watching it on a big screen if you are prone to motion sickness.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film begins at a surprise going away party for a man named Rob who has got a job in Japan and is about to emigrate there so the Manhattan apartment is filled with people having a good time until the power briefly fails and there is a tremor. They all rush to the roof after hearing an explosion only to flee out of the building to the street when debris rains down and the power totally fails.<br/><br/>Once in the street the action really begins and they catch a glimpse of a giant monster on a rampage. The group tries to leave Manhattan via one of the bridges but are foiled when the monster smashes it killing Rob's brother. Rob then decides to go and rescue his girlfriend Beth and his friends follow leading to encounters with monsters and so forth.<br/><br/>The reason I enjoyed this film is because it makes you feel on edge as it is quite claustrophobic because the only viewpoint is through the hand-held camera and I found it quite exiting. It also has a running time of about 80 minutes so it is not dragged out too long. The special effects of buildings collapsing and the monster itself were really good and realistic enough that you don't feel like you're only watching a movie.<br/><br/>I've noticed that this movie divides opinion between those such as myself who can switch off enough to enjoy it for what it is, an hour and 20 minutes of entertainment and those who like to expose improbabilities such as Rob stealing a phone battery from a looted electronics shop and using it in his phone without needing to charge it. Also, the fact that the cameraman films unlikely moments such as when Rob has to tell his mother that his brother has been killed and moments when they are being chased and the fact that a half demolished skyscraper is leaning on another without collapsing.<br/><br/>What gets me about those that enjoy picking films like this apart is that they complain about things like the phone battery, which are plausible as I have bought electronic gadgets that are supposed to be charged before first use but which do actually work for a bit before the first charge and the fact that the tower of Pisa has been leaning for centuries without toppling but fail to mention the biggest implausibility of them all which is the fact that a 100 foot tall monster is rampaging through New York and can't be killed by conventional weapons.<br/><br/>If you don't like implausible plots and dialogue then why do you watch movies? I admit that this film does corner itself by only using the hand-held camera but it was very entertaining. The only complaint that I have is that it ends very suddenly and you don't get any closure. I wonder if a sequel is on the cards?"

","Yes, the visual effects are very impressive, unfortunately, there isn't a single likable character (all through the picture, I was thinking it's a good thing they all die--made obvious by the opening title sequence). The characters are all such jerks, you find yourself really hoping for them to get killed off in really creative ways (alas, no especial creativity except for the one almost likable character who explodes after getting bit by a parasite). One of my friends kept saying, ""but they're New Yorkers, of course they're asses, that's just how New Yorkers are,"" but I think the writers just didn't want to give us any characters to be emotionally invested in and have to change the ending because audiences thought it was too much of a downer. Blair Witch was sort of the same way--you really didn't like the characters all that much, so you didn't really feel too badly about them all dying.<br/><br/>On another note, I was actually surprised this got a PG-13, given how graphic a couple of the scenes are. Hopefully, the sequel will have better characters while maintaining the quality of the visual effects and maybe improving the suspense some."

It is a risky strategy using a first person camera style and can go horribly wrong (Blair Witch Project). But this has been carried out incredibly well. The director has managed to capture a glimpse of the true horror that these people would have been facing in this scenario. I actually like the fact that very little is explained  it feels more realistic to me, as the film is trying to place you in the shoes of one of the civilians. If you were just going about your business on a normal night in NYC and that kicked off, you wouldn't have a clue what the hell was going on, you would panic. For the same reason I think some of the seemingly flimsy dialogue can be excused. What the hell would you say if a huge monster starting tearing up a city? I think this film captures the shock and horror of a classic genre perfectly and adds a new spin to it.

","This movie is a good story and some some great scenes But what i hate is when they focus on the people inflicted in the conflict and not the actual action and the camera moving is so goddam annoying you miss out on the good bits, lucky i don't get motion sickness but I've heard many people do. This type of directing is becoming more frequent i would rather see the actual full scale battles with the monster/alien than people running away and trying to survive. It is exactly like WAR OF THE WORLDS (remake with Tom Cruise and that annoying Dakota Fanning)and the entire movie was based on their survival, who cares whether they survive its the action of battling an almost invincible enemy thats the thrill and true excitement of the movie, Look at ALIENS (James Cameron) it was brilliant full of action and also showed survival. ;) Pls stop with the BLAIR WITCH film type of movies before you have a cinema of motion sick people. Also i agree with another persons comment that this is just a rip off of Godzilla and the creatures in it reminded me of PC game Halflife Opposing Forces aliens that shoot spines but excellent special effects just a pity there was only a few of them though out the movie"

","When ""Cloverfield"" was released earlier this year, much whoop-de-doo was made about the fact that in the film, the viewers are supposedly watching footage of a monster attack on New York City, shot with a hand-held video camera by one of the characters. This obviously brought about comparisons like ""It's Godzilla meets Blair Witch!"" Unfortunately, I absolutely HATED ""Blair Witch"" so that was not a major selling point for me. I do love me a good giant monster story though, so when the film became available thru my cable system's On Demand selection I decided to take the plunge and see what all the fuss was about, and ended up being pleasantly surprised. You know how in EVERY Godzilla-style ""giant monster"" film, there's always at least one scene of hundreds of citizens running panic stricken through the streets, pointing up at the creature and screaming? ""Cloverfield"" is basically a ""Godzilla"" story told from the viewpoint of a few of those people. As the film opens we find ourselves in the apartment of Rob Hawkins, a twentysomething who's about to depart to take a new job in Japan. His friends have gathered for a surprise farewell party and one of those friends, ""Hud,"" is given a video camera and asked to walk around gathering ""testimonials"" and farewell messages to Rob from everyone in the room. Even though he doesn't really want to, Hud begrudgingly begins his recording, and then a huge explosion suddenly rocks the building. From there it's ""on,"" as the characters rush outside just as New York City descends into chaos. Some sort of huge creature is rampaging through Manhattan and we follow Hud, Rob, and several of their friends as they try to make it out of the city for the rest of the film. Would it violate spoiler rules to say that some characters make it, most don't, and it's a white knuckle ride all the way? Though I expected the shaky, ""hand held"" camera work to be distracting, I honestly didn't even notice it anymore after the you-know-what hit the fan. There have been complaints on this very board about the relatively short run time (just under 90 minutes) of ""Cloverfield"" and that most viewers will still have un-answered questions at the end of the movie, (just where DID this critter come from anyway? Outer space? The Ocean? What happened to Rob and his girl after the camera went off?)but none of this mattered to me. I found it fast moving, occasionally heart breaking, and exciting, and it's something I would probably watch again."

","The kaiju genre is one of the best inventions ever dreamed up in Japanese soil. It literally translates as ""strange monster"", and that's exactly what it is, movies centered around the sudden arrival of a giant-sized, spectacularly ugly and scary monster in the middle of Tokyo. Staples of the genre are crumbling buildings, the giant foot of the beast stepping on a poor jap that stumbled while running, mayhem and generally useless military activity. I think the first Asian movie I ever saw was Mothra, which is about a giant butterfly monster invoked by the strange chantings of miniature twin geishas. Of course, the most famous kaiju monster is the reptilian anti-hero Godzilla. On his first movie he's a destroyer of humanity, yet on subsequent films he saves Earth from a gallery of creatures, presumably so he can earn back his title as its main nuclear nightmare. In 1998, there was an unfortunate American version of Godzilla which pretty much was an attempt at Jurassic Park on NYC. The movie featured an unrealistic evacuation of Manhattan. Now that US has been through 9/11, I think they've sort of earned the right to make a Godzilla movie. After all, Godzilla is nothing but a '50s metaphor for nuclear horror.<br/><br/>The catch here is the Blair Witch Project gimmick, in which the movie is actually ""found"" home video material from a camera with seemingly unlimited batteries and capacity, in which a group of friends go from late-night partying to kaiju chaos. It's a great catch, actually. Like in Blair Witch, we get to know the protagonists before seeing them in dangerous situations. Our friends here are saying good-bye to Rob, who's trying to return to a relationship with Beth, and the main survivor group is composed of his friend Hub (the one who ""documents"" all the misadventures, a nerdish, annoying, comic relief presence), Marlene, the best character in the movie (it goes without saying she's a wino), and a hot black chick. I can't be arsed to remember her name. They find themselves in the disorder of the (slightly more realistic than in Godzilla '98) Manhattan evacuation, and suddenly decide they're gonna help Rob find her girlfriend Beth, who's trapped and suffocating, somewhere in the island that's being destroyed by a reptile the size of the Empire State. Smart bloody thinking.<br/><br/>As you're probably guessing by now, I wasn't too in love with this movie. Its main problem was that, despite the superficial pains they took to make it a ""realistic"" witness home video (the recording over previous Coney Island footage, the date and time, the opening government disclaimer), it played exactly like a by-the-numbers Hollywood movie. Worse, actually. The characters in any teen slasher are more logical than these ones. If some guy loses his nerve and decides that the best course of action (instead of, you know, immediately calling his parents and close relatives) is to run into the danger area looking for some short-breasted chick who's probably dead, I think his mates have a moral obligation to knock him unconscious and save him. I can't believe in characters who are faced with a gigantic lizard and don't want to save themselves. That's not what's being a hero is all about. That's definitively not what a fireman was doing during 9/11. That's being a tool in a poor scriptwriter's mind. And some military guy suddenly decides that their suicidal tendencies are worth encouraging? Come on.<br/><br/>Now, technically, this movie is so cool it's a shame it got lost in a bad script. Even if it has been shot in obviously high quality, the constant jerking of the camera (although, gimme a break, this is not seizure-inducing for anyone who has ever watched an '80s videoclip) and the filters made me believe I was watching a first-person account of a giant monster tearing down a city. The way the monster is introduced is clever enough - we see the inmediate consequences of its rampage, and eventually (with a little help from the parasites that climb off him) we get to know it in increasingly irksome detail. But none of this technical (and creative) wonder is any good if the story the filmmakers are telling us has so many logical holes and unrealistic behavior. There are a million plot devices that could realistically set the survivor group apart from military aid and into the claws of the monster. There's no need to turn the protagonists into self-righteous cardboared figures who mumble Garfield jokes (ok, I laughed at that one) while wandering into the unknown. Basically, why do we need a comic relief cameraman? Cloverfield doesn't trust the audience to be smart enough to endure the ""found"" footage without a C-3PO hanging around? So it wants to be realistic, yet everyone is a bloody stereotype? I'll admit it, it's a concept that's easy to explain and sell, but hard to actually film in a realistic manner. I'd say the closest they can come to make a great kaiju in this postmodern style is to combine footage from news and various recording devices into one edited narrative. That way, it wouldn't look so staged and it would offer a bird's eye view of the story with the added ""reality"" element. Of course, that's not what Cloverield, Abrams and company try to do, but I'd recommend a change in priorities. Maybe for the sequel. Who knows?"
"dr_foreman","6","0","0","22 January 2008"," A decent time at the movies, but no classic.
","I like monster movies a lot, including both ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Godzilla"" (the Japanese one, not the Matthew Broderick one). So I guess it was inevitable that I'd see ""Cloverfield,"" which is frequently described as the love child of those two films.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I didn't find ""Cloverfield"" to be as good as its source material. This movie, unlike the Blair Witch or Godzilla films, focuses an awful lot on character development. That might work, except the characters in ""Cloverfield"" are mainly annoying yuppies involved in really shallow, neurotic romances. I felt sympathy for them during certain scenes, yes, but that was only because they were suffering - not because I especially liked them as people.<br/><br/>The other disadvantage ""Cloverfield"" has in comparison with its predecessors is that it features a sort of lame monster. I mean, sure, Godzilla looks fake and all, but at least I can identify him as a dragon-dinosaur hybrid, which is cool. Without giving too much away, the beast in ""Cloverfield"" just looks...bizarre. Icky. Messed up. I didn't think that it had a particularly iconic or memorable design, in short. I doubt that anybody will remember what it looked like 10 years from now.<br/><br/>I guess I'm being a little harsh, though, because ""Cloverfield"" has some good suspense moments and memorable apocalyptic imagery. And the characters aren't a total loss - at least they're loyal to each other, and occasionally one of them gets a good line.<br/><br/>It's just not a great movie, that's all. I'm a little tired, I guess, of horror films that focus on 20-something ""beautiful people,"" and I long for the days when monster movies featured wise middle-aged professor characters and plucky journalists instead of rejects from ""Dawson's Creek."" <br/><br/>Still, if you're interested in enjoying a few scares and experiencing mild nausea in the process, ""Cloverfield"" will deliver for you."

"BloodStone","2","48","265","18 January 2008"," Cloverfield: A thinly veiled soap opera disguised as a ""monster movie""
","Let me get right to the point. This film sucks major AS$!! One hour & 25 minutes of run time & MAYBE 1 minute total of actual footage of the monster. Plain & simple, Cloverfield is nothing more than a soap opera that incidentally has some ambiguous giant monster with a few cheap scares thrown in. And to make matters even worse, the film is done entirely with a hand held digital camera & the inept individual holding it either has had too much caffeine or it's his first time using the damn thing. Because it's all over the place. My seven year old could've done better camera work-WORD!! We actually get more footage of the ground than we do of giant monster mayhem-no lie. And the first 20 minutes of Cloverfield will bore you to tears with vacuous frat party chattering that amounts to nothing more than filler. No explanation of where the beast came from, how it got here, why it is attacking New York... in fact no real ending to the film. Even the critter's progeny aren't given enough air time & they resemble 2nd rate leftovers from ""Starship Troopers"" One other note to pass along; most folks when they are being attacked & gnawed on by let's say a pit bull are not worried about their damn camera. They're interested in just one thing-RUNNING! But not in Cloverfield! Also, most folks I know do NOT want a camera stuck in their face non-stop when they are having a personal crisis/tragedy (but gee they're just so darn tolerant in Cloverfield). So the argument some may use of ""realism"" to defend this rancid turd of a film is laughable. The producers of Cloverfield obviously must have seen the success of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and thought to themselves; ""WOW! Hey let's cash in! Except we'll have a giant ambiguous monster instead of a witch legend."" Problem with that is, once word gets out on how rotten this film truly is, they won't even come close to the box office take of TBWP. Warning: If you're prone to motion sickness DO NOT see this film because you WILL be queasy before the credits roll. <br/><br/>Bloodstone's recommendation: Save your money & go rent Peter Jackson's King Kong or a cheesy Godzilla film. Both would be vastly more entertaining & you won't even need to take a Dramamine before hand. <br/><br/>BloodStone's Rating: 2 out of 10"

I can deal with copious amounts of blood and gore. I can deal with hokey attempts to scare me with things popping out of dark holes unexpectedly. I can even deal with the ""must have"" love story woven into the plot for whatever reason Hollywood feels there needs to be one. What I can not stand though, is spending 12 bucks to walk in the door to watch a movie and end up spending 3/4 of it looking at the floor, the ceiling, the walls to either side, at the girl one row back and to the right with huge jugs... or anywhere else other than the screen because to do so makes me want to lose my lunch. I can appreciate that the director/creator wanted to go with a different way in telling the story, but damn, make it watchable. Both my kids and myself left so motion sick that our cokes and popcorn went untouched and we did not recover until the following morning. If they do go ahead with the sequel, I certainly hope that someone makes the executive decision to go back to a traditional filming method rather than this NYPD Blue on cocaine method.

The acting equally as terrible, though to be honest, I was too distracted by the low quality of film to really concentrate on performances. Also, the attempt at making the film ""realistic"" was truly spoiled by the high quality sound. I wish my camcorder could record sound that well. The special effects, those not ruined by the shakiness and over zealous and borderline egotistical filmstyle were actually quite good, too bad the film was destroyed by the poor choice to use a handy-cam.

I felt constantly bored, i normally don't talk during movies, but the whole theatre was laughing through-out the entire movie. i actually talked during this movie, it was dreadfully droll, and had nothing of interest, let me explain it more, and tons of spoilers. first off, i felt no sympathy for any of the characters, only the redeemable character was ""hud"" which he wasn't that funny. the soldiers in the movie were poorly portrayed, next time something big happens try to go filming in any military site, it's not gonna happen. also they would have been zip-tied and searched, and no soldier would let you pass through, and tell you about the EVAC, in that situation, you are expendable. if you notice during the movie in the bottom right there is a clock, during parts it disappears, and then reappears, we all made fun of it. ""oh look the clock is gone again! no it just turned back on ha ha!"" i also love that the huge monster can rumble manhattan, but then suddenly it disappears and re-appears next to the ""main characters"" and the rumbling ensues. also the same godzilla roar that's in every giant-city-destroying monster movie, the littler ones stopping to roar before attacking and somehow aren't afraid of guns, but they desperately ducking away from a fire axe (another superman stand in front of the bullets, but dodges the gun). let me end this because i could rant about this for hours. this was a dreadful movie, if you worked in the making of this movie please email me, so you can fix all of the major reasons why this movie is a flop. also the monster is from space, you see it crash down into the water in the last coney island scene, it was a cool idea for a hidden thing, even though coney island is gone now. all-in-all this movie is a plain, cheap cop-out, that is boring and unoriginal, not worth paying for, in fact this movie is barely a step better than ""dragon wars"" and a few steps below ""godzilla"" not the original, but the matthew broderick American version."

There's only one way for YOU, and only you, to decide whether the ride was worth the measly $10 entry fee. Experience the film for yourself.<br/><br/>Disagree?: You don't understand the premise or perspective of the film. Have you ever watched an eerie homevideo and thought, ""That sucked, the camera had a bad angle.?"" Highly doubtful. It's eerie, because it includes YOU in the experience. The unfamiliar and lack of control is terrifying, leaving unanswered questions opened. Real ""home video"" footage conveys this picture beautifully. That's the perspective the film took and that is what I felt. Too dumb to comprehend and appreciate this? Stick to idiot-proof movies like Godzilla, where you'll have the satisfaction of a moronic plot that includes a dweebie scientist who ironically knows exactly the origin and solution to the problem.<br/><br/>Note to Self: After seeing this, I feel robbed by every other movie I have paid $10 to see. This movie is not like any other movie I have sat through. It has ruined all hope for me to experience the same mental AND physical emotions I had during this film for future films."

","Cloverfield was an amazing ride. It featured a completely unique view of a monster flick, showing the action through the eyes of the people rather than birds-eye views or panoramics of the city. Granted, there is a purposeful amateur feel to the cinematography which may leave you feeling sick or annoyed with the camera shaking, but personally it was not a big deal at all.<br/><br/>The movie worked so well because of the unique mesh of realistic filming and amazing special effects. The movie put the viewer directly in with the action. Unfortunately, the movie is still clouded with mystery as nothing is quite revealed except the looks of the monster itself, but that only adds to the realism and awe of the entire experience. The actors and actresses were entirely believable and played the parts amazingly well. The movie is very intense and scary and arguably the best monster movie I've ever seen. Must be seen on the big screen, so go see it."
"Jonny-ironica","10","3","8","20 January 2008"," Better than any other monster-attack film...
","So, I've been seeing previews for this film since late last year and the teaser especially had me wanting to see it. What I'm writing tells a whole lot of the plot, so yes, it's spoiler full. However, this first paragraph has no spoilers, and gives an overall opinion over the film. The movie is shot from a hand-held cam point of view, which we all know has been done, but it gives the film genre a new and interesting take. However, if The Blair Witch Project made you nauseous, I don't think this movie is for you. Other than that, I think the direction is amazing. The special effects are nothing less than spectacular, but it doesn't take away from the film's heart. I gave it a 10/10 rating because no movie is perfect, but this has got to be one of the best efforts I've ever seen. Therefore, it does deserve a 10.<br/><br/>The film's first thirty minutes or so establish character development that actually makes you feel for the characters. Rob Hawkins' friends are throwing him a going away party as he's leaving for Japan for his job. It's discovered that he fell in love with his best friend, Beth, and they slept together. However, she brings another man to the party and the tension causes a fight. Beth leaves abruptly, very upset. You also get to know Rob's brother, Jason and his girlfriend Lily. Then you get to know Marlena, a sarcastic girl who has shifty eyes and looks uncomfortable. And of course, you can't forget the guy behind the camera, Hud, who has feelings for Marlena(thus causing her character's development).<br/><br/>A tremor, which some very pointedly point out could be another terrorist attack, sends everyone onto the roof where they witness an explosion that sends things flying towards them. They all rush into the street to discover the head of Lady Liberty being hurled down the street and because no movie is complete without sad humor that defines Americans, people start taking pictures of it with their camera phones. That sent me into giggles.<br/><br/>Fast-forward.<br/><br/>They are then rushed by the military to the bridge leading out of the Island, but while Rob pauses because Beth calls his cell phone, panicked and injured, telling him she can't move and she's bleeding, Rob's brother, Jason goes down when the monster's tail takes a whack at the bridge or something. Marlena, Hud, Rob, and Lily all make it off the bridge where they race to the subway. They all take a moment to grieve when who else but Rob's mother calls. At first at laughed at his ""Hiiii Mooom"" tone, but then it brought tears to my eyes when he had to tell her about his brother, her son.<br/><br/>Fast-forward.<br/><br/>They decide to take the subway tunnel to Beth's street and try to get to her. Here you hear some of the funniest lines of the movie from Hud and Marlena. They do have a good chemistry together. The tunnel features probably one of the scariest scenes where they are attacked by parasites that came off the giant monster. All in all, they survive with Marlena suffering from a bite and lock themselves in a room. They decide to try the streets again.<br/><br/>When they go up to the streets, they are found by soldiers and taken to a tent. Unfortunately, Marlena's bite causes her stomach to expand and explode(which you don't really get to see because as soon as the soldiers discover she's been bitten, they take her behind a tent, but trust me, the shadows are all you need to see; it's still pretty terrifying.<br/><br/>Fast forward.<br/><br/>Basically, they find Beth alive and remove the metal pipe thing(sorry for not knowing what they're called) from her chest and escape back down the building just in time.<br/><br/>Fast forward.<br/><br/>They get to the last helicopters fleeing the city before it's bombed. Lily is forced into a helicopter by herself and gets away first, supposedly surviving the movie.<br/><br/>Hud, Rob and Beth make it into another helicopter and are watching the monster run from all the things being shot at it. It supposedly goes down in a cloud of smoke and just as Hud is screaming something along the lines of ""Hell yeah! That's what I'm talking about"" the monster reaches up and promptly smacks the crap out of them.<br/><br/>The helicopter goes down, but Beth and Hud are uninjured. Rob is still alive, but apparently has a bad injury to his leg. (FYI, this survival is entirely possible, look it up if you don't believe it.) Anyway, the monster comes right in front of them and apparently chews Hud to death before spitting him back out. Rob and Beth grab the camera and flee to a bridge in the park. They document everything that's happened to them just before a bomb or something lands on top of them. The camera gets stuck under some rocks, unable to capture anything, but you hear Rob and Beth exchange their final ""I Love You's"" before supposedly being blown up and dying. However, people are already disputing this because after the credits, you hear someone say ""Help us"" played backwards sounds like ""It's still alive"".<br/><br/>My complaints with the movie are far and few between. The movie has some obvious plot points that have been used before. For example, when being attacked in the tunnels by the parasites, Marlena comes back to help Hud by beating one off of him instead of running. Later, this is addressed by Hud who says,""You could've just run, but you didn't."" Clearly, that's generic, but it's completely forgivable in this movie. All in all, I recommend this as long as the camera work doesn't bother you."

","All I can say is that this movie exceeded my expectations! At first, when the movie ended, I was upset how it ended. Then after some reflection, (by the way, if a movie can make you reflect about it afterwards, its worth the price of admission!) I understand why and how it was done! It had to be done this way and leave those unanswered questions! It is after all about a tape that was found documenting the events that happened one night in New York when a monster attacked. I was riveted the whole time and love the fact that it left me with more questions than it answered! I ended up coming home and combing the internet to try and find out more of the story...and guess what....there are official websites that help you! I became totally immersed in this world and left to my imagination, ( yes..there is still such a thing) I have slowly but surely started to put the pieces together! There are a lot of things you will question...such as how the camcorder battery ran so long. Well, since the movie is 1 hour and 20 minutes long...that seems to fit into how long a battery lasts and how much time you can actually tape for...roughly. There is so much I want to say about this film but I don't want to ruin the fun for other people who will take the time to reflect and search for my answers like I did. Trust me ...it's worth it!

You are thrown into the movie essentially moving with the starring cast and only know as much as they do, and what they might get a glimpse of.<br/><br/>In the end Cloverfield is a new twist on monster movies , and while it comes with some flaws(and motion-sickness *gurggle*) you will be left wanting more.

"nbaprincess2005","4","3","8","19 January 2008"," Very DISAPPOINTING Film...
","This movie should go down in flames with the likes of Godzilla (1998) and The Hulk (Ang Lee). Shooting the ENTIRE movie in 1st POV is AWFUL. This movie had so many JUMP THE SHARK moments. I'm surprised that J.J. Abrams would attach his name to such a bootleg project. In my opinion, the film did not live up to the hype. I had really high expectations for this film. As an avid movie goer, I left the theater feeling robbed. This film SUFFERS from poor directing and a BAD script. It's almost as if the script was unfinished. The shaky camera work was over the top. I went to see a 3:25PM show, it's not 8:30PM and I STILL have a raging headache. I've already taken 3 Motrin.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the film fell flat because I just didn't feel vested in the characters or the story arc. So many things were left unanswered, and it really hurts a film that doesn't have excellent world/story building to begin with. The script basically took a ""monster"" and dropped it in the middle of an urban area with a bunch of vapid twenty somethings. Maybe if the film had a different director, it could have saved the movie. The movie was shot so poorly, and to the point where it was just no longer believable. Saving Private Ryan is an excellent example of ""hand held"" camera work that was completely amazing. The same can be said for the I Am Legend, Jason Bourne Series, and War of the Worlds. This film could have used both elements of 1st/3rd person point of view. The fact that the director did not know when to switch between the two is DAMNING. I got the sense that the viewer never has a full scale gravity of what is taking place. The viewer is so focused on the crazy camera work that they miss so much of the emotional connection. These characters didn't mean anything to me. This has a lot to do with a POOR plot.<br/><br/>No back story is given. The powers/abilities of the monster and its darklings is left wide open. Why doesn't the monster die when it is literally hit with several missiles (F-16) and bombs from a B52 Stealth Bomber? It doesn't even die when it's nuked? Give me a break...The viewer has to suspend their disbelief for them to truly enjoy the movie for its own sake. The ending is predictable and abrupt. The movie was killed on so many other points, but a shitty ending is just the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>This is no Independence Day, which was an EXCELLENT movie. When I think of apocalyptic movies, this one won't even make the list. I Am Legend, Armageddon, Deep Impact, etc. all were better than this film.<br/><br/>There can't be a sequel to this movie. It would just be awful, unless a real director came in to save the monster lore. Such a bad job was done on the first one, that I don't think there is anything to really work with in terms of progression and development.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie just didn't grab me and take me for that thrilling ride. Wait for this one on Netflix!"
"arcticlvr1","9","3","8","19 January 2008"," Whole lotta' shaking going' on
","What can I say? I love the movie and everything about it. I had read all the reviews and watched the trailers and clips and really may have gotten myself over-hyped for the whole thing but......FOR ME, I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. I am a big fan of sci-fi/horror movies and thought this had a lot of potential, even though it carried a PG-13 rating. After the ""earthquake"" the movie goes head on into action/sci fi and never stops. When the Statue of Liberty's head lands in the street and people are scream I was going crazy. That was wild and fun to watch. Also, there is a lot of talk about 9/11 and such but you know what, I could not even compare or think about that while watching this. I am sure there are plenty that say it reminds them so much of it when the building goes down. In any case, if a building callopses, there is going to be a lot of dust and smoke ...... So the acting is first rate, the special effect are first rate, and the whole set-up of the movie is first rate. go out with and open mind, some motion sickness pills, and hopefully enjoy one of the best monster destroys a city movie in a long time."
"skluczkiewicz","6","3","8","19 January 2008"," Lost it's appeal
","I was never completely hyped up to see this movie. I looked at it as a ""down on the streets"" point of view of a Godzilla type movie and that's pretty much what it was. Unfortunately that point of view wore thin on me.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the set up at the beginning to get you interested in the characters you were going to follow around. I didn't mind a group of 20 somethings acting... well like 20 somethings. It all gave it a bit of realism. I had no issue with the camera being shaky (although I had to look away at one point when I started feeling some nausea). I even liked a lot of the aspects of the attack in Manhattan.<br/><br/>My issue was at some point in the movie, probably in the last fifteen to twenty minutes, I didn't care about it anymore. The whole thing just seemed to go on too long. I didn't care about the people we were seeing on the film anymore. I didn't care if they survived or not. I just wanted it to end.<br/><br/>I also, for the first time I can remember in the past few years, felt like I wanted my money back after seeing Cloverfield. That is a bit strong of a statement considering there were aspects of the movie I did like- the creature in this has a very cool design and let's just say the ""in the street"" fighting really feels like you're right there in the action. It's just that by the end of the movie I felt like ""yeah been there done that"" a thousand times in other Godzilla type movies. That's all it was in the end.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me as the other two people I saw it with really enjoyed the movie. It's just my opinion so take it for what it's worth."

","Whoever can say this movie is bad, should just order tickets to Step Up II. If you didn't know the movie was made with a hand held camera, then why did you bother seeing it? The movie was spectacular. In my opinion there was no need to find out information about what the monster was ...as far as what it ""is"", I think they just created something, as in not based off of anything I mean. The movie was extremely heart-pounding and is one of my top 5 favorite movies. I can't find one reason why people would not like it. The way it was filmed? If you didn't know, why see it. Did you expect it to be a PG movie? Those reading this that are actually into movies, it's absolutely worth the money and time for this movie. Even though ten dollars is not a lot, it may be to some.

"MisterJackMan","9","3","8","19 January 2008"," Good, fun and exciting
","This movie in my opinion was a very well done and enjoyable. Unlike most monster movies, you don't ever actually see much of the monster, which leaves you in major suspense. As noted, the entire film is shot in a style of a home video camera. If you don't like that type of look, don't bother going, because that is the main selling point of the movie. I found the movie its self to be very fun and at times edge of your set action. Although some may not like it for the lack of monster screen time, it seemed that it made it more realistic. As you can tell, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of movie."
"black_penguin","9","3","8","19 January 2008"," Groundbreaking film!
","I am a huge J.J. Abrams fan and I will probably spend my money on anything that has his name attached to it so predominately. But first off I feel I have to warn you, this is not the kind of monster movie for people who like monster movies. Now onto the film: This movie is an experience. The film gets in your face and includes you in the character's flight for survival. If you have trouble with motion sickness or shaky camera work, you might want to sit this one out until it makes the round to DVD - but if you can handle a shaky screen for 90 minutes, get there early to grab a comfortable seat a good distance away from the screen. There is no plot to this movie, which while it has it's downfalls, there are also benefits to that. There's no cheesy love interest to get in the way and everyone, and I mean EVERYONE is expendable. There's no way to tell who's going to survive based on where their names appear on the marquee. And when someone does die, it's a shock, but you move on. You want to get to the end of the tunnel and make it out alive.<br/><br/>But like I said earlier, this is not a film for people who love monster movies. You don't know where the monster came from, what it wants (if it wants anything other than wanton destruction, of course), and you don't know what happens at the end. There is no resolution; which makes it feel too much like real life for a lot of people to handle. But it does leave you a little shaken up. If you were frustrated with commercials and teasers and trailers that give you a quick peek of the monster as it's ducking behind a building or dodging into the shadow prepare to be royally unsatisfied at the end of the film. You don't see the monster. Again, a lot of people have a problem with this, they say they feel 'cheated', but until Alien 3 you don't really get a good look at the aliens in that series, unless it was moving into or through the shadows. I feel you see enough of it to piece together in your mind what it looks like, and your imagination will render it far better than any CGI house ever could. Assuming you have one, of course.<br/><br/>One thing I will say that really worked in his favor was he finally made a film that wasn't ruined by people talking and chattering and screaming during the show. At times it's hard to tell if it's the audience that's murmuring or the movie, and that's as someone that's stopped going to films as often because of all the chatter, that's fine by me. I enjoyed this film, but it isn't for everyone. If you like the work Abrams does for LOST, then I'd say give it a chance and keep an open mind. Just keep in mind that he asks many more questions that he answers, but at least he'll tell you why it's called ""Cloverfield"", if you're paying attention in the first ninety seconds or so of the film."
"koalabrai2021","8","3","8","19 January 2008"," This is the way monster movies should be done...
","Just saw the movie and still have the mild rush from it going on 30 minutes later. This is the way monster movies need to be done. We are talking Alien-style. You don't need to see the monster because your own fear and imagination can come up with something more terrifying than anyone in Hollywood ever could. The director knows this, the writer knows this. And that is why the hand camera first person view works. It really lets you control the movie and put it in your hands.<br/><br/>Look back to the 50's and 60's when anything that could grow to 50 feet would attack. Most of those monsters came from nuclear fall outs, accidents, testing or war. And so Hollywood played out those fears with the giant monsters attacking. Because that is what nuclear energy was. This giant unstoppable force, that was indiscriminate in its destruction.<br/><br/>It would be so hard to sell a giant monster movie to today's audiences. King Kong worked for the nostalgia factor. Godzilla was horrible. We have lived under nuclear power for far too long and no longer fear it. With the Cold War over the threat of nuclear wars has faded (and I mainly mean MAD type nuclear attacks, nuclear terrorism will be covered in a minute).<br/><br/>So what scares an audience when the raw unbridled power of nuclear destruction doesn't scare us? What scares an audience that is tuned in to everything, has constant media updates whether news, pop culture or even the smallest bits of trivia piped into our phones, computers and televisions. It is the idea of being disconnected, of not knowing what is going on.<br/><br/>That is what Cloverfield plays off of, the unknown. America's greatest fear right now is the uncertainty of the future. We did not see the attacks on the World trade Centers and the pentagon coming. We have know idea who controls all of the nuclear weapons in the old Soviet states. we have know idea how much biological weapons fell into the hands of Syria or Iran. Our fear is not in what we can see coming, it is in what we can't see. By not giving you explanations or clear pictures, the monster becomes more than just a monster rampaging a city. The monster embodies that fear of the unknown.<br/><br/>Once the fear is established, the movie's perspective forces the audience to evaluate what they would when the unknown crashes down right in front of them. Do you run from it? Do you find your lost love? Who do you want to be when it hits? And the best part is you are contemplating this while being taken on a well paced roller coaster ride, with highs and lows positioned at the exact right spots. It was expertly edited and shot so it let audiences relax before throwing them back into situations where most people would decide not to carry on.<br/><br/>There is a part of me that says the people that are looking for a concise explanation of every aspect has let Hollywood or TV totally destroy their imagination to the point that they can't fill the blanks on their own. Put, the video game controller down for a minute and think people. Sometimes the best stores we can get from the movies are the ones we fill in ourselves.<br/><br/>For those out there that want to see a good monster movie, in a time when it is harder and harder to scare audiences with the over abundance of torture-porn flicks or badly done big budget CGI-fests, Cloverfield is for you. You just need to go in with the right mindset. Let yourself become one of those people on the streets and in the buildings as unknown fear falls around you, then you will know what the movie is about and you will enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>For those that need their hand held through a movie because you are use to Michal Bay telling you why the big bad aliens are attacking, I am sure Matthew Broderick would be really happy if you picked up a few more copies of Godzilla."
"kyle-hellkamp","8","3","8","19 January 2008"," Definitely entertaining.
","Wow. Definitely a worth-while movie. It does utilize unoriginal techniques seen before, but for the way they wanted you to feel involved with the story, it works the best. It's funny when it wants to be, and serious when it needs to be. If you realized that the monster was an allegory for the fear felt in New York by 9/11, then congratulations! You paid attention.<br/><br/>Now for the bad parts. You can get a bit motion sick from the film. However, I get motion sick quite easily, and can only see out of one eye, and I didn't feel bad at all.<br/><br/>And than there's logic...Or lack thereof it. First, that camera is probably the strongest piece of technology on the planet (With ungodly battery life). Women are able to run just as fast as the men, while wearing stilettos. And while an inch deep bite yields the seemingly appropriate amount of blood (lots), impalement through or near the heart yields almost none. Just a flesh wound.<br/><br/>The average movie goer will get a kick out of this one. A few corrections and this one could have been epic. But still definitely worth seeing."

"mdaddy99","10","3","8","18 January 2008"," Exploits Human Emotion to Create an Amazing Movie
","Looking back at the history of monster movies, we find that he monster is often shown blatantly and often. In addition, any destruction of famous landmarks and military attacks are usually indulged to an almost ridiculous extent with hollow, undeveloped, throwaway characters and little story driven by them. So here comes the half movie, half experiment known as Cloverfield, which is shot from a hand-held camera for a more realistic effect and revolves around the perspective of a small group of friends. And it is ingenious. Now, I've constantly been lurking on websites that explain the back-story of the monster. Unfortunately for those who want all of the details, you may be disappointed to find that no true back-story is in the movie. This however, makes the creature itself all the more mysterious, and thus utilises this mystery to make the movie all the more effective. As in almost any monster movie, the creature is shown in detail (though not often). I was surprised to find that I got a more than decent look at it early on in the attack. Now here's where I honestly have to greatly commend the makers of this film. The monster and its parasites are really not extraordinarily ""amazing"" in appearance. Though they are cool, they're modest, and there's just not much that makes them too incredible. The reason that I love this so much is because, in a movie aimed at giving us the most realistic monster movie of all time (an oxymoron, I know), there is not going to be some hardcore creature with flame-breath and other useless features. Sorry Godzilla fans. As far as the story itself goes, it's extremely human-driven and does a great job at enthralling the viewer. For those of you who want action, allow me to say this has to be one of the fastest paced, intense monster films I have seen. There's plenty of military action here, and though it is often on a small scale, the pure intensity of it gives a rich, epic feeling. The destruction of landmarks is not nearly as tasteless and focused on as in past films as well. Humor is also plentiful and there are no bad jokes. In closing, there are a lot of plot holes, but because this is the perspective of the ""average Joe"" in a monster attack, I absolutely welcome them. You may not consider this to be the best monster film of all time, but at least consider it as a much-needed innovation to a genre that was, in my opinion, hanging by a thread in the mainstream movie market."

I expected something along the lines of Emmerich's Godzilla, but I was very wrong. From the moment this film starts, it's addicting. You immediately begin to wonder about these characters, will they live or die? Cloverfield is about a group of people who are throwing a going away party to their friend Rob, who is leaving to Japan for a business promotion. During the party, however, all hell breaks loose when an ""earthquake"" strikes the city (New York City). After an explosion, and the Statue of Liberty scene, they go on a journey to find Beth, Rob's ex-lover, who is trapped in her apartment.<br/><br/>Acting was very good from everyone is the picture. With no-names running the show, I was surprised at how good they were, considering monster films can be some of the hardest films to act in. And with a 30 million dollar budget, they did a lot. That is very little for a film(the average is about 70-100 million). J.J. and his team did a fantastic job on this film. With the mixed reviews, I was worried about everything that would happen, would it be worth the money I paid for a ticket? Guess what?

I won't say what the monster looked like but I could have never imagined what he was or what he does... It is not one of those cheesy monster movies that made in Japan (Although a reference to Japan is made) and the monster design and what it does is actually very original... They actually do a fairly good job of hiding the monster too especially for something that size. The only amazing shot of it is at the end of the movie... Either way I recommend you see it no matter what!"
"Jeen","9","3","8","18 January 2008"," One hell of a ride...
","Caught the film today...and after all the months of waiting, yes, it was worth it. CLOVERFIELD stands as one of the best, most visceral, suspense-filled films I have seen. It is a solid giant monster film, clearly in the league of GODZILLA (the original), THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and most recently, THE HOST.<br/><br/>To be more honest, it is actually a character-driven giant monster film. *Spoiler* Yes, there is a giant monster--where it came from, why it's tearing through NYC and how the hell it can be stopped is never made clear (but there is a lot of speculation made during the film). And yes, pretty much almost everyone does not survive by the end of the film. But--you do care about these characters. You do care what happens to Rob and his friends as they try to survive what is truly a terrifying experience. The monster itself is a scary beast, because you never truly get to see all of it. Also, the POV provided by the video camera adds to the suspense. This film is experienced from the characters' point of view.<br/><br/>And while the film was funny in some spots (thanks to the character of Hud), it is a white-knuckle thrill ride. It also has some of the most realistic CG I've ever seen--I mean, the film supposedly cost only $30 million to make, but it looks like a lot more.<br/><br/>True, it has the ""found footage"" angle of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but CLOVERFIELD is much, much better. Some may see it as a reinvention of the giant monster movie, others may see it as a shameless exploitation of 9-11 (which it is NOT). Some may just call it a piece of crap...but they're wrong.<br/><br/>CLOVERFIELD is a taught, thrill-ride of movie, and it deserves to be the first true blockbuster of 2008. You've got to see this one."
"scruss1","9","3","8","18 January 2008"," Awesome Movie
","JJ Abram's and the guys did an amazing job. I will tell you this before I get started that nobody where I saw it noticed. Towards the end of the movie there will be a shot facing the ocean, there will be a boat in the right side of the screen, watch by that boat the entire time.<br/><br/>Now for my thoughts, I loved this. It was like Jurrasic park 2 (in the city), meets blair witch meets godzilla. The entire time was action, the action sequences were amazing (rescue on the leaning tower of piza anyone?). I really didn't know what to expect from this movie, but after seeing it I have to say it was more entertaining (comedy and action wise) than any movie I saw last year. You feel like you are really there, in the action with these people. I think more movies should be done like this, just not done to death."
"zoegreenfrog","8","3","8","18 January 2008"," Overall, I really liked it!
","I saw this movie today with some friends of mine, who really loved it up until the ending. At first, I couldn't believe the ending. It was so...abrupt. And unexpected. But after thinking about it, it totally made sense.<br/><br/>This movie does not have a lot of elaboration or conclusion. It's simply a videotape recorded by a group of people who really didn't intend to get it on video anyway. I LOVE how the whole thing is like a home video. After thinking about this movie more and more, I realized how much I liked it. It was very clever, and just a good action movie. While it got very gory, and a couple parts made me jump, overall it was just really good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants a movie with closure, though, because the ending does not give it. That may just be the best thing about the movie though."
"kirby-styles","6","3","8","18 January 2008"," The Blair Godzalien Project
","I saw this movie the day it came out and the theater was fairly full. Lots of hype without many clues probably drew most of these viewers. I guess I wasn't expecting much more than a scary movie about some kind of monster attacking NYC filmed by hand-held cameras. It really wasn't much more than that except for a cheesy love story thrown in.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I don't care for film shot by an unsteady hand. When I watch COPS, I don't feel like I want to smack the guy with the camera and these guys are running and even jumping fences. During Cloverfield, there were times I was thinking ""Give someone else the damn camera!"" The only time you get a decent view of this monster is from the helicopter near the end of the film. For viewers who like this style of filming, they would probably think it was a pretty good job.<br/><br/>No real plot except for the aforementioned love story. Guy and girl pretty much end their ""since childhood friendship and I never realized I was in love with you"" relationship during the party at the beginning of the story. Now that Godzalien is wiping out Manhattan, guy has to make his way back to girl's apartment and save her (or just have her die at an alternate location).<br/><br/>The film kept my attention because I was yearning for some answer or explanation or some sort of closure of just what is really going on here. Really it's just a giant Godzilla/Alien/maybe even Predator monster knocking over buildings while 'giving birth' to hundreds of mini-monsters. The military was dropping bombs and shooting all kinds of munitions at this thing with little success. This monster didn't seem too intelligent; he just didn't like tall buildings. He did however know the symbolic importance of snapping the Statue of Liberty's head off and rolling it down 59th street. Maybe he did it for the trailer.<br/><br/>It is worth checking out but you will probably feel the same as you would if you were downloading a late breaking news story and halfway through it you lost your internet connection.<br/><br/>P.S. This film is my dark horse for 'Best Score' award. The song during closing credits is outstanding."
"jw_1195","8","3","8","18 January 2008"," Cloverfield delivers thrills, suspense and surprises!
","Just in case it wasn't obvious, the following review DOES contain spoilers. I strongly suggest you don't read on if you haven't seen the film, and you intend to.** <br/><br/>As did most people, I walked into Cloverfield with hardly a clue as to the plot of the film. First off, I would like to point out that the film's advertising was done extremely well - allowing viewers to guess what the plot was introduced them to one of the movie's main ideas. The film is shown from the perspective of five average New Yorkers, four of which hold a going-away party for their friend Rob on the evening of the attack on New York. Those five then fight for survival, escaping the giant monster and the little spidery creatures that come along with it - all documented on a camcorder. This gives the film's audience little idea as to exactly what is happening, exactly as the characters feel.<br/><br/>The cinematography is, as I mentioned before, done on a camcorder (or so the viewer suspects). It is very reminiscent of the Blair Witch Project, and some scenes (one in particular that comes towards the end in mind...) may give the viewer motion sickness. But this merely adds to the film's realism, and makes the film seem amateur - which makes you believe the visual effects even more.<br/><br/>I first heard about Cloverfield back when I saw Transformers, when the teaser appeared before the film. Back then it was untitled, and I was fairly unenthusiastic about the film. But when a friend told me about Cloverfield and showed me the teaser again a few months back, I got more and more excited - and today when I walked into the cinema I could barely contain it. Luckily, my expectations were met, possibly even surpassed, by the end of the film. It starts off generally low key, but the slow build up pays off when the main plot gets running. The build up also helps us to understand the characters more, so that development is not needed during the monster's rampages.<br/><br/>The monster itself is truly an amazing character in the film, as at first you expect it to be your classic Dinosaur-like creature when you see small glimpses of it as it claws its way through buildings at the start of the film. In fact, it is actually almost a good hour into the film before you can determine the monster's shape, and even then it is hard to tell what exactly it looks like. Hopefully on the DVD we get a documentary that shows CGI models.<br/><br/>(If you haven't seen the film and would like to find out for yourself what it looks like, don't read on).<br/><br/>Off the top of my memory, the monster has a round-ish face with fangs that are sort of reminiscent of the deep-sea fish that dwell in the darker portions of the ocean. It's front legs sprout forwards from the shoulder, a little bit like a spider, and the body gradually gets smaller until it finishes off with two (or one, I can;t remember all that well) legs and a long, slimy tail. (Spoiler warning) There are a few quite frightening up-close-and-personal shots of the monster, two in mind - once as it lunges forwards and takes down a helicopter, and again... well, I'll leave that one for you to see! The acting itself is quite good, especially considering they had to act while filming. It must be rather difficult to make a film if you're both the actor and the cameraman, and so I praise the cast - particularly T.J. Miller, who actually played the cameraman - for achieving the goal relatively realistically. The brief moments of silence in the film that are usually followed by the actors awakening from unconsciousness are actually quite tense, and these scenes are normally followed by some shocking images of small spidery creatures attacking or the giant monster lunging forwards and stepping on them, or something to the like of that. The film has some extremely shocking moments, although the one that I am bursting to write down is one that I will restrain from writing for those who haven't seen the film and yet who don't mind spoilers.<br/><br/>The lack of a soundtrack also adds to the film's reality, therefore increasing tension. Often you will find that in a lot of mediocre horror films tension is (sometimes) ruined by music, although it does depend on what kind of music, I suppose.<br/><br/>This is in no means a rip off of Godzilla. No way was it inspired by King Kong. Cloverfield is a relatively original piece of work; I will admit that the topic is one that is commonly used, although this film portrays that topic very well and with a majesty that I'm not sure will be easy to top. And the fact that the movie is only around 70 - 75 minutes adds to the frightening aspect of it - it shows how quickly everything happened. I really enjoyed Cloverfield, despite that fact that I was frightened to death by the end, and I intend to see it again soon. I recommend it for fans of films like Godzilla - although trust me, once you see this, you'll never want to watch the '98 Godzilla again.<br/><br/>Let the rampage begin..."
"Rob-O-Cop","8","3","8","17 January 2008"," where the F*** did this stunning movie come from
","I'd heard absolutely nothing about this movie when me and my girlfriend were at a local cinema stealing their free wireless internet to check some emails. I noticed the movie listed and because I'd already seen or knew I didn't want to see every other movie on the list (yes modern movie making is that bad) and I kinda just felt like sitting in a movie for a couple of hours we thought we'd check this one out. we checked it on IMDb first and no one knew much about it and there were no votes but we thought we'd risk it, a costly thing these days but we hadn't treated ourselves for a few weeks.<br/><br/>The initial few minutes were not promising, not boring or anything but just a handy cam being played back of some teens party. then it all kicked in, and it was an exhilarating ride.<br/><br/>Yes the whole movie is seen through the eyes of a handy cam, yes Blair witch did the same thing, but this is not Blair witch. This is a big movie. the special effects were stunning. The sound was mind-blowing, surround sound (a feature which no handy cam I know of records, but I'm just being picky, i wouldn't want to downgrade the experience with mono camera sound). The concept was handy cam but this was no low budget amateur movie. The picture quality was well better than home movie, the lighting was good, scenes and camera angles all contributing to the story. i.e. they didn't get too hung up on the concept, but used it to make the whole experience non stop edge of the seat thrilling.<br/><br/>The story was nothing much, a love story spread over the main feature, an unexplained massive creature gets p!ssed off and rips Manhattan to pieces. basically Godzilla, but that was the point, it's really a concept movie, nothing more nothing less and as that it succeeds amazingly. this was one entertaining ride and maybe it shows what it would be like to be under siege by enemy forces without having to deal with all the hassles of politics, or maybe it's just a piece of well made entertainment.<br/><br/>Afterward I was slightly disturbed by how this movie was marketed. as in I'd seen nothing of it, and its no small movie. What was their plan?. to get people used to going to see movies on a whim and being pleasantly surprised after years of mostly being disappointed with the dross that Hollywood serves up. I felt kind of manipulated even though in my case there was no manipulation cos I just turned up on a whim and was one of the first people in the world to see it. So I guess I'm playing right into the ad mans hands and spreading the word of mouth to get you to go and see this movie, cos it is what you want a movie to be, something you couldn't experience at home (the sound is amazing and no home cinema or laptop is going to reproduce that).<br/><br/>This is a genre defining great movie. It's entertainment exceptionally well done, don't sit too close to the screen."

","Cloverfield was a boring and bland film - it would have been worth watching it if it was scary or exciting but it failed dramatically in that sector and many others. The only part that was slightly gripping was the scene with the statue of liberty's head, but this scene leached fear from the real life tragedy of 9/11 in a disgusting way.<br/><br/>There are so many floors in this film its hilarious- people surviving way longer than they realistically would have. No children or elderly people through out the whole film although its set in a giant city. And don't even get me started on the noise the baby monsters make.<br/><br/>This film did not have me on edge once.<br/><br/>80 minutes = way too long.<br/><br/>What a let down."

","I am sure lot of people like me were so excited to see one film that come from the same company as the excellent series ""Lost"" and I am sure most of them left the cinema disappointed as me.<br/><br/>Well there is nothing new or original in this film, also the plot is inexistent, but anyway you can have a decent entertainment product without all of that , but that was also here not possible cos the way how the film is shooted (like one amateur camera did, like the ""Blair witch project"" thing) made all the fun disappear.<br/><br/>I hope in future the creators of Lost surprised us with a great film again, not like in Cloverfield."
"admiral-encode","2","11","50","27 January 2008"," Shaky-cam ""goes up to 11""
","Now don't get me wrong here, innovation in cinema is really important and moving the old and tired conventions of how we see the narrative should always be pushed.<br/><br/>The creator of Lost (a ninety minute plot strung-out for five years), has certainly super-sized the CGI, but sadly (as with his other project) skipped on the writing.<br/><br/>There is a level of horror and morbid action, but after a while you think ""so what"" and that's the main problem with this movie. So to counter this obvious gap, the action ""goes up to 11"". JJ decided to allow his camera work to be of the shaky-cam genera and unless you like reality TV or any number of coffee commercials you too will be shouting ""for the love of God JJ, put the camera on a tripod, you'd think Stedicam had never invented"".<br/><br/>Now to the plot, as I mentioned earlier 'young JJ' seems to have been overly pragmatic on the writing and it shows. The whole narrative is a remake of any number of similar stories, but this time to increase the pace, you see so little of what is actually happening that it drives you mad. This is a tactic he used in Lost, but thankfully you won't need to wait three seasons to find out ""what's behind the door"". The characters are uninspiring and the use of a camcorder as a linking device is wasted because it's been done so many times before, relentless, and we don't really care. <br/><br/>This movie could have been so much better, and it's a shame because the nucleus of a great film was there for the exploitation, but sadly (as with so many movies these days) style over substance reigns supreme.<br/><br/>All in all, this should have been a TV mini series and nobody would have minded, but a feature film, no. When it comes out on DVD I expect it will do very well - providing they issue motion sickness tablets with every rental."

Don't want to spoil it. Just great. Many have said what they think it is, I just want everyone to experience this first hand. Just remember to expect a shaky camera for most of the film.

","This movie gets away from the normal all angles point of view, is very open ended and makes the viewer part of the experience. The suspense comes from the snip its of the monster and noise outside and all around. Be prepared to be frustrated, you will want more. This movie comes at you in waves. It gets off to a slow start, but I think that is part of suspense. You want the monster! Enjoy the human element. The characters are very relative. Take it east on the butter, you may get nauseous. Forget the Blair witch comparisons, this movie is much smarter and is definition of a suspense thriller. Plenty of dark scenes and plenty of PRO! Enjoy!"
"bobbyelliott","3","9","39","3 February 2008"," Very derivative
","This movie is a mix of several other films, including Blair Witch Project, Godzilla, and Alien. In fact, I found nothing original about it. In spite of it being short (90 minutes), because it's so formulaic, I found it a drag and I was looking at my watch after 45 minutes.<br/><br/>And it's a very old formula. Good-looking twenty-somethings run around a city being chased by something evil, make very bad decisions that imperil their safety, escape said peril through ludicrous good fortune... repeat for 60 minutes until end.<br/><br/>But the biggest disappointment is the complete lack of plot (beyond the trite: ""I must save my girlfriend from this monster""). Seriously, there is no story here.<br/><br/>On the positive side, it is short. And I thought the monster was quite well done. And, I guess, 14 year-old boys will enjoy it.<br/><br/>Don't under-estimate the first advantage (the movie's brevity). You'll be very grateful. Believe me."

Besides, there are tremendous inconsistencies within the idea, showing a poor understanding of camera-work. I'm not sure I understand why the movie was produced or given even the faintest praise.

","This movie is an unbelievably fun ride. It combines elements of realism with a little (or should I say, HUGE hehe), splash of fantasy.<br/><br/>When the movie begins, we are at a party observing the lives of some average twenty- somethings. And as much as I wanted the action to start, I began to become interested in the drama at this gathering. When the first signs of disaster hit, I was actually surprised! I guess being 23 myself, I was really starting to identify with the people at the party and became interested in their little social lives. There were also some quite humorous bits in that scene. <br/><br/>And when the monster begins to attack, it is NON STOP THRILLS. No joke. There isn't a moment in the movie for about an hour that is slow. It is just scene after scene of nerve wracking tension. <br/><br/>The monster is hardly shown (until the end), and this just adds to the suspense. It was a great choice by the director/writer.<br/><br/>Also, some people complain of the lack of knowledge of what this thing is and why it is attacking Manhattan. But I get it. Its not the point of the movie. The point is the visceral experience. <br/><br/>THE CHARACTERS Don't KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON, AND NEITHER DO WE! Its actually very cool to just get pieces of this puzzle, and have the tape go dead before we get any true answers. It makes you draw your OWN conclusions...sorry America, I know you hate that...but if you want more answers go see something else!<br/><br/>10/10 for the movie of its kind from me, I've never seen a better monster movie.

","I was so intrigued to watch this film on screen after watching the trailer on screen. The concept was so awesome, a monster suddenly appearing in New York Manhattan and wrecking all the buildings into pieces. The feeling was like something really usual and unbelievable happened around you all of a sudden and how different people reacted to it.<br/><br/>Today I watched the film on screen and got out entirely dizzy and frustrated about the story. The filming technique was different from typical movies we watch. It resembled that in ""The Blair Witch Project"" that the movie was viewed from the Video Recorder's perspective but in a much clearer version (Maybe the DV was of Good quality, thanks to Rob!) However the screenplays were just too shaky and made people feel dizzy most of the time. I understand in real situation it should be as shaky as hell like in the movies, but I think for most audience viewing this movie it would be a disaster. Somehow movies are for entertainment to the general people so I think it would be better if they have improved this part.<br/><br/>The cast did their parts in the movie. Without stars in the movie made it more realistic and let us feel more close to real life. The cuttings and lightnings were great. CG effects were good. However the dizzy camera screen stole a great deal of marks from them. It made me hard to concentrate on all the details as I was about to throw up watching the movie! In addition, personally the story was too simple. There were no twists at all and much was predicted after being surprised by the first attack of the monster. It was sort of the ""Resident Evil"" style of movie where the government last resort was to bomb the entire area. And the cameraman Hud was doing too much trash talk which made me hate him more than appreciating his sense of humor.<br/><br/>If you can tolerate riding on roller coasters for a continual of 85 minutes, I think you can give this movie a try. The concept was really really nice and I liked it, but I just could not stand watching a movie that makes you throw up. Given improved shaky camera technique and more twists to the story, I think this movie can deserve a higher rating."
"zstarnes0703","7","3","9","19 January 2008"," J.J. Abrams forgot to finish Cloverfield
","I have been really pumped about going to see Cloverfield for a week or so now. I was afraid that the movie wouldn't reach my expectations and they didn't. The first 20 minutes of the movie are really slow. It adds little meaning to the story and in my opinion was just drawn out to make the movie closer to 90 minutes. During almost the whole movie I was on the edge of my seat wondering where the monster came from and what were the small creatures were that were attacking everyone. The movie had so much potential, and i couldn't wait for the end but I guess with all of the promotion, they forgot to have an ending to the movie. The movie just abruptly ends. You never find out where the monster came from, if they, killed it, what was happening to the people that got bitten by the creatures or anything. The movie was everything I hoped it was going to be until the ""ending"". This is what totally kills the movie. An ending can make or break a film and it definitely broke this one."
"DonFishies","7","3","9","18 January 2008"," A uniquely enigmatic and satisfying monster movie
","So here it is, after months of speculation and hype, Cloverfield has finally arrived in theatres. And the wait just may have been well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>A plot synopsis this late in the game may sound a bit like overkill, but suffice to say, a gigantic creature appears in New York City, and lays waste to it. Meanwhile, a group of friends, who happen to have a videocamera, record their point-of-view of the attack as they try to make it out of the city alive.<br/><br/>What is surprising about Cloverfield is how it lacks any real depth or three-dimensional motivations for any of the characters (including the monster), but it draws you in anyway. It works in a way of saying very little, but packing a lot of strength into the things it does say. You feel an enigmatic sting right after the movie gets going, and it never manages to subside. It leaves a lot to the imagination, but at the same time, it works in so much that you fail to notice the many discrepancies and minimal plot details that would otherwise destroy a film.<br/><br/>The storyline itself is heavily convoluted, and at times, melodramatic at best. I realize that the subplot of the party is integral to getting the group together (and the explanation for the camera), and I realize that some of these characters needed to be more than just a walking cliché waiting to get killed, but it really seems like a bit of work could have been done for them. The pathos for their situation is there (and their varying heartbreaks, including one powerfully done scene on a train platform), but the film never seems to take a crack at really making us feel for them. A lot of the dialogue exchanges between the characters are what drag the film down in its already blazingly fast running time, and could have easily been fixed up. They have their poetic moments, but they could all have had some work done (not to say that the adrenaline saturated performances here are not terrifically done as it is).<br/><br/>Instead of focusing on the characters so much, the film's key strength is what is going on in the background. The satire and political allegories are just stunning in more than a handful of occasions. All at once the film draws on xenophobic ideals drilled into us by 9/11, old monster movies of yore (especially Godzilla) and the war on terror. The film even has a sequence that borders on being a recreation of 9/11, bringing the true realism and fear of the characters home to the audience. Seeing some of these scenes are downright terrifying, and mainly because we have seen scenes just like them in real life. Hell, the film even toys with the actions of the current generation. Instead of running for their lives, a group of people take pictures of the fallen head of the Statue of Liberty with their camera phones, presumably to later post on Facebook or MySpace. It prods around with these ideals, and in the process, creates a film that is undoubtedly immediate, and belongs to the kids of 2008. It may feel a little too close in touch with its excellent Korean brethren The Host, but its uniqueness lends itself to being more than a copy.<br/><br/>And while some may write off the use of the handi-cam as a gimmick, it is what makes the film so enthralling and so strong. I had my doubts about the movie being entirely shot in this format, but as I watched it, I could not imagine it being nearly as powerful, or nearly as watchable if it were made with a standard film camera. Instead, the camera treats us into a sort of all-access pass, allowing the audience to feel as if they are a character themselves. And once the actual characters get running, the audience may feel like they are in for an endurance test as well. The edge of your seat mentality the film lends itself is more than enough to suggest that the film will get your blood pumping. It is not blazingly original, but for a suspense filled, mass-marketed, Hollywood film, it is definitely somewhat of a unique experience. Yes, the dizziness of some of the camera work is a bit jarring, and more often than not you may not be able to tell what is going on (and you will unlikely realize all the little things going on in the backgrounds of shot until it is too late), but these minor inconveniences only make for a more immediate and gratifying trip. The audience involvement tactic may not be for everyone, but is something that those who are willing to try, should. <br/><br/>What impressed me the most however was how great the monster itself looks. It never stays in one spot for long, but the fear and terror that grips the characters as they catch glimpses of it is just enough. For such a small budgeted film, I was expecting something a little less realistic. Instead, it looks authentic and scary enough to be more than just someone's nightmare. Describing it will ruin the fun (and watching it tear up New York is the real treat), but the short glimpses do not last all that long thankfully. I was a little less enthused about the smaller parasitic looking beings that show up halfway into the film (and in one shot, you can tell it is clearly CGI), but they still look very well done anyway.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a flawed creation, but it is also very strong. Its enigmatic presence and genuine satire is something that monster movies tend to lack, but is quite hard hitting here. A little less melodrama could have made this terrifyingly and satisfyingly quick ride a whole lot less bumpy.<br/><br/>8.5/10."
"lywtrue","10","3","9","18 January 2008"," Cloverfield: Maybe The Greatest Movie in 2008!
","I just saw Cloverfield and never felt so impressed, and therefore moved to write a review here. This is also my first review here ever and it is my honor to say that Cloverfield must be one of the greatest movies in 2008. This is also the only great movie I've seen for the last year and I am usually a captious person. This movie provides us not the answer or reason, even not a story, just the facts, situation and strong feelings, which shocked me deeply.The characters are very real and their were not completing some ""mission"" but were only trying to deal with such extraordinary situation and to instinctively find something important to them. Although their action was a little bit unnatural in the face of certain death, but I believe many people will also do the similar things under the same circumstance.<br/><br/>The other successful part of this movie is the use of the view of ""handheld camera"". Not like the similar disaster movies, you will find that you are not sitting in the cinema and just clearly seeing others' disaster. You are with such poor persons. You are feeling what they were feeling, you are doubting what they did, you are scared as they were. Although the image is not clear and always interrupted, it just added the authenticity. The use of such way is really really great! Cloverfield is very successful to deliver the visual aspect of on-site feelings. It would be another stupid movie if the camera focused on the monster the whole time and nothing else.<br/><br/>I am very satisfied to devote one and a half hour of my life to this movie and may see it again. Just truly exciting. If you miss this movie, it would be a real disaster."
"jaredmobarak","9","3","9","18 January 2008"," Good luck tonight TravisCloverfield
","Cloverfield is a damn good time at the moviessomething that one can't say very often in January, the month usually utilized to dump films while Oscar-bait from the previous year gets released. Seeing the first teaser attached to Transformers in July literally gave me goosebumps at the potential for what it could be. I will admit that while the hype was high, the past couple months saw it wane. The gimmick started getting a tad stale and the TV spots began to ruin the momentum it carried so well before anyone knew what it was. Producer J.J. Abrams knew what he was doing, though, as the end result exceeded expectations, taking the colossal monster genre as background dressing for the human tale of love and regret which came up front and center. I just feel bad for director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard because it is their film yet everyone describes it as Abrams'. Whoever deserves credit, they are receiving a ton from me. Every detail was painstakingly considered, there were actually some genuine scares (usually hard to come by for me), and the story had some weight and meaning, allowing the fine performances to have something to play for, rather than just running for their lives with egos and self-preservation the only thing worth living for.<br/><br/>My main fear was on whether we would see the monster and how that visual would ruin the movie. Stuff like this only truly works for me if the creature creating all the havoc is something foreboding and unseen, always lurking and able to attack at any moment. Here, though, we actually get a look at the behemoth pretty early. From its tale attack on the Brooklyn Bridge to its full visual on TV screens in a local electronics store, we know exactly what it is causing all the destruction. The beauty of the filmmakers is that they never needed the monster for the film to work. It is a secondary character used only as motivation for our lead Rob to hunt out his love Beth and a means to preventing him from reaching her easily. Maybe the world falling apart around them is the catalyst for their feelings to finally boil to the surface, however, the fight is always going on around them; it's not about defeating the enemy, it is about living for something bigger then yourself, doing what you can for the people you love in a time of desperate need.<br/><br/>Cloverfield asks a lot of its actors throughout. Filmed on a first-person camera, there are many long takes and unbroken scenes to express the aesthetic choice of this being a real primary account of the invasion found later on after the smoke settles. Emotions run high, death takes a realistic toll on both body and mind, and adrenaline flows forth to keep these heroes on the run to get out of Manhattan alive and intact. Each holds his/her own to make it all seem real, injecting humor so that the bleak moments can break with levity. Death is starring them in the face and, like anyone of us would do in that situation, they try to mask their fear with laughter in order to release some of the tension building higher and higher inside of them. Michael Stahl-David, as Rob, is by far the best of the group. He needs to go from deeply in love to tragically scorned and angry, happily surprised by his friends to scared for his life, and confident to risk his own being for another to devastated as he must explain the death of someone close to him over the phone. His emotions run the gamut and he pulls them all off with grace. Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, and Odette Yustman hold their own with the immense pressure of their situation weighing down on them as well. When tragedy strikes, and it does often, they must react realistically to every situation. Special mention also goes to T.J. Miller as Hud Platt, our surrogate guide through the mayhem, acting as our camera operator, complete with commentary and comedic relief with every turn.<br/><br/>With the strong performances and the taut, simple script from Goddard, I have to praise the work of Reeves at helming the piece. With little to work with in order to have the audience relate to and rally behind these characters, we are thrust into the action pretty early on. Goddard crafted a yarn that succeeds from getting the small things right. Rather than go big budget effects, he relies on the human interactions to portray the action. Reeves understands this and allows for a brilliant documentary feel. If you are susceptible to motion sickness, be warned that the camera is very shaky and possibly even handled by Miller while he chases after his friends. The askew angles and amateurish cropping of frame add to this completely, keeping all the action truncated on the edges because if it were real, the viewer would only look when something catches his eye. Turning to see what they think they saw shows off the end result, increasing the fear and anticipation for what might come next. All the monster effects are adequately rendered and the utilization of digital camera tricksfantastic use of nightvision in the subway, awesome instance of auto-focus confusion with Hud, and precise usage of the fact that this is all taping over a previously filmed event (Rob and Beth's day out in Coney Island) which shows through wonderfullyshown to full effect. Complete with an ending that truly encapsulates what went on this fateful day in NYC, Cloverfield delivers on all its promises and becomes so much more than just Blair Witch Project mainstream. Every moment is real and touches you in a very personal way. It is an experience, a spectacle; not to be confused with the monster movies that only show you what is happening, this one puts you in the action, making you feel it all yourself."
"mcmurtry001","Null","3","9","18 January 2008"," Wow was that disappointing - Rent or bring a vomit bag
","I went with my father to this movie. ( No I am not 10. I am 30 and my father is much older.) He loves monster movies and the first words out of his mouth were ""That was really disappointing"".<br/><br/>Whoever said that shaking a camera around through the entire movie should be banned from movie making for life(JJ Abrams). This was a little too artistic and shows that the producer is full of himself and won't let anyone enjoy the movie. This is essentially a home movie of people running around in NY for an hour and 5-7 minutes of big and little monster shots.<br/><br/>The whole point of a giant monster movie is to see a giant monster. That's what all the fuss was about and why you paid $11. Oh yeah, the movie is only like 1 hour and 20 minutes. You only get to really see the monster the last 20 minutes of the movie. My suggestion is to go to another movie across the hall until for an hour go into Coverfield, to see the monster, and then go back to a better movie.<br/><br/>You only really see the monster in in about 5% of the movie. When you do see him the camera is out of focus and only shows the monster for a brief second. You also only see glimpses until the end. Really ticked me off. <br/><br/>The best part in the middle of the movie is when these parasite spider looking things attack the characters in the subway. Of course you can't really make them out either because the characters are running away from them and shaking !#$* out of the camera. (I turned green at this point)<br/><br/>This could have been a good monster movie if they shot it like a normal movie instead of a 13 year old, and if they had focused on the monster and parasites a lot more. The whole ""it's more intimate"" thing doesn't belong in a big monster movie. That's for girl flicks that my wife loves like Sense and Sensibility.<br/><br/>Is the monster cool and realistic? Yes it is. <br/><br/>Was it worth all of the other crap to see the monster at the end. <br/><br/>Not for $11. <br/><br/>What does the monster look like? <br/><br/>It is really hard to describe. It looks like a giant hairless cat, but it's front legs are really long and inverted so it walks almost like a bat. Also it has multiple limbs underneath like a crab and a really long tail. I t is not a giant whale looking thing. <br/><br/>Are there parasites coming off of the monster? <br/><br/>Yes and they look like a cross between a spider and a crab. They do start to eat people. You see them 3 times alive. One shot of a dead specimen being carted away by some soldiers. This dead shot is the best shot.<br/><br/>Just trust me and wait for it to come out on video so you can fast forward through the shaking and lame moments."
"thatsaboutright","Null","3","9","18 January 2008"," The Cloverfield Experience
","Cloverfield. Brought to you by Nokia.<br/><br/>The best way for me to describe Cloverfield, in the simplest terms is, part Godzilla, part Blair Witch Project, part War Of The Worlds. Of course many, as I did, will know that going in. I didn't expect however, for it to be the best parts of those movies.<br/><br/>It should be noted that many have mistakenly called this a J.J. Abrams movie. Really, it's not. Any good in this film should be credited to the actual director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard. Who's previous writing credits include Lost, Angel, Alias, and Buffy TV.<br/><br/>As I started to see more and more trailers for Cloverfield before its release, I feared it would become Dawson's Creek meets Godzilla. For the first 10 minutes, I started to feel that was where it was going. Until the first 'shake'. Then it became a full fledged giant monster rampage flick and it never let go. But I will admit that it had the copy paste guy meets girl, guy looses girl, guy saves girl, elements that plagued the Transformers movie. Big difference is Lili Mirojnick, even though she had less screen time, had more substance than Megan Fox in Transformers.<br/><br/>Cloverfield clocks in at only 84 minutes. But it is a tight film that gave me just enough of everything to be satisfying. For me, it's the first time a giant monster rampage flick gave me that feeling of having lived what I saw on screen. It did this by never breaking from the first person camcorder format. At first the jerky camera was a little jarring, but my eyes quickly adjusted.<br/><br/>When 911 happened I kept my VCR recording for almost a week 24 hours a day. A lot of Cloverfield reminded me of the amateur video that was shot then. But the film seems to try to avoid the comparison. Since nobody on screen, that I can remember, ever associates the two events. Even though in real life, I bet that everyone there would state, 'it's like 911 all over again!' When remembering that 911 footage, it helped me justify some parts when the camera guy didn't point the camera at the action. A few times I thought, 'point the camera at the monster you idiot!' But I remembered times in my own life, when using a camcorder, I found myself watching one thing, and pointing the camera at something else. Of course I wasn't being attacked by Mothra.<br/><br/>For the reasons I loved Cloverfield, my twelve year old son hated it. There are no winners. No Rambo stunts. No wrap up with a pretty bow. No explanation as to why or how. I don't want to give away anything. But this isn't a happy movie.<br/><br/>I predict that another version of this film will be released in theaters, with additional footage, if it is the success they hope it to be. I know I want to see it again on the big screen and additional footage could fill the seats a second time. The DVD release will be interesting. Since watching this version, I felt there was even more carnage they wanted to show. But they wanted that PG-13 rating. Wise or not. I don't know.<br/><br/>The oddest thing about the Cloverfield Experience was the audience reaction afterword. Full theater....dead quiet. I know I was quiet because in my head I was thinking, 'Wow. I just lived that.' But I wondered how many there thought, 'What the hell was that?' While watching the film, I kept wondering how it was going to end. How would they eventually break that fourth wall. Since the film began as though it were a video feed stating, Property Of The United States Government. My son turned to me and thought there was something wrong with the movie. It ended much in the same way. But eventually, when the credits did roll, the Cloverfield Overture 'Roar!' played. Loudly. That piece of music kept me in the theater until the last credit. Just before the Paramount card shows at the end, I could hear a faint voice. I am not sure what it said. But it gave me that last bit of creepiness.<br/><br/>I would recommend all my friends see this on the best screen with best sound system as soon as possible. So they could enjoy the Cloverfield Experience as I did. Since calling this a movie in the traditional sense would be a false representation.<br/><br/>Have some fun. Go Live Cloverfield!"
"Homerpalooza1289","10","3","9","18 January 2008"," IT MADE MY LIFE (VERY minor spoiler)
","Approximately 4 hours ago some thing attacked my mind. What was the thing you ask? Well it was the amazingly bad-ass subject designate CLOVERFIELD otherwise known as the Cloverfield monster, and Cloverfield the movie itself.<br/><br/>As you may not have known, I have been waiting for this movie since last July when Transformers came out and a mysterious trailer for an unnamed movie puzzled me and my friend. Through many viral websites and movie news sites I have come to love Cloverfield more than your average viewer. I survived the horrific Ethan Haas hoax, Slusho (BET YOU CANT DRINK JUST 6!), and the infamous Tagruato. Through all that waiting and excitement that built I have to say that I was in absolutely no way disappointed.<br/><br/>Now to the movie: (VERY MINOR SPOILERS YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN NOTICE IT)<br/><br/>First you should know, that you are in the movie. Seriously. Or at least that is the feeling that our wonderfully hilarious cameraman Hud so aptly conveys to us. When they're screaming, you're screaming. Whether out of pure excitement, pure fear, or a mixture of both (Me =D). Second, yes you DO see the monster, in fact you see it REALLY close. And yes he is just as bad-ass as you imagined, or at least what I imagined. You get the best of all genres while watching Cloverfield. There's a romance, there's crazy action constantly, there's scary things everywhere, head-exploding gore, and of course it's also extremely hilarious.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is not your ordinary monster movie. The characters you come to know aren't the heroes who know exactly what's going on and what to do to defeat this thing. These are the normal people, you and me. Running in the opposite direction just trying to find your friends and get the hell out. It makes Cloverfield so much more personable knowing that that could be you (if an evil oil company unintentionally brought monstrous wrath to a city... but i digress).<br/><br/>I recommend Cloverfield for absolutely anyone who wants to see a genuine monster movie. J.J. Abrams said that he wanted make an American monster movie and I think he accomplished that with flying colors. Go see it, even if you think it looks stupid, its not. Even if you have no idea what I'm talking about with websites and oil companies, go see it. And finally, even if you think The Dark Knight will be so much cooler and you don't want to waste $8, go see it. You'll thank me later."

If you are an ass, and aren't going to like it because of the shaky camera, then you are condemning all visual media to horrendous ""film"" like Step Up. Anyway, this is definitely what War of the Worlds should have been like. I liked War of the Worlds, but this was so much better. It's almost as if J. J. Abrams was watching WotW and thought to himself, ""I could make this a whole lot better."" Some people thought it was a bit pretentious, but it wasn't. Seriously, if you're going to judge this movie based on it's realism, you're missing the point. Of course, if you understand things like propellers and blood-clotting, this movie is as real as it can get, besides the whole monster-destroying-the-world thing. Great movie though.

","A lot of chaos, but where's the monster? ""Cloverfield"" fails at what many Godzilla movies are able to succeed, having the monster have a point to the story. The movie was more about searching and saving the main character's love interest than escaping from the chaos caused by the monster.<br/><br/>The camera movement was not terrible, but it is highly recommended to sit as far away from the screen (Arrive early because those are the first seats to go.) because sitting to close to the screen may make many people dizzy.<br/><br/>The story would of been more interesting if it was focused on trying to survive from the monster and escape New York City."

If you go into this movie expecting to have everything layed out for you, then you are gonna hate Cloverfield. The whole story is taken from the perspective of 1 guy, the cameraman, so there are a lot of plot-points that are left out. It leaves you to come up with your own conclusions. It is effing awesome. Every scene puts you in the shoes of these people, and it makes the action so much more intense. You can feel every footstep, and you experience all the fear. Everything feels very authentic. I love it. I don't think this film will be received very well. People are gonna want to know more.<br/><br/>Where did the monster come from? Why is it unstoppable? How did they survive that crash? Does it matter? If you knew, would that really make the film better? This movie is meant for you to make your own conclusions. No one is going to hold your hand and give you a resolution at the end of this movie, so if you were hoping for one, don't see Cloverfield."

I do believe this transcends any 1 genre, with the element of horror, documentary, suspense, drama, you name it. JJ Abrams did not disappoint. The only drawback is if you are prone to motion sickness it could pose a problem. Before the midnight showing I went to the manager came out and announced the possibility of getting sick from the movement and even passed out ""barf bags"".

That being said, I was almost sure that I was expecting too much out of it, and that a potential blockbuster hit like this would surely leave me disappointed. I was very wrong.<br/><br/>This movie, although being about a monster attack in the most overused American city for attacks, is definitely the most original of its kind. The hand-held camera POV is an awesome way of filming this movie and it would not have been as good without it. As many reviewers will say, it makes you feel like part of the movie. The movie was pretty much a constant ride, very loud but yet you hear the parts that are necessary to hear in order to grasp what other people are thinking. I was impressed with how realistic the people's reactions were, and you'll notice that the camera gets turned off or turned away in scenes that you know a real person would do the same.<br/><br/>All in all, I can say Cloverfield thoroughly impressed me.

Sometimes I found myself begging for a better camera shot. There were a few decent parts, but I don't think that it lived up to all the excitement over it.

The fact that it is depicted through the point of view of a hand held camera is genius. Sure this may have been done with The Blair Witch project, but this is no witch we're dealing with. We, as an audience, know as much as the characters know which leaves us with many questions at the end, but the ending in my opinion was exactly what would have happened if a gigantic monster were to attack. This is a must see for anyone who wants a unique thrill ride. Honestly one of the most intense and thrilling movies made in years. I recommend it."
"eleon77","8","3","9","17 January 2008"," Why I liked it?
","I'm not gonna give much away, for I know many other reviews have that done that honor for me, but I will say Cloverfield was a good movie. Sure not great, the plot holes do bother me to an extent, however, they bothered me more in Blair Witch Project. The reason being is with this movie, you get to care for the characters, you get to connect with them one way or another. There is everything in this movie. From jumps, chills, comic relief, and a lot of those moments that make you say HELL NO! That is why I found it so entertaining. One thing I would go and add is that the movie is very stereo typical, but entertaining nonetheless. What can describe this movie? Blair witch meets the Myst and Godzilla in NY. Or better yet, a mixture of many films with some video games."

","Lost was a total let down and this is by the same bloke. He hit on the idea of making it up as you go along. It doesn't matter if you can't explain. He has no respect for viewers He is entertaining, But in the end vacuous. A package with no gift All show and no substance. Therefore I predict there will be no satisfying conclusion. In all, like Lost - a con. <br/><br/>Since my last post, today 27th Feb. 2008, this video so called film is as I predicted. Irritating and vacuous. The 'writer' Drew (should draw, not write) Goddard is the only scriptwriter to have written 'Oh My God' into a script more than any other scriptwriter on earth. Well done. Great claim to fame. <br/><br/>JJ Abrams has again pulled a fast one on the public. Must be the Bush era that dishonesty abounds. Sure, he is laughing all the way into a flash hotel, but he is of the worst sort of film maker. A trick and con man. A man with no artistic value, which okay, not every film has, or is of principle, but this guy takes the urine. <br/><br/>Roll over every talent, JJ Abrams is in the room!"
"Sausage_Demon","9","3","9","17 January 2008"," Fresh take on a stale genre
","Cloverfield brings some originality in the telling of the classic Monster attacks city story.<br/><br/>Some like to complain about the fact that it is hand held and not filmed in the usual standard, this I feel is what made Cloverfield so easy to get into, as it has an almost first person experience. Others complain about the infinite battery on the camera...unless you want to be watching black after half an hour I think people should really let this one go, the ""infinite battery"" criticism is something people use who are looking to hate this film, they make a point of how unrealistic it is, you know since all other movies are entirely realistic of course.<br/><br/>someone wrote a review saying they couldn't believe that the camera happened to have night vision settings, a built in light and all that. Well newsflash, most handi-cams these days come with those features, I have one over 3 years old that had a very bright light on it, plus a nightvision mode...very unrealistic of course.<br/><br/>The two big things that really make this film great are two things missing not only from the genre but most films these days, and that is Characters you can care about, and not over explaining everything. This film doesn't explain what happens to NY, or the monster, or what the little creatures infect people with to make them explode, or where the monster comes from, why it is attacking NY. That may seem like a lot, but it allows people to use their imagination and considering most people these days do very little thinking I would call this film a type of therapy. The monster itself looks cool, I felt it could have had a slightly better design but since it is not in your face throughout the film that's forgivable. <br/><br/>It is a new take on the genre, any monster film in the future will have to emulate the immersion the audience got with this film or fail outright. Some people will feel sick due to hand held filming, thats a given, and those who hate it when people do something new will hate it but I recommend giving this film a go, J.J. has redeemed himself to some degree with this film after ruining LOST with season 2&3."
"directxpert","9","3","9","17 January 2008"," Glad to be one of the first to see it.
","(MINOR spoilers nothing major) The trailer and promotional posters for this movie told us almost nothing, just showed a destroyed Manhattan. One might assume it was The Day After Tomorrow 2, or a complete rip-off, but I can assure you, it was extremely un-clichÃ© and creative.<br/><br/>So a giant ""thing"" is attacking Manhattan. Throughout the film I heard people saying ""Godzilla 2.0"" behind me but I disagree completely. What happens with and to the monster is very realistic in terms of CGI and creative by the team behind the film.<br/><br/>The whole film is a camcorder perspective, which does sort of get us involved with the characters more than a normal director's approach. Because of this, there is no music to be heard. It'd ruin a lot of the film anyway.<br/><br/>The film did have me, and a lot of people on the edge of their seats. A lot of was happening... a lot of the time, whether it be characters fleeing, the ""thing"" attacking, or actors fulfilling their ""emotionally unstable"" role. Speaking of actors, they were all brilliant.<br/><br/>The ending is what had most people shocked. It wasn't the typical ""thing attacking"" ending such as the one found in Godzilla, it was more... unexpected, almost as if you didn't want it to happen.<br/><br/>I give it 9/10 simply because of its originality and clever work by the team behind the film."
"bogal0","9","3","9","17 January 2008"," You must go and see this movie!
","Just got home from watching Cloverfield and wow it was great and very absorbing to be part of! That is what you feel like when you watch, you are with them running and hiding and running and climbing and running and screaming and more running! <br/><br/>The start at the party is a good run up to the main part of the story and the intro to all the participants in the running! The acting makes you feel like these are ordinary people at a NY leaving party for someone they all like and will be sad to see leave to a job in Japan. Rob is not so happy as he is leaving his girlfriend Beth behind and when she arrives at the party with someone new Rob is not pleased!<br/><br/>I sat watching and wondering when the explosion was going to happen and it only added to the tension of waiting and anticipating it. The non-stop action starts and does not stop until the credits at the end and what a ride it is! There is not too much blood or violence to people but the buildings take a hell of a pounding (why is it always New York?) The monster is cool and unusual and the special effects real enough to want to check if NY is still in place!<br/><br/>Well worth the cost of a ticket and a great movie!"

","I went and saw this movie at the cinema today. I didn't know much about the film before today. When I went to buy the ticket the woman at the admission asked if I get motion sickness. So I said 'No' then 'Why?'. She replied by telling me that a few people, after exiting the theater were feeling sick. I just didn't really believe her that much.<br/><br/>So, the movie started. There was a fare-well party for some guy in it from some guys camera-point-of-view.<br/><br/>Then the monster attacked and the camera was jumping all over the show. ( I now understood what the woman was explaining to me about).<br/><br/>Cloverfield was a (for me) a pretty awesome movie in the end. The whole camera idea made you feel right in the story...and I mean RIGHT in the story. In a motion master type way.<br/><br/>So, if you enjoy fast, action packed, scary films that get your heart racing. Cloverfield is definitely up you alley.<br/><br/>9/10"
"hughmitton","9","3","9","16 January 2008"," Innovative, creative, almost satisfying
","If all you are expecting is some kind of Blair - Godzilla mash up, then you will enjoy this film immensely. The selling point of this movie is the P.O.V handycam and it works well; it connects you to the characters and in some instances you can feel what they feel. Using a dubbed-over tape to intertwine back story with current events, we entail a small group as they run, shake and scream all over Manhattan. And it is one hell of a ride, the effects work really well; I don't know what it is about all this motion sickness crap - perhaps eat less, sit further from the front and drink water.<br/><br/>So what wasn't so 'cool' about it? Firstly, a couple of clips from 'Trailer B' make it obvious what is going to happen in the story. Two, the creators daringly took up the opportunity for product placement. Considering there's pretty much no sign of any other posters or billboards it becomes obvious what it is when you see it and ultimately brings you back into the cinema for a minute. Lastly, the foley was slightly off. You know how in ninety per cent of films the thunderclap happens at the same time as the lightning? Yeah, well, it's the same for this. Military jets, explosions etc just all seem not quite right, especially if you've ever seen all those things in real life.<br/><br/>But no one's perfect, and on that note, I wouldn't bother squabbling over the ending, the 'monster', the characters and their decisions or anything like that because you're meant to be left in mystery. Nobody should leave going ""Oh wow, I see what they're trying to get across"" it's laminated in cool and it is entertaining. That's what blockbusters are for right?"

","I grew up on a diet of giant monster movies like Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, Gorgo and the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms. I waited trepadatiously for this movie, doubting that the hype would be justified, but hoping none the less. The movie succeeds, and delivers as promised.<br/><br/>As reported elsewhere, the film unfolds from the point of view of some people being filmed on a hand held video camera. When things start happening they are totally clueless, as are the military personnel that show up.<br/><br/>People panic and make irrational decisions. Unexpected heroism leads to tragedy. People find hidden strength they did not know they had. The monster rampages, confused and deadly. People die.<br/><br/>The interpersonal drama is what makes this movie work so well. The scarcity of direct views of the monster help rack up the tension. In saying that, one does get to view the monster, and it is impressive. It has a certain weird realism to it that makes it that much more intense.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one hell of an intense ride IF one just accepts it as if it is real footage while watching. The hand-held stuff can be a bit disconcerting at times,but it also lends itself to making things seem more real. I highly recommend Cloverfield. It is innovative and involving."

","This movie was awful. I can't understand why it gets the high rating. First things first, the beginning. Why spend so much time on a boring party? Considering that there's not a lot of intelligent dialogue in the rest of the film it's not like you have to learn much at all about the characters. So, they had sex. Now that's going to matter a lot to Blairzilla. This part could easily have been cut down to three minutes. And in the tunnel, where did these bugs come from? They looked like they'd been hanging around for ages, but apparently they'd just washed up on land and went straight for the tunnels.

","Cloverfield starts off like the worst episode of Laguna Beach where Spencer Pratt and his annoying looking friends have a send off party for their equally douche-bagish friend.

So they head off to midtown to look for main douche-bags girlfriend who may or may not already be dead. Sure the rest of us probably would have been like hey bro good luck and headed to jersey but the only person in this movie familiar with NYC geography seems to be the monster itself. <br/><br/>The movie is shot in super jerky handy-cam style to create an eye witness feel. Or as I like to say, the movie is shot in a shaky handy-cam style to cover the less than stellar or believable special effects.<br/><br/>The monster is pretty stupid looking for the most part and he pops up all over Manhattan, he also seems to have a great hatred for architecture (both classic and modern). The monster can also take a full on hit from a massive bomb and just be all like yo son, not a scratch!<br/><br/>Don't expect anything in the form of plot in this movie and don't expect much in the way of entertainment either."
"poolandrews","6","2","5","8 June 2010"," Bettr than I expected.
","Cloverfield is set in New York City as a farewell party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) who has got a new job in Japan & is leaving soon, all his friends are there but after a row with his girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman) she takes off. Then suddenly the ground shakes, looking outside the guests see huge explosions & building's collapsing. Soon it becomes apparent that a huge monster is making it's way through Manhattan destroying everything in it's path, Rob phone's Beth & learns that she is hurt, together with his best friend Hud (T.J. Miller) & a couple of girls from the party Rob decides to rescue Beth who is trapped inside her apartment but with a huge monster on the loose & the US military trying to kill it there's plenty of obstacles in their way...<br/><br/>Directed by Matt Reeves I have to say that I enjoyed Cloverfield for what it was even though I didn't expect to, in fact I usually rant on about how I hate the modern hand-held jerky camera movement that to me just looks awful but here in Cloverfield it's used to good effect. The best way to describe Cloverfield would be a giant monster film like Godzilla (1998) but told from the perspective of a bunch of normal people caught up in the situation unaware of what is happening & acting on instinct. The idea that you would want to save your friends & family is perfectly natural to me although if you would go up against a huge monster to do so is another issue I suppose, I really liked the average person perspective actually & the character's here do feel quite natural & ordinary. Portable video devices are everywhere these days so recording the events isn't a stretch either although that camera does seem quite robust considering what it goes through. While watching some of the spectacular sequences in Cloverfield I couldn't help but think if this was meant to be a 9/11 thing with terrified people on the ground running from falling buildings & the utter confusion, fear & panic that would inevitably happen. At only 80 odd minutes this moves along like a rocket & after the first fifteen minutes never lets up, I thought it was pretty gripping & intense & I liked the downbeat ending as well, far too many Hollywood films take the easy happy option. Having said that Cloverfield isn't perfect, there is no explanation about the monsters origin or it's fate & I am not sure it would stand up to multiple viewings.<br/><br/>The whole realistic shaky hand-held camera really does give the impression that your watching events unfold from some guy's point of view but it is a little too dark at times & a little too jerky although I am sure these were intentional by the makers. There's no real gore or violence, just a splash of blood really, Some of the CGI effects are very impressive, the monster itself, building's falling down, explosions & the Statue of Liberty's head getting dumped in the middle of New York. When you think about it though the makers of Cloverfield went to great lengths & probably spent a fair bit of money trying to make it look as low tech & low budget as they could, does anyone else see any sort of irony in that? Apart from during the end credits Cloverfield has no musical score & again that gives it a realistic feel.<br/><br/>Filmed in just 34 days in Los Angeles & New York on a $25,000,000 budget Cloverfield looks cheap & inept but that was a very deliberate look & some of the CGI effects are very impressive. The acting by total unknown's is pretty good to be fair.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a monster film that tries to tell it's story from the viewpoint of the ordinary person, the person who is terrified & doesn't know what it going on & only instinct is make sure his family & friends are safe. It's also a 9/11 film, the imagery & it's implication is too blatant to be merely coincidence."

","I was really surprised by how much I actually liked this film. The ""mockumentary"" style was really well done. As a result of course characterisation suffers and there is a lack of plot, but I don't care, because that's the point. You're not supposed to get bogged-down with all the whys and wherefores, because you're seeing it through the eyes of one of the characters and as a consequence there is no need for any of that. I really did enjoy it. There was a good atmoshpere surrounding it. I just felt uneasy all the way through like there was never anything quite right even when all seemed well and good. I've heard I lot of complaints about the ending, but I don't mind. If you think about it it's kind of obvious what was going to happen anyway- you're seeing through the camera held by one of the characters, so how did you get the camera? Really well made, I really enjoyed it. It's something different."

Well after I watched Cloverfield I was obsessed with the thought that maybe there are some specks of intense originality still left in Hollywoodland. The director obviously was inspired by the 'shaky camera' of the Blair Witch Project, the director must have seen its effect on the audience (which I will confess was very creepy at times in Blair Witch) The problem with Blair Witch is that it wasn't directed too intelligently, that is where the director of Cloverfield came into play and asked himself 'Hmmmm...how do I incorporate the shaky camera and still keep the viewer interested and not vomiting due to 'shaky camera syndrome?' Well he did it beautifully, the shaky camera was there (which I admit I was a little hesitant about dealing with for an hour and a half) but I actually found myself really into the movie and albeit the acting wasn't swell, but I can understand how the director wanted to bring a 'realistic' approach to the movie. All in All I was really really impressed with the film, so maybe there are still some specks of originality still left in the stratosphere of the movie world! Nine out of Ten Stars should suffice.

Its suspense, and has moments that grip you. The camera movement (which the movie is all about) is believable and works good with the characters which are also pretty good. The acting was also pretty darn good. Now, the things that i did not like. But this is just because i manage to find a flaw in every movie i ever see. And these two mi gonna mention are those that worked for me and most people wont even notice it. So here goes, the monster is a bit to skinny, and funny looking. It doesn't seem fearful or whatever... than there are a few times when one or the other character tries to be funny and damn, it doesn't work if you're being chased through a big city bu i freaky alien monster. but as i said, you'll get past these thing without noticing them... its just me.

","First, just a few words on the subject of 'spoilers'.<br/><br/>Preface: Cloverfield is so completely bizarre as to be nearly immune to being spoiled by anyone's comments. I could have read every spoiler here and still been nowhere near ready for what was waiting. (But I'm signing onto the IMDb 'spoiler' program just in case, lol!) <br/><br/>The home-movie stylizing of this flick makes the plot entirely indescribable. Basically, you are as helpless to grasp the 'what' and the 'why' as are the main characters. I had hoped to discover the answer to some of the mystery by the end of the story but apparently, the 'what' is still alive and the 'why' is because our military is buying its weapons systems from the same folks who make Frisbees.<br/><br/>Seriously, this is a very good, very unique movie. Some of the best FX are the helicopter scenes of the beasty getting blasted by a B2 Stealth Bomber. How in the hell did it avoid being turned into sushi is beyond me!<br/><br/>Okay, I'm gonna wait for a sequel because it just wouldn't be fair to mess up New York like that without offering the Red Sox fans in Boston some equal time ;) <br/><br/>..."
"joe d","6","2","5","25 April 2008"," Still Not Sure
","Saw it last night on DVD and still not sure if I liked it or not.<br/><br/>The film follows the technique as used in Blair Witch Project. We see events unfold as captured through a hand-held camera. This works out very well for with no musical background and actors portraying characters as everyday, ordinary people, we're able to see a realistic documentation of an attack on New York by a monster as experienced by of a handful of people. There is a complete absence of macho men and women trying to be heroes; instead the people are real, expressing their fears panic and confusion just like you and I.<br/><br/>However, it's this slick type of production that also leads to disappointment because it severely limits the action and special effects. With no communications and utter chaos in the streets, we are as completely in the dark about what is happening as are the characters. And like Blair Witch Project, we're left without any ending. Since we know the tape has be confiscated by the Government and is the only know video record of what had occurred, we don't know if the monster was killed, how much of New York City itself has been destroyed and if this devastation has been expanded to other areas. We get only a little glimpse of what is actually unfolding by seeing a small portion of a television news cast and by what we're told by army personnel evacuating the city.<br/><br/>So, at best, the film is half monster movie and half study of how ordinary people react. Depending upon one's preference, it could be either a 10 or a 1. That's why I took a little above the middle ground in my rating. I found Cloverfield both entertaining and disappointing for it held my interest but denied me the fun of knowing what was going on, hearing the scientific explanations and following the attempts to destroy the monster - the ingredients necessary for good monster-movie making. I also realize it was the producers' intent to keep us in the dark in order to become fully engrossed in the more realistic terror experienced by the film's main characters. Will admit this different approach did work and after having some time to think about it I can also honestly say that Cloverfield has indeed started to grow on me despite my initial disappointment."
"Deveousdevil","10","2","5","23 April 2008"," A very good movie, portrays disaster very well
","I thought this movie was really good for a number of reasons. First off, the main point of this movie was really to redeem the '90's debacle, ""Godzilla..."", which may very well have been the worst movie in history. Cloverfield does that well. It's the same story, a giant monster terrorizes Manhattan, destroying everything in its path. It is a little different of course. Instead of laying eggs, this monster is covered with venomous fleas, that if bite you, cause you to explode; and the monster itself is a lot cooler and designed better and that adds to the intensity and fear. <br/><br/>The entire movie is from the perspective of a few people through a video camera. So there is no music or traditional cinematography. However, that is the best part about the movie. It adds a lot of intensity and makes everything more personal and realistic. So if the mood of the characters changes, so will yours, in a more appealing way without the addition of sad or happy music, or descriptive montages. It really makes you feel like your in the same situation as the people.<br/><br/>This movie has some very clear references to the 9/11 attacks. If you've seen as many 9/11 documentaries or video clips as I have, you will easily notice some scenes that were taken directly from those clips, and adapted to the movie. For example, a very well known scene form 9/11, when a bunch of people were hiding in a store while the streets filled with smoke, or the smoke billowing between the buildings and ""chasing"" the people as they try to outrun it.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is very good. The people act just as you would expect them to in a life threatening situation. You never get the feeling that they have rehearsed anything they said. It is played all very naturally and very casually. As if it isn't a movie at all, but as if it is actually happening. A lot of the dialogue seems improvised , which is very good in a movie such as this because you want it to feel as if the characters are actually experiencing what you see on the screen for the first time. This again adds intensity to the movie when you personalize more with the characters and what and how they feel.<br/><br/>Although I am sure the writers' and directors' main goal was to make a really good scfi movie filled with cool creepy action, which they succeeded in doing, and making a few symbolic and literal references to 9/11, they were able to achieve a lot more thanks to the acting and cinematography.<br/><br/>This is a really good and cool movie, and should be watched at least once."
"bob the moo","Null","2","5","17 February 2008"," The gimmick in the delivery is effective and impressive in the midst of the action but the characters and narrative take away more than they add
","A group of young New Yorkers are holding a surprise going-away party in Upper-East-Side Manhattan, with the only excitement being revelations about the relationships between some of the friends. However a massive boom brings the party to an end and everyone heads to the roof in time to see further explosions, culminating with the head of the Statue of Liberty hitting their block. They attempt to flee Manhattan along with everyone else on the island while the military flood in from the other direction but a phone message from one of the group sees them heading back to try and rescue her as well.<br/><br/>The first ""big"" film of 2008 deserves credit for what it does very well indeed, which is its marketing strategy. Although I failed to see any of the trailers until the week before release, even I knew about it a year ago. Given the extent of the hype surrounding the film, it is hard to fault it in this regard. However when I got around to actually seeing the film, the way it had been sold was not really a factor in my enjoyment (or not) of it so I put this all to one side. The film opens slowly with an introduction to the characters and establishing of the party for later but after what does seem like an age we get the ""attack"" finally happening and with it comes the panic and hand-held chaos that the trailers gave us.<br/><br/>The next twenty minutes or so of this are great as we are thrown right into the middle of it and the effect is dizzying but yet very real. Many have compared this to the Blair Witch Project in its gimmick (the discovered ""real"" tape watched after the event) but this is not the gimmick that I think Cloverfield is built on. Instead the film relies heavily on the fact that we have all watched the news in the last two years and will have experienced many ""real"" events through the eyes of camera-phones and shaky-handed survivors as they are replayed on the network news programmes. This is a clever and effective gimmick and it is one that is at its strongest when it is making the action and attack the focus.<br/><br/>Sadly the gimmick does not work as well when it is trying to hold a narrative together because this is not what we are used to. Of course it doesn't help that the story is not that great. I didn't really want a mission back into the city and it did feel like the plot had been come up with to try and ensure ongoing action in the danger-zones rather than everyone running away. Massive coincidences ensure this feels more clunky and obvious than it should and, outside of the most intense scenes, you do feel it. The fact that I didn't like the characters was probably a bit of an obstacle to me as well. It is not just that they are young, it is that they are impossibly beautiful people who live wonderful lives in a wonderful city; it would not have hurt to have had a bit of diversity in the group to try and reduce this but then I suppose the makers know who their target audience are. The cast of mostly unknowns deliver well enough in terms of running and being frightened convincingly while looking attractive but the film is not about them and they are annoying at the times when the detail of their problems become the focus. I did like that the film treat them all as equally disposable though.<br/><br/>Reeves directs the action really well though and is helped by tremendous special effects that manage to feel real whether it is the destruction of buildings or a massive lizardy creature being fired on by jets. Indeed this is what the film is best at as it recreates the feeling of fear and destruction that we all experienced on television on 11th September 2001. Overall then this is why it is worth seeing  for the parts where the city is being destroyed and we are simply stuck in the middle of it all; just a shame that the characters and story seem to get in the way more than that they enhance the experience."

And you probably wont know either, since you can't really see what's going on. The characters and the acting were very poor. The movie was basically like this (which really annoyed me):<br/><br/>Cameraman yells: - OH MY GOD LOOK AT THAT! OH MY GOD DO YOU SEE THAT? In the same time he is ""of course"" recording the ground.

","Interesting to note all bad reviews of this movie have a ""SPOILERS"" warning. Intriguing at least. No spoilers on this comment.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is based on one sole concept JJ Abrams used on Lost: mystery&hype. The idea is not telling all the details, but instead fuel hype by letting viewers catch small implanted scenes and start a buzz around them. <br/><br/>This is not bad, if the content is truly good. Lost lived to the expectations most of the time. But this movie was not as well thought out as lost was. <br/><br/>Seems like the plan was to build up money by making a cheap blockbuster. They saved on famous actors, saved on film and lighting and everything a real camera work demands. Saved a lot -- movie only cost 25m to make. Built a lot of hype using the old trick of the ""what's that?"" ad plus really cheap internet buzz.<br/><br/>That all means this movie was really planned as a cash cow.<br/><br/>As all this took most of the thinking time of the production crew, there was not time left to develop likable characters. No time left to think about a reasonable reason for panic. So a monster was used. No time left to think about a story. There are tons of stories to tell on an incredible setting as a monster demolishing the crap out of New York. This movie only has people running around.<br/><br/>Characters were stereotypical. All party goers and all friends until death. All really freaking panic all the time, so you get screaming all movie duration. <br/><br/>In summary: <br/><br/>1) the movie gets points by being different. We hope there are more movies which do not tell the audience what is going on word by word. <br/><br/>But: <br/><br/>2) story+characters+script is dumb. The production had to expend to much time thinking how to build up hype and had no time to build a story or a good script."

","Quite possibly THE worst film I've seen in a year. The characters are pretentious, the acting is not great (a few times when confronted by an enormous monster they just say something like 'oh sh@t' or 'oh god' - not very likely, in fact the actors didn't make me care whether their characters lived or died. Too much build up around the party scene/beginning with nondescript characters, waiting for something to happen. The monster is unique looking, however it didn't explain why the monster was there properly and no clues as to how the monster came about. This film tried to be Godzilla - but even Godzilla explained why the monster was there and how it evolved!"

","0/10.<br/><br/>This is definitely the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. I was debating a few minutes ago between some really bad ones like Catwoman or Dr Moreau's Island or the heartbreak kid. But I decided this beats them.<br/><br/>I spent the first 30 minutes trying hard not to fall asleep and the rest of the movie trying hard not to throw up. <br/><br/>The first man view in a camera for an entire movie is really tired for the eyes, specially when this man is running most of the time. I definitely find unnecessary using this kind of filming and really ignore why they decided to record this movie like that. Lacks originality and makes people feel sick. I don't know for you but I went with 4 more people to the cinema and all of us ended up feeling dizzy.<br/><br/>There's a moment I swear to god, when you just want to go out running. I just decided to stay until the end to form a complete judgement of the movie (perhaps the end would be really good, I thought; I was wrong).<br/><br/>So everything in this movie is really bad, except for one or 2 sequences that definitely are not worth the torture."
"richard-wilkinson-2","10","2","5","3 February 2008"," Incredible, riveting and breathtaking
","Having waited months, watching trailers, reading previews and discussing the film with friends, I finally watched Cloverfield at the cinema last night. I can honestly say that I hadn't been as excited about a film since Independence Day, and was hoping and praying that JJ Abrams and Matt Reeves hadn't delivered a red herring.<br/><br/>Well I can assure you, after sitting open-mouthed for 1hr 25 mins, Cloverfield is already up there as a potential film of the year. Everything that makes a great action/sci-fi film is in there, from the everyday people having to do whatever it takes to survive, to the enormous monster terrorising the city, destroying everything and everyone in its path. Lets start with the characters : Rob and Hud are easily the best characters in this film. In particular, Michael Stahl-David's portrayal of a man desperately trying to save his loved one in the midst of destruction was fantastic. Hud, the cameraman for the film, is almost a spitting image of a friend of mine - from mannerisms to jokes - and his nervous, rattled voice trying to remain positive throughout the carnage we witness on the camcorder is brilliant. Most importantly - the monster. Without a shadow of a doubt, the Cloverfield monster is terrifying - looming high above everyone in the city as it destroys buildings and screams deafeningly across the night. In particular, the view from the helicopter where Hud is screaming ""can you guys see this?"", we see the gigantic beast skulking, almost as if it is hunting, through the city, baring its teeth and lashing its tail. Oddly, not once does the creature seem unrealistic and I actually felt like it could be something from under the sea that man had yet to encounter, instead of just some alien creature with powers beyond ours. The creature seemed confused by what was around it, like it had been awoken from sleep, only to find the world it knew before very different. The main point of this film is the way it is shot - through a Panasonic camcorder. Contrary to beliefs, this makes the film even more terrifying - it makes you feel like you are actually there experiencing all the terror with Rob, Beth, Lily, Hud and Marlena. My eyes took a bit of getting used to the movement at first, but after the first few minutes I was just riveted by the on screen mayhem. To summarise : Cloverfield dared to be different, it dared to reveal nothing beforehand, and dared to try things that had failed with films in the past. The giant creature, the camcorder viewing aspect and the relatively unknown actors and actresses. But surprisingly, and thankfully, all gambles paid off - leaving us with one of the years, if not decades, most terrifying and satisfying movie experiences."
"eric-shapehead","10","2","5","3 February 2008"," Best Monsterfilm I know! My experience with it:
","I can't say much. I went to cinema and hoped to see a real good movie about Monsters and this movie surpassed my expectations by far. I thought, how would it be like, when I was the man with the camera. At the end of the movie, when the credits came, I just sat there and could'nt say anything. Was it shock or like the time stopped? I don't know. I never felt such enthusiasm, I just had a real strong feeling in my mind, which was saying: ""WOW! That was amazing!"" I didn't want the movie to stop. I sat there and couldn't move, couldn't say a word. Even my girlfriend sat there like I did. The way home in the car was really quiet and I just said ""What a movie!"" and that again and again.<br/><br/>And I couldn't thing of something else. I never had such a feeling in other movies and trust me, I saw tons of Movies in my life. The last movie I had just a little bit of this feeling was 300. I can't describe this feeling, but I know, that I want to see this movie again and I hope there will be a Cloverfield 2, because I have lots of questions open.<br/><br/>The best Monsterfilm in my opinion, now Alien+Aliens are only on rank 2 and 3 and Cloverfield is my No.1<br/><br/>It's worth to see this movie in cinema and when think, that you are the person with the camera, then you will have a much better Moviefeeling.<br/><br/>And for those guys, who say: ""No Story, No Plot"" and bla bla. This movie is made in a style of: ""what would be, if this happens in the real world?"" If something like in Cloverfield happens to us in reality, do you need a story for it or what? Are you then yelling to the Monster: ""You suck, you have no story""??? This movie had a goal and this goal is to make a Movie from the perspective of a normal Person and how would this Person act, when something like in Cloverfield happens in our World. You all only need Stories and other things. I just think you can't think realistic. How would you act, when a Monster appears in your town? This Movie shows it the best. How much will you know, when a Monster appears in your Town? The Movie shows it the best.<br/><br/>And now shut up with your need of a Story. When something happens to the world, there is no story for you as a normal being."

","J.J. Abrams has a reputation for leaving audiences hanging. While I won't reveal if 'Cloverfield' follows the trend, I went into the theater ecstatic about seeing the mysterious monster that he had cooked up for this film. The first person camera is difficult to handle at first, but after about 10 minutes you will hardly notice it. Abrams does a good job of not having it shake when the character is running or during action shots. The plot is very fast moving, and the characters in the film are very real. Getting to see the monster is probably the best part of the film. I would recommend this movie, but it probably won't make my top five for 2008. It really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. 'Cloverfield' isn't a must see...I would classify it as a ""Should See""."

","I just got home after watching the movie and I was probably the only one in the theater that liked it. The idea of shooting the whole movie from the eyes of ordinary people and their cam is just great. The best example is of course ""The Blair witch project"". <br/><br/>The movie is full of tension, suspense, great action, great sounds and the view of the ruined Manhattan is very convincing! The atmosphere is recreated so realistically, that you can almost feel yourself involved in the action. This movie is definitely one that you MUST see at the theater, at your home I'm sure you'll miss the whole action and thrill.<br/><br/>So that is for the good stuff - now let me tell about it's weak sides. First is the emotions and human relationships involved - they were so fake and so full of clichés, that there were some people laughing in the cinema. I know it's hard to enact true human emotions and feelings through the eye of a home camera, but that doesn't mean that it is impossible and definitely doesn't mean that director Matt Reeves should just place them there full of clichés and so fake and boring! The second serious fault is the monster - when will they learn that even the best computer made monster isn't even 1% as scary as our imagination, and believe me the monster is very well executed, but that is still not good enough, I would prefer it if it was left for me, to torture my imagination what king of thing is attacking them!<br/><br/>So to sum up - I liked the movie but at the same time I felt it could've been done better!

"TonesH","7","2","5","26 January 2008"," A surprisingly good film
","I have to admit, this was not a film that I would have seen on my own accord. I hadn't heard of it when my friend invited me to this, and after a bit of research I was put off by two things: firstly that it was a monster film, and that it involves hand-held camera. But in the end this was a surprisingly effective monster flick, up to the same standard as The Host.<br/><br/>Firstly I was not captivated by this movie. The beginning bit in the party was frankly quite irritating. I grew to quickly dislike most people, particularly the guy behind the camera. I think that not much character development was made, nor was it throughout the film. I think I would have preferred to have come in when the action begins, not really knowing who these people were. The core of this film is the action, not the characters.<br/><br/>The action is surprisingly good. The special effects were fantastic, and even in vast New York one feels a certain claustrophobia. The pacing was very good, and the action was nicely quick. It wasn't lingered on, and it wasn't built up to. It was sudden and horrific, making it seem more like the danger could come from anywhere at any time. The danger of the large beast and then the little creatures made the danger feel both epic and personal.<br/><br/>I had heard before this film that we wouldn't see the creature, and that certainly would have disappointed me, I think. I think that the hand-held really made the creature more real, as we only see brief glimpses of it until the very end (which sort of countered the effectiveness of the rest of the movie, to an extent). The fact that we didn't really know what the creature was, or what its intentions were, made the movie far more effective, as one never knew what was going to happen. Nor did the movie fall into that irritating trap of the stranger who knows everything, and comes and goes at different times.<br/><br/>One thing that frustrated me was the going back to the previous tape of the couple. I think I would have liked it better if that was our only knowledge of the characters. I think it was underused as a device, because it really only happened four or five times. I think I would have proffered it if the last scene, and the last video flashback, were our first real insight into who those people were. But such is life.<br/><br/>In the end I thought that this was a terrific monster movie, certainly one of the best I have seen in a long time."
"Exiss","6","2","5","25 January 2008"," It's certainly a first and it probably needed to be made...
","So here I am at home, having just gotten back from watching Cloverfield with two friends, and I'm all set to impress my opinion upon you like my fellow public and tell you why Cloverfield sucks/rocks.<br/><br/>Except not, I'm not going to tell you that you should or shouldn't go out and watch Cloverfield. You can decide that for yourself. What I will tell you about is how my experience watching Cloverfield was. I thought the movie was all right, nothing to blow my socks off, but I wasn't upset either. After all, I had friends with me, Cloverfield probably would have been less entertaining for me had I gone by myself.<br/><br/>It really is a different kind of movie. A familiar movie, but done up in such a way that it crosses multiple genres by combining different styles of movie-making. On one hand, we have the traditional story of a monster attacking a large, populated city. I've heard the comparisons to Godzilla over and over again, but in my opinion, the point of view Cloverfield was filmed in takes it further from Godzilla than closer. We, the audience, view the entire spectacle from behind a video camera being held by one of the characters. If I had to try and pin down what type of movie Cloverfield was, I'd say Monster Docu-Drama fits the bill pretty well. If nothing else it's a fast-paced, disaster-film version of the Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't spend much time establishing characters, it doesn't answer any pressing questions. It presents itself as if the audience were actually taking part in the events happening on screen. We know as much as the characters do at the end of the day, and can only really speculate and fill in the missing blanks with our imaginations.<br/><br/>Since Cloverfield has done so well in the box office, I expect to see a sequel or two in the coming years. Maybe not written or directed by the same people, but it's coming.<br/><br/>To its credit, Cloverfield is certainly a first and it probably needed to be made. The monster movie genre has become pretty stock and dead in the past years and could use a different, fresher viewpoint. If only a familiar, yet slightly altered view.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Dream_seeker","8","2","5","25 January 2008"," Possibly the closest original Monster movie that's actually good!!!
","Before I get into being the critic i have to say this, when walking into this movie you have to remember 1 thing; that this movie is being done by hand held camera so unless you haven't seen a movie that was dealt in this type of aspect (Aka. Blair witch) then you might find this difficult to watch but it depends on the viewer. Now i will get into the criticism.<br/><br/>I have to give it to J.J. Abrams for amping the people up with the secret type of trailers and websites that gives prelude to this anticipated movie and finally when going to see this movie i was expecting the hand held shaky camera feel so i wasn't surprised at the outcome cause it just adds more depth as well as realism to the ride. The story....well...there's not much of a story; technically, its more so a documentation that was left via SD card during the aftermath of what happened and picked up by the military to be viewed and that's where the fun begins. What makes this movie even more realistic is the fact that they don't know much about the monster than we do when watching it; so when they know as much we do too (in a sense of the word); thus adding a scary reality to the threat this movie provides and gives that much originality to the focus of the movie.<br/><br/>The actors are a close to real as they can get and even though there were some that would be confused by the time jumping during the camera scenes when you put 2 and 2 together you get to understand what is going on between the characters of Beth and Rob and their somewhat shaky relationship before, during, and after the horrific events so in a way one would or could make it out to be a love story in the middle of an apocalyptic event; But this movie didn't need a soundtrack cause it added just as much tension without it, you feel for these characters as well as dread the monsters that seem to come out of the woodwork during the battle scenes and that's where the awesome special effects comes in. I can't compare this movie to Blair witch cause as much as there is an identical feel there is a significant difference, Blair witch is more on a psychological aspect. Whereas for Cloverfield this is drowned in awesome special effect that seems to mesh very well with the real hand-camera the action picks up strong in certain parts of the movie giving it a deeper tone as well as fear for the people portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>This is a love or hate movie, some will love the direction that this movie puts on the audience as well as how it was well written and directed as well as the not-knowing until they know aspect which i felt was greatly on point cause even the military didn't know what they were facing so this movie won't hold your hand in anything cause our guess is as good as theirs. Some will hate this movie cause of that same approach i've mention...you see some people want to know ahead of time what is going to happen or who they are going to face but when you have something like that...you don't get that sense of dread and surprise but most want that; also the camera isn't the best and these guys run...and run, and run so you have to deal with that from time to time if not all the time...i'm sure there are other, ""Love, hate"" reasons but i think i said too much.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8 simply cause its even though it has lack of story it holds a deeper, original, realistic feel for danger as well as a typical love story which gets you into their world. Also, the shear not knowing until the characters know made this movie just as real as if this was caught by surprise as the next person and you get more hints as they know which. Along with damn good special effects this movie did a good job making people anticipate and it didn't let me down which some movies would do sometimes when faced with that type of hype.<br/><br/>Plus, I thought the woman playing lily was HOT!!"

","Finally someone who dares to do something different. ""Monster movies"" hasn't evolved for a don't know how long, so this is really needed. Some people complain about the camera work, but this isn't supposed to look like a movie, it's supposed to feel real. I really had trouble coping with the cameras without tripods in, for example, Bourne Supremacy. But that movie was supposed to look like a movie. In this movie, it just adds to the realism, and the feeling that ""I'm here, this is happening"".<br/><br/>Few movie creator dare to do something different. Most people just do it ""the safe way"", but some few selected persons have something to offer the viewers.

","Cloverfield is exactly what you'd expect from the trailers, and from Abrams, and because of this, I feel it fully fills the shoes of the ""hype monster"" it has created since the original trailer was shown during the Transformers.<br/><br/>Most people know going into the film that it's meant to be as realistic as possible (as far as you can get giant monsters attacking New York to be real) and so not only is it shot with what is supposed to be a hand-held camera, it also uses a cast full of unfamiliar actors to further support the idea that this isn't a just a movie. The only actor I recognized was one of the police officers (who was on screen for about 3 seconds) played Jackie Jr. on The Sopranos.<br/><br/>The above factors and many others definitely make Cloverfield the scariest, and most suspense filled monster movie ever. It presented a great mixture of ""shocker"" moments along side what I like to call ""Shamalyan"" moments, where the suspense and tension is a bigger payout than the rest of the scene.<br/><br/>The movie only goes for an 1 hour and 24 minutes, but still does a great job at establishing the main characters identities just enough to where the audience cares what happens to each of them, but not so much that we sink into boredom and get robbed of what the movie is truly about.<br/><br/>I'll end by saying that naysayers, whiners, and pessimistic people who rate this movie low either did not know what kind of movie they were seeing, or were bound to hate it right off the bat. This movie, in it's genre, and what it was made to do, should definitely be an eight star or above rated movie forever.<br/><br/>If you WANT to see this movie based off the trailers, I can give you my guarantee you WILL like it. I can not stress this enough."

","this is the best movie ever!!! and the handy-cam made the movie best because everything was so real. I felt like this was really happening and I was part of it. when we went to theater to buy the tickets , the lady who sells the tickets told us, it was the worst movie ever.. don't go and don't waste your money she didn't let us buy the tickets :)and I called my friends and told them what she said to me and my friends said let's gave it a try and we decide if it was good or not. then we went back again bought the tickets lady said that it was the biggest mistake and waste of money. first 10 minutes I didn't like it. too much dizziness and then boom!! movie really started I loved it!! it's different. very different. if you don't like changes probably you don't like this movie but if you like it you are gonna love this movie because for me (as a movie freak) this was the first extraordinary movie and I can tell you this, you won't waste your money if you decide to go it worths every dimes you will spend..and filmmakers; very good job, congratulations.."
"theghost1","9","2","5","24 January 2008"," GREAT MOVIE *may may you sick* BUT NOT BAD MOVIE
","I won't mention any of the details of the movie I will only say that I went and saw this movie knowing as everyone should have that went to see it that it was going to have shaky camera shots the whole way through. Alway's check out a movie before you go see it to find things like this out. It was all over the net without revealing any details that this was from the perspective of a video camera. I know my home movies shake like crazy. I HAVE VERTIGO. SO I knew going in that I was asking for trouble. first 10 minutes or so I was thinking ... oh crud I've messed up i'm gonna get soooo dizzy and then get sick.. but I stuck it out. I made it through the entire movie and you know what? out of over 100 people in the theater I saw 2 or 3 get up and leave but they came back... with POPCORN and drinks so they were not getting sick. Now will some people get sick from this? Yeah sure. Will some people get sick from rollercoasters? YEs I do and I know not to ride them because I can't do it I get sick every time.<br/><br/>About the movie though? IT ROCKED. FRESH New Ideas and action and scares.. Sure there were some stupid things in it but hey what movie does not have from time to time? I give this movie a 9 only because It was not perfect as I have yet to see a perfect movie.<br/><br/>As for some not all but some of the people giving bad reviews on here. One guy said he had to leave about 10 or 20 minutes into the movie because he got sick and then says the plot line sucks?? How can he say that if he did not watch it? The plot does not even really start until about 20 good minutes into the movie maybe 30. I think a lot of these people are just upset because they got sick. And I can seriously sympathize with them. If I had to have paid 9 - 12 dollars to see this movie and got sick I would be upset too... at myself for not going to matinée and paying 6 dollars when I know that I get sick sometimes with motion. That way I've only lost 6 dollars and it's my fault not the movies.<br/><br/>Bottom line is this. I LOVED this movie. IF your able to watch things like this all the way through without getting sick then you will probably love the movie also but take the advice of other people and take some Dramamine if you get motion sickness. Not sure if that stuff makes you sleepy or not I've never taken any. But the movie is only an hour and a half long so maybe you can make it with some. It's too good of a movie to wait for DVD or VHS"

","ever wander into a party where you don't really know anyone and have it go bad? maybe the cops show up. maybe a massive fight breaks out. or maybe the entire city is torn apart by something huge and you don't understand at all. you're thrown into a situation with complete strangers, forced to make the best of it. everybody has to make their own decisions, and you're along for the ride. would you get a little attached to them? start to relate, maybe. would you want to help them out if you could? calm their panics and try to get them thinking straight enough to survive? have you ever physically ducked in a cinema because you were so immersed in the experience? reeled in horror at the sudden and shocking fate of anyone on screen? have you ever left the cinema with more questions than when you went in, and spent the whole car-trip home and beyond discussing what you think you saw and what you think it means? if you answered yes to any of the above, you've probably just seen Cloverfield. if not, aren't you just a little intrigued?"
"cjfort","10","2","5","23 January 2008"," The Review: Cloverfield
","Cloverfield could probably best be summed up as a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Walking into Cloverfield, I had known about some of the hype, and had know about it for awhile (A relative was heavily into it), and I am happy to say it is as good, if not better than hoped.<br/><br/>I do believe the hype has helped how good it is. If you followed everything, the film is much more real to you than someone knowing there was an explosion in the commercial. But if you didn't follow the hype, you can be sure it will still be a good movie.<br/><br/>I would like to mention, though before I get into the hardcore part of my review, that A). I will not spoil the monster many have wandered about and B). Be weary of negative reviews, because after asking people, I've noticed, quite ironically, that the people who don't like it the most, are all in school, aka the people who are most hardcore about YouTube.<br/><br/>Now, this movie has been most popularly called a mix between The Blaire Witch Project and Godzilla. Though there are heavy elements between Cloverfield and these films, that comparison isn't quite right.<br/><br/>This movie is not a rip-off. It is more like an original movie made out of Unoriginal parts. The film does do the hand-held, first person point of view like Blaire Witch (which was the reason for many negative reviews, and for me warning you that if you have motion sickness, don't watch the film), but this movie doesn't screw up the premise. It uses it very well, and doesn't over do it, and puts our very funny comic relief behind the camera.<br/><br/>The film is very intense throughout, and doesn't disappoint on it's monster. The monster is used like Jaws is used, only with a little more seeing, and this ends my talk of the monster.<br/><br/>Another warning, is that you must know that this isn't played like a movie, or a documentary. It's played like a tape found after the incident nicknamed ""Cloverfield"".<br/><br/>This movie won't have a formulaic (for the most part) story, so don't expect Hollywood endings or development, but more like real people in real situations. That is the main reason overall why people didn't like it, because they expected a Hollywood picture or '98 Godzilla. DON'T. THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF FILM.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was very exciting, realistic, and the characters aren't character's, but real people (to creep you out more, go to their Myspaces).<br/><br/>I highly enjoyed this film, and protect it from haters. See it with a fresh mind.<br/><br/>Rating: *** (of 4) <br/><br/>Entertainment: PERFECT 5 (of 5)"
"nowicrytearsofrain","9","2","5","23 January 2008"," fantastic movie
","this was such an exciting movie. i was thinking it was going to be lame like the Blair Witch Project, but it was noting like that. it was great. it was so much better than the trailers led it to be wow i mean it is totally worth the money to see it had my attention and it seemed as if it was really happening right there with you it never tells how the Godzilla like creature came to be in Manhattan but i like the way. and they don't tell you and those spider like things that come from it are insane! i mean wow that was creativity. the only bad thing is that it makes you dizzy from all the jumping of the camera but it was very well done! kudos really one of the best i have seen in a while, and i am around movies 24/7."
"AdamPeabody","5","2","5","22 January 2008"," Great sound design...um, that's it, I guess.
","This video (yes, I meant that) may be comfortably viewed on, say, my 7"" portable DVD player. Perhaps even as large as my 20"" bedroom TV. Certainly not the big ol' DLP in the living room. And under no circumstances should this picture be viewed on THE SILVER SCREEN. <br/><br/>Clearly taking a cue from any and all video footage from 9-11, this is a movie about running. Not in the ""Run Lola Run"" Steadicam/Shotmaker Truck kind of way, oh no. This movie is about running in the same way as giving the video camera to your four year-old. There is more footage of the Lower Manhattan asphalt here than anything else. There was a warning printed on Salmon-colored paper at the theater where I viewed this explaining to me I might suffer motion sickness as result of seeing ""Cloverfield."" It should have said ""will suffer motion sickness."" When it ended, I swear I've never before heard more people groan wearily as they stood up.<br/><br/>The one genuinely redeeming element of seeing ""Cloverfield"" in the theater was the brilliant sound design. That is what holds everything together and makes it remotely enjoyable. While somewhat unrealistic, being that no handy-cam microphone could record (to say nothing of playing back) such rich audio, it is still very compelling and engrossing to listen to what the visuals cannot convey. There are a lot of these moments. Particularly, there is a moment in the subway tunnels when the characters are being stalked by creatures unseen, only to reveal them in an admittedly clever use of the infrared gimmick. <br/><br/>This was a really hard video to watch. I had to take full minutes away from the screen to focus on the theater's EXIT sign in order to prevent heaving up my popcorn. Entire running sequences are lost to me as I stared at the hairdo sitting in front of me. At least in the beginning, I could watch the on-screen time and date, which held perfectly still. That ended up disappearing about fifteen minutes in. Michael Bonvillain, ASC, I salute you. You truly kicked my butt. I hope someone gets you a geared head on a J.L. Fisher dolly next Christmas."
"prashant-end","7","2","5","22 January 2008"," Awesome Special effects
","This was a movie which i can say is unique and with mind boggling special effects - thats the only reason i rated it 7! Other than that there were many ways u can dissect the movie to raise questions like - video cam battery life? how the video survived?etc...but I really dint care about all of that and watched it as a movie based on its merits! It was one fun ride for me...amazingly refreshing movie and yeah hope the constant movement of the camera doesn't effect you! Also watch it in a big screen for max effect!!! If I was 18 I would have rated it 9. Acting was pretty good and also liked the way the Director started the movie and introduced the 'Scene'! Everything was very different, especially the way he directed, it felt like I was between all that what was going down in the movie, and I also wonder if he used 'other cameras' for some scenes, other than the video-cam!"
"debaryman101","7","2","5","22 January 2008"," I am at my wits end
","I have been reading various comments how this movie was awful and they should not have been shaking the camera. This is supposed to be someone recording the events of the horrible day that they are going through. Do you hear music?? As in a traditional movie!!! Except for the party scenes. The only music played.<br/><br/>Does anyone have an imagination anymore?? Or do you need everything served to you on a silver plate?? I read somewhere that the movie had no ending? The tape ran out!!!! That is why the previous recording was being seen. Also I think a bomb does not agree with a camera very much.<br/><br/>I am not saying I love what I watched but I do like it very much, It was very original. This is why we go to the movies to see something memorable. I watched this and when it was done and I left the theater I was expecting people to be running around for dear life. I was immersed in this movie for the time it was on the screen.<br/><br/>I read about the hype and saw the trailer during the beginning of transformers, which some of my friends thought was an excellent movie. I didn't think much of it during that time. Then I got into more investigation. Maybe a month before this was going to be released and I got into the story a little more and was excited to see it.<br/><br/>My wife thought it was a bad movie because she did not know a little back story about it. I don't what to get into arguments about how some people got sick, I'm not sure about how true that is. especially when not one person did in the theater I was in.<br/><br/>I liked what I saw and I imagine if it really happened, and NYC would be the worst place for it to happen in. Especially with all the people living there. I have one more thing to say, To all the people that think the people who made this are now making money from 9/11 because of various scenes that look the same, Think about it!!! If a building falls down it is going to make debris and something really big goes walking down a street, it's going to wreck that street.<br/><br/>Another thing to the 9/11 people, Watch ""9/11"" (look it up on IMDb) It was supposed to be a documentary about a probationary firefighter, But the film makers recorded in one of the towers what was going on that terrible day. That film is real compared to cloverfield and the man running the camera couldn't keep it straight. But I see some things that are the same in both experiences. I see fear and trying to help people you think you know and find out more about them.<br/><br/>I will end this with one more thing, Some people need more imagination especially when watching anything."
"atarimarinas","7","2","5","22 January 2008"," Felt sick but thrilled
","The movie itself i found it to be very realistic, apart from the fact that a giant monster is attacking New York CIty the hand-held camera does its job of delivering a realistic experience (Of course the way it's filmed). The film draws you in and makes you feel as if you are experiencing the film. The only bad thing about the movie was that it made me SICK, all the movement of the camera which makes the movie even more believable is the same reason why many of the viewers will feel as if they were in a revolving car for 84 minutes. On the other hand i thought the ending of the movie was good, i was expecting some kind of Hollywood ending that would show normal people in a party finding the weapon to kill the monster, it wasn't like that and it made the movie better, thank god that the main character didn't kill the monster with his bare hands!!!!"
"stebai","9","2","5","21 January 2008"," Its not a movie - it's a document.
","I loved it... couldn't understand all the teenagers who moaned like hell over the credits. Once you get over the shaky cam and buy into the film being a document rather than popcorn fodder, you should too. Everything runs just like it should, as in the camera stops recording whilst the group are re-viewing what just happened, we do not see this. The monst-ah (sorry can't pronounce it properly since Beowulf) is excellent. People who complain about it's lack of screen time should consider if they would turn around and video the thing if it was heading there way or run, like really fast, away.. Yeah.. Oh btw i loved the non Hollywood ending, like ""The Descent"" (UK version)it left my mouth dry and my senses drained."
"kidhasaces","7","2","5","21 January 2008"," Good , solid, different ,excellent not quite.
","A few weeks ago I didn't know much about this movie so I had little expectations, but a friend of mine wanted to go see it so I came here to see what people had to say. After reading a lot of comments I felt that this was a can't miss movie. So my expectations were turned from not much to anticipating this movie.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was indeed solid, it had a lot of the same type stories that you can compare to other movies but with a different take on the presentation. The story was decent, it did however lack details but I think that if you think of it as a first person experience you wouldn't have all of the details either.<br/><br/>The camera shaking was good for most of the movie, except some parts was making me dizzy and had to turn away if not I was going to be sick.<br/><br/>If you get a chance give this movie a try, it is a short movie and the pace was good the entire way.<br/><br/>My take this is a different movie in a lot of ways and if you sit down and think about it most people will enjoy it, but it isn't worth a 9 or 10."
"skatermike34","10","2","5","21 January 2008"," Awesome movie
","I saw this movie Saturday night and I have to say I loved it. This movie is different ,maybe to different for most people. The two friends I was with complained about the shaky camera a soon as we got out of the theater. I disagree with there reaction to the way this was filmed. Movies are almost all filmed the same way. There is something happening and you get all these different camera angles from all, which don't get me wrong isn't a bad thing. Filming that way helps to revel more about whats happening and shows you the bigger picture. But I don't think thats what they were going for here. In this movie they used the camera to put you in the movie with the actors. Filming it in this manor helped to add to the chaotic atmosphere of the movie. Yes its shaky and yes they run a lot causing them to point the camera all over the place, but when that happens you hear everything that is going on around them. You can hear the monsters roar, the guns firing, the heavy breathing of the characters from running for their lives to0 escape. Because they filed in a way that put you there in the action I felt many things. I felt excitement, concern, anticipation, and I think I shared in the terror of the characters. I could go on about why I liked the way this was filmed regardless of the shaky camera, but I'm sure anyone reading this wouldn't want to hear more and I am also very tired.<br/><br/>But I would like to add one more thing, this is a story line spoiler below.<br/><br/>For all of those that read this after they have seen the movie and have decided they didn't like it because they didn't tell you enough about the monster and where it came from and all that stuff. Well maybe you should try to think outside the box for once. This movie wasn't made to be your traditional monster movie. Where you are told everything about the monster and what not. This movie is about the experience of a few people during their struggle to survive. You don't know where the monster came from because the characters you follow don't know. Everything that you know depends on what the characters know. I feel that this made the movie even that much enjoyable for me because it was unique. ""Godzilla"" like movies always follow the monster around, and a few characters too, but even though you see the monster quite a bit it is still not the main focus of the movie. Yes the movie started slow with the party and what not but I think it was to help introduce the audience to the characters and to help them understand who they are. I feel this allowed the audience, or at least me, understand the characters and how they acted to their situation better. Such as why Rob so so driven to got save Beth. We find out that they are obviously very much in love but Rob angers Beth causing her to leave the party, where she would have been safe. So then he feels guilty for making her leave and now he feels obligated to save her, and also he loves her. Then they tell you about the love Lily and Jason feel toward each other, so when Jason dies you can understand the pain Lily feels better. And other things like that. Well I'm going to stop now, I didn't mean to make a long post but I got carried away and started on a rant. I'm not going to review it so I apologize for grammar errors cause I know there are people who stress about that stuff. Well its 6:17am and I have yet to go to bed, I hope you enjoyed my post and goodnight."
"Spookwhiskey","9","2","5","20 January 2008"," Film Review - Cloverfield
","Following a six month viral marketing campaign marked by its steadfast and absolute refusal to cough up so much as a cursory peek at its creature of feature, Cloverfield arrives as something of a miracle in this spoilerific age: an honest to goodness blockbuster that's managed to save its thrills for the theatre, an intense, accomplished dash through B-movie terrain given a snappy do-over thanks to a fresh eye and the savvy execution of a potentially gimmicky conceit.<br/><br/>It's the night of Rob's (Michael Stahl-David) going away party, a last hurrah thrown by his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) prior to his jetting off for an impressive new job appointment in Japan. Asked to document the occasion on Rob's handicam, Hud (T.J. Miller) finds it difficult to keep his wandering lens off the beautiful ring-in Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), the aloof object of his puppy-dog affections. But when Rob's one-time partner and long-time secret love Beth (Odette Yustman) departs early with her latest squeeze, it's only a hiccup in time before their lives are changed forever, as New York city finds itself at the mercy of some horror from the depths, some great, lumbering thing...<br/><br/>Shot entirely in handicam point-of-view with Miller's Hud acting as both commentator and cameraman, Cloverfield takes the 'human perspective of catastrophic events' approach employed by Spielberg's War of the Worlds and pushes it even further, offering a frenetic, man's-eye-view of the disastrous and grand-scale destruction typically relegated to Godzilla flicks. Towers are felled and bridges collapsed as the mysterious leviathan blazes a trail of ruin through inner Manhattan, the audience offered only the most fleeting of glances at the lion's share of the action as our band of protagonists flit in and out of shopfronts and alleyways in an ongoing effort to survive.<br/><br/>The hand-held photography is the real hook here, a device which proves eminently inspired. Director Matt Reeves sure knows how to sell the immediacy, ensuring the camera-work remains every nauseating bit as frantic and chaotic as you'd expect of the real thing. Sticking to his faux-vérité guns, however, means audience members craving the usual sweeping shots of the over-sized beast demolishing cultural landmarks and venting frustrations on sky-scraping highrises will be ever-so-slightly frustrated, wishing our camera-pointing heroes could perhaps adopt a brisk and steadied trot in lieu of their customarily haphazard hell-bolt. Of course, the frenzied slant obviously works wonders dramatically, and Reeves and scripter Drew Goddard even manage to find a use or two for the camera along the way beyond the obvious documentation tack to stave off any 'Why don't they just drop the damn thing and leg it?' critiques, the most noteworthy of which is a genuinely frightening giant parasite attack which plays out entirely in night vision. It's sequences like this which help reel us in, furthering the suspension of disbelief exponentially.<br/><br/>Of course, the harrumphing nitpickers will find much here to bemoan, from the lack of any discernible story and threadbare attempts at character development, to the questionable decisions made by said characters borne of a fundamental necessity to keep us close to the action, a problem inherent to the 'found footage' setup from the outset.<br/><br/>But hell, frownmongers be damned, for to focus on the minutiae is to deny yourself the thrill of an indisputably exciting exercise in escapist cinema. Cloverfield is a new take on the giant monster movie, nothing more, nothing less, and a terrifically entertaining action movie experience is there to be had for those open to it.<br/><br/>With its good-looking young cast and intrepid director all working overtime to ensure not a second of its economical runtime is wasted, the outstanding Cloverfield is a searing, white-knuckle monster flick from which fans of the genre will reap greatest rewards. Superior special effects and a city-trashing creature worthy of the anticipation push this over the line as a cracking, inventive example of a film that actually lives up to the hype."
"rodrigocamposbr","10","2","5","21 January 2008"," Great Film- GO SEE IT
","OK so the film lives up to the hype- Everyone that i saw it with enjoyed the film on many different levels- If you like LOST and do not mind a bit of a shaky camera then you will love this film- It is very much like LOST where JJ Abrams makes the viewer think, no so many questions as lost, but you do have to think for your self- Not everyone likes to do that so they may bash the film- For a regular moviegoer this is a very exciting and thrilling movie- At points you are on the edge of the seat because of the suspense that was built up- The special effects were good, the acting as well- HUD/the camera guy was funny and this helped set us up for the scary/thriller parts- The fact that i did not know any of the actors, or al least recognize them- Helped me believe in the story line- A group of friends at a party using a hand held camcorder- But you also have to consider this is a Monster flick and there are things that will never happen in real life- so if you cannot suspend reality for the duration of the film- you will be in trouble- I really enjoyed this film, the way it was shot made you feel as if you were in the film- much like a ride at Islands of Adventure, like Spider Man- feels like you are being attacked and are in the film- For all these reasons above i recommend this movie- I have never gone to the theaters 2wice to see the same movie, and my friends and I are going to do just that- I am 22 years old and my friends are in my age group- This is a film that is marketed towards 25 and under age group- and mainly males- So if you are 40+ and do not like LOST and did not like the way the Blair Witch was shot- please do not attend this film because you are not going to like it and are going to wrongly bash it- But if this does not pertain to you regardless of age you will have an entertaining time at the Movies-"
"stuart_lynch","5","2","5","21 January 2008"," Wait for Cloverfield 2 :The explanation
","It's difficult to perceive an acting performance as good when seen through a camcorder. Granted there were no fifty thousand dollar lenses, masterful cinematographers or great composers at work, but at the same time, I didn't care a damn for it's characters. Not the shaky and ""concerned for his friend"" cameraman, nor the lead character with his dangerous agenda. In fact at about 52 minutes, I wished they would have all died and the remaining 30 minutes could have offered some explanation as to what was actually happening.<br/><br/>To its credit, it was suspenseful, it was original in it's shaky cam sci-fi'ness, but didn't touch on anything that the Blair Witch Project hadn't done with a dramatically reduced budget years before, aside from a few guns and a few nice cg fx.<br/><br/>Speaking of and again to it's credit, CG shots of such magnitude are usually preplanned and executed through professional camera's, where markers, green screens and camera matching techniques take the place of actual directing and good old fashioned movie tricks. But anyway, to have added this kind of detail to moving camera footage is a testament to new and improving software, but not an extraordinary feat in itself, it simply ""can be done, these days"".<br/><br/>Well, I was bored to tears, my favorite moment in the entire movie was when the main character entered a store and we caught a moments glimpse of a reporters account of the goings on.<br/><br/>Maybe Cloverfield 2 can be a combination of fake footage from CNN, Fox News and BBC World News. The irony being of course, that FOX will defended George Bush's every timely action, just as they did with Katrina.<br/><br/>Good night."
"timothy-hill","6","4","14","11 February 2008"," OK but certainly not original
","As mentioned by other reports this film is fairly intense and certainly has that feel of realism in the fact that you (or the camera) puts you in the situation of a real life monster attack on Manhattan (again)!!. But the film is not original, add Blair Witch, War of the Worlds and Godzilla and here you have it. In most films there is an area which is totally non believable and this one is no different in the part that (a spoiler here) the three party goer's try to rescue a girlfriend who is not only injured but in a building which is just about to collapse and have minutes to do this and get on a final helicopter ride out of the city before it is nuked, quite ridiculous! Don't get me wrong the film is watchable but forget it if you think your watching something unique."
"jlamarca","4","9","42","31 January 2008"," I think that was one of the worst sci-fi films I've ever seen!!!
","Wow, I can't believe that this film scored so high! For starters, there was virtually no character development. Even if you try to appreciate the movie for its special effects, it's a no go! Perhaps even worse, was the fact that the damn camera was shaking PROFUSELY throughout the ENTIRE movie! It's understandable that the perspective was shot via that of a novice camcorder, but they could have at least ensured that the bloody camera had Steady Shot! To say that the shaking was extremely annoying would be a gross miss understatement! As bad as the movie was, I stuck around until the end thinking that the film might somewhat at least TRY to redeem itself, by giving us some good visuals on the monster, but... Well, let's just say that I don't want to be accused of writing a spoiler!"
"neilmarshall-1","4","5","20","13 February 2008"," An expensive risk
","I went to see this movie last night with no prior knowledge about the film, other than the attractive movie poster featuring a decapitated statue of liberty.<br/><br/>When the movie started and we were watching some camcorder footage, I kept wondering when the film was actually going to start! This was the kind of feeling I got throughout the whole movie. And I was not alone! I heard murmurings around the cinema with spectators wondering the same thing. I can not remember the last time I went to the cinema with over half the audience leaving before the halfway mark. (And the movie only lasts 95 mins) I admire the risk that the filmmakers took to create this movie. There are some attractive special effects and some parts of the movie are visually stunning. I also thought it was refreshing to see another film from the point of view of a cameraman, as I have not seen such a movie since the Blair Witch Project. However, before I went to see the Blair Witch Project, I knew what to expect.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Cloverfield would have been best suited on the Independent cinema screen, rather than mainstream.<br/><br/>If you want to go and see a movie from a different point of view with some attractive special effects then go and see this movie.

","Well, I went to see this full of the hope given by just about every review I head read or heard that the movie delivers something special. For me it didn't work, there was absolutely no way I could sit through 80 minutes or so of the worse camera action I have ever seen. It starts promisingly enough, but the moment the hand-held video camera that the film is shot on is passed to someone who has obviously never held one before, that did it for me. I have to admit and it's not easy for me to do, that I walked out on this movie. I have seen thousands of films and consider myself passionate about movies. I will give anything a chance but the continual movement of the camera, replicating a badly shot home movie just left me feeling sick with motion sickness. I got about 40 minutes through the movie before my stomach could take no more swaying too and fro, back and forth. I felt like my brain had been thrown about in my skull, what a shame. I was really looking forwards to this as I love a good monster movie. I have rated it 6 out of 10 as I gave it a chance."

","Few movies today are an experience in themselves. There are loads of movies that we experience, and that we are witness to, however, very few pull us in so deeply that we feel that we are a part of the action as well as Cloverfield does.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is exactly what we've been led to believe it is through months of viral marketing strategies (that have worked), it is a monster movie shot from the first person perspective, a story told entirely from one point of view, from a small group of people. An absolute must for enjoying this film, realize that fact, understand that this is supposed to be a found video tape of one small groups encounters with this disaster. For those who go into Cloverfield expecting to see the scientist who discovers the origins and just so happens to know the weakness of the monster, or the politicians debating full scale assaults and evacuations and ethics of bombing a city block, or the military hero who was about to pop the question to his pregnant girlfriend the evening he gets called in to save the day, or the many other rolls we've come very accustomed to seeing in apocalyptic movies, throw those old cliché characters out the window. You will not be hearing any power love ballads either, I'm sorry, but that's Armageddon, Independence Day, and about a dozen other movies, not Cloverfield. Cloverfield is told from the perspective of the people on the ground, who are hit by the unknown, who don't know what it is, what to do, or anything at all. This story is told from every normal person's perspective and really makes you feel the urgency and panic that we would all be going through. This movie is told by you, and if you can't relate to the plight of the characters, you haven't got an altruistic bone in your body. This is where Cloverfield makes those groundbreaking leaps and strides we've all heard about, it's our story, not our hero's story.<br/><br/>Overall, prepare to enjoy yourself at the movies. This is an experience. It is fun and in the true JJ Abrams fashion, highly mysterious and full of questions. But what do you expect? What questions do you think the people on the ground had during their experience? Those are your questions too. So don't go into this movie expecting the normal fully wrapped up in an easy to digest package with all of your thinking and answering done for you, this is a great ride that will have you and your friends talking about what you just saw. So enjoy, this is a fun one that you have to see.<br/><br/>All in all, you will either love it or hate it. I for one loved it."

","This is an intense movie which is surprisingly rebellious in its aim at frightening and equally exciting its audience. It's been a while since I have been to the cinema and have felt sheer and utter tension from beginning to end. The film memorably consists of a number of chilling effects conveniently shown on a handy cam. This is exactly what makes the film seam so real, which is why it's unfortunate that so many would criticize the films highest achievement. Thoughtfully, leaving us wondering about where the creature is from. This in my judgment is a positive aspect as it's not directly relevant in the films context to explain this, but further more the survival of our main characters. Which have to be applauded for portraying such believable performances. Always entertaining, disturbing at times and to an extent rather relevant. A+"

","Well for those of you that haven't seen this movie, please don't read any further, but for those that have seen it or those that don't mind be spoiled, read on.....Cloverfield is one of those movies that will leave you with more questions than answers at the end.  What is this monster?  Where did it come from?  Is it truly evil?  What is it's motivation?  Did they finally destroy it at the end?  Is there going to be a sequel!!!!????  All these thoughts were with me when I left the movie last night.  Well let me describe the monster first of all, because to be quite honest, if you have a weak or queasy stomach, I would recommend not seeing this movie, as it is taken with a hand held camera and jumps around a lot.  Anyway, the monster is huge!  It sort of looks like a dinosaur, but not quite.  It has huge red like lungs pulsating out of its head and huge fangs for teeth.  It releases spider/crab like creatures into the city and they seem even more terrifying than the monster itself.  These crab like creatures carry some sort of plague or infection that makes people blow up...and I will just leave it at that.  I believe that this monster pretty much just destroys NYC, because this tape seems to have been found later by people in the future and becomes property of The Department of Defense.  The unrealistic sides of the movie are a camera that never loses it's charge, a cameraman that can almost superhumanly keep filming this chaos all around him, and a monster that seems to be indestructible to bombs, missiles, artillery.  What is this monster?  I don't know, and I hope J.J. Abrams sheds some light on this in the future.  I have some theories and if you are interested, feel free to email me.  Thanks."

The movie was an action thriller all the way through, since you never actually see the monster clearly for several scenes.

","My friend who works at Fox has told me a lot about how the movie studios try to get lots of free advertising by setting up profiles on MySpace and other internet related stuff. And this movie was an internet sensation for a long time with it's advertising.<br/><br/>WELL IT WAS ALL WORTH IT!!!<br/><br/>Holy Jesus Mary and Joseph. This movie was such an intense experience like I haven't seen since watching Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. More importantly I was so entirely engrossed in the whole film for the entire time, and it's been 10 years since I saw a movie where I didn't look at my watch and wonder when it's going to be over. I loved ""There Will Be Blood,"" but even there it didn't keep my attention the entire time.<br/><br/>My only criticism is about near the end when Rob and his gang continue to pursue their quest to save Beth. Why in hell would you climb into the AOL/Time Warner building when one tower is collapsed into the other tower? Didn't we learn from sept. 11th? Although it all serves the cute love story I still felt no woman (Or in my case man) is worth risking your life like that when you don't even know if she's alive or not. And when they get to her she's impaled by a steel girder? Oh well, Trinity seemed to live for awhile at the end of the Matrix trilogy when she was in a similar situation.<br/><br/>However all in all I finally totally experienced the ""Dream like state"" that Freudian film theorists talk about in watching a film in the dark theatre. When I left the theatre I was so exhausted and traumatized I felt I had been through a war.<br/><br/>Some people were angry, and wanted their money back, because the movie didn't explain anything as to where the hell the alien came from and why he (Or is it a she?) chose to rampage and destroy Manhattan. That wasn't the point of the move dumb asses. It's all from the perspective of a guy with his video camera. Of course we don't get all the nice explanations. And if you sit back and enjoy the film you don't give a damm about nice explanations as to why. Film is usually about a ""Slice of life"" and just because this is a science fiction film doesn't mean it can't also employ the standards of other film genres.<br/><br/>Crazy kudos to J.J. Abrams. You had me with ""Lost"" but now I'm totally and completely in love with your genius.<br/><br/>Is it a little weird to like a movie so much where the city where I live gets destroyed? HAHAHAHA"

","Cloverfield is a movie like no other movies... It's one of those rare movies that comes along and changes almost the entire way you look at the movie industry and what they put out.<br/><br/>Hype aside Cloverfield is quite possibly one of the greatest monster movies I've seen in a long time. The crowd reactions though proved just how little it's going to be accepted in this time of massive acceptance of mediocrity. The movies plot (mostly the creature) is not explained and in order to get the full picture you have to read the Viral Websites that fester the Inter Web.<br/><br/>The movie is quite realistic in terms of making you feel like you're there. The entire time I watched the movie (especially during the attacks) I almost felt like I was on a 3D Ride at Universal Studios. I felt like I was the one recording the footage and documenting what happened.<br/><br/>I didn't find anything to far to suspend my belief on. The movie (which is a recording of the main characters adventures during the attack) is only 80 minutes out of the seven hours of the monsters attack. During the gaps in time it's quite possible that HUD (the cameraman) was able to charge the battery or change it.<br/><br/>I've blabbed on for quite a bit so let's just go over the quick basics. The monster looked amazing and how it was presented was phenomenal as well. The acting wasn't great but it felt realistic, I felt like this was a recording of a real life event, not a Hollywood production. The lack of music also added a lot to the movie. The tone was perfect and the mood kept flowing. The ""dry spells"" were littered with foreshadowing text and quite hilarious dark humor. I mean come on... Flaming Hobos! The movie could have used a slightly stronger ending, and I say this only because I fear we might not get another movie or the viral sites might never close everything up. I think the movie could have ended with a News Channel ""wrapping"" up the events.<br/><br/>None the less. 10 out of 10 for this movie. It was a Monster / Love Story perfection."

","When I watched the movie I actually doubted it really was a movie and not just a clip found in the aftermath. In my opinion that is the biggest realism compliment I can ever give a movie. The film goes so far in being realistic that it almost ignores the original movie frame and goes on about as you would expect it to in real life. The actors and actresses no longer appear to be acting at this point and the only thing left for the viewer is to enjoy the thrills and amazing effects. Note again,we have seen better effects in movies but not one has ever driven them to this level. When the thing marches around it gives a much clearer performance than it would if shot with a real movie camera and when there is an explosion, there actually is an explosion before the camcorder. Minuses like a bit 'strawberry paste' looking blood and a lack of a real story don't even matter because when you leave the cinema you've just seen a disaster movie worth remembering."

It's not often that one sees people coming face to face with a fear such as this in film that isn't accompanied by music, different camera angles and other features of film that remove one from the reality that could be experienced.

","Most giant monster movies you see are horrible. They are laughably unrealistic, poorly directed, unexciting, cliché, not frightening, and incredibly cheesy.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is not one of them.<br/><br/>Instead Cloverfield treats us to a fantastically thrilling adventure, which depicts a horrifyingly realistic situation, shot in the most believable and frightening manner, with breath taking visuals and is genuinely suspenseful.<br/><br/>The film is shot entirely from the point of view of a small group of civilians via the use of hand held camcorders. Unlike movies such as ""The Blair Witch Project"", the film is well photographed not relying on overly erratic and nauseating shaky camera movements, but rather has a much more pragmatic style, which allows the movie to both look like it was really shot by camcorder during a monster attack, but at the same time not leaving the audience grasping for straws as to what is going on, or worse feeling motion sick.<br/><br/>Better still, the events that unfold during the movie are entirely plausible. Not once during the movie are you left thinking, ""Oh come on as if that would happen"". No, instead the movie is encased with realism, from the military weapons, tactics and formations during battles with the monster, to how buildings collapse when struck by the monster, to the choices that the characters make when presented with unimaginable circumstances, to even the reactions that characters have when their comrades are injured or killed. The movie even goes as far as to make extensive use of symbolism of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, such as when a building collapses sending dust and debris rocketing down the street while the characters run inside stores for shelter, to emerge covered with dust.<br/><br/>The plot is immensely character driven. The movie isn't as much about the monster attack, as it is about our main characters trying to deal with this situation. This movie does not dive into the cliché of having the movie be about the military commanders and scientists coming up with theories trying to defeat the monster, but is rather about the problems and turmoils that our lead characters have to go through during this situation. The movie though staring a cast of ""unknowns"", is wonderfully acted, with all of the cast giving superb performances. When somebodies friend dies in this movie, they mourn and cry over their fallen companion, and when something attacks, they appear genuinely frightened.<br/><br/>Do not let the fact that this is a giant monster movie turn you off. Forget that you ever saw a travesty like a Godzilla (1998) or King Kong (1976), and prepare to be blown away by the extraordinary movie that is Cloverfield."

"Quinoa1984","7","3","11","26 January 2008"," a contradiction that works, up to a point: big Hollywood blockbuster/monster movie meets (stylized) subjective POV
","JJ Abrams is very clever at delivering projects that drive up the hype machine like some kind of crazy storm, which can either go off smashingly (Lost) or not so much (Felicity). Cloverfield is an experiment that needed some clever marketing - hence the ""what the ?"" trailer that came out last summer with people partying in a video camera viewpoint, and then looking out at a big explosion over New York City. What the film is is a bit different from the mystery surrounding the buzz on it, though the director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard (the former's first movie since The Pallbearer, the latter his first feature script after years of television), end up delivering some clever ideas and some good scares, even surprisingly juicy metaphors, while also making the audience suspend an incredible amount of disbelief.<br/><br/>And it's this amount of disbelief that had me personally feeling very mixed about the picture when it ended. I knew I had seen some good entertainment in the sense of delivering the shocks and thrills that a good monster movie can provide (some of it, arguably, reminds one of the recent film the Mist). But there's more than just the ambiguity around where the huge would-kick-Godzilla's-toosh monster that reigns havoc all over midtown Manhattan, though that's a part of it. There's a specific purpose in having the characters Reeves and Goddard have in the picture, who are shallow, self-obsessed twenty-something cretins that look like a cross between your suburban Abercrombie acquaintances and rejects from MTV reality shows. The filmmakers bring the audience early on- and in increases steadily as the story goes on- to despising these people, not simply for their actions (have any of these people heard of the phrase ""every man for himself and huge f***ing creature against all?""), but for doing the stupid things that happen in most horror films.<br/><br/>And yet, at the same time, the filmmakers have something special going on here, aside from the technique, which is of course part of the message (medium-message yada yada). The monster and its minions, for these kids as well as everyone else in the city, is like what philosophers call ""the big other"". Look at the scene where looters rush into an electronics store, and on TV there's news footage of the monster ripping apart the city. All the looters stop dead in their tracks, and for Rob and Lily and especially Hud the creature is like some unfathomable presence that can't be stopped, and despite being right where they can see it is something they can't totally grasp their collective consciousness around. That, plus some (slightly obvious) allusions to 9/11, and a slight tip of the hat to Japan (the kid going off to Japan, almost clever by half I'd say), make this a movie that does have some good metaphors going for it under the surface.<br/><br/>This being said, there's something about the aforementioned characters that sort of bugged me, startling early on with the twenty minute lot of scenes with the party, and trickling down as the film went along. The style is meant to convey something specific, that we're right along with the viewer as they go through an extremely chaotic situation that is inconceivable (at least, unless, you haven't seen your share of Godzilla movies). Which, in its own way, treks back to the legacy left by Blair Witch Project, where one cared about what would happen to the trio as their defenses whittled down to a nub in the midst of the dark woods. In the case of Cloverfield, however, we're put in a situation where the subjective point of view is intense, a way of revealing a creature that is designed like out of some weird graphic novel. This part, of revealing the horror elements, works fine and effectively (particularly the spiders in the subway)...<br/><br/>And at the same time the characters don't quite follow the reality that would be for most people. It's good to see a movie like Cloverfield with an audience (especially, if you're lucky, in Manhattan itself) to see the kind of response it gets, which to me seemed like a collective form of stretching the suspension of disbelief. Aside from the character Marlena, who is arguably the most sympathetic (or just least ""what the ?"" of the characters in what they do or say or act), they're like most characters we see in many a horror movie, following a logic that is more based on getting through the points that will lead the story through its harrowing end. I'll be able to suspend disbelief even in the sorts of things one has to go with in Cloverfield. But it takes some identification, some sympathy with the characters, to make it really worthwhile. I didn't get that from the picture, adding to it a muddled (if slightly exciting) climax.<br/><br/>In the end, Cloverfield left me with mixed feelings, and I'm not sure when I would watch it again. But as the biggest hit so far in 2008, it's hard not to want to see what it has to offer, as a tip of the hat to old classic monster-destroys-city movie while trying a different approach. Least I can say is Abrams fans wont be too dissatisfied."

","The late great circus showman P.T. Barnum would stand up in his grave and applaud the advertising campaign that ""Lost"" creator J.J. Abrams designed for his new monster movie ""Cloverfield,"" an allegory for the 9/11 disaster aimed at the You Tube generation. Essentially, ""Cloverfield"" is ""The Blair Witch Project"" meets ""Godzilla"" with a bit of ""Independence Day."" Sadly, this appalling 85-minute epic about a quartet of twentysomething adults out to rescue one of their own generates only a modicum of excitement, suspense, and horror. Like ""Blair Witch,"" ""Cloverfield"" relies on the gimmick of shooting its catastrophic action entirely from the viewpoint of a guy looking into the viewfinder of a camcorder. Actually, ""84 Charlie Mopic,"" a little known, low-budget, 1989 Vietnam War movie, utilized the same gimmick with greater imagination than either ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield."" Indeed, whether they realize it or not, the people that made ""Cloverfield"" have imitated most of what ""84 Charlie Mopic"" did with its saga about a combat photographer shadowing a special seven man reconnaissance unit on a dangerous mission.<br/><br/>People that suffer from motion sickness might want to gobble some Dramamine before they see ""Cloverfield."" The action chronicles a troupe of Yuppies throwing a farewell soirée for Robert Hawkins (newcomer Michael Stahl-David of NBC-TV's ""The Black Donnellys"") who is bound for a new job in Japan. Anyway, Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel of ""Poseidon"") is supposed to shoot video testimonials. Jason pawns this chore off on his pal, Hud Platt (T.J. Miller of ABC-TV's ""Carpoolers""), who uses it as a way to greet girls. Meanwhile, Rob and his girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman of ""Transformers"") quarrel. She retreats to her Central Park high-rise apartment. Not long afterward, shock tremors typically associated with an earthquake stagger New York City. TV news stations televise images of pandemonium. Out of nowhere the decapitated head of the Statue of Liberty careens like a bowling ball down a Manhattan street. Eventually, word of a ""Godzilla"" sized reptile rampaging through Manhattan reaches our heroes. The power flickers everywhere, and panic erupts. Our heroes learn that nothing in the Pentagon's arsenal has been able to thwart this humongous monster's stompfest. Rob ignores warnings from the Army and sets to rescue Beth trapped in her own apartment. Along the way, Rob and his friends battle baby monsters that spring from the main monster.<br/><br/>""Pallbearer"" director Matt Reeves and ""Lost"" scenarist Drew Goddard take a fantastic idea and fluff it. The camcorder that Hud tapes the action with doesn't sport a stabilizer so you'll feel like you're being whirled around in a Cuisinart. Unfortunately, aside from a few eerie shots, ""Cloverfield"" lacks adequate hysteria or suspense. The characters behave as idiotically as ""Friday the 13th"" victims, especially when they plunge into a dark creepy subway tunnel. The monster resembles the offspring of Dr. Seuss' Horton the Elephant character. Nothing emerges as remotely scary, and gore is held to a PG-13 minimum. ""Cloverfield"" offers no closure, and it makes you pine for a man in a rubber Godzilla suit."

","Well for the first 5 min I was not sure about this idea, it seems irritating and some what boring but thats IT! From that point onwards I was on the edge till the very end! The thunders and roars made the whole theater tremble! I felt like being there with them and wanted to escape to safety at any cost. That's success of this movie right there! What more can I say, you have to watch it to believe it! By the end of the whole ordeal, I was feeling a bit nauseous though as the previous poster mentioned :) Very original and thrilling experience... As I came out, I could see all of the other audience completely lost thinking about the movie as if it was still grabbed their attention!<br/><br/>This one will be remembered for a long long time!<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

","OK so having anticipated this movie for quite some time I just got back from a screening of it.<br/><br/>It was funny. I was pumping myself up for it for a while, then as a sat there in the cinema i thought, wow, in 90 minutes this will all be over...will this be worth it? Overall though the answer to that question is yes. Yes there is a set up of 20 minutes or so...doesn't matter guys! It is necessary to gain some connection to the characters, so lets not complain about that.<br/><br/>The part where the monster first hits interrupts a conversation between Rob (""Im like your main dude"") and his bro Jason -which, by the way, has very relevant dialogue to set the tone for the rest of the movie, so pay attention.<br/><br/>Because, as been mentioned in another review, this is a step up from a monster movie; that is to say, when something terrible is happening, how would you react, what would you do for the ones you love? With the immediate threat, we get answers to these questions from our main characters.<br/><br/>To quote a poster at the Rotten Tomato forums ""If life as you know it is ending, the world around you is crumbling, you are probably going to reach out for the ones you love."" I loved this movie, and i hope you reach out for it.<br/><br/>OK, too cheesy end to a review, just see this movie!

","Can't believe the negativity from some of the reviews. This by far took me by surprise. It wasn't one of your cliché movies with the scientist, hero, villain trying to stop people from killing it, or a president with the goofy patriotic hero music.<br/><br/>This was by far the most exciting movie that took an event in life and showed how monstrous it was. It wasn't about killing a monster or how it really evolved, but how something so terrifying can interrupt our daily life. I like that it started with people going about there lives and how self involved they where only to have all of that change in moment. And the movie sticks with that idea and that is what I liked about it. It did not go off on tangents. It didn't have stupid people who know everything and think they can stop the monster. I liked the challenges these kids had to endure to get from point A to B. The acting is what I thought made the movie. It wasn't some silly muscle actors pretending to be gung-ho. I hate the fact that everyone keeps referring to BWP because of the cinematography. It was nothing like that movie. I CHALLENGE ANYONE TO HOLD A CAMERA STRAIT IN A MOMENT LIKE THAT. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Also, I like the end and we see where the monster came from. A product of space, time and gamma rays. I believe."
"jboothmillard","5","2","6","21 July 2010"," Cloverfield
","Cashing in on the successful ""found footage"" format, seen in successful low-budget movies like The Blair Witch Project, and Paranormal Activity, this ambitious bigger budget film does it to make a disaster movie, produced by J.J. Abrams (Lost, Super 8, Star Trek, Star Wars), directed by Matt Reeves (Let Me In, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). Basically, the footage seen is recovered by the United States Department of Defense in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"", for a case titled ""Cloverfield"". It is footage captured by a group of friends across New York City and Coney Island, with clips from a former recording seen is parts throughout. Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving the city to travel to Japan for a new job, so his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and Jason's girlfriend Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas) have thrown a farewell party. Their friend Hudson 'Hud' Platt (T.J. Miller) films testimonials for Rob during the party, while Rob's ex-girlfriend Elizabeth 'Beth' McIntyre (Odette Annable) shows up with a new man. Rob and Beth have an argument, during which a supposed earthquake strikes, and a brief citywide power outage occurs. Suddenly, many loud noises are heard, and explosions are seen from a distance. When the partygoers leave the building, the severed head of the Statue of Liberty is hurled into the street in front of them. Then an enormous creature is seen several blocks away collapsing the Woolworth Building. Later, during the city's evacuation, the Brooklyn Bridge is destroyed by the creature's tail, killing Jason and several other people. News reports show the army troops and vehicles attacking the monster. Smaller ""parasite"" creatures fall off its body and attack nearby pedestrians and soldiers. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud escape the subway, Lily, and another partygoer, Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), venture into Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. They get caught in a battle between the creature and the Army National Guard and run into the subway, soon attacked by several of the parasitic creatures. Marlena is bitten, but the four escape and find a command centre and field hospital. Marlena bleeds from her eyes in reaction to the bite. She is dragged into a tent, where she appears to explode. Rob, intending to save Beth, persuades one of the military leaders to let him go. The man then tells Rob when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its plan to destroy Manhattan hoping to kill the monster. The group manage to climb the building opposite to enter the apartment building leaning next to it, and they find Beth impaled on exposed rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site at Grand Central Terminal, where they encounter the creature once again. Lily is rushed into a departing Marine Corps helicopter and escapes. Moments later, Rob, Beth, and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness the creature being bombed. The bombing causes the creature to fall, but it lunges at the group's helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park. On the crashed helicopter's radio, the group are warned that a second bombing will commence in fifteen minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee; Hud retrieves the camera when the creature suddenly appears and kills him. Sirens blare and the bombing starts, Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under an arch. Rob and Beth take turns to leave their last testimony of the day's events. The bridge crumbles, and the camera is knocked out of Rob's hand and buried under rubble. Rob and Beth proclaim their love for each other just before another bomb goes off, with both screaming while the monster roars. Also starring Margot Farley as Jenn, Theo Rossi as Antonio, Brian Klugman as Charlie, Kelvin Yu as Clark, and Ben Feldman as Travis. The performances are average, the special effects are reasonable, and the camera is often shaky, but these faults aside, you can get into it and enjoy things going crash and bang. I originally thought that this film was either naff or silly, but I'm glad I watched it again and gave it a second, it is an interesting enough alternative to the typical monster movie, a watchable science-fiction action thriller. Worth watching!"

","There are two things going for this movie: first, it's shot so darkly (with a hand-held camera), you can't see much the stupid antics of the characters in this so-called story. And, second, it ends after seventy-one excruciatingly boring minutes. And, not a minute too soon...<br/><br/>If you're into excessive use of CGI and special effects, then by all means see it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a rip-off from maybe a dozen other movies e.g. The Thing (1982), The Blair Witch Project (1999), Predator (1987), Alien (1979), Godzilla (1998), King Kong (1933, 1976, 2005) etc etc, then, by all means do go and see it.<br/><br/>As a metaphor for the tragedy of 9/11, however, it just stinks. Shame on the whole production cast for making this piece of trash.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I give it points for those special effects, the CGI (albeit excessive) and the frenetic editing (which is still often annoying). And, I give the (forgettable) actors a point for having the moxie to actually appear in this pile o'sh**t.<br/><br/>Not recommended for (real) kids or serious movie-goers.<br/><br/>And, look, if you want a much better non-stop action/terror flick, using hand-held camera, see REC(2007) – but, only the Spanish version."

The whole film could of been made much more realistic, I don't know about you... but if an alien is destroying an entire city why would you risk your life to save someone who might not be alive anymore?

I just thought that the beginning was boring and the ending was bad. The actors did a great job for the roles they had to play.

","I recommend seeing this without knowing anything *except* that it is filmed POV Camcorder style like the Blair Witch Project.

Some of the scenes were so cleverly set up that I found myself grinning unintentionally.<br/><br/>I think that there are allusions to 9/11 and that they are absolutely necessary: after all, we have experienced 9/11 and we know exactly what it looks like when there is a disaster. This film captured that feeling. It brought back my own memories of that morning, trying to get out of Washington D.C. under the impression that we were being bombed, panic and false information everywhere. I don't think it was exploitive.<br/><br/>If you liked the escape scene in the most recent War of the Worlds where the aliens attack for the first time, you will love this. It's the intensity of that scene drawn out over an hour and a half.<br/><br/>I think we need more films like this which are willing to take risks."

It had all the workings of a great title but I found myself actually trying to make myself like this movie and trust me that doesn't happen often. It's predictable and leaves you feeling like you've wasted an hour and a half of your life. The ending is very anti-climatic and the love story which is the only other plot this movie has is lackluster and leaves you wanting more. Do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Watch Godzilla, Alien, or Blair Witch because they were way better and that's not even saying much."
"johnkeii","1","2","6","24 January 2008"," Not for everyone
","First off, I am not going to spoil anything in this review. I gave this movie a 1/10 because that's what I think it deserves. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There are many scenes in this movie that are unexplained and the characters motives are very poor. The entire movie is filmed in first person with a shaky camera. The special effects are pretty good quality, but there's no point in having a movie full of special effects if the storyline is poor. I did not notice any parts of the movie that explained where the ""monster"" came from or why the monster was attacking. Neither did any part of the movie explain what would happen to the monster's victims if it had attacked or infected them. I would recommend this movie to anyone who does not like to analyze movies and people who like trillers."
"JoeKarlosi","8","2","6","23 January 2008"," Cloverfield (2008) ***1/2
","You'd never know it by its generic title, but this is actually one of the finest films about a giant monster destroying a big city ever made. The entire ""movie"" is captured on someone's camcorder a la THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (and recovered, we learn at the start of the film, from ""what was once Central Park""), as a secured government document of the tragic events which a small group of twenty-somethings experienced first-hand. What begins as a harmless home video party at a club in New York City abruptly turns into a long night of mass destruction and decimation, as some type of unexplained creature devastates Manhattan. This is not so much a movie about the creature as it is an intense and downright unnerving POV exercise that puts us as viewers into the chaos. Some scenes play very much like that fateful day of 9/11/01, and any person who witnessed that paralyzing event of buildings collapsing and smoke and debris gushing down the avenues will likely be revisiting the visuals in their minds.<br/><br/>I've heard people complaining of nausea and dizziness over the filming technique, but the camcorder craziness didn't bother me as I knew what the movie was trying to do and I just went with it. The special effects here are outstanding, and the monster is never shown all that much to ruin the illusion. I'd also call CLOVERFIELD one of the more genuinely scary monster movies I've seen in a dog's age. You really feel like you're a part of the destruction and it seems very realistic. Would I go so far as to predict future ""classic"" status for this film? Not sure. I do think the tendency by the general public these days is to move on to the next popular movie, and nothing retains a hold on viewers today like cinema giants used to, when life was simpler and perhaps offered not nearly as numerous entertainment options. But it's still what I'd consider a great monster movie. I'd also advise fans who want to see it NOT to wait for video; this needs to be seen on the big screen with thundering sound effects for best impact. ***1/2 out of ****"
"LaroldC","9","2","6","23 January 2008"," Fresh idea! Heart-stopper, creates real panic!
","*** SPOILERS! ***<br/><br/>The beauty of this flick is that it bridges the gap between trendy ""reality"" entertainment and classic sci-fi. If you take exception to silly plot machinations or suffer from a heart condition or seizures, then steer clear. But if you are like me -- able to suspend disbelief, easily entertained, and a CGI addict -- then this is a MUST SEE!!!<br/><br/>Start with a surprise going-away party for Rob (the lead character who got a job offer in Japan) with maybe forty well-dressed yuppie-types and all the typical social drama/humor. Hud, Rob's befuddled best friend, is asked to video-tape goodbye wishes from the guests. When Beth, a hot, recent one-nighter of Rob's, shows up with a guy, Hud gets Rob's emotional crash on film. Rob had wanted more from Beth, but had held off due to his imminent departure. Rob forces a smile, then goes off by himself to sulk. Beth leaves. With Hud secretly recording, Rob's friends try talking sense into him outside on the fire escape, when -- BOOM!!!<br/><br/>Out of nowhere there is an ""earthquake"", which sends the men scrambling to the roof to see what happened. Suddenly there is a huge explosion a few streets away which rains flaming debris down on their building. The guests run screaming down the stairs and outside. Amid ominous, thundering roars and impact tremors -- and the Statue of Liberty's rolling head -- scattering people are still shouting ""What's happening?"" No view of the source yet, as the handy-cam is flailing aimlessly. Hud then tries to get some footage, and he catches a fleeting shot of a giant leg stepping between buildings. He tries to tell everyone what he saw, but everyone is too stunned to listen. From the party, only Rob, his brother Jason, Hud, and two female friends are able to regroup. From here on out, it's all chaos, noise, and terror -- in a documentary format.<br/><br/>With the streets all blocked, the masses try to get out of the city on foot. Meanwhile, the unidentified enemy (still unseen by the audience) is apparently destroying NYC. Eventually, the group gathers around a TV in a local gadget shop, and are appalled to see CNN's sketchy live footage through smoke and flames of a giant creature crushing buildings, as thousands of dog-sized, spider-like creatures rain down from it and pounce savagely on people. The group is torn away from the TV by sudden machine-gun fire, scrambling Army tanks, and RPG's whizzing by overhead.<br/><br/>Rob gets a cell phone call from Beth, saying she is trapped in her building and can't move. Rob wants to try to rescue her. The group decides to stay together and they attempt to cross the Brooklyn Bridge on foot, but the creature slashes it in half (which Hud gets partial footage of), killing hundreds, including Jason. The group has no choice but to go back and try to use the dark subway tunnels, which they find are crawling with rats fleeing from the spider-things. In a terrifying night-vision sequence, one of the women is bitten badly while beating a creature off Hud. When the group escapes the tunnels and finds themselves in a military field command post, they ask the soldiers for answers. The unidentifiable creature is winning. The government will be nuking NYC within hours. The group is given directions to a chopper evacuation site. Suddenly, the bitten girl says she doesn't feel well, starts bleeding from her eyes, and then basically explodes, apparently from the weird toxins in the bite she got. The survivors push on towards Beth.<br/><br/>In the ensuing sequence, we get our first decent view of the creature, sort of half lizard, half monkey, with beady eyes, savage claws, and huge fangs. It may have extra limbs or tentacles, but that aspect is unclear, as the handy-cam is always shaky and the glimpses are very short. (Brilliant fake cinematography!) Beth's building is found precariously leaning over against an adjacent building. Rob knows she is on the 39th floor. They climb the stairs of the adjacent building and cross over to the roof of Beth's building, then they are able to crawl down and locate her, unconscious, cell phone still in hand. She is pinned through the shoulder by a piece of protruding rebar. They tear her loose and carry her down, fighting off more spider-things.<br/><br/>They reach the military helicopter lift site by dawn. They get on choppers, apparently saved. Beth, Rob, and Hud get on one, the remaining girl from the party gets on another (I think hers gets out OK). Rob's chopper has to fly by the monster, and Hud films it clearly for the first time, cheering as bombs hit it. But it decides it wants some chopper for breakfast and it suddenly turns and clips them. They scream through a frantic, spinning free-fall and crash, but they survive and crawl for cover. That's when the camera looks straight up as the monster spots Hud and says hello in person. It looms in and chomps him. Supposedly bitten into pieces, we lose Hud. The monster moves on and the camera falls back to earth. Rob grabs it to give his final testimony in case the film is ever found. Amid giant roars and the sound of jet bombers, he and Beth crawl under a foot bridge in Central Park. Rob states his name, Beth states her name. They start crying. Explosions, getting closer. The camera drops to the ground, pointing at nothing. We hear Rob tell Beth he loves her. She tells him she loves him. Then there is a final huge explosion and the film immediately cuts to a previously-recorded day at an amusement park with Rob and Beth out on their only date. They tell the camera they are having a great day.<br/><br/>End."

Not one part of the movie are you left bored, and that part that you may feel get dragged on have some funny comment given to you by Hud, the character who holds the camera. I have seen this movie 3 times. The acting in this movie is wonderful. To me, acting is like make up. You have to use the best of it to make people realize there isn't any. Saying this I mean that you do not think people are acting. You feel like you are actually with the group of people, as one of them. Especially with the point of view coming from the camera. The entire movie, from the time Hud receive the camera, I felt like I was the person with the camera. This is the only movie to actually make me forget I am seeing a movie, its that powerful. The character detail is so deep, you feel like you actually know the characters. I was HEARTBROKEN (trying not to reveal a big scene) during the scene of what happened to Marlena at the Medical station. For some reason I felt like I actually knew her and that a good friend had the same fate. That is what a good movie should do to you and it is what Cloverfield does. This is not only a monster moving but also a Romance, Mystery, Action, Survival, Comedy, Sci-fi, and a Thriller.<br/><br/>The only thing with this movie, which is the reason it does not get a 10, is that to fully understand what happens, you have to do a lot of research in the viral marketing. The whole deal with Slusho plays a huge role into this.<br/><br/>Other than that the movie is absolutely perfect. I can't wait to get it on DVD and force showing it to friends who haven't seen it. The only reason why I could understand someone not liking this movie is that some people do not like a jiggly camera and might get motion sickness but that majority of people do not have this problem. To me that just added to the suspense, making you feel like you are at the party, in the streets, in the tunnels, and eventually under the bridge. I would much rather prefer this than a third person point of view like most movies.<br/><br/>Go Watch it, and don't feel bad if you have questions at the end, I know I did. The worst thing about this movie is that it ends."

","Every once in a while a new film re-writes the way we make movies. Cloverfield simply grabs you by the shirt and takes you on a ride!!! It's as if you are a part of the action! By incorporating the cameraman into the plot, each angle is creatively tied into his character. We see emotions and feelings portrayed in the way scenes are choreographed. Other films have tried to use this cinematography element and failed. Cloverfield is the first film to pull it off. With Cloverfield, it's as if Indy has finally arrived at the box office. It's all made possible by the cutting edge technology of the 21st century. With the hand-held HD camera, the next wave of action films is coming. It's about time! We are more than ready..."
"cyberajnabee","1","2","6","22 January 2008"," Can there be a bigger let down
","This film had two things working for it, it's marketing strategy and its review ratings. With images of NYC under attack by something mysterious the trailers are successful in building suspense. Reviews everywhere said the movie was great and blah blah so i went to watch it with my friends.Once you start watching though, the first thing that you realize is that the monster in the movie (which was supposed to be the main attraction)is pretty average looking. Nothing new. Next you start to realize that this movie has absolutely no plot, no beginning, no climax and no end. Then you realize how the movie is so unrealistic when the protagnist and his friends survive a crash, extremely unrealistic. This was by far the biggest let down of a movie that i have ever seen. A movie with no plot and unrealistic events and an ordinary monster, well that's all i have to say about it. I wouldn't even watch this movie again even if i was paid to watch it."
"dreamgoddess822","1","2","6","22 January 2008"," Please don't waste your money or your time on Cloverfield.
","I repeat: Please DO NOT waste your money or your time on this idiotic movie. The hand-held camera gave one of my companions motion sickness and he had to leave the theater for a period of time so he wouldn't throw up. The plot can be summed up as thus: Monster attacks. People die. Sure, there's some soap-operaish chatter about how Rob and Beth slept together and they're so ""in love"" and Rob is going to Japan and(OMG!) Beth brought some other guy to his going-away party...but honestly, I couldn't care any less about the characters.When Rob's brother Jason died, I felt only the slightest ""Oh, I guess that's sad.""I found the utter implausibility of some of the events to be just stupid. For example, Beth gets practically impaled on a pole in her apartment and she ""can't move."" But when Rob and company finally rescue her, she is able to both kiss Rob and run across Manhattan? In what realm of possibility does that even make sense? The special effects are cheesy. (I laughed at the sound the smaller monsters made.) I wasn't scared in the slightest of the big monster. I kept praying for the movie to be over and wishing I could have the $8 back that I was robbed of. Finally, it was over and I was thrilled that I would no longer be feeling a headache on account of the ""groundbreaking"" and ""original"" hand-held camera work. The ""Blair Witch Project"" did it first...and someone could make a similar movie in their backyard andpost it on YouTube.So don't waste your money or your life watching ""Cloverfield."" That's 74 minutes of your life you'll never get back."

","Maybe they should have just shot it with a real low-end video camera (or at least made the quality appear as such) and released it to Youtube and let people watch it in sections. Most of the acting in the film was one notch above the typical soap opera. So I couldn't care less for most of the characters. Someone should splice this with The Russian Ark, which was also filmed w/1 camera, and post it on Youtube. At least RA had cool costumes and scenery.<br/><br/>This film should've been done as a typical monster flick. Much of what the characters did was typical for the genre anyway. Maybe the sequel will be done that way."

","This is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I though it had a good story at first, but then everything went to hell after the first ten minutes. The acting was good, special effects were great, but the movie just sucked. I really didn't plan to pay for a 90 minute dizzy effect, but I also wasn't about to leave the theater 9 bucks in the drain. Now on the the beast! The monster looked like it was half chicken half brontosaurus and really disappointed me in comparison to Godzilla. Godzilla had so much fear the whole Japanese race was scared by him. This movie was supposed to give Americans its own monster, but instead it gave us some reject dyslexic retarded monster. What can I say besides the face I was really disappointed and will never recommend this movie to anyone. I would rather sit back and watch ""The Hulk"" starring Eric Bana 1,000 times in a row.

","I loved this movie! It had everything going for it, from funny lines ""I can't stop imagining how creepy it will be if a homeless guy just came around the corner lit on fire.""-Hud, while in the tunnels. I especially liked how the movie was a ""1st person"" movie. I think people either are going to love it, or are going to hate it. I LOVED IT! Can't wait until it comes out on sale. I too liked how you you actually feel like you are running with the characters and how you don't know what is going to happen next. I think my favorite part was when the main four(Rob, Lily, Hud, and Marlaina)are running looking for beth, and all of a sudden the monster appears, and then the army comes firing away at it. Tanks, and all. That scene was pretty awesome. If your over the age of 35, or easily motion sickness, I HIGHLY recommend that you DON'T see the video."
"MrDonut","9","2","6","22 January 2008"," A big screen experience not to be missed.
","I saw Cloverfield on the night of 1-18-08, as no other timing would have seemed appropriate. The trailers got me excited for what was to come (both the movies they were for, and the movie that was listed on my ticket), the feature surpassed my high expectations, and I left the theater a content guy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I felt like I was in the minority. Four days later, it seems everything I hear is about how the camera shook too much, it was too short, nothing was explained, etc. Some of that, I'll voice my opinion on later. In my opinion, Cloverfield succeeded in delivering a slightly-compelling story, gripping visuals, and intense sequences that kept the viewer's eyes glued the screen (despite the alleged motion-sickness-inducing Queasy-Cam work).<br/><br/>For those who only know of the movie being about a monster attacking Manhattan, here's a more detailed run-down: A young man has a heated encounter with an ex at his surprise going-away party. She leaves. People have fun. Party disrupted by monster attacking city. Screaming and running ensue. The young man and his closest friends flee for their lives, while trying to meet up with the ex-girlfriend who left earlier in the night. All of which is witnessed through the lens of the hand-held video camera that was recording good-byes.<br/><br/>The filming style, I think, was very effective in immersing the viewer in the experience. The acting got the job done. The CGI was convincing enough. The monster's appearance, to my surprise, didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Addressing the complaints from other opinionated folk, that I mentioned above: Camera too shaky? You try framing a shot while being scared enough to pee your grown-up pants. How did he hold onto the camera the whole time? (I've heard such a comment) It had a strap. Long battery life? He turned it on and off throughout the course of the 75-85 minutes. Nothing explained (such as why the monster is there)? We only know what the main characters know. ""Scientists"" and the military people were too busy doing their jobs to explain to some random twenty-somethings what they thought was going on. Also, the ending was perfectly fine, if you figured out what happened.<br/><br/>Last year, my favorite movie was I Am Legend (just barely besting Bourne Ultimatum and Superbad); midway through January, I think I enjoyed Cloverfield more than I did the Will Smith film. This year is off to a good start, you think? (Or maybe I just have bad tastes...)"
"bcraig8","10","2","6","22 January 2008"," great film
","even though it is a retread of your typical monster movie, it breathes new life into the genre. the best way to describe the film is that it is genuine. you never feel cheated and find yourself rooting for some of the characters (I generally find the main characters are stupid and hope they die). it was chilling to watch the events unfold on a home video recorder a la ""Blair Witch."" This genre has seen 2 solid entries as of late (the other being ""Host""). I would love to see more filmmakers take a similar approach with their films. I'm tired of cookie-cutter films where everything is predictable. The originality of the approach sets it apart from the Japanese monster flicks. I could go on, but wanted to keep it brief and make sure I voiced my approval on a brilliant film (I even jumped several times). The most telling part of my movie going experience was how my wife reacted. I made her go and she seemed totally disinterested in the whole thing and told me to ""wake her up"" when it's over. First 15 minutes I thought she'd fall asleep for sure, but then the action begun and she was hooked. Midway through the film she brought he feet up and knees to her chin, hugging her legs. I would have started busting up, but the scene was genuinely scary. (You'll know it when you see it). She loved it. But the best part about the movie? No Tyler Perry!! Which is more than I can say for J.J. Abram's ""Star Trek.""<br/><br/>Go check out this movie, it's great."
"jaredmullen","10","2","6","22 January 2008"," Cloverfield=Awesome
","First of all Cloverfield was everything I'd expected it to be and more. Non stop action and a lot of destruction. Some people say there is no substance to the movie but it's not supposed to b/c it's about someone filming their friends going away party then a monster suddenly attacking new york and there isn't supposed to be any substance in a movie like that. Anyways the monster looked awesome. It really felt like I was watching recovered footage of the attack and the friends' last hours of survival. I loved it so much I saw it twice, 2 days in a row. To those who wondered why they decided to rename central park Cloverfield. And why they called the movie Cloverfield was b/c it's either the name of the street JJ Abrams lives or lived on I can't remember. anyways if you haven't seen Cloverfield then see it you will not be disappointed."
"ricknz1","10","2","6","22 January 2008"," Long over due!
","Although I did become nauseous with the camera-work, I accepted it for what it was supposed to be, amateur footage of an incident that comes out of the blue one evening. I am glad that the director had the guts to stick with the format in spite of the dizzying effects it has on the viewers. I have long dreamed of a monster movie that would capture a realistic public reaction rather than the heroic calm that every other movie seems to be packaged with. This movie was CHAOS!!! Beautiful chaos. The only part that I felt lost me a bit was when this gigantic beast took the time to ponder the single individual (the cameraman friend) at the end before he mangles him... I mean, COMMON!!! He has a whole city to terrorize, why suddenly was he captivated by this single individual? Other than that, I thought the movie was stellar and so Im giving it a ten based on BALLS alone."
"MattsMovieWatchingWorld","8","2","6","22 January 2008"," The video camera is my favorite inanimate object in movie history that could almost be a character.
","It all started when I watched Transformers (2007), which I just happened to watch on opening day, July 3. Before the feature started, we were privileged with a unique trailer of a movie that contained a video-taped party that turned into a video-taped monster disaster. This trailer only ended with a caption that said ""From producer J.J. Abrams"" and a caption that said ""1-18-08."" The monster wasn't revealed, and the title wasn't revealed. My first reaction was ""Okay,"" like I didn't know what that was all about, or like I didn't know whether or not it was a real movie at all. Later, after watching Transformers, I thought again about the strange trailer, and thought positive thoughts about what the movie could be. I first saw the trailer to Transformers about a full year before seeing it, and a big blockbuster movie like that would basically only be showing trailers to movies that also would be big blockbusters. So this unusual ""1-18-08"" movie must be pretty big despite the release date in January, which is usually a month for ""stupid"" movies. Because of a partial premise that we didn't know exactly what the monster was, or whether or not we've seen this monster before, the movie did get a bunch of anticipation from trailer fans, which I think I'll say I belonged to.<br/><br/>The release came, I decided to remain positive about it, and I saw it opening day at midnight. And the cinematic experience I experienced was very unique and original. Like the promotions suggested, it is a documentation of a monster disaster following a going-away party for a friend, all taken from the perspective of a single hand-held video camera. The plot is intense, and I liked the idea quite a bit. And because the entire movie is taken from the camera's view, we get things that we don't get in movies very often. Behind The Ring from LotR (which does have a will of its own), the video camera is my favorite character in movie history that can be argued whether or not it's a character as it is an inanimate object.<br/><br/>The story is: First, the story of friends who decide to videotape a going-away party for a friend Rob Hawkins. The monster attacks, and these friends attempt to survive. Second, the story of the government as they find the camera at the end, mark the beginning of the tape with ""Multiple sightings of case designate 'Cloverfield' Camera retrieved at incident site U.S. 447 Area formerly known as Central Park,"" and the government uses it for government and/or history purposes. Third, and most of all what I want to emphasize, is the story of the camera, from the beginning of the tape to the end. More than the story of the victims, whose characters we come to appreciate and hope for their survival, more even than the story of the monster, whose neither origins nor fate is entirely explained, it's the story of the camera. We only see the middle of the story of the monster, we see the beginning and middle of the story of the victims, and just with that, the movie isn't quite enough to appreciate. But the story of the camera has a beginning, middle, and end. And the story of that is more than enough of what we need to enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Because this is nothing more or less than the story of the camera, from the camera's documentation, no music is scored. The credits after the camera's story, which document how this became a fictional story with the intent to entertain movie fans in theaters, is the only place in the entire movie that has music attached. And the music there is quite fun. When the credits for the songs came, I was surprised that there were many songs credited, which I guess were entirely used during the beginning party scene. I almost impatiently waited for the end credit music score to be credited. There was a big space in the credits between the other songs and the end credit music. It was called ""Roar! (Cloverfield Overture)"" by Michael Giacchino, who I have previously appreciated for the music for The Incredibles. When that credit came up, I clapped madly. I loved the music, and I probably loved the credits just as much as I loved the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is fun, it proves that there is originality left in the world, and we come to love everyone in the movie, the friends, the monster, and the camera.<br/><br/>8/10"

"elbekim2000","10","2","6","22 January 2008"," You get what you put into it.
","Cloverfield was a brilliant film in my opinion.<br/><br/>I came in knowing these following key-points:<br/><br/>-It was shot with a hand-held camera-which could lead to motion sickness. -It has a slow beginning. But the beginning was necessary to build character development and to let you see the different personalities of the main group of victims before they were thrust into the disaster. -The ending was abrupt<br/><br/>People who are complaining about the motion sickness can be justified. But it wasn't bothersome to me at all. One way of BEATING THE MOTION SICKNESS is envisioning a point at the center of the screen and just focusing on that point instead of following every direction the camera flails around to. This will allow you to digest the scenes without moving your eyes constantly (which leads to the motion sickness).<br/><br/>The ending was perfect. It wasn't a Hollywood ending, which is why it was good. It seems like the main characters die but, do they? The end credits give you an impression that they may still be alive and gives room for a sequel.<br/><br/>I thought it was a gripping film overall and leaves you attached to the characters. The sounds and action sequences really made you feel like you were right behind the camera lense.<br/><br/>Don't be warded off by the poor comments that other people are giving and please see this film. <br/><br/>It is way better than the other sci-fi films released this year that have failed to deliver (""I Am Legend"" for one).<br/><br/>Of course there are some holes in the plot that are left unanswered but it was shot from a hand-held people! It was from the perspective of 1, yes count it, 1, hand-held video camera. It wouldn't be the same if they explained every last detail of what was going on. <br/><br/>When September 11th happened, people weren't asking around and going on the internet trying to find out what was attacking their city, they were running for their damn lives, they didn't care if it was terrorists or a giant monster!<br/><br/>So please,<br/><br/>see this film.<br/><br/>Don't see it if you have an extremely weak stomach.<br/><br/>See it if you like rollercoasters because this movie takes you on a wild ride.<br/><br/>9/10, most fun I've had in a theater in a LONG while."

","So here's the deal; had i walked into this film not know that it was going to be documentary style, running around with lots of weird and wacky camera angles, sporadic monsters, and lots of hight pitched screaming, i probably would have been somewhat upset.<br/><br/>However, i did walk into knowing all of this to boot, so there it is.<br/><br/>I think the best way to describe this, and the most fairest observation about this, is that people who love it, are going to love the exact same things that the people who hated it, hated.<br/><br/>Personally, i will never spend money to see another pseudo-documentary style film like this, because i don't care for the open ended story telling. i thought that it was far too annoying to enjoyable. although what was done, was done extremely well, what was done was done in a style that i just don't like.<br/><br/>The scenes were very well played, and the footage was pretty good for what it was. my biggest complaint however was the character ""hud"" who acted more like a 15 year old with a camera. too many stupid comments, too much idiotic chatter, and not enough substance. sure, he was supposed to be the stereotypical doofus who was given the camera because it amused his simple character, but i think that it was over played after the whole ""he and she slept together"" bit.<br/><br/>The monsters were done well, and i liked how the kept the cloverfield monster a mystery so to speak towards the end, but at the same time, i felt that they could have used just a smidgen more intelligence when it came to evading the monster as they escaped in the choppa.<br/><br/>And yes, they do most certainly have to ""get to a choppa""...<br/><br/>The ending was a bit of a disappointment for me, as i felt it was unnecessary, and really made the film pointless. They go to all this trouble avoiding the blasted thing, only to make a very predictable escape that parallels the monster path of destruction.<br/><br/>Why they thought that a monster that could toss the statue of liberty's head half way across manhattan would not be able to jump a couple of hundred feet in the air from a standstill is beyond me, but hey, there it is...<br/><br/>In the end, i and my wife, were both somewhat nauseous. she liked it, but then again she also likes me too, which goes to show where her tastes are at. my best friend, the man known as secret agent j liked it, but then again still lovingly referred to it as blair witch goes to N.Y.<br/><br/>Those who say that it is nothing like blair witch really need to get a clue, cause it was almost exactly like blair witch, only with more running, screaming, and eye candy...<br/><br/>... and no stupid man standing in the basement of a cabin looking all... stupid...<br/><br/>I had to be fair and give it five stars. 5 cause, and again, what it did, it did really well, but i just didn't like what it did...<br/><br/>... although the star trek teaser gave me chills... >8^P"
"stewiefan201","8","2","6","21 January 2008"," Cloverfield's flaws never subtract from its strengths.
","Many excited filmgoers have been waiting for it and here it finally is, in all its glory. Cloverfield in the beginning was a simple trailer that showed an explosion, panic, and the Statue of Liberty's decapitated head lying in the streets of New York. This lone trailer invoked so much mystery into the movie since all it showed at the end was the name J.J. Abrams (TV series Lost) and the release date 1-18-08, which will now go down in monster-movie fan history as a famous date. After all the mystery, guesses, clues, photos, and intrigue, finally a second trailer was released. People were now even more excited claiming they saw the monster run in between two buildings in one shot, or they saw the monster's face as a bridge collapsed. But nobody was sure of what they saw in the trailers and press, which was a result of the brilliant viral marketing scheme of the film. Nobody had any idea what to expect, or what the monster looked like until they saw the film. All answers were answered and mysteries de-mystified on the infamous opening day of Cloverfield 1-18-08.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is filmed completely home-movie like with main character named Hud holding the camcorder the whole entire time. The movie begins with a going-away party for a young guy named Rob (Michael Stahl-David) who is leaving for Japan for a job as vice president at a company. As Hud (T.J. Miller) walks around interviewing people, a sudden earthquake-like interruption occurs. Everyone goes out onto the roof and sees a gigantic explosion occur. Everyone wanders out onto the street only to learn that some kind of giant monstrous entity is attacking New York. Total mayhem ensues in the city as Rob, Hud, and a few other friends such as Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), try to escape from the city. (Of course they bring the camcorder along for a home movie like none other.)<br/><br/>At 84 minutes Cloverfield is a short movie, but runs with frenetic and tense energy the whole time. Once the monster plot kicked in, I never felt any boredom for one moment and was constantly excited to see what was going to happen next. The character development felt shoddy but to me that only adds to the realism of what's going on. This is not like a normal film where everything is shot sequentially and time is added to developing the characters. The audience does not know these characters any more than whoever (Probably the Army) found the camcorder. Did you really expect Hud to go up and ask everyone their life story before the attack, I guess that's a no.<br/><br/>Many have complained that the home movie style of the film induced motion sickness, or caused them to throw up. I personally didn't get sick or feel sick at all, and neither did the two friends I saw it with. The camera angles in the movie at certain points are still and firm, and at other points shaking all over the place, and dipping up and down and every which way and that. This camera style is one of the key ingredients added for the realistic residue of the movie. But I guess I agree, Cloverfield should be labeled ""WARNING: This Film May Cause One to Puke.""<br/><br/>Now to the big excitement of Cloverfield that is the monster. We never really gain a good view of the monster in its full detailed form. There is pretty much always a building or smoke blocking part of it, or maybe the camera angle dips which happens a lot during this film. But that nevers detracts from my fascination with the unknown creature. One fact that angered some audiences was that we are never get an explanation of what the monster is, where it came from, why it's so destructive and mean, or what its goal is if it has one. To me that is the beauty of Cloverfield. I have had enough of horror-thriller flicks like Cloverfield that always spoonfeed to filmgoers all the dirty details of what everything means. The imagination can think up far more brilliant theories and details than the film itself can. Once the mystery is explained, there goes the mystery. The monster in Cloverfield was enormous, vicious, destructive, and intriguing. I'm also very glad that it's something original and not Godzilla.<br/><br/>The flaws are there of course, so here's what I and others found. The camera seems to be very high tech, I've never heard of a camera that's battery can last vast hours, and also survive a few huge drops without even a cracked lense. Another problem I found is that there aren't more buildings that were knocked down by the creature. We see the statue of Liberty's head thrown down a street, and also a huge skyscraper fall to the ground, but not many others are torn down. Another issue is why are there no dead bodies littering the streets? With all that's going on there should have been a few bodies scattered about. Also why is everyone on foot, did they forget their car keys? I think the instinct would be get in a car to get away from a monster attacking a city, but I guess a nice pair of Cross-Trainers solves that problem. One last issue is that the lady characters are running very fast in high heels, now I'm a guy but I don't think that'd be happening.<br/><br/>Cloverfield has flaws just like any other movie. But the suspense and heart-pounding excitement, and unexpected scares, are what got me. I give Cloverfield a 3 out of 4. It is the prescription to cure any fanboy's fever."

I know, I know, the movies SUPPOSED to be like that, but it just gave me a really sick feeling while watching the movie. Overall, the movie was alright. The story line was alright, the fact that it was a home-made sorta movie was okay, and the effects and set was Excellent! I just didn't like the feeling I experienced after I watched the movie. The movie left us still wondering what that CREATURE was ! Is it an alien, is it an ugly re-make of Gozilla, or is it just some weird creature? No-one knows, but it was ugly.

","Before going to see Cloverfield, I had heard many different reviews of its quality, ranging from ""the worst movie ever"" to ""simply incredible."" After having seen it, I must say that I fall in with the latter of those two groups. The movie is great in all aspects. It's fast paced and leaves you on the edge of your seat for the entire ride, yet manages to do so without exhausting you. The handicam style filming adds great depth to the story and makes the experience so much more visceral. The characters are also well developed, and the actors do a fantastic job.<br/><br/>The only reason I could see why people wouldn't like this movie is because it's not a generic Hollywood film. This movie is innovative and isn't afraid to break some of the conventions most blockbusters follow today. The ending is fantastic, although atypical for a movie of this sort. I wouldn't spoil it, but let's just say that if you're willing to open your mind to new experiences, you'll love it.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is probably one of the best action/disaster movies ever made.

","Back in the fall of 2007 when I first saw the trailer for CLOVERFIELD I was very intrigued. The trailer was high tension. I was itching to see this movie.<br/><br/>I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! I truly love this movie. Seen it three times!!! It was made to look like a video retrieved from what was once Central Park here in NYC. The movie starts with the U.S. Government blurb and logo. Its apparent that the footage was being viewed secretly by top military brass and members of our government. This the video begins. Its lighthearted and in many places funny before the attack. Its about one of the main character's Bon Voyage party and some of the insanity that takes place during the party. The there is the great explosion and insuring ""attack"" upon Manhattan. This is not a monster I've seen before which makes this extremely satisfying. Monster is NOT a reptile.<br/><br/>I understand the original title of the film was going to be PARASITE. I see why. WOW!!! But the military designation is even better.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams for bring us a highly original film."
"rustyalex2","8","2","6","21 January 2008"," Cloverfield, Felt Somewhat Real
","Cloverfield was filmed in a unique way. The style of the camera was in a document first person form where the viewers (us at the theater) are able to see the film in the perspective of a character who is holding the camera and recording the action as if the events were to be happening in real life. The story focuses on a group of people whom are trying to survive as a monster begins destroying NYC. The whole view is through one camera, the 25 million dollar budget was well done on the special FX, Sound and Graphics which made the film feel real. The plot is stunning yet makes you feel at times that there could have been more towards it. At times the camera movement swayed too fast and made you look away from the screen for a short time. A lot of people loved the climax and were confused by the ending, therefore the film didn't balance out entirely to the expectations. This movie compares to other hit movies such as Godzilla, Day after tomorrow, War of the worlds and even the Blair Witch Project. The actors deserve credit and so does the film.<br/><br/>Many people were disappointed because they didn't understand that once the camera shuts or turns off during the film, the whole movie turns off too. This appeals at the end. If you didn't enjoy the films it compares to then maybe you should wait until it becomes available for rent. Though Altogether IMO this is a good film to check out in 08."

","I had been following the movie since July when I went into the midnight showing on Friday. I was worried this movie wouldn't live up to its hype, but it did indeed. I went and saw this movie for my 2nd time today. The movie is just so amazing with sounds, visuals, and its mystery that is going to leave fans talking long after they've seen the movie. It's one of the most different monster movies i've ever seen not really focusing all the attention on the monster and more on the characters of the film. I loved J.J's work and we may be looking at a squeal. I guess time well tell what's in store for Cloverfield fans. My advice see this in theaters in will never be the same at home."

","Spielberg got us partway there with War of the Worlds (a huge missed opportunity to outdo the original). These guys -- Abrams and Reeves -- get us all the way there. 'There' is what it might feel like to be in the way of something big and angry and strange in New York city.<br/><br/>I rate this movie a 9 because it is nothing if not effective. The unknown actors are credible, the atmosphere is credible, and the scares are credible. All three are hard to sustain, especially considering the premise of this movie. <br/><br/>The way we all are blindsided and bewildered by events that jar us -- the way we lack the 'God's eye' perspective usually offered in such films; the way life-altering events seem to come out of nowhere... all are captured in a uniquely powerful way here. <br/><br/>Someone called this the first monster movie for the MySpace generation, and I can't argue with that. But I'm way beyond that generation, and I thought this was a breakthrough. Don't wait for rental, see it on the big screen."

","This film could be reduced to a cross between The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla, but it rises above such amateur labels. This is a good flick based off of original cinematic methods, but addressing coherent and pertinent subject matter. The cinematography was good (as far as the genre goes). There were certain parts that I would advise anyone who is in any way sensitive to 9/11 to avoid. That is a big minus of this film: it is a great story, but the setting is... somewhat unsettling. The film makers could have used Chicago or L.A. as a setting and avoided the distraction. This distraction is onmniscient throughout the film. Nevertheless, I liked the film. There was a flow in the concept and the storyline."

","I really don't like big-monster movies other than as fodder for MST3K. And this isn't so much about the monster itself as it is what the monster does. People somehow are missing that, partly because so many movies are just about the monster and some stereotype characters.<br/><br/>But this is different.<br/><br/>And it resonated with me because I understood what the film symbolized. Everyone's trying to evoke Sept. 11 and it's about that, but not the way people think. We're looking at 9-11 through the eyes of 7+ years of memory.<br/><br/>Think back to that horrific day when you had no idea what was happening and you just felt like an ant being fried on the sidewalk by some evil kid with a magnifying glass and you were helpless and unprepared and incapable of comprehending what was happening.<br/><br/>THAT is what Cloverfield is about. In the end, you have no idea what that thing was or where it came from and you doubt you'll ever know the truth...<br/><br/>...just like so many things in life. And when you come right down to it, disaster movies and their ilk, to me, are not about how cool the special effects and action are, but how it takes that feeling of being side-swiped by life and magnifies it so out of proportion that you don't feel so bad about it anymore by comparison when your car breaks down or you lose your job.<br/><br/>Sure, that sucks, but at least I'm not watching my friends get hit by flaming wreckage from some sort of towering colossal beast while everyone screams and runs.<br/><br/>I give it 8 out of 10.

","First off, I am an easy going movie patron. I pay the price of admission to escape for a while and to be entertained. Thats it, plain and simple. I do not expect every movie to shake the world and be an Academy Award winner. I just expect it to be somewhat interesting and intriguing. With all of that said, I will tell you that the only thing you should pay attention to in the negative comments are the warnings about dizziness from the shaky camera effect. When the film first started it did take a little while to get used to, but you DO get used to it (most people anyway). It appears that some people prefer to have standard cookie-cutter movies spoon-fed to them, which is unfortunate. A lot of movies can be compared to an Amusement Park Ride. Either you sit down, suspend disbelief and go along with it or you look at all the gears on the ride, complain about the way the characters are constructed, and completely remove yourself from the experience. Honestly, when you go to Disneyland, do you allow yourself to enjoy 'Its A Small World' & 'Pirates of the Caribbean' or do you complain about the flaws in craftsmanship? This is the same thing. Its a Popcorn Movie with monsters, presented in a unique way. And you know what??? It's done really well if you allow yourself to enjoy it."

But I do agree that some people might get dizzy or sick watching it, but I didn't and absolutely loved it. Also the monster does not disappoint, it was perfect<br/><br/>Plus u saw plenty of the monster in the movie, so the mysterious monster is finally revealed.<br/><br/>So go see this movie, I can already tell that it is one of the best movies of 08."

","I totally loved this flick! Sure the video is choppy, but it usually is when shot from a hand-held video cam. This was so realistic, I felt like I was there with the group. Total mayhem like that would happen if this were a real event. I didn't feel the 'motion sickness' many of the reviewers speak of at all. The ending is abrupt and I found myself really wanting more as I left the theater. The next best thing Abrams and Reeves could do is collaborate on a sequel which would be shot in the normal sense for a film - with a more complete storyline which would explain the origins of the creature and its lively deadly 'offlings'...This film is brilliant in all the pre-marketing and even in the choice of filming for this type of perspective. I was totally involved with all the characters. I will definitely watch it again when it comes on DVD."
"anemica","Null","2","6","19 January 2008"," Cloverfield is unique
","First, I really need to say is: if you have any motion sickness or are pregnant and suffer from severe to moderate nausea, this movie is not for you. <br/><br/>The storyline was good, the monster was unique and very cool. The camera action was not! I have never been so motion sick during a movie for a long time. It was hard on the eyes and the constant moving was painful. Looking away didn't even help. Most of the people that I could see from my seat were either looking away or playing with their cell phones. <br/><br/>The intro to the movie was good until it got redundant. There are some parts you don't need to see or hear about. You're watching a movie of gore and blood, no one needs to see romance. I also did not like how they used the romance to the point where the main characters risked their lives to rescue someone who was possibly dead or dying. I just wish that they had used a rolling camera with a team, not some guy relating the problems to you. I did not find him funny and only laughed once. <br/><br/>I was also annoyed with the Brooklyn Bridge part. It was very dumb. Who heads out into a open, hanging part? Obviously the creature will notice and end that. <br/><br/>They should have ended it with Hud being picked up by the monster. You got to see the creature, and that should have been it. I did enjoy that you barely saw the monster or it's offspring, only when they were attacked. These people also hid in the most obvious of places. If that was me, I would have ran and never looked back. Nor would I head into the center of the chaos. <br/><br/>Again, good storyline, bad filming. Next time, use a better camera."
"soutrik-93","9","2","6","19 January 2008"," Not quite a movie, more of a ride. An awesome, hugely immersive ride. But be sure to watch it in theaters, it won't be the same on DVD.
","Cloverfield is a lot like a simulator ride with elements of a movie. It still is one of the scariest experiences in a theater I ever had.<br/><br/>The whole movie is shot like a homemade camcorder movie, and this is implemented perfectly. This isn't like the Bourne movies, where the camera loses it just when the action is getting good. The filming is much more realistic, and the cameraman's hand shakes a lot more, but it steadies itself when looking at important things, like the monster. The camera-work is so realistic it will put you right in the middle of all the action. This is probably the scariest part of the movie, because you think you're there. Way more immersive than any simulator ride I've ever been on. Never leaving the camera's point of view makes it an experience not unlike Half-Life.<br/><br/>The movie takes a while to get off, and spends some time introducing you to the characters. This is time well spent, as the backstory plays a big part later on. Also, you'll come to like the characters as you try to survive the ordeal together. The action starts at the perfect time, and rarely lets up after that. The dialogue is very believable (or believable enough, considering the situation), and never pulls you out of the immersion.<br/><br/>Overall, Cloverfield is definitely a movie I would recommend for anyone who wants to get their heart pounding for 80 minutes non-stop. I strongly urge you to watch it in theaters as it is an important part of the experience. The sound makes the theater rumble as debris hits the ground. The 50 foot screen makes you feel like you're seeing it with your own eyes. If you can see it in IMAX, even better. But don't wait for it to come out on DVD, because no matter how big your TV, it won't be the same."
"danim33","8","2","6","19 January 2008"," Good movie, but take motion sickness meds before!
","I have been looking forward to this movie ever since I saw an unnamed trailer online a long time ago. It did not disappoint, but it did make me feel ""car sick"" from almost the very beginning and one of the people in my group actually threw up in the bathroom at the end of the movie. Although it made me feel queasy, it did not take away from the experience too much, actually made it more real. If you are not prone to motion sickness, you will be fine, but I tolerated the Blair Witch and Bourne Identity movies just fine, so do not use those experiences to compare, because this one made me sick immediately, but it was mild and I still enjoyed the film greatly. It is funny, suspenseful, and gives you plenty of shots of the thing attacking New York, which is not Hilary Clinton, as one moviegoer shouted at the beginning of the movie- one of the reminders why going to the theater often can enhance the experience. So if you do not mind a shaky camera, and not having all the questions answered and just want to enjoy a different thrill type of movie, then go see it. If the shaky camera and unanswered questions will bother you, then you might want to pass, or wait until video when you can have a bucket nearby! 8/10! Addendum- I feel strongly that I should add, after having read other comments, that again, know what you are going to see. If you lived through 9/11 in New York, you may want to skip this if you are prone to post-traumatic stress, as the destruction of New York may bring that back to you. And, if you know you are prone to getting sick, then seriously, go to the store and get some over the counter medications! The warnings are out there people, heed them if you are vulnerable, rather than go then say it is a terrible movie!"

Maybe at the beginning it was a little, but by the time the party is happening, you are in the movie and the motion is much less. The acting was pretty good ( if you are concerned of it). If one word could characterize the acting, it would be ""normal"" What I mean is that it was really good. The effects were pretty cool too. the ending was very different than the other movies, but I liked it. SPOILER ALERT....................................................... About the ending, be careful to notice the splash in the right hand corner at the ending sequence in which Rob ad Beth are in Coney Island. The monster actually came from space about a month before the footage of the attack. END OF SPOILER......................................................<br/><br/>One recommendation: Do not go to the theater with ""perfectionist"" expectations. You will ruin the movie for yourself. Just go, relax, sit quietly,clear your mind,and enjoy. I really enjoyed it."

I don't want to give anything away. Just realize two things when you go in: Yes, you will be dizzy during the first 5-10 minutes (then the camera steadies out) and realize that the whole movie is from a camcorder video.<br/><br/>You will leave the theater feeling like you just experienced a giant monster attacking the city.

They're trying to survive and save the people they love.<br/><br/>Yeah, the camera is shaky and it's hard to follow sometimes, but that's what makes it so good. The documentary point of view puts you in the middle on NYC and one of the survivors trying to find refuge.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire movie, I felt like I was there and running myself.

"ethan_hegel","8","2","6","19 January 2008"," An excellent work of cinematic art.
","Cloverfield, brought to us by the geniuses behind Lost, is a very different movie by normal standards. It follows a group of friends as they try to survive an attack by a gigantic monster and its little gremlin minions. The entire story is told through the group's hand-held digital camera, which makes for a very interesting twist on the storytelling. The creators were also very clever in adding flashbacks with this style of cinematography and storytelling. I personally didn't find the movie to be as terrifying as the MPAA rating suggests (violence, terror, and disturbing images) but it definitely had it's moments. The disturbing images part was right on target though. And the scale of the movie created by the digital camera-style filming definitely makes you feel as though you are actually there. There were a couple of moments, especially toward the end that made my eyes open wide and think, ""Oh, crap."" All in all, I really enjoyed Cloverfield. 8 out of 10."
"ActionMan42","5","2","6","19 January 2008"," An interesting half of a movie
","I saw this movie opening night in Australia and had no clue what to expect.<br/><br/>First point - the ""home video"" concept is interesting and gives the movie a nice feel, but I wish they could have at least kept the video still and level for at least a portion of the film. Even when there was no action going on, the camera was always off-center, angled, or shaking. My girlfriend and I regularly had to look away from the screen just to keep from getting motion sick. The lack of any video stabilization was unnecessary and over-the-top.<br/><br/>Second point - The characters, albeit fairly well-developed, are just plain stupid. The movie makes an attempt to portray the characters as courageous, but the panic-driven story line became very tiresome and predictable. Then again... there wouldn't have been much of a story if the characters made rational decisions.<br/><br/>Third point - unsatisfying movie. Although you get to see what's causing all of the destruction, there is absolutely no closure. You are left to wonder how the story ends, and by the end of the film I really didn't care if a single one of the main characters survived because I felt they all deserved whatever came to them for taking such ridiculous risks.<br/><br/>All in all - not worth my $15 except for the great previews for the upcoming action flicks Jumper and Iron Man."
"bmgod88","9","2","6","19 January 2008"," Must See in Theatres
","Going into Cloverfield i had much the same expectations i had for snakes on a plane... this is going to suck. Much to my surprise i received a mind blowing visual experience that kept me glued to the screen. The beginning of the movie does an excellent job of developing the main characters and really helping you empathize with them and even put yourself into the story. Then the action hits you extremely quickly and doesn't let go until the ending credits roll.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people complained about the camera bouncing around too much. I for one did not find the camera style to be distracting i actually found it to be more immersing. The story and shooting brought something real to an event of complete fantasy, were at some points you felt it was almost believable.<br/><br/>While Cloverfield may not be for everyone if you are a hardcore movie goer, like myself, and love a great story, this is the film for you. If just looking at the tilt a whirl at your local county fair makes you queezy, then i would recommend you go see another film. In the end this film shattered my expectation and i think its one of the best films I've seen in the past year or so."
"BigDom2786","7","2","6","19 January 2008"," Believe the hype...but don't expect too much....
","When I walked out of this film I have two emotions: happiness and disappointment. I was happy because I got the film I wanted: a monster movie that didn't explain everything, but had enough for me to understand what the hell was going on. The main problem with Godzilla(98) is that it force-fed the audience what the monster is or where it came from. This movie leaves it up to your imagination, and I'm glad it did. I'm disappointed the film felt too short for a monster movie and too long for a love story. As much I appreciated an actual attempt at story, it distracted what was basically 65 minutes of monster madness( and 5 minutes of light humor). Though, if it wasn't for this love story, the movie would've been the length of a TV show.<br/><br/>Basically, the characters( no matter how annoying they were sometimes) were well acted, the monster looked pretty awesome( I think JJ Abrams need to thank the Half Life creators for some inspiration ) and it ended the way I wanted to end ( even though it could've been better).<br/><br/>So I say go see this film, u wouldn't regret it. Just don't come in expecting this to be the greatest movie ever made. It's just a great way to spend a Saturday night with your friends. Oh and word of advice: don't watch this film at least in the first 5-10 rows.....u will get motion sickness from the shaky cam."

","Before you read this review let me just say I've been waiting a very long time for this movie. Ever since the mysterious trailer featured in Transformers, I have been completely psyched for the release of this movie and did some research online. This is everything how I pictured it and more. I enjoyed every single second of this movie. It sure kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. Throughout this movie you will laugh, cry, and say ""I can't believe that just happened!"" and leave you wondering what will happen next. They did an AMAZING job with the camera in first person, and easily would not be the same without it. There are many questions you will ask yourself after you see the movie, and leaving you wanting to see it again as I definitely will. Some parts there was so much happening in the environment it was hard to tell what was going on, which is what makes this movie unique though. I will not tell any spoilers at all, but I was very mad when I heard people say ""What! That movie sucked!"" at the end. Before you do the same if you see the movie, just remember the intensity of every second of this movie. I will be disappointed if this doesn't make the Top 250 because it most definitely deserves the title. This is I think one of the best movies I've ever seen and the most adrenalin rushing experience I've ever seen in the cinema. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone! I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy this movie."

","The relationships formed at the beginning between the characters really does carry the film through the 80 or 90 so minutes, if and only if you are drawn into these relations.<br/><br/>It so happens I was, I connected with the characters and laughed with the amusing comments that were made at times. So it was no surprise that I was very interested in seeing how the movie concluded.<br/><br/>In general, the first thing i'd touch on is the acting as these are not big names, we don't expect to see Denzel Washington like performances. And on that, to be honest these generally unknown actors do suit these roles much better then a famous actor would. The acting is convincing enough.<br/><br/>The camera work is a main focal point as most would know or heard of, but it is done a heck of a lot better then The Blair Witch. The people behind Cloverfield did their homework and took advantage of the Blair Witch's downfalls in this department no doubt.<br/><br/>There are instances in the movie where you may question why the camera is still rolling, but as I see it, this is common in these such films.<br/><br/>Summing up, this film is rewarding if you are able to cling to the characters at the beginning of the film. If you don't by the time all the crazy stuff starts happening. You most likely wont enjoy it.<br/><br/>Overall i give it a 7/10, I don't really want to write specifically why it loses 3 points as i will spoil some things, but they are due to unrealistic events occurring in a movie that is using realistic camera work."

","The film is shown in a retrospective with the camera work reminiscent of the Blair Witch project. That's O.K. The premise of the initial news of some form of catastrophe in the city of New York and eventual ""encounter: with the beast/alien was well done. however, some of the acting was immature, silly and adolescent at best. Not to spoil the plot, some of the behavior of the main characters was juvenile and the dialogue was 2nd grader level. We are drawn into characters that are the most naive and stupid I have watched in a movie. The characters as a whole are barely nelievable and cartoonish. When confronted with a catastrophe of this nature, normal thinking people run AWAY from the scene of ground zero, not towards it. the film's second half seems to be some type of virtual reality game. Enough said. I prognosticate this film will not do well in the box office once people find out. I will definitively will not be anticipating to buy the video. The move is entertaining in parts but misses the mark by about a few hundred meters. The camera work eventually felt as if the viewer will be having a seizure at any minute. Wheww!"

While I felt the concept was a great idea, the story was well thought, the execution was just lacking.<br/><br/>First off, they went WAY overboard with the hand-held camera feel. I spent half the film having to try and not focus on the screen to keep the dizziness at bay. Perhaps had they just shown and opening shot from the camera menu that showed ""Steady Cam On"" or something like that, they could have filmed a bit less motion blur. This unfortunately kept me distracted through much of the film.<br/><br/>The performances were generally pretty decent, but there was something lacking. I never felt any anxiety, or anticipation, or fear, or sadness, or pretty much any emotion.

Honestly I was pretty freaked out by the whole idea of a giant monster just destroying everything and this didn't help. Although the first person camera view has been done before I think Cloverfield just made it better, it personalized this genre of movies.

","I really enjoyed this film. I thought it was very original in the way that it was filmed from a first person perspective, and the ending was very bold for an expensive American film. Like most people I had high expectations for this movie and it mostly lived up to them. The special effects were very good and it clearly relied on evoking images of 911.<br/><br/>I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said but I'd just like to make some comments about the monster. While I thought the monster was pretty good (and scary), it could have been better. Obviously the makers of this film were aiming for maximum realism and so the monster could have been more ""believable"" by for example not giving it humanoid features. Since it is supposed to have come from outer space how can it have a humanoid face with recognizable facial expressions. For that to be so it would have to have descended from the evolutionary ancestors of mankind. Also another point of realism, how can the US military fire so much ordinance at the monster (destroying much of the city) and still not kill it? Absurd! The film makers captured a very realistic and immersing feeling and they did the right thing by not showing much of the creature until the end since it is much more effective when only partially and briefly glimpsed in the midst of the action, thus maintaining its mystery.<br/><br/>The characters were hard to sympathize with I think. They were just twenty-something yuppies living in New York and I find it hard to believe that they would go out of their way and risk life and limb to document the events portrayed in Cloverfield. Perhaps they should have been scientists or journalists, that would have been more believable.<br/><br/>If you are thinking of seeing this film you should definitely go see it in the cinema and not wait for it to come out on DVD since it is a visceral experience needing a big screen and powerful surround sound system to be truly appreciated and will not be half as good on a small screen. Also, be warned that because it is filmed in ""queasy-cam"" style it may make you feel nauseous on the big screen."

","NO SPOILERS! <br/><br/>I just got back from the midnight screening and I have to tell you how awesome I thought Cloverfield was. It is not surprising to see how many people are already bashing this movie. What is surprising though is why they are. People keep on complaining about the camera work and the way the movie ends. Let me ask those people this: What did you expect? It was pretty clear since the beginning that this movie was being filmed on a Handy-cam. So why expect still shots and Academy Award winning cinematography? I think the reason why people are giving this so much crap is because they were annoyed by all the buzz and just decided to lash out against the movie itself. I'm not saying that's the case with all of you guys, but I know there are those people out there that are like that.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie yet, let me just give you some tips before you do. Don't go in expecting a typical monster movie with a beginning, middle, and end. Abrams and Reeves set out to redefine the monster movie genre and that is exactly what they do. They made this movie very unique, managing to stay away from a lot of the pitfalls and clichés that always manage to sneak into the other monster flicks.<br/><br/>I may just be the only person who enjoyed the camera work. Seeing it from the point of view of the people who went through it made it even more incredible and realistic. I hardly get scarred or jump in a movie, but this one definitely will cause a few jumps! However, if the whole shaky camera thing is not your cup of tea, then you have been warned (although you don't really need a warning). I did not find it distracting or nauseating like some people will say (overreacting of course), but I can understand how there are those of you out there who will not like it.<br/><br/>Secondly, be prepared to find that there is actually a human element involved in this film. The characters are so realistic it's hard to remember that they are just actors; they do such a great job of keeping the film going when they aren't running for their lives. Basically, the main character Rob is trying to find the girl he loves throughout this entire attack, going against the common sense of getting the hell out of there! And lastly, do not expect to have all your questions answered. I'm gonna try and not spoil anything here so I'll just say this: whatever the hell that monster is or where it came from is up in the air at this point.<br/><br/>Some of you may not like the ending. I found it fitting and strangely satisfying. Although, why people think there will be a sequel is beyond me.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a very entertaining movie that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat most of the time and has a surprising amount of humor from cameraman Hud. The graphics are very well done, the monsters are refreshingly new and original, and overall the film kept me entertained. IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE, but if this sounds like something you will like then see it! 8/10"

","For those who think that this is suppose to be the cliché, ""Blaire Witch meets Godzilla"" clash, you are are completely and utterly misled. This is a very good POV film and needs to be treated as something of it's own kind. People need not compare it to other films, but rather compare other future films to it, because it's style will probably be mimicked. This is a very realistic film, as realistic as it can be at least. It has its moments but you are mostly left believing these are real emotions the actors are displaying. The biggest problem that I saw some members of the audience having was that they were being nauseated by the camera's wild motion. Folks, if you know you can't handle things like that, this isn't the movie for you. As for the hype, hype will always ruin every movie if you listen to the guy that always hates the movies that have it built up. If you go in there because you have a personal interest to see what it is suppose to be about, and it seems interesting and innovative to you, see it. If you are seeing it because everyone is talking up a storm about it and have no real clue what to think yourself, wait till it comes out on DVD. It is a great theater experience. Even the greatest home entertainment system and the most comfortable couch on the planet couldn't do it justice like the true silver screen does. See it if you like monster movies and aren't afraid of camera motions nauseating / disorienting you. I went in expecting a mildly entertaining thriller, and came out having seen a very interesting and intense monster flick that deserves to be held as unique and brand new.

"mauddib1141","8","2","6","18 January 2008"," What a horror film should be...
","****************CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS*********************************<br/><br/>Minutes ago, I finished seeing the midnight premiere of Cloverfield at the Uptown Theatre in Washington, DC. If anything, I had low expectations going in. I found myself pleasantly surprised by an elegant horror film.<br/><br/>All too often, horror films suffer from three basic faults. First, horror films tend to devolve into morality tales or popularity contests in which unlikeable and/or morally flawed characters die and usually do so in horrible ways. Second, horror films tend to reveal too much of the monster, by either showing the monster in full detail or by revealing too many facts about the creature. Third, although it is not necessary that all major characters die, uplifting endings tend to reduce the full impact of a horror film. Cloverfield's effectiveness lies in its ability to clear each of these hurdles.<br/><br/>First, Cloverfield avoids being a morality tale or popularity contest by presenting us with a set of characters with whom the audience can relate and who show, overall, positive or at least understandable character traits. Although the characters have slightly different personalities, no one is written to be clearly more or less likable than anyone else. There are times, however, when we question the wisdom or morality of certain characters' actions. For instance, the audience would probably question both the morality and wisdom of one character whose decision to film this incident in undeterred by the destruction surrounding him or even the deaths of some of his friends. Further, the audience is left wondering how moral it is to search for one person in NY city (which forms the underlying premise for the film) thereby endangering the lives of everyone else in the group (a kind of 'Saving Private Ryan' problem). Although these characters make decisions that are questionable or even downright stupid at times, the characters acknowledge the risks that they're taking and behave in ways that someone may conceivably behave in a high stress situation. Further, the resolve of the character filming the incident and of the character who spurs the group forward looking for a woman who may already be dead (not to mention the loyalty of his friends who agree to go with him) further makes us like and even root for the characters.<br/><br/>Second, although we see a lot of the monster, we tend to see parts of the creature in low light situations or in between buildings. When we finally do see the creature in daylight, the sun is to the creature's back, creating a halo effect that obscures the details of the creature's face (this was done rather effectively with the aliens in M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs'). Further, we are left knowing very little about the monster and its origins. Ultimately, fear is based on ignorance, and since you leave the theater with more questions than answers about the monster in Cloverfield, the monster remains terrifying. For an alternate example, consider the creatures from the ALIEN films. These aliens are scary for a time. Once you know where they come from, how they mature, and that they are essentially social insects, however, every film afterward feels like a National Geographic special about the predatory behaviors of the Man-Eating Parasitic Xenomorph of LV-426. They're not scary- just interesting at best. If Cloverfield has sequels, this monster will inevitably suffer the same fate. But for now, the monster's mystery keeps it scary.<br/><br/>Finally, horror films are essentially multi-million dollar ghost stories. Ghost stories are most effective when either (a) the monster wins (b) there is a threat that the monster will return or (c) there is an ominous sense that the creature was not fully understood and a graver fate awaits the characters. I will not spoil the ending by telling you whether Cloverfield conforms to (a), (b), or (c), but, I will say that, in regards to the ending, Cloverfield takes a page from 'The Birds' and 'Night of the Living Dead' in that the fate of the characters, the monster, or even mankind are left to some extent uncertain.<br/><br/>I am giving Cloverfield an 8/10 because it manages to be a great horror film not by offering something new but by borrowing from classics. Elements of 'The Birds,' 'Night of the Living Dead,' and, of course, 'The Blair Witch Project' are fundamental to the film's success. Indeed, I am surprised that no one made a film like this soon after 'The Blair Witch Project' because that film's success makes a film like this a foregone successor."
"zmackey1","9","2","6","18 January 2008"," More than what was expected.....
","First and foremost I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. I spent a great deal of effort avoiding any speculative discussion about the nature of the movie prior to my viewing (and I've been excited about it since the first preview in Transformers!) in order to avoid any feelings one way or another. I went in completely neutral, but left in awe.<br/><br/>I have been reading some of the reviews and thought I would add my two cents. I personally think this a ""love it or hate it"" movie for the most part. This is, unfortunately, due largely to the way it was filmed which is actually what was most enjoyable for me. Don't get me wrong now, all the running did make me dizzy, maybe even a little nauseous, but it was nothing someone who's watched a few home movies can't handle. The handy-cam point of view adds so much excitement and suspense to the movie though. It really feels like you're there, right in the action with everyone else. You become lost and confused, nervous and anxious, and you truly feel how small and desperate everyone is. There are moments in the film that just literally sucked me right into the streets of New York, military all around fighting the good fight, running for my life with my heart beating out of my chest!<br/><br/>Now I do have to admit this is not your typical movie. There is no real ""development"" so-to-speak. After all, you follow the same group of people with the same camera the whole film. You can only learn as much as they can, which isn't much. But, that really isn't what the movie is about. If you go in expecting there to be some Hollywood ending to the movie you are not going to be happy. Some people say there is no ending, but I assure you there is. You have to accept what is offered. So if you can stomach the camera (really not that bad) and take the movie for what it is (a guy with a handy-cam in the midst of a disaster) I'm confident you will thoroughly enjoy every minute."
"gumlp","9","2","6","17 January 2008"," So you've never been to Coney Island?
","""What is Cloverfield?"" We've been hearing it for almost 6 months now-although ""What is 1-18-08?"" was first said till it gained it's titled- but regardless we all wanted to know what Cloverfield was. Today we found out. Sorta.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is the codename given to an incident that occurred in New York city. It's footage recovered from a hand-held camera find in the aftermath of this incident. Its the lives of Rob and his friends as they experience first hand what occurred. It's our gateway to experience what they went through. Its utter brilliance.<br/><br/>It begins a bit like Deathproof, you know that movie that played after Planet Terror in Grind House, the one that not many people stayed to see. Slow conversation, a build up of character, boring blah blah blah BOOM.<br/><br/>Panic and Chaos ensues. Headless statue of liberty, dust, debris and more panic and chaos ensues. So what? Somewhere between all this, however, is a story of one mans journey to find the love of his life. Midway across the city. (One of the major downfalls of this movie. SOOO Cliché!!) But at the same time we're treated to snippets of what this creature looks like, and that it spawns other little demons. So through this first person look we find love of life, run for safety and then end up.... with a awesome shot of creature and then nothing. (Not necessarily, but i don't want to ruin the ""ending."") Okay so yes it never really ends. The story of Rob and his friends does, it comes to a complete close, but we never really find out where the creature originated from, (although we are given theories by the funny cameraman, Hud. And who knows, perhaps one of his theories were, but we never find out.) Or what happens after the incident either. It just ends. And some of you might say thats dumb, and I agree but at the same time makes the movie that much more interesting. Why? Let's say a month from now we get a book, or a website, or some other form of 411 giving. An account of what occurred after wards. Wouldn't you go out and buy this book, or visit that website to get the lowdown? We know the tape was found, and we know someone find the tape. So whose to say that the spiffy marketing campaign the movie had, wasn't replicated by the film to, this time promote say-such book. I can't guarantee there will be more but I'm confident there will be. And we're all going to chew it up to learn it all.<br/><br/>So why did I give it a 9? Well, first of all it didn't get a 10 for the clicheness of our hero and for the simple matter that I don't want more later, but now. Aside from that. This movie delivers. It's got a bit of comedy, even when the creature is but a foot away. And it's got a hell of a lot of suspense. It's got terror, as in, ""Oh sh!t, I pooped my pants."" and it's got some sad moments that makes you want to cry, (not my, chick I went with.) But most of all suspense. (The climbing of the building to find Beth, the roof top scenes that was brilliant.) I just can't wait till tomorrow to see it again, and Sunday to see it once more. And, although the first 15-20 minutes are good for the first viewing, it's get a tad boring. But I do recommend watching it for character development the first time around.<br/><br/>As for the camera and those ""users"" giving the movie one star based on the nausea they acquired throughout the movie, I didn't experience it. Yes the camera shakes but and we do see some floor, but thats only like 2 minutes combined in the 2 hour movie, (although the ending does show the floor a lot, there is no movement.) It's absurd to give a movie a one star rating just cause it got you dizzy. Reading those reviews I see no mention about the plot or the monster leading me to believe the movie wasn't even seen.<br/><br/>Also, leaving the movie theater a lot of whispers could be heard saying, ""Thats it?"" I just chuckled to myself and said ""It is J.J Abrams."" However, even if the movie did have an actual tell-all ending, I think they would of found something else to complain about.<br/><br/>Again, just watch the movie for the movie is like a ride you've never experienced before. You can compare it to the first time you rode a roller-coaster. It begins slow, comes down fast, takes some turns, makes a loop, drops a couple of times and then abruptly ends. You may become sick but your still left wanting more. But there isn't, there's an hour wait for a 60 second ride. And once it's done you have to stand in line and wait some more for the next attraction to experience some more."
"DICK STEEL","9","4","17","17 January 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Cloverfield
","OMIGAWD! OMIGAWD! RUN! OMIGAWD! HELP! GET THE HELL OUT! OMIGAWD!<br/><br/>You'd be expecting to hear a lot of that, but not to fret, the rest of this review is spoiler free, guaranteed! So we've weathered a six month wait since the teaser trailer premiered with Michael Bay's Transformers (and draws some parallels, more on that later), and set the net buzzing with its many viral marketing sites appearing online, some red herrings, some dangling treats for those who can't wait to guess just what the movie will be titled (well, just Cloverfield), and speculate on how the creature, if it was one, would look like.<br/><br/>In recent history, Hollywood had tried this stunt before. Remember the Godzilla of 1998? Audiences were teased with a tail here, a roar there, and the filmmakers pretty much had the monster kept under tight wraps. Until it opened, and because it failed to live up to its hype, and didn't meet everyone's expectations of how the good old Japanese lizard would look like and behave, it tanked at the box office. Now, Cloverfield adopted similar strategies in having us hear a roar, and to witness its destructive powers, without a visual clue of what it looked like. Did it deliver?<br/><br/>Strangely enough, in my opinion, yes. Don't get me wrong, as I was leaning toward, and close to committing the cardinal sin of loathing a movie prior to experiencing it for myself first hand. I was apprehensive about watching something that perpetually couldn't keep still, and yet its technique adopted in presenting the movie worked perfectly. Like Blair Witch Project, we witness a series of events as unfolded through the lens of a hand-held consumer camera. In doing so, we forgo watching the movie from a third person perspective, and get plunged head on to first person instead. In this age of reality television, exclusive news scoops, youtube voyeurism, this shakycam technique works in putting us there where the action is, watching things unfold, raw.<br/><br/>Imagine, just if, a big unknown were to happen. You push and probe, and frankly, get scared, wondering what to do next, worry about your loved ones, and probably would just follow the masses. Cloverfield took a simple, tried and tested story about a monster invasion in the scale of Godzilla's, and played with us - what if we were caught in the same situation with the monster pounding everything in sight - what would we do? We take pictures for our blogs. Then run.<br/><br/>I would put my neck out even to say that there is no grounds of comparison between Cloverfield, and one of my recent monster movie favourite The Host, simply because it's like comparing apples and oranges. The latter decided to show all very early in the movie, and had a strong focus and emphasis on the family of characters. Here, we don't feel much for the yuppies, we somehow become one of them, the videocam being our eyes and ears. And the creature, while we don't see it in full glory clearly, makes it all the more menacing. It plays on actual fear - we catch a glimpse, then quickly run away - and I thought it made the 1998 Godzilla look like a pussy with so much unexplained, that this uncertainty breeds and grows within you.<br/><br/>But of course there will be some quick to dismiss this along the lines similar to those who dislike Transformers on the grounds that there isn't enough screen time for what mattered to them - ""we're here to see robots/monsters, so give us the robots/monsters!"" As mentioned, there are nice moments where we sneak a peek at the rampaging creature, but there will be those whose appetite remain insatiate. Bear in mind though the point here is to experience what it would be like if you're stuck in a similar situation yourself (wonder why this wasn't available in IMAX format), rather than watching in God mode, the narrative unfold in extended Starship Troopers style. And similar to Transformers, Odette Yustman is your new Megan Fox, except that she goes back to being the classic damsel.<br/><br/>Cloverfield, if it makes enough money at the box office, leaves plenty of room with multiple doors wide open to possibilities of spin offs, prequels, sequels, and probably even a television series, animated or live action, or through any other visual medium. You can essentially repeat the same premise, but from different points of view - trust me, there are enough - and can probably build an entire community of creative work just around this one simple flint to sustain a campfire.<br/><br/>OMIGAWD!"
"ajhartmann","6","1","2","23 January 2020"," Overhyped
","With years of hype, Cloverfield was swathed in mystery, with several name changes (even the first trailer released did not have the title attached) and only brief glimpses of the main monster shown before the films release. The film is a science fiction thriller, focusing on the rampage of a monster through New York and was aiming to replace King Kong as the so-called Godzilla of America. Of course, nothing is ever as good as it seems. Clovefield turned out to be a polarizing movie, at best a daring experiment and at worst poorly written and migraine-inducing.<br/><br/>Cloverfield begins in NYC, at a party thrown for one of the characters. The first 15 minutes is boring drama. The 20 something characters aren't memorable at all, but at least most of them aren't overwhelmingly annoying. The most critical point of this exposition is to introduce the audience to the found footage style the movie is in. The movie is supposedly film recovered by the government after the actual interesting part of the movie takes place, but we'll get to that in a bit. The party is being documented by one of the kids, which turned out to be the excuse the director used to explain the entire movie being from the viewpoint of a shaky camcorder. It's an interesting decision, and makes the brief appearances of the monster (unofficially called Clover) more impactful as well as helping the audience to be immersed with the characters. However the shaky view could be nauseating for some viewers, and can cause the film to be a little confusing at times.<br/><br/>After fleeing the party when the monster begins its attack, the party group is split and the rest of the movie is spent by the main party searching for first a brother, and then a past love interest. At this point believability of the characters actions. No sane person would rush towards a large monster they don't understand, or would the military allow several civilians to leave instead of evacuating. The most bizarre point in the movie is when a woman is pulled off rebar, and is apparently fine just minutes later. With a script reworking and some better casting, the film could've been a lot more enjoyable. The only truly gripping moment of the movie in when in the final moments of the film, the only two surviving characters profess their love for each other, as bombs explode around them and the monster roars. The camcorder then skips to an earlier time when the two were on a date, and the film ends on a bittersweet note.<br/><br/>J. J. Abrams (via his influence from Bad Robot Productions) intended Cloverfield to be America's Godzilla, and with a bit of magic it could've been. The film was held back by a lack of emotionally relatable characters, and wasn't quite interesting enough to rely on shock value. The unanswered questions posed in the film makes you think about after it is over. Clocking in around an hour and a half, Cloverfield is not a particularly long film if you don't enjoy it. If you did enjoy it, there's a chance you'll be frustrated with how great of a film it could've been. Overall, I would not consider Cloverfield to be a bad film, just a large missed opportunity."

","'Cloverfield' is a smart and engaging found-footage monster horror that will keep its viewers on edge.
The team of director Matt Reeves, producer J.J. Abrams and writer Drew Goddard create a great horror flick that is surprisingly unpredictable and one of the tensest films I have seen in a while. The well-thought out pacing enables it's viewers to know just enough about the main characters to care about them, so when the action starts you're actually hoping that the characters will make it. Character establishment is an important aspect of any film, particular horrors because the audience needs to have some sort of attachment to it's characters in order for them to actually enjoy the movie because you have people you want to root for. From the very moment that the terror begins, it essentially doesn't stop, resulting in that edge-of-your-seat feeling that we all love. The fact that the entire film is done in an amateur manner, through a shaky camcorder, helps the viewer immerse into the film and it adds a sense of reality. Therefore, when the scares come, they are nothing short of frightening. However, this film did have a few flaws as some scenes seemed rather far-fetched, particularly at the end, which broke the sense of realism. There was also some predictability, but it was balanced with a few moments that were surprising."

","When I first heard of this movie, I was skeptical because I wasn't a big fan of Paranormal Activity and I haven't seen the Blair Witch Project. I watched it and I loved it, but I did started to have a bit of dizziness 20 minutes into the movie. The reason I love this movie is because It's extremely realistic and the acting doesn't even look like acting and it's everyday people just doing their everyday life things and then all of a sudden, they are the victims of a giant creature and just like they, the audience have no idea about this thing and what it is. The special effects are amazing and the dialogue is very ordinary and normal. My favorite part is when the guy holding the camera sees the monster for the first time and it looks extremely huge in size. Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity, The Blair Witch Project, and any other found footage are the type of movies that you either ""love or you hate"". I love this movie, but I can 100 percent sympathies with you if you get motion sickness, because my brother Gerard got motion sickness and hated the movie. Another thing I was taken by surprise that a reference to 9/11 was used when the Statue of Liberty's head fell into the city and the dust of clouds came. It's very offensive that they referenced to that. That's the only problem I have with this movie. Go see Cloverfield, but bring some Dramamine when you go and see for yourself. This is my opinion."

","There are so many plot holes that it's hard to feel positively about this film. Still, it had a modicum of suspense and characters that we sort of cared for. The protagonist leads his peers on what should have been a hopeless venture. As a monster is attacking Manhattan, he manages to get to an apartment building, go into a building next door, and cross over to rescue his girlfriend. The possibility of any of this is beyond belief. Sad as he feels over his poor girlfriend's plight, he isn't going to rescue her. Oops! I spoke way too soon. Why are these monsters so set on knocking down skyscrapers? Are they hungry? Why would the idiot continue to film when everyone is running for their lives.

","Cloverfield takes the Godzilla formula but with the found footage style. Director Matt Reeves and Drew Goddard took something that should have been terrible, but gave it enough style and substance to make it a fun and entertaining thriller. You don't go to these films for Oscar worthy acting or ideas. You go to these films to shove popcorn in your face and have a fun time. That's why it deserves a 9 out of 10, because as a standard monster thriller, it is a well above average movie. The action is intense and not lazily filmed, you are never bored, and thanks to the Cabin in the Woods writer/director, has some humor in it as well. This is not a horror film, which some think it is. The acting is good enough to not take you out of the movie immersion. This is an excellent rental."

","I almost gave up on this because the first 15 minutes are super annoying. Watching a bunch of young New Yorkers at a going away party through the shaky, jarring point of view of a hand-held video camera. Thankfully I stuck with it though because after those first 15 minutes, when the sh*t hits the fan, look out! <br/><br/>Cloverfield then becomes a total thrill ride as we follow 5 of those partygoers (documentary style) through the city as a giant monster descends on New York. You really feel like you're in it with them due to the unique imagery, reminding me at times of some of the post 911 shots seen on TV. Anyways I ended up getting quite wrapped up in this.<br/><br/>The story is pretty good, nothing too original but because of how its been filmed it feels unique as the army descends, N.Y is evacuated and one of the characters attempts the carnage to rescue his girlfriend.<br/><br/>I loved how the monster isn't fully seen for quite a while (in a 'Jaws' sort of way) this made it much scarier. ""did you see that?"" ""what the hell was that?"" I think a lot of the dialogue was probably unscripted here too. I also liked the ending which is left...vague, with lots of questions, so that you're asking yourself ""And then what happened?"" Would love to see a sequel to this. 5/31/14"

","Don't know why, but never saw Cloverfield until the other night, and didn't really know what the movie was about. Just saw a 77 Rotten T rating on Direct TV and taped it. To say this is one of the worst film I've even sat through is an understatement! Yes, it completely rips off The Blair Witch, who is now a 500 foot monster in New York City. I'm mind-boggled how anyone with any sense could find this movie even the slightest bit entertaining.??? It drags on in the beginning with ""Hud"" (TJ Miller) who is given a hand-held video recorder to film comments about some friends who are preparing for marriage. BORING. Of course the camera wiggles and goes in and out of focus to the point of migraine. BTW, how did Miller ever get an acting job. You only hear his voice through 99% of the movie, and that's annoying enough! So the monster FINALLY shows up and people do what they always do in Hollywood movies.... The exact opposite of reality. If you see a 500 ft monster destroying NYC and a friend wants to go straight towards it, to save his girlfriend who is injured, you're not going to follow. More like, ""You are crazy, and if you go it's on your own, idiot!"" Oh, and when your buddy holding the camera continuously films your friends getting killed cause ""people will need to see this,"" instead of turning the damn thing off and helping, you're probably going to kill or seriously injure him. It was so stupid!!! You also know that, like in Blair Witch, they are all going to die and the camera will capture it. Took me 5 min to figure that one out. Oh yeah, the guy actually does get to his injured girlfriend. Yeah, she's got a piece of rebar sticking out through her chest from the building she was in falling over. She's not dead. Nope, she is very much alive, and is then violently pulled of the rebar, and then continues to run around, seemingly unhurt, the rest of the film. Of course, only until she's killed in the last scene... A ""7"" score on IMDb??? Is this for real, or is this as science fiction as the characters in this awful movie. Oh, there's a sequel coming.

The giant monster had the _potential_ to be really cool, but despite the myriad conceptual drawings (that leaked their way onto the Internet), the powers-that-be opted to go with a Godzilla/Marauder/Arachnid hybrid that was creepy without being truly terrifying. The spider-like ""ticks"" that seemed to steal their movements and appearance from ""Pitch Black"" and ""Starship Troopers"" monsters held little appeal other than a way of saying ""Boo!"" during quiet moments in the movie. If you are prone to motion sickness, don't plan on enjoying your popcorn in the theater, as the first-person shaky-camera footage throughout the movie (as in, the ENTIRE movie) will ruin your intestinal fortitude. After looking at the 8 out of 10 clover-field received on IMDb, I was fairly excited about seeing the flick. However about halfway through the movie I realized that there really wasn't any plot.. Not even any main characters.. My 8 year old cousin could have produced a better movie! The entire movie consisted of a couple of friends trying to get away from this giant clover-field spider (Which is actually a type of spider) If I could have thought of the typical monster movie taking over the city and destroying everything this would have definitely fit the mold!

","When the first indescribably spontaneous trailer for 'Cloverfield' previewed, Abrams and co. effectively threw the absorbent mystery net over the viewers. Releasing the brilliantly teasing two minute trailer of a ravaged national sculpture being tossed through NYC and supporting text other than 'Produced by J.J Abrams' - no movie title. Terrorist movie? Monster movie? Disaster movie? What we acquired about J.J's style from 'Lost' was that there were no limitations. This movie was spectacularly marketed. The opening character meet and greet serves a comfortable introduction to the characters who endure the mystery J.J has in store for them. Deciding on a slightly less recognisable cast really allowed the interest in the characters to flourish, with no John Mcclane's or James Bond's to assure us they'll get the girl and save the world. 'Cloverfield' is boldly portrayed, tensely gripping and since its release in 2008 has been a monster movie unrivaled (arguably until Abrams returned with 'Super 8' in 2011).<br/><br/>8/10."
"Errington_92","Null","1","2","12 February 2013"," I Don't Know Why It's Happening.....
","""I don't know why it's happening"". In hindsight this quote is a potent embodiment of Cloverfield, its raw emotive core which sees its central characters be driven by their emotions through thick and thin in a night which forever changes the course of history.<br/><br/>Starting off in an ordinary fashion we witness the trials and tribulations of Robert as he prepares to bid farewell to friends, family and his true love Beth. Although this sequence is nothing spectacular and could easily fit into a sappy rom – com, it has an underlying sense of dread and lingering at the events to come. Seeing this love drama unfold forms a humanity which makes them relatable to us which was exactly the move Cloverfield had to make before hitting us forthright with the traumatic horror that ensues. <br/><br/>The major player here is the cinematography, its point of view vision which we're confined to so that we become immersed into the devastating chaos that the survivors finds themselves in. Being restricted to a point of view vision means there's no escape for us, we're not in control of what we see forcing us into the horrific psychological ride which consumes every character a la The Blair Witch Project. Cloverfield defiantly would not have fully realised its havoc - filled atmosphere and tension if the cinematography had expanded. <br/><br/>Cloverfield's cinematography is only a percentage of the immense psychological roller-coaster we venture on. Shock deaths, immediate changes to situations and honest accounts of individual feelings, Cloverfield does not shy away from raw emotion. In watching Robert having to tell his Mother of his younger brother's death is a culmination, his whole emotional barrier crumbling down at the stark realisation of his world being devastatingly altered hits us simultaneously.<br/><br/>Credit also has to be given to Cloverfield's familiar urban New York setting, the hustle and bustle of modern life suddenly hauled to a standstill where everything the characters come across causes us to feel overwhelmed with senses of profound astonishment. Particularly when the surviving members of the group randomly come across a white horse and cart causally making its own way across now deserted streets, only in such a stunning journey of pandemonium and brutal violence would witnessing a white horse and cart become a disturbing absurdity. This along with the mystery surrounding the invading monster only serves up more horrifyingly astonished scenes. <br/><br/>Running up to only the seventy minute mark, Cloverfield uses its short time frame perfectly with terrifying tension and jittering suspense playing with us psychologically constantly making us wonder, why is it all happening?"

","Cloverfield is an engaging, intense and thrilling ride that takes about ten minutes to introduce our characters and set up the relationships between them before kicking off the chaos and never letting up throughout the remainder of the film. I was blown away by the effectiveness of shooting this story from the first person perspective. What could have been a typical monster movie is upgraded in intensity by making the viewer feel as if they are going through the same situations that the characters are. And by giving us likable characters that we care about also goes a long way to invest the viewers in the story. The story itself is fairly simple, but it works well enough for the purpose of the movie, which is paced at a near break neck speed. The writing is well done, giving us a few clever moments and a few moments of levity, largely provided by T.J. Miller as Hud, who gives nearly his entire performance off camera. The effects are the real star of this movie bringing the monster and a destruction ravaged Manhattan to life. Strongly recommended for anyone who is a genre fan, a first person perspective film fan, or anyone looking for a hell of a ride."

Firsly I want to talk about the good side of this film.<br/><br/>The most influencing topic in this film is the friendship among the characters. They didn't leave one another and supported themselves no matter what happened to them. They show us that to keep together helps us get rid of all bad things. So I like this part of the film.<br/><br/>I was also affected the man who taped the events. The reason why I affected me is that although he had a lot of bad things, he didn't give up and keeped taping. He was sample of determination. He was also ambitious and he didn't set a value on realizing his purposes. He breathed his last when he ran after his purposes. So the film recommends us to follow our dreams at any rate.<br/><br/>And now it is time to talk about bad sides of the film. There are a lot of monsters in it.

I loved it. One of the most compelling things about this movie was the fact that you didn't get to see the 'thing' that was attacking New York City, for about half of the movie, this really kept you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if I have confused a bit already, not explaining what the movie is about so I'll just start off now, Cloverfield is about a 'thing', as I said early that attack New York our main characters being a few friends that were having a 'Farewell Party' for their friend was leaving to Japan the following day, obviously things didn't turn out for our friend as he had planned. Now moving onto the budget of this film, it is an astonishing 25M, the last time I saw a film this action packed and well realist (effects wise), was probably never, maybe The Matrix or District 9 (I saw District 9 before Cloverfield), although even then Cloverfield feels more real despite having a lower budget.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong I would probably list The Matrix and District 9 higher on my favorite movies of all time, but I can say this, Cloverfield is a revolutionary, exiting new film that made a lot of money from a film made out of nothing.<br/><br/>9/10."

"cherold","6","1","2","18 October 2011"," Interesting but ultimately unsatisfying
","Take the hand-held camera gimmick of The Blair Witch Project and marry it to a standard monster-destroys-city flick and you've got Cloverfield. It's an interesting way to tell a monster movie, seen closely through the eyes of a small, bland group of friends caught up in the disaster, yet while I found it interesting it never really pulled me in, and the ending did not make me happy.<br/><br/>You can't talking about this movie without talking about Blair Witch, mainly because Blair Witch took the same gimmick and got so much more out of it. Even though that earlier movie had a fraction of the budget, it used the device so much more effectively; compare the final talking to the camera scenes from both films and tell me Cloverfield's is even a tenth as effective.<br/><br/>It is also less convincing as a premise. The guy with the camera is oddly devoted to documenting the event, to the point where he will stand back and film when he should be helping. In the real world, one of his friends would have grabbed the camera and threw it against a wall. Because of the way it's done, you never forget that this is just a clever device. Blair Witch was more convincing because the camera was the whole point and you were dealing with someone who would think in those terms.<br/><br/>Still, it does have it's good points. Because we see everything from one point of view, we get information in bits and pieces and never get anything like a real explanation of what's going on. There are individually effective scenes. The cameraman is vaguely likable, although everyone else is pretty forgettable.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, the hand-held single view camera is not an effective way to film action or horror scenes, the story and characters fail to be interesting, and the ending is very disappointing. It's interesting enough to watch, but it could have been so much better."
"Nooblethenood","Null","1","2","31 July 2011"," Stylish and definitely effective, if flawed.
","Cloverfield is at first glance not the kind of film I'd bother to review. Numerous reviews here comment on the hype around its release, and there is a definite 'love it or hate it' feel to things. Still, clearly weighted towards the 'love it' camp.<br/><br/>As we all know, the 'clever' conceit is that this is a discovered DV tape covering the experiences of an apocalypse-like event in Manhattan. The DV tape thing, I thought, worked well enough. You get the interesting temporal tool of the main footage being recorded over existing video, so we see snippets of a previous day in which the main character has formed a romantic bond with the girl he eventually goes back to save. It takes a moment to get a feel for this disjointed exposition, but it works.<br/><br/>For all this of course it tends towards fairly 'realist' acting, and the main performers are capable, if given little to work with. There are some convincingly shocking moments. Comparisons to the laughably stupid Blair Witch Project simply don't stand up. In addition, this benefits from the nice faculty of serious, big-scale visual effects being coupled with the hand-held, 'camcorder' footage. This undermines disbelief very well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, suspension of disbelief pretty much ends there. The monsters in the film are far too conventional and familiar, and, frankly, are much too visible. It would have been much better seeing much more of the effect of their presence, and much less of them, especially the big daddy monster. In addition, there are countless holes in the plot, or certainly in the behaviour of the protagonists. If you're going for 'super-realism' in your disaster movie, then you've got to be a bit realistic about people's actions and motivations. This wasn't. Fair enough, the main character might (maybe) go back to rescue his girlfriend from her damaged building. But no way would the broadly uninvolved others come along with him into the jaws of death, and certainly they wouldn't bother going around filming all of it. Then again, these days, perhaps that bit is fair enough! In any case, what it gained in stylistic, visual realism, it lost in the lack of narrative credibility. A shame, really. Could have been really good.<br/><br/>Still, an enjoyable enough, if slightly pointless hour-and-a-half of film, with some nice and pretty well achieved aesthetic ideas. Not quite the genre-shattering event it maybe could have been, but certainly worth seeing for an entertaining Friday evening in."

","Didn't pay much money for the film, so I don't feel cheated. On the whole I think Cloverfield is an innovation in filming style but that style needs a lot of work and the director needs a lot more practice. Style-wise, I thought I would find the camera nauseating and a turnoff going into it, but surprisingly I got used to it fast and it quickly blended into the background of the experience. The film definitely held my attention which is interesting considering there was no soundtrack for most of its length. <br/><br/>Story-wise, it was fun to watch but if it was supposed to be ""thrilling"" or ""scary"" it wasn't. I laughed at the various deaths which, while not frightening, were entertaining. The plot is fool of holes (which I won't go into here since so many other reviewers have) and the characters act like idiots but I found their actions quite believable since there are a lot of idiots in this world and many people probably would do, or try to do, what they did.

","After reading many reviews from this film I decided to check it out. I wasn't all that interesting in the film when it came out back in 2008, so I finally decided to watch it, and I thought it was pretty good. Cloverfield is a unique monster film because of the filming method (its all by a hand-held camera). Its engaging and very entertaining. At first it gets somewhat distracting and annoying then you eventually get used to it. And I thought it actually worked- it made the audience feel as if they were actually there with the group of people seeing the monster attack. Cloverfield has some good thrills, many of them are from jump scenes with the monsters (not too scary and unexpected). The film was pretty interesting but it could have been better had they focused more on the monster. The movie is pretty short. The first 20 mins takes place at a party then the film takes off when the friends notice a monster from outside. Most of the main cast end up dying and since its being filmed by a hand-held camera, you don't see how brutal the death's are- it happens pretty quick.<br/><br/>The characters were alright, not really that likable but not that bad. I think they should have done more development on them to have made the film better. Cloverfield is definitely better than that garbage Skyline- which gets compared to because of its recent monster/alien type films. Watching Cloverfield, you could tell that Skyline borrowed many scenes from the film. I think Cloverfield could have been better had they made the film about 20 minutes longer. The actual film ended around the 73rd minute (73.45). This film is definitely not for everyone. Many complaints are from the camera but to watch a film like this you need to have an open mind, and take it for what it is."

You would have little or no information about it, you would try to escape but with no real master plan, authorities would suddenly appear out of nowhere and they would know more about the monster and the situation than you, and they would not trouble to keep you informed. Eventually you will get caught by the monster, and you will die a horrific death.<br/><br/>There are no heroes, there are no losers and winners, and there is no real ending... pretty much like in real life.<br/><br/>Besides that monsters aren't likely to appear, the only thing that seemed unreal to me was that Hud kept recording once the panic started.

","Most simply put, this movie is a combination of Blair Witch, War of the Worlds and Godzilla. It begins with the familiar concept (which is starting to become cliché) that the following events actually happened and video tapes were discovered. Then the audience start to watch the video tapes which are shot in the hand-held camera style (again, Blair Witch style). New York city is under attack but we don't get to see the attackers, this unknown element does bring some suspense to the story. Then we discover *spoiler* that it is a gigantic creature (kind of like Godzilla) from outer space that is attacking the city. That, in a nutshell, sums up the movie. Even though I didn't get bored and watched until the end, I don't think the movie offers anything original other than bringing good ideas from the past movies into one plot. Special effects look more impressive on film shot with hand-held camera style. This is the best part of the movie. Story is very basic and like I said nothing new about it.

"screenman","7","1","2","8 June 2010"," Not A Bad Effort
","Frequently compared with 'Blair Witch' as an amateur's movie legacy of terror at ground-zero, 'Cloverfield' comes with a much bigger budget. The scenario spiralling out of control presented from the uninformed 'everyman' perspective rather than that of the more traditional 'expert' was also attempted by Spielberg in his rather hammy, over-the-top borathon remake of 'War Of The Worlds'. Well; Cloverfield is considerably better.<br/><br/>The problem - for me, at least - is the lengthy scene-setting preamble. We are treated to a tiresome, hedonistic party of young people, getting highly sexed and pretty drunk, quibbling about their shallow little lives. On and on it goes, with the wobbly hand-cam making for a dizzying sensation. Can there ever be anything more boring than movies of other peoples' parties? For me, it was almost a turn-off.<br/><br/>However; for those who stay the course, when things liven-up, they are worth your patience. The wobbly-cam comes into its own. There are some truly excellent scenes of disaster, panic and general chaos, that I would have liked to have dwelt on for a little longer; a great deal of imagination and no little money must have gone into their creation. In the dark, the CGI joins are seldom evident. The main monster is enigmatic and imperfectly seen, which really works better than full-frontal. Late in the movie we do briefly come face-to-face with it in the park as it devours our cameraman, and I found the revelation disappointing - a bit of an anti-climax.<br/><br/>As well as the biggie, there's any number of small dog-sized terrors like shrimps or insects that are fast-movie and vicious. So it's not just a case of hiding in a doorway till the 'Godzilla' thing has blundered past.<br/><br/>There are plenty of taut little shocks. The set pieces - what can be seen of them - seem excellent.<br/><br/>But despite all of the positive technical issues, I come back to the old bugaboo: STORY. It's something that happens to people you are induced to care about. And once again; I wasn't persuaded to give a toss about any of the characters. They are the sort of shallow young brats that inhabit every gore-fest. Freddy Kruger's been dispatching them for years. You'll find 'em in 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'Wolf Creek' - where not? In fact I don't believe I saw a single character above the age of thirty-five. A better mix and more interesting relationships as well as more clearly defined and less stereotypic characters would have been a big plus, and this is where 2 of my stars were lost.<br/><br/>As a comparison, I found all of the characters in 'Pitch Black' rather fun, each had something to say, and I was sorry when the got axed.<br/><br/>Still; it's got plenty going for it in the effects, sets, and suspense department that are well worth a watch. There's just this rather unfortunate hole where STORY should have been. Some survived, some died. I think the monsters got killed. That's it."

","After coming out from seeing this movie me and a friend had a small debate about whether there would ever be a newly invented stylized genre of film, and if not will films always be pigeonholed in the same exhausted genres we constantly see rehashed now? I kept asking myself ""in a hundred years will audiences still be watching updated versions on the same old concepts?"" I was always taught, ""don't mess with genre"" and in today's market this regrettably holds true....<br/><br/>Obviously Cloverfield is a ""updated version"" in a classic film genre; the monster movie. Also obvious is how this bothers me, mostly because of the hype that was built around this film, or rather the viral marketing campaign that sent fanboys everywhere racing to their online message boards in nerdy excitement. Producer J.J Abrams sent the Internet in a tizzy (yeah I said tizzy) with clever viral marketing tactics, never hinting on what the film was actually about until the ominous teaser poster with a decapitated Statue of Liberty entitled ""1.18.08."" With this much mystery-laden buildup a big payoff was certainly expected, yet behind all of this hype was just another variation of yes, a monster movie. Now at this point you're either thinking I'm being cynical or I just have high expectations, but you'd be right because yeah, I am and I do.<br/><br/>See I was really rooting Cloverfield wouldn't just be another monster movie, that it be more clever, something no one has ever seen before. But maybe I'm just gonna have to just accept the fact that genre films will live a lot longer than I ever will and I should just get over it.... but not today friend, because, in fact, there really wasn't anything clever about this film at all, its basically Godzilla meets Blair Witch Project. The convention of telling the story in first person perspective through a shaky consumer camera was built for and attends to the iGeneration, and although commendable is still a cheap trick. However (and this is big however) under the guise of this marketing ploy, there is a really good film. The way the film's writer Drew Goddard establishes the lead characters in the first act is really involving, and I did actually kinda care for their outcome when the monster (eventually) attacks Manhattan.<br/><br/>As good as the movie's cinema verite style is there is still a lot of questionable motivation throughout the film (They all go back to where the monster is, really?) and you also really have to use your suspension of disbelief to believe some of the um, logistics (the handicam has night vision, a built in light, can record over an hour and a half of footage, and can survive a 100 foot drop?) But forgoing all my negativity (as you should), this film ultimately achieves its goal of allowing the audience to experience first hand what the characters are experiencing. And even if it's in a hackneyed monster movie genre, as a native New Yorker I was at the edge of my seat, eating up every second of it, call me cliché."
"goodfellas-foggetaboutit","5","1","2","8 March 2010"," Big monster, cool CGI, terrible plot..
","First of all, it's not scary. A monster 30 stories tall destroying Manhattan is supposed to be a scary deal. But ""Cloverfield"" sidesteps that challenge and opts for an easier way out. It makes it look cool. You'll watch this movie, go home, have dinner, go to sleep, wake up the next morning and go to work, and before you know, a whole lifetime will pass without your thinking about it for once. While watching, you might (might, j-u-s-t might) enjoy it, but there's nothing in this movie that you'll take home with you. Least of all a good scare.<br/><br/>The story? Have you seen ""Godzilla""? That's pretty much it. Huge monster comes out of the ocean and into Manhattan (oh no, not Manhattan again!), and goes on a building-tumbling rampage. Meanwhile, the military tries to bring it down with everything they've got (of course, to no avail). Throw into this your protagonists, who are caught in middle and are trying to escape, and there you have it! The use of shaky cams, however, brings a new perspective into films like these. Starting from the path-breaking ""Blair Witch Project"" to the recent ""Rec"", shaky cams have been used to create a sense of reality in movies, and thus, to intensify scares. The simultaneous use of hand-held camera and (extremely good) CGI is a rarity and works very, very well for this movie. Especially the scene of the carpet-bombing by the B-2 Spirit is really good. ""Cloverfield"" also follows (at least for the first half-hour) the trend of not showing the entity that creates the mayhem. After that the director realized this is not the kind of film where you don't show the creature, the creature IS your USP. So, out came Clover. Anyway, nice try.<br/><br/>Now let me come to the bad things. First, the (non-existent) script. Only one example will suffice. The plot line demands that the characters be trapped inside Manhattan. How to do that? Here's how – the main protagonist (Rob) must rescue his girlfriend who is trapped in her house. To do this, he (and three of his friends, who loyally follow him around) must get to the center of the town (ground zero for monster activity), climb to the 49th floor of a building that is slumped onto another building (physics be damned!), and rescue his girl who has been impaled by a steel rod through the chest! Seems believable? Hell, yeah! To add to this, the girl, shortly after being removed from the rod, does a 100 m sprint leaving her friends behind. You go girl! I know I'm supposed to suspend some disbelief. But this much?? And second, there's the acting. In a movie like this, there should be no ""acting"" (""Blair witch"" and ""Rec"" are perfect examples). But ""acting"" there is, and pretty dumb, too. Dialogues seemed non-spontaneous and scripted, expressions were often strained. If you want to make a movie ""realistic"", then a shaky cam is not enough. You have to have good ""non-actors"". This, it didn't have.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Cloverfield"" would pass for a single viewing. Nothing more. Don't expect too much, and you'll be fine."
"aesgaard41","2","1","2","18 December 2009"," Over-Hyped and Under-Appreciated
","For me, Cloverfield is a good movie, but it's just not scary to me. It was best by fast-forwarding through the monster scenes and watching the character sequences. The special effects are really well done, but a real creature at the size depicted would have collapsed under its weight. The movie itself has a very ""Blair Witch Project"" feel where you follow the characters, but you're not allowed to learn anything or are you allowed to learn anything. The brief scenes of the creature (or creatures?) is something like a bald ape, frog, grasshopper and tick; it's never seen in full form and that's what makes it really annoying. There's a lot of overdone devastation, but not enough plot. I'm just not terribly impressed by it."
"twentyfour_fps","7","1","2","5 December 2009"," Well done considering the concept
","I delayed watching Cloverfield because my 19-yr. old son told me it sucked. We both dread shaky-cam films, and he said Cloverfield takes the cake in nausea-inducing jitter. I finally watched the film, and was pleasantly surprised at not only the quality of the special effects, but at the producers' success in evoking a real sense of dread and horror. The Blair Witch style handy cam approach lends quite a bit of realism, and the destroyed city was portrayed to stunning effect. My guess is that all the negativity in many reviews of this film stem from the 16-24 yr. old demographic of viewers, who probably couldn't get past their emotional biases against the main characters in Cloverfield. Sure, the plot was simplistic, and the monster invincible and undefined...that's the hallmark of a truly frightening monster movie - mystery, the unknown. We fear most that which we don't understand. In summary, I think Cloverfield, even with the annoying shaky cam, manages to do something most horror films fail at - create a real sense of stark fear."

The plot was good, and we see a group of characters that are likable and relatable to try and escape a horrificbattack on New York. The slow revealing of the monster throughout the film, leading up to the creatures close-up towards the end of the film, was expertly performed. The handy-cam work provided a realness not many films include, and really makes you feel as if you are in the film, catching glimpses of the monster slowly throughout the entire film.

","Cloverfield is a hard movie to recommend, not because it's a bad movie, but because this is one of those movies that not everyone will like. Either you love it or you hate it, nothing in between.<br/><br/>People who don't like the movie basically list the following problems:<br/><br/>1. The camera-work was shaky.<br/><br/>It's true, but it only was a problem at the movie theater where the picture was very large. On a TV screen or computer, it isn't a problem. If you watch a lot of home videos, it becomes almost insignificant.<br/><br/>2. You didn't see the monster enough.<br/><br/>Hud, who'se never used a camcorder before, is logically not going to be able to record every second of the monster. Besides, you get a full-frame shot of the monster at the end.<br/><br/>3. The actors were horrible.<br/><br/>It's true that the actors do not play their characters like other actors do. That's because they play them as if their conversations were unplanned. People just aren't adjusted to how they act. I found them to talk much like how I talk to my friends.<br/><br/>4. Many scenes reminded people of 9/11.<br/><br/>This is mainly only a problem if you want it to be. While it's true that there are scenes including a building collapsing and a wall of dust rising from it and a set of towers leaning against each other, the filmmakers stated that it was a tribute to 9/11, not shock value.<br/><br/>As I said in #4, these problems are really only problems if you're looking for them. If you don't think about the movie to much, I think you'll like it just as much as I did."

","In Manhattan a party of well-wishers are ready to say goodbye to Rob who is departing to Japan after a successful promotion. That very evening a monstrosity is awoken from the ocean-depths who causes death and destruction in its wake. These events are all captured on film as those who survive seek to remain alive.<br/><br/>Cloverfield has obvious parallels to 'Godzilla'. However, what makes Cloverfield rather startling is its contemporary resonance with the terror attacks of this century. As one would of surmised, the whole film is through the lens of a camcorder, which is a clever device to really convey the fear of the unknown to the audience and indeed those actually their. This has an obvious implausibility in that it is unrealistic that any person would willingly hold a camcorder throughout the ordeal but if you can forget this, its rather thrilling. <br/><br/>The special effects are of the highest quality and the acting is really well-delivered. The running time is perfect, and it never lags. There are a few highly unlikely events, which are rather frustrating, and unfortunately bring my vote down. I can however appreciate that these events have an almost inevitable inclusion in the film to keep it flowing.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a good watch with thrills and high entertainment value, certainly worth the time to watch."

","Great movie. Please don't believe all the 'haters'. This is the most compelling and original fantasy/SF/action movie of 2008. For starters there isn't really a hero in this movie. You're just following a random group of 'victims' who have there own little adventure within the grand scope of the story. Which is refreshing. And of course some aspects of the movie aren't realistic, it's a bloody SF-movie! The monster is certainly the weirdest looking thing I've seen in a long time and this is a compliment!

"jason-210","8","1","2","25 January 2009"," Entertaining post-modern horror movie.
","This film is made using the hand-held amateur camera technique, a bit like the Blair Witch Project, but it's much easier to watch because instead of the incessant shouting and camera fumbling of the Blair Witch, this is calmer with more control. During first 15 minutes we are allowed to get to know the characters, and the world they live in. Occasionally, when camcorder stops, we see glimpses of another film made earlier, which the cameraman is recording over, which gives us an insight into the happy twenty-something lives of the main characters. <br/><br/>The horror, when it comes, is unknown. A bang, like an earthquake, a momentary power blackout, a confused newsflash. The cameraman and his friends react with a mixture of shock, curiosity and finally panic and fear, and you really feel like you are there with them. They wonder if it's a terrorist attack. In the next ten minutes, there are explosions, and a skyscraper collapses sending a cloud of dust billowing down the street between the apartments. It's a clearly a direct reference to images of 9/11. <br/><br/>After the initial sequences, the film moves at a very quick pace, with plenty of action and some very suspenseful moments. Along the way the film has just the right level of humour to add to its entertainment value, delivered to us in the form of comments from ""Hud"" the nerdy cameraman.<br/><br/>A central idea of the film – a big monster smashing up the city – is an obvious reference to Ishiro Honda's 1954 Japanese Godzilla movie, which featured a prehistoric creature that has been awakened from the sea by hydrogen bomb testing. If Godzilla was an allegory about nuclear war, and effects of nuclear war, then I think we can say that Cloverfield is an allegory of terrorist attack on cities. It certainly touches something in us when we see the scene with skyscraper collapsing and dazed people covered in dust looking for their families. In one part of the film a body on a stretcher is wheeled passed the camera with its stomach blown open – it made me think of suicide bombers, although it was at the same time a reference to the first Alien movie.<br/><br/>In this allegoric sense, the monster is a symbolic manifestation of our fear of terrorism, and the destruction terrorism can wreak in a city with a high population and so many buildings so close together. The inability of the US army to contain, to successfully stop the monster is also metaphorical, as are the ""bits"" that fall off it – there is no hiding place. This is an enemy that is largely created in the mind, and thus cannot be destroyed, rather like the monster in the 1950s sci-fi film ""The Forbidden Planet"". <br/><br/>I call the film post-modern because, on a deeper level, it has references to many earlier sources, such as Godzilla, to 9/11, Alien (when Marela's stomach explodes), Lovecraft (Dagon), and Forbidden Planet. If you look hard enough, you will also see that throughout the movie there are a wealth of small details that give clues about what will happen later, or that help us figure out what has happened, or just make us wonder. This suggests that the script and continuity in the movie are watertight.<br/><br/>I wish I'd seen it at the cinema."

","I remember when I first saw the trailer for this. There was no title for this film. I was anxious to view this film. Over a year and a half later, I finally got the chance. This is very good. It is filmed as if this movie is reality: a hand-held camera, unknown people screaming, etc.<br/><br/>The beginning is calm and peaceful. There is a party being held for Rob, the main character, because he is leaving for work in Japan. All the sudden, trembling begins and an oil tanker is capsized. It was caused by a gigantic, Godzilla-like monster. Now, NYC is being evacuated. But someone is trapped.....<br/><br/>The actors did a great job. Most of these actor are relatively unknown. I had the feeling that these actors were actually scared. Towards the end, there are great special effects. Also, the monster scared me. It looked like an ugly beast with the cross between Godzilla and an elephant.<br/><br/>I was disappointed about a few things. There was no music to add to the suspense and the camera was a little shaky at times.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an intense film that fans of horror movies will like. I rate this movie 9/10."

By the time I first saw it I knew, from previews and reviews, what to expect. My expectations weren't extremely high so I was really taken in by this excellent film. This is a director's film, and Matt Reeves really delivered. He created a sense of confusion, claustrophobia, panic and excitement in a clever, creative way. The cast created believable characters and a sense of reality. The comments that there was no character development are ridiculous as how do you develop character in a chaotic situation in an 80 minute, real-time film? I'd say the cast did a fine job of character development in a most limited time frame. What do you want, their entire lineage and biography? They showed they cared for each other. What a weak criticism. I should give a tip of the hat to the FX people for a job well done. I actually felt like New York was being destroyed by some strange other-worldly force and I think that was the film's goal. Well done!"

","I know a lot of people had problems with this movie because of the camera, saying it made them sick. They all decided, because they could not handle this, that the movie sucked. Most of these people couldn't make it through the whole movie. I watched the whole movie, and I rank it my second favorite movie after East of Eden. This is how every horror or thriller movie should be made. This was really just a better version of Godzilla in that the story was very personal and engaging. You felt like you were there, and were just as surprised and scared as all of the characters. The best part of this film was trying to figure it all out. When you watch movies like Godzilla or King Kong, they give you all the answers without making you think about it. But with Cloverfield, you have to keep your eyes open, you have to listen, and you have to put together all that you've seen and heard in order to figure out exactly what was going on. I know this is going to offend a lot of people, but I consider this movie to be a great work of art. And I am very picky about movies. I consider a lot of movies to range from crappy to so-so, so you can trust me about this one."

","I can see the up side of this movie, but to be honest I saw every side imaginable; the camera shakes wildly around like a caged tiger, and the actual story might seem better if I could actually observe it! There was not much that pleased me in this film, but the Woolworth Building's destruction seemed somewhat ironic. There is, of course, a monster - which might actually be very realistic and scary, if only I could see it for more than a few seconds! The film is basically a bunch of jumbled up ideas presented through a whirling camera - it certainly adds realism to the movie, don't get me wrong, but it's like watching a film for two hours on your phone. There are large amounts of crawling in around the city avoiding the monster, and if the camera does not make you sick this might do the trick; the relationships of the characters become the primary focus in the film, and the development between them is frankly awful. The film's use of CGI and VFX is brilliant, but provides little compensation for this slow-paced rather 'shaky' production."

","All right, shaky cameras do not make me nauseous. That's okay with me. And if there are some people out there who are just like me, then I tell them that Cloverfield is an extremely good movie. I went earlier this year, when it was still in theaters, with a friend who hates horror movies (I had to drag him with me) and even though he didn't want to go, he did come out with a smile on his face and told me for the next 20 minutes how he thought the movie was awesome. So much for not wanting to go. Seeing it on TV yesterday reminded me that I hadn't reviewed this movie yet. However, if you do not like shaky cameras, then you might want to stay away from this one. Like many people said, it resembles Blair Witch Project in many ways, so if BWP made you scared for the next couple of days after you saw it, then do not pick up this movie because it's almost as worst.<br/><br/>Story: The first 20 minutes were pretty calm, and that's okay with me because it introduced us to fun characters and new actors. They're setting up a surprise party for their friend Rob who is leaving for Japan to go work over there (for two years, if I remember). So people are enjoying themselves and all until all the lights shut down. The people get out, only to find the head of the Statue of Liberty being thrown in their direction. Something has found us (like the poster says) and it's clear that he/she doesn't like us at all.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the way the movie was filmed, as if you were a part of the movie, however what I didn't like was the fact that the movie focuses almost only on the adventure itself and not really into character development. Even though the actors were pretty good, I'm not sure any of them will get an Oscar nomination because we barely see any of them clearly. Oh, and compared to a lot of people, I enjoyed the apocalyptic ending with everyone dying. Unless you hate BWP or shaky cameras, then don't forget to pick this intense movie up."

","Putting audiences right in the middle of the action is what many thrillers try to do. Many succeed, many do not, but what is true that ""Cloverfield"" succeeds tremendously. The hand-held camera gimmick and pseudo-documentary, that has been around since at least the infamous film ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and greatly popularized by ""The Blair Witch Project,"" is given a new genre - the monster disaster film, a la ""Godzilla."" The Hollywood version of ""Godzilla"" even took place in Manhattan just like this film, which also includes massive destruction to large parts of the city. Some of it is eerily similar to 9/11 as dust from collapsing buildings floods down a street engulfing fleeing people.<br/><br/>The difference here is that ""Cloverfield"" isn't about awing audiences with tremendous special effects, but locking them into a thrilling point of view. Think of it like a roller-coaster; once it gets going it is fast paced with many things being just a blur, but the end experience leaves you breathless. That invites multiple viewings to see what might have been missed first time around, because once the main part starts ""Cloverfield"" is remarkably tense. The cinematography evokes that frenetic action of a helpless person running with a camcorder amidst destruction, but it is very well done and a careful viewing reveals more than might have been originally thought in all that blur and shake. The sound is also great. There is a possibility that it sticks out due to the shaky visuals and thus a viewer is forced to listen more carefully to get information, but when a film encourages its viewers to more closely inspect its details, rather than spoon-feeding it outright, can only be a good thing.<br/><br/>ASIDE: it remains amusing that a standard camcorder can record so well after going through so much punishment!<br/><br/>All in all, the dramatic aspects of the film aren't that original and thus the film is ultimately something that has been done before. However, it hasn't been done in this manner and that alone makes this a cinematic ride well worth taking. --- 8/10<br/><br/>BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- terror/violence"

It is amazing what you can do with computers... All you need is imagination. You always can go as far as you can imagine. Forget Godzilla or The hostel.

","The filmmakers effect of course is that as you watch the handy cam footage, you experience what the protagonists experience.<br/><br/>The core of the story is the first bit of video with ""Rob"" and ""Beth"" - Two new, non-familiar non-Hollywood faces, faces you will meet at any party like the party ""Hud"" was filming. Well, not like that particular party.<br/><br/>But it takes an invasion by some unknown thing to tell the tale. It also takes the side-story about a Rave-Gone-Bad, which started to go bad the moment ""Hud"" got the camera. Personally, I would have killed ""Hud"" at the start of the film, but we needed Hud to lug the Camera around.<br/><br/>This film uses the Hitchcock-ian method of filming with almost NO CUTS as in ""Rope"" and ""Under Capricorn"" - But with the added Handy-Cam kind of footage- This brings the film into an incredible level of first-person experience... Because WE become Hud as Hud films the events of the evening- So we see what Hud sees, and also what the camera sees.<br/><br/>At first viewing, we have no initial idea what is happening, no warning, and we are not sure until we see a huge TAIL. And we have not a clue as to why the heads of Statues of Liberties are being flung as if they were crumpled aluminum foil projectiles, and we are teased like that all through the film, a lot of things we see are not really explained. Matt Reeves builds the picture, step by step, and to great effect.<br/><br/>But what it comes down to... THIS is probably the GREATEST Monster Movie made in 25 years, not since the Original Alien- As Alien had the Chest Burster scene, this film has...<br/><br/>Never mind what it has. I won't tell you, you have to SEE it- New York City has NEVER been Tokyo-Trashed like THIS... And while Tokyo has Godzilla, New York has Clover!"

","Let's face it. The idea of a movie about a monster attack in New York City seems like an idea that has been used over and over again that people don't want to see this sort of thing ever again. But Cloverfield manages to overcome this. How? <br/><br/>Well it uses the hand held camera technique. Then it places you right in the centre of the action by having the camera being held by one of the characters. Plus the camera being used is a typical everyday-use hand held camcorder. These factors really make this movie exciting and intense. I remember seeing this movie in the cinema and I was really on the edge of my seat while watching it. The tension really is maintained throughout.<br/><br/>The final result is absolutely pleasing."

","Imagine you're documenting a friend's farewell party with a camcorder, and suddenly the earth shook, a blackout, explosions, and something huge is attacking your city. So you run with your friends to safety, all the while, recording everything on the camcorder. Scary. Cool.<br/><br/>I liked the concept from the first time I saw the trailer. Surely, a giant monster flick told from a survivor's side has been done in War of The Worlds (2005), but Cloverfield dared to go on a step further with the story being told by a survivor's camcorder. It is just so interesting because it gives a different feel of reality. Be warned though, the camcorder-amateur style shots may be dizzying in the beginning but you'll get used to it if you agree to accept the whole concept.<br/><br/>Surely people will say that it's a marriage between Blairwitch and Godzilla, and yes it can be an appropriate simplified description of Cloverfield. Some will definitely be disappointed by the story, there's really nothing too new there. In fact, a lot of clichés are used. But I'm not complaining on clichés because it's already a different approach. Godzilla told from the view of a survivor who recorded everything on his camcorder. It's a fresh new approach to monster movies, and surely inspires imaginations.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that in many scenes you can really feel that the movie tried too hard to hide the monster. There are some occasions where it cuts away just way too early only so that you'll be curious of what exactly is going on. There are times that, I think, even when you're scared, you'd still try to get a shot of the monster and record anything informative. A huge giant monster is attacking your city, and you barely try to get its picture? Why bother with the camcorder then, just ditch it and run for your life! But that's okay, I still totally enjoyed the movie. Besides, perhaps the writers already prepared the reason, ""because the character documenting everything is kinda dumb"". If we simply try to be a simple audience and not a critic, I think Cloverfield is the closest thing to 'realistic' as any monster flick can get. It just feels more real because of the whole ""survivor's camcorder"" concept."
"pninson","4","1","2","20 July 2008"," It Almost Works
","The first 17 minutes of this movie are excruciatingly dull. After the first three minutes I was leafing through a magazine (I rented this, of course). There's a long party scene, but this is no GODFATHER or DEER HUNTER. A group of 20-somethings are holding a going-away party for a friend, and there's interminable footage of people gossiping and behaving normally. This is as interesting as watching your coat hang on the wall.<br/><br/>Finally, there's a big boom, and the action starts. The gimmick is that the guy videotaping the party keeps the video going, even when he's running for his life. Not only is this hard to swallow, but the camera zooms all over the place, or sits tilted to one side. The idea is obviously a gonzo monster movie, a you-are-there cross between GODZILLA and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.<br/><br/>There are moments when this comes off, or almost comes off. You don't get a very good luck at the monster, or the little monsters that it generates. Nothing is explained, which I consider a plus; since none of the characters know what's happening, the audience doesn't need to know either. We're supposed to share in the characters' confusion and panic.<br/><br/>The reason it doesn't really work is that the characters are bland and vapid, the cinema verité effect of the wildly gyrating camera is more annoying than anything else, and there's nothing original in the script or the plot. It's routine fare.<br/><br/>It's OK for killing 90 minutes on a slow afternoon, but I have a lot of sympathy for anyone who managed to sit through this in a theater. This is definitely rental fodder."

","Okay I had very high expectations for Cloverfield. I found out that JJ Abrams was doing a secret project and couldn't wait to see the trailer. And once you saw the Statue of Liberty's head get chopped off and land in the middle of the street - you know you are in for a treat. The ""blair-witch project"" camera view was annoying at times. And at times I was rather amused that the ""camera-man"" kept holding it up no matter what, which drew away a sense of realism. Although most characters were quite undeveloped, you got drawn to like them, feel for them and with a big LCD/Plasma TV you'll be submerged into this Hell. Overall it's a story of love and courage and friendship with a big bad ""some thing"" in it. The fresh take on the genre was refreshing and it deserved 10* for that, however in the end the movie is slightly underdeveloped with an abrupt end and the fact that camera is indestructible take the 2 stars away.<br/><br/>Well worth a watch, I recommend everyone buys it on DVD.

"agelshaxe","9","1","2","30 June 2008"," Intense and Thrilling
","After long months of clues scattered about the internet, teaser trailers for a nameless film about the decapitation of the statue of liberty and viral sites, Cloverfield was upon us : a movie that thrills, chills, terrifies and leaves you with a pounding heart and a gaping mouth...<br/><br/>I have heard some say that the video camera-style filming made a lot of people dizzy at the theater. I couldn't say so myself as I saw the film on DVD. My personal viewing of the film on a small screen added a little to the feeling that the movie was a Youtube-Clip or something like that which felt pretty cool.<br/><br/>Being a relatively short film, Cloverfield doesn't wait too long to plunge you deep into a cataclysmic event that plunges Manhattan into chaos. The special effects--which are fantastically rendered despite the ever-shaking camera--are oftentimes frighteningly believable and dump you straight into the event which makes you feel like your part of the crowd; a feeling that is as exhilarating as it is terrifying. The actors' screams of terror and traumatized expressions are good enough to add to the experience, though some of the dialogs during the quieter moments do sometimes feel a little off, especially those of the too-talkative cameraman.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is an exciting film with a core idea that brilliantly succeeds: you really feel like your seeing an apocalyptic event take place. If not for the story, which--in the end--only plays a secondary part, you should definitely watch this film if you're searching for a high-intensity thrill-ride of a movie!"
"dermottferry","8","1","2","27 June 2008"," a film for those with an imagination.......
","Do you like films with realistic story lines where everything is sorted at the end? If you do, then DON'T see Cloverfield. If you like films that take your breath away and have you talking about it for weeks after, then DO see Cloverfield. I, for one, thought that this was one of the best movies I had seen in a long time. It's so easy to get bored with a film and lose interest in it these days. This doesn't happen in Cloverfield (well, after the first twenty minutes anyway).<br/><br/>The film is all filmed hand-held. The last time that happened with good results with 'The Blair Witch Project'. It opens with the two main characters Rob and Beth enjoying a fun day. It then skips to a going away party for Rob a few months after. Rob is going to Japan as part of a job promotion. But whats dominating his thoughts that night is the fact that the love of his life Beth is now with somebody else. So while Robs best friend Hud is having people record going away messages for Rob, Rob and Beth are arguing which leads to Beth leaving the party.<br/><br/>I know it sounds all very Dawsons Creek, but bear with it. Out of nowhere, the party is interrupted by a bang and the lights go out. Everyone is a little bit shaken up but appear to calm down after the media reports it as a 'small earth quake'. Then the Statue of Liberty's head is knocked down the street and the whole City is faced with something they never thought possible.<br/><br/>This is when the adrenaline begins to rise. You will watch Rob's, Beth's, Marlena's and Hud's search for safety as if you were there with them. It's an edge of your seat thrill ride that you wont be able to take your eyes off.<br/><br/>In the months leading up to the release of Cloverfield, director JJ Abrahams of 'Lost' fame released many a teaser without giving too much away. What a stroke of genius. It all added to the mystery of the movie and was the perfect way to advertise it.<br/><br/>The tag line reads- 'Some Thing has Found Us'- yes it certainly has. A fresh new type of movie that I loved."

"alphawoolf2001","5","1","2","11 June 2008"," An interesting failure
","Certainly this is the most ""realistic"" giant monster movie I've seen attempted yet. It takes the matter-of-fact intensity of the Shibuya district sequence from ""Gamera 3"" and expands that into the better part of an entire film. In that respect it's quite impressive. But unfortunately even the spectacle of the monster attack scenes is scaled down to the events of a home movie. Realism doesn't necessarily make a better monster movie.<br/><br/>Please note the viral marketing campaign I've read about here on IMDb completely missed me. I suppose that might have gotten me worked up a bit more before seeing the film, but ultimately it must stand on its own apart from whatever clever advertising is devised. The ""Blair Witch"" documentary style of filming was a bit to get used to, since I was not expecting this. And the biggest flaw of ""Blair Witch"" reappears here - whiny, obnoxious characters that just never shut up. I had no real stake in seeing whether these people survived or not. And since the film makers here take a tip from Spielberg's ""Jaws"" and dole out appearances of the creature sparingly, most of the film is watching these people.<br/><br/>Ultimately it's less of a traditional giant monster movie and more of a conventional Hollywood thrill ride movie that just happens to revolve around a giant creature. It's good for one viewing but I have no interest in seeing it again.<br/><br/>P.S. And man, what an ugly monster. I'm not talking cool ugly, I'm talking ugly ugly. Sorta like Harryhausen's Ymir meets Star Wars' Rankor, done ugly."

","After seeing the trailer and hearing the initial wave of so-so reviews, this movie seemed sure to be a disappointment. Also, one had to wonder if the ""top secret"" promotion of the film prior to its release was just the studio's marketing department trying to disguise a poor film as long as possible.<br/><br/>Gladly, none of my fears were realized. Cloverfield lived up to the hype. The plot involves the documentation of a Godzilla-like attack on NYC, shown with realism through a hand-held video camera. Many have said it's Blair Witch meets Godzilla. That seems a bit of an over-simplification, but works as a good basic description. The challenge of depicting a large-scale action/disaster/sci-fi movie through the tiny lens of a video camera is daunting, but executed quite well here. Many will question plot elements and say, ""Well, a hand-held camera can't... Why wouldn't you drop the camera when... The camera would break if..."". Yes, a certain suspension of disbelief is necessary for the home-video concept to work. That's why it's a film and not reality.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Cloverfield doesn't bring much original to the monster-movie genre in terms of special effects, plot or character development. Despite this, the hand-held camera realism is enough to make it unique and well worth watching."
"HeyYoAdrian","5","1","2","9 June 2008"," I did not like it much, but I hope they make several sequels.
","We need more good monsters. Particuallarly we need our own Godzilla. I don't care what kind of B'ish movies they come from. This monster was pretty good. <br/><br/>There was something in the extras on the DVD that suggested that it may have just been an offspring of something larger. It was just a very faint hint from the designer of the thing who made some kind of comment about being told to pursue a look as if it were confused and under attack not knowing what to do. Being a giant monster it did it's thing. I don't think they set us up to feel sorry for it or anything.<br/><br/>I hope there are sequels because there are so many questions to be answered about the monster (and so many opportunities to make a better movie): Will the monster ever garner a name? (Shavezilla, MickyMonster, Notzilla) Will it grow hair? Was it one of a kind or are there more? Where has it been all this time? 'Some Thing Has Found Us' Found us? Why was it so angry?

"sashank_kini-1","9","1","2","9 June 2008"," Its still alive!
","The movie is still alive in my memory as its surely one of the most, enthralling, fast-paced, action-packed, deadly and sadistic film. I call it sadistic because the director lets no one live. I loved the film thoroughly, though the staring was a bit dull and gloomy. But then, all of it happened so suddenly that I was left glued to my couch. How I wish I could have seen it in the theater! Still, even on the television, its really intense.<br/><br/>Firstly, I thought that it is a B-movie. There are fresh face actors, who don't look so experienced. A monster attack causes a catastrophe in the city. The plot might sound B-grade but the execution is absolutely great.<br/><br/>The shaky camera made me a bit woozy for a while but then, I found it okay. Just one question: Who records something when his life is in grave peril? If an attack really happened, the first thing I'd do is to drop the video camera. But here, the shaky camera made it even more intense.<br/><br/>The actors do a fine job. They are scared when they are supposed to be, the shock and the fear can be clearly seen on their faces. Therefore, I was glad not to find any big names as this cast was perfect. I just was a bit irked by the main character, Rob. He was a bit arrogant with everyone many of the times. I preferred Hud's acting the most and was feeling bad when he perished. He had a bit of humor in him when the whole world was in a drastic situation. I especially liked when he started talking anything out of the hat, without realizing that it wasn't the time to talk rubbish. They didn't tell anything about Lily too. I liked her acting too.<br/><br/>There were a lot many things that I didn't notice as first, like how the monster landed on earth. Then I realized why they were showing the clips of the main characters to the island. <br/><br/>I also was surprised by the abrupt end. It was a good end but not satisfying. I so wished that the monster was killed. The action scenes were brutal, especially the way people were killed. I loved the gory deaths, especially of Marlena's . It was wicked and disturbing, yet excellent. The director showed no mercy for any of the characters.<br/><br/>If you like some action packed movie that is brutal, wicked, unforgiving, sadistic, merciless and ruthless, then Cloverfield is just for you. Enjoy! 9 out of 10."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","8 June 2008"," The most intense Monster film I have ever seen!
","I just saw Cloverfield, and I will start off by saying that it is the most intense thrill ride you will ever have. It is not just a thrill ride, the screenplay is well written. The screenplay allows the film to work, but of course, the real beauty is the amazing direction and camera work. Yes, the shaky camera has been used before, but never this intense, and never in this way. The film begins with certain people filming, and then a guy filming in his best friend's going-away party. Of course, the camera work at the party is also amazing and well done. It allows us to reflect on the characters, characters that we will have to follow through this hard day. The main deal is that Rob, who is the one going away, had a relationship with his friend Beth, and in the middle of the party, the lights in Manhattan and New York City go out. Well, basically a huge creature is in the city, and is causing destruction. The shaky camera allows us to experience everything as crazy and chaotic as the characters themselves. The camera makes us feel just as nervous, and that is why this film works so well.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie, is actually, very good and realistic. Every single actor you would totally concentrate on. I thoughts that Michael Stahl-David as Rob was great. Lizzy Caplan(who i love from mean Girls) also did a nice job. The sound effects, and the film editing, when there is some, based on the camera work is freaking amazing. I actually think that The Academy should try to recognize and honor this film's achievements. I mean, it is about time these kind of films are honored, for its effects in whole. The special effects are fantastic and flawless. The film was under a budget of $30 million, and even like that, it had as great visual effects as Iron Man. I think the Academy SHOULD honor this.<br/><br/>Overall, this, for what it is, is a pure golden action film. yes, some people will hate the shaky camera, but it is just amazing. Some people will also hate the ending, but dang, I was glad it did not follow other types of action films(where the man characters ALWAYS survive, or that the evil is ALWAYS killed). This is a science-fiction film, about the unknown, and I think films like this tell us what other things could be out there, and when we can be attacked... This is the best film of 2008, it beats Iron Man, and it is probably the best Monster film of the decade, or even in history..."

","I just watched Cloverfield and i must say, it left me in shock. the whole feel of dread and fear was so apparent that it felt like you were in the middle of hell. yes the camera can get annoying at times but that makes the movie feel that much more real. and from the all the things i heard people complain about, i personally felt the camera was not as shaky as people said, yes it was when they were running like hell from the monster but that kind of makes sense. the special effects were spectacular and the actors did feel really believable and real. the only thing that i will agree with is that it was a very short movie not even a full 90 mins but thats OK because you are probably not even watching the time because it flies by so quickly. and the only thing that bothered me is that the movie really does not answer any questions but i guess that was what the directors were going for, and the whole fact that the video camera survived a nuclear bomb did not make any sense but thats OK because if it didn't we would never of had this movie. and i went into this movie with a completely open mind and it did not let me down, check this movie out."

","The trailer was amazing, the buzz was huge, the end result is admirable. Cloverfield isn't without its flaws however and there are some massive plot holes but such cant dull down the sheer voracity of the film. Blaring with sound and visuals make Cloverfield an utterly surreal experience. It's more like a roller-coaster than movie. Taking you on a momentous journey that differs from the underground to towering skyscrapers. The truth is that Cloverfield is always enjoyable. There is not one moment throughout that you won't be balancing on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The realism displayed throughout the film mainly comes from the was its been shot. The shaky camera technique last seen in The Blair Witch Project allows full exploration of New York after An alien attack with no exceptions. This is free form film making at its very best. A few questions do come up during the movie. For example the perplexing condition known as the virus that pops up for a brief moment but is never fully explained and I'm sure it will make for an interesting premise for the inescapable sequel. Still when the thing that should be festering in your mind is the high octane and brilliantly relentless action, you'll find that the unexplained infection keeps on coming back to you. It's also a shame that the trailer for Cloverfield is substantially scarier than the final result. Those who were expecting an adrenalin filled experience will be pleased those expecting a sophisticated horror won't.<br/><br/>There's also the small matter of a rather unsatisfying third act. Sure the film does need to calm down eventually but the ending is worryingly abrupt. I hear critics complain about the wafer thin plot, sure I'm not denying that but clearly those very critics have never seen a B-movie before. The wafer thin plot simply allows for more action sequences, a good thing if you ask me. And you're reading my review so ill assume you are.<br/><br/>Producer J.J. Abrams teams with writer Drew Goddard and director Matt Reeves for this frenetic tale of a powerful destructive force that descends upon New York City, and the four desperate survivors who put their lives on the line to embark on a perilous rescue mission.<br/><br/>As for our beastie, no signs of CGI suffocation that the far inferior I am Legend suffered from, and what makes it even better is our monster is truly frightening. The very symbolism of 21st Century apocalyptic nature. Don't be fooled by the overlong and often boring opening in. It will start soon enough. And with a rather short 87 minutes you'll wonder how it packed so much action into such a short space of time.<br/><br/>A surreal, tense but most of all relentless cinematic experience. Following in the footsteps of The Blair Witch Project allowing far more freedom to explore the sheer devastation of New York after an alien invasion. Some questions are left unanswered but noting too major witch means you can get on and enjoy the film"

"no_persona_here","9","1","2","5 June 2008"," A gripping and surprisingly immersing movie.
","Cloverfield is one of those rare films that takes one type of movie formula and puts a unique spin on the whole experience. In Cloverfield's case, the unique spin is in the film's presentation and perspective. The film, which centers around a group of young adults trying to survive a monster's rampage throughout New York City, is told through a first-person, or documentary-style, perspective (think of films like 'Blair Witch Project). This might sound a bit stupid to some people, and some will find this film to be stupid, but for me and many others the doc-style perspective really draws you into the film like the way something like, say, Star Wars did when you were little. The survivors struggle throughout the movie seems a whole lot more realist thanks to the perspective.<br/><br/>To be honest, the doc-style perspective will either make or break this movie for you. Given that the younger generation of people will probably embrace this film given that this type of presentation is familiar to them, people used to tradition prespectives might have a hard time getting into this film.<br/><br/>While some might disagree, I believe that if Cloverfield decided to go with the traditional methods and stuck to old-style camera technique's, this film would have nothing going for it. The movie's story won't win any awards for originality, and the monster didn't exhibit any qualities we haven't seen before (that is, if you've seen movies like Godzilla, Aliens, The Thing, you get the idea). If this was just any other sci-fi 'monster on the lose' film made from by-the-book rules, you probably wouldn't have heard about this movie The main focus of the film is drawing you into the experiences of the characters. The acting in the film is quite good, and the choice to go with no-name actors was a no-brainer. Whenever something happens to a character, it strikes a cord like no other film has done in a long time.<br/><br/>One thing about this movie is that it dose not pack a whole lot of power on a small screen. I had the privilege of watch this film on a huge T.V. screen on DVD with a few of my friends, but after watching this film, I started to wonder whether or not this film would have been as good if I had saw it by myself on a small screen by myself.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is something to behold. Even though the movie by itself lacks a lot of originality, the documentary style perspective really draws you in and makes all the movie's used elements seem serious and engaging. Just be sure to watch it with a group of friends on a large screen."

But sandwiching the the story about the new job in Japan (a wink to the inspiration perhaps?) and the potential romances added flair. And the Coney Island scenes on the tape was a nice touch too.<br/><br/>Did anyone see the object fall into the ocean earlier? While the creature was never explained, this gave us a slight hint. It also ended the way more films should, with a sudden open stop.<br/><br/>Best scare was the creatures face suddenly charging out of the smoke caused by the bombing run and grabbing the chopper.

","User 'bumbletbw' described the movie perfectly thinning it down to its purest element: garbage. After hearing some good vibe about this movie, I rented it to find a story barely worthy to dethrone a PBS Masterpiece Theater midnight showing. Let me start off by stating that I traditionally like these types of movies: I liked Blairwitch, Signs, and Jackass. These movies all had something that CF did not, namely: an honest script, logical plot flow and an interesting story. Maybe the best way to describe this movie is to ask rhetorical questions. Why didn't any of the camera shots remotely scare me? Why did I feel like the hand-held camera was sometimes substituted as the narrator and not treated like a physical object? Why did the film not look as though it was filmed with a hand-held camera? I was willing to give this movie some narrative slack in exchange for a few suspenseful minutes, but it reneged on the deal. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. Before you rent it, see what is on 'Nick at Night' first. I'll admit that it would have been better on the big screen. That's why I gave it 2 stars."
"daniel-1384","2","1","2","27 May 2008"," Definitely on my bottom-10-list
","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Since there's no sight of the monster throughout the entire movie, except for 2 seconds, the special effects are basically limited to a bunch of explosions. So, considering that what's used to make the movie is basically one handy cam (WITHOUT steady shot...)and a lot of gasoline, and that the ""plot"" (haha) consists of running around with that handy cam in the middle of the night, screaming, (hence no need for a writer, more money saved) the budget shouldn't have exceeded $2000.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really like monster movies, even bad ones, but I have a couple of basic demands, one of them being an actual plot, so this one doesn't qualify. But don't take my word for it, see for yourselves, just don't pay a dime to see it."

","I was so excited to see this movie, it looked so cool. It wasn't. It was seriously Godzilla meets Blair Witch with unbelievable characters (didn't care if they lived or died), the monsters were hardly explored enough to give us reason to care about them, and the script was incredibly lame. I was looking forward to everyone's deaths just so that the movie would end. I guess some of the cgi was impressive but it got lost in the plot holes and ever continuing torture. This movie probably wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't had my hopes up so much by the hype it received.

","This was an OK movie. It definitely wasn't worth buying. Maybe a good watch on a rainy day with nothing else to watch. The way over use of the shaky home video camera really ruined the story line for me. And I lost my interest after the first 30 minutes because of it. The actors did a good job in holding their own. I do have to say that at least Blair Witch Project was a little more interesting in story wise as well as the over use of the shaky video camera. The plot for Cloverfield was really nothing knew or out of the ordinary. It hit closer as a ""B"" movie. The Alternate endings were just as boring as the original ending of the movie. Better luck next time."

","I don't have much to say about this movie as it left me a little speechless. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen because it was so original. I've never seen anything like it. Nothing about this movie disappointed me. Even seeing the monster's face up close at the end was good, usually you are bummed out because you expected something so much more. The lack of a soundtrack is absolutely haunting but there are plenty of impressive and scary sound effects. This movie has it all:<br/><br/>Originality: check Superb special effects: check Great story: check Good love story: check Not too much love story, for the guys: check Blood and gore but leaving much to the imagination: check<br/><br/>Don't expect a happy ending with this movie.

"rg_duke","5","1","2","17 May 2008"," Don't demand too much and you'll be entertained
","This is not an awful movie; it just isn't all that good either. I was ignorant of all the hype preceding its opening and had not watched an episode of ""Lost"" since the first season.<br/><br/>So, I came into the movie expecting nothing more than a mildly scary horror film (PG-13 rating) executed with some novelty.<br/><br/>On that level I was entertained. All these sorts of movies require the human characters to make grotesquely bad decisions in order to relentlessly expose themselves to the main character: the monster. I didn't mind the obvious stupid errors: the ""heart throb"" not only survives being impaled on a piece of rebar, but then runs all over Manhattan and absorbs frantic hugs from her man. I didn't even feel cheated by the lack of story telling. The movie does nothing at all to explain those things that attacked our ""heroes"" in the subway tunnel. The movie does nothing at all to explain its ending, both endings. Did they die? What fell in the sea? I was mildly entertained for an hour and half and that was all I asked from this film.<br/><br/>But, when the credits rolled I realized that the movie had never winked at me. Was I supposed to take all this fluff seriously? Was it supposed to an American Godzilla, an allegory of 9/11? Then, why waste almost twenty minutes setting up normalcy before things go crazy when Mr. Spielberg used half the time and been twice as convincing with E.T.? So, just watch and don't ask too many questions. You'll have some minor fun. Which is exactly the definition of the average film of any genre."
"mtn","7","1","2","3 May 2008"," well-done and absorbing
","If we start with the asumption that this is an entertainment, a pleasant and aborbing way to spent about 2 hours, Cloverfield succeeds brilliantly.<br/><br/>There is even some connection with the characters--and this is good, since the monster is seldom in full view, but its constant threat permeates the reality of the character.s.<br/><br/>One very interesti0ng aspect of the film is that it is so generationally biased. The group of characters are young professionals in their 20s-30s, and they are the terminally hip and self-absorbed Gen Y stereo types. Very inane and self-centered.<br/><br/>However, when the crisis comes, some of these characters grow to face the challenge, and they do so in a believable and positive way.<br/><br/>There are fairly major logical incongruities that are not merely nit-picking. For example, at one point, in view from a helicopter taking the main characters to safety, the monster shambles well below the POV. Perhaps 1000 feet below.<br/><br/>The monster is bombed by a B-2, and in the ensuing dust we are led to think that maybe--just maybe--this may have destroyed or injured the monster.<br/><br/>But no! The monster's jaws leap from the dust cloud to pluck the helicopter, previously far, far above any height that the creature could have reached from any previous indication of size, or even leaping ability. And the *reason* that this is written into the script, as far as I can tell, is to keep the POV in contact with the monster, for it the helicopter had gotten away, that would be the end of the video POV.<br/><br/>But all in all, it was very good, indeed!"
"bakerunion","3","1","2","2 May 2008"," very tedious and not worth the effort to watch it
","Although the use of the hand-held camera is annoying, the real problem with it is that it becomes the focal point of the whole movie and so the drama is lost in the technique. The characters are uninteresting, if not annoying in their own right, and that creates two more problems. First, you don't care about them or what they are doing; and second, they fill up most of the movie time and the purposeful glimpses of the monsters and other special effects/action moments are very limited. I kept watching the clock timer on the DVD to see when the movie would end. Those who are hoping for a Godzilla in New York kind of movie will find only the hint of it in this effort."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","1","2","27 April 2008"," Watch that last shot again
","I awaited Cloverfield with almost wild anticipation. Sadly, it was released in theaters about two days before I had to go back to China (I was home in California visiting family for the winter holidays), and I didn't have time to see it before I had to leave. It would have been nice to see it on the big screen (this alleged ""motion sickness"" has never affected me in the least, either here or in the similarly photographed Blair Witch Project), but even on pirated Chinese DVDs the movie looks pretty good. <br/><br/>Given that so much of the monster portion of the movie passes without us ever really learning much about the monster, it's odd that the beginning of the movie, which is just a personal home video taken by some friends to congratulate someone on getting married, seems like it goes on about five times longer than it should. Maybe that's because for much of that part of the movie, there seems to be developing a very involved romantic drama which will become meaningless within a few minutes. Of course, it doesn't become entirely meaningless, only about half of it does. In fact, I should mention that, for a romantic subplot squeezed into a monster movie, this one actually works quite well. I hope Bruckheimer is taking notes.<br/><br/>At any rate, it is well known that the Statue of Liberty does not fare well in the movie. One of the original teaser trailers famously showed the statue's head being thrown down a New York City street, and they really should have left it at that. In the movie, they don't know how to have people react to such an occurrence. As soon as the head comes to rest, a lot of people gather around it like mindless zombies, snapping photos of it with their cell phones. Evidently these people are so brainwashed by technology that they are more concerned about e-mailing these amazing photos to all their buddies than they are in what exactly threw that head. Personally, I like to think that I'd be amazed if such a thing happened, but for at least the following few seconds, I would be more concerned about where the head came from!<br/><br/>Once the movie gets going, however, it never lets up. The monster is a brilliant creation of digital effects, which detract from movies far more often than they add. Th CGI is spectacular in this movie, and that is not a comment that I make often! In the extra features on the DVD, there is a lot of talk about presenting the monster not as an angry beast bent on destroying, but as something like a frightened infant fighting for it's survival. A scared baby monster (one as massive and frightening as this one) being injured and not knowing why is definitely a force to be reckoned with, although there is nothing in the movie to let us know any of that. For all we can see, it's just an angry beast bent on destroying. <br/><br/>The only major drawback of the movie is the bonehead holding the camera. Another idea mentioned in the extra features on the DVD is that the movie originally came about as an effort to create America's own movie monster, given that Godzilla, so many decades after its debut, is still a major part of Japanese pop culture. Sadly, this guy ""Hud"" (which stands for Heads-Up Display, not Humanoid Underground Dwellers, but good guess) strikes me as the results of an effort to create the most idiotic, dumbed-down American caricature possible. Here's a bit of sample dialogue:<br/><br/>Hud: ""What time does the chopper take off?"" <br/><br/>Rob: ""0600."" <br/><br/>Hud: ""Uh, what time is that?"" <br/><br/>Rob: ""6am!""<br/><br/>Hud: ""Oh, yeah. I knew that.""<br/><br/>Good thinking, moron. Way to represent the homeland. I live in the heart of Communist China, and I feel I should tell you that, especially with all of the controversy about American protests about Tibet and the Beijing Olympics, many people in the world have much difficulty differentiating between the American people and, say, their government, or their movies. <br/><br/>One of the main difficulties that the movie has to overcome, however, is why this Hud would go on holding a video camera while his whole world was being destroyed around him. He was reluctant to take on the job of filming at the beginning of the movie, so it's strange sometimes that he always holds on to it and always points it at what needs to be seen. But surprisingly, this never really seems like a problem to me. Sometimes we have to wonder why he's holding it, like when he climbs onto the roof of a high-rise apartment building which is leaning precariously on the building across the street, but they make excellent use of broken clips, and cuts back to what was originally on the tape, to show times when Hud stopped filming and then started again later.<br/><br/>I think many people will be put off by the fact that so little is actually learned about the monster, but I think this might be the film's strongest point. First of all, the movie is left wide open for a sequel, not the least reason for which is because the entire movie consists of a single DV tape that the government found at the ""former location of Central Park."" Think of how many other tapes might be found and made into more movies! <br/><br/>But most of all, pay special attention to the right side of the screen in the very last shot of the movie, which looks out over the ocean. In my opinion, that's all we really need to know"

","OK so I was in the mood for a monster flick tonight, and Cloverfield did it's job in keeping me somewhat entertained throughout.<br/><br/>The beginning is SLOW .. so be prepared for that. It's also really not exceptional in my opinion because it tries too hard to be scary without being over the top. Normally this is a good thing, but for me it was sub par, this movie could have used a little over the top. The characters are believable 90% of the time so that's a good thing.<br/><br/>All in all I wasn't mad for having watched this, but honestly the camera style turned me off.

","By the end of the first season of ""Lost,"" I was hooked on the show. By the end of the second season, I'd all but given up on it. Now, I'm a casual watcher, but if I miss an episode, it really doesn't bother me (even though I know that's heresy to some.) I feel kind of the same way about Cloverfield. I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it a LOT. I bought the DVD, taking a risk. I watched it back-to-back three times. Sorry. No cigar. I almost like it, but that's because there are elements I do like about it. Those elements almost swing me over to it's side. But not quite. So what do I like? I actually liked some of the characters, particularly the female friend (I forget the character's name) who survives. She played her role with honesty and believability. I even liked Hud. He was annoying rather than funny, but that was his character. I like the fact that the creature was revealed to us in fits and starts, so that we were still left, to the very end, with a sense of dread and wonder, because we still knew so little about it. Finally, I liked the fact that the green-screen effects were done so seamlessly, that a great deal of reality was created, and that reality almost saved the movie. There were other factors that were so-so. The opening party scene was longish, though not painfully so. There were several other 'bridge' scenes that ran long. Also, I was really only surprised by an appearance of the creature only one time. But the main thing that sticks in my craw, is that J.J. did the same kind of ""explain one thing, create two mysteries to replace it"" manipulation that finally burned me out on ""Lost."" It was obvious from the get-go that he had ""sequel fever."" It was obvious that this movie was almost a throw-away to set up a franchise of sequels. Maybe not, but it sure seemed that way. Argh. The movie was technically well made, the acting was mostly adequate, the creature was indeed uniquely ugly and threatening. Still, it didn't win me over. Oh well, I think a friend will take the DVD off my hands for enough to make the cost equal to a matinée ticket. I can live with that."

","People keep comparing this movie to Godzilla and The Blair Witch Project. I saw neither of those but after seeing this movie I felt compelled to watch them so I did. THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING LIKE GODZILLA. The only thing in common with Godzilla is the big ass monster and the running people. It is similar to the Blair Witch Project in style, tension and uncertainness but Godzilla (1998) is more similar to Jurassic Park with the dinosaurs and a final conclusion. Cloverfield is something else.<br/><br/>People either love or hate this movie. To tell you the truth I'm one of the people who love it but read other comments too, both sides are telling the truth. The reason I love it is because I saw no movie like this one before. The whole science-fiction story is presented from the perspective of a hand held camera. The camera itself is a super-advanced prototype that is unbreakable and has almost unlimited power and nightvision and everything but that's not the point. The point is that it creates a unique and absorbing tone. You don't really notice the special effects they are just part of the story like if they were filmed in reality and that is what makes it genius like in the show called ""Heroes"".<br/><br/>So love it or hate it... doesn't really matter. What matters is that you will not be bored during this movie, not for one second. And it will stuck in your head for a while."

","THIS is a monster movie. THIS is what it felt like to see Godzilla in theaters in 1954. <br/><br/>Excellent acting, AMAZING screenplay, AMAZING camera work. This theme pushes our current perspective on film, and we will see many copies soon to come. The characters were very well developed and full, and reacted realistically. <br/><br/>I really appreciate the camera work and all the ass-busting this must've taken. Truly a heap of work, getting all the authentic shakes of a handcam but not losing focus on specific points. We also saw a lot of good humor during the slow scenes, which kept me in good spirits.<br/><br/>The story was pretty amazing too, as extra-dimensional creatures (or whatever) probably need to be nuked to be truly defeated. Hell, knowing the writer, the sequel will probably involve time-space rifts dumping thousands of these monstrosities into cities with concentrations of small, high-drama-laden groups of friends. But I must digress. really appreciate the actions scenes and how the monster was not easily felled as Godzilla was in the crap-tacular '97 American rendition. The whole point of a monster in a story is to reflect the true nature of your characters under duress; it is sometimes a shortcut to delivering high amounts of drama with relative ease. The previous 20 Godzilla movies missed that point. <br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the tribute Godzilla song at the end! lol!<br/><br/>I remember first seeing the teaser for this movie and immediately screaming ""GOJIRA!!!!!"" in the theater- I was wrong.

Although I believe some where vexed with the fashion of the movie, but they sure do doesn't know how to appreciate an impressively imaginative film. Primarily I have no complete idea of what would be the central cause of the stories major conflict, it was indeed exciting and makes you sit still on your couch and expect the unexpected. But to be honest, I thought of it as a frequent bunch of maturely adult friendship story that focuses on their self issues and try to narrowly solve a relationship coma, and then suddenly an outbreak of unexplainable war-like-fare boomed out of the blue causing awe and panic all over Manhattan. Later, however we come to understand the causes and main point of the story, thus I sparingly conceive what the tag line says ""something has found us"", then a huge monster appear in a blur from devastated store's tvs stormed by petty thieves out for their own egotistical interests.<br/><br/>Then the impact from our faces?

","My first impression was a high-budget ""Blair Witch"" type movie. It was shot entirely with a hand-held camera.I found it incredibly dull on first viewing. I then read many reviews which raved about it so I decided to pay more attention on a second viewing.<br/><br/>The first few seconds tell us that this movie was recovered by the government in Central Park. We then go into 18 minutes of bad photography and inane dialog at a Manhattan party. At about 19 minutes there is an explosion and people start running around. The hand-held keeps on running. The rest of the movie is basically panic, people running around, screaming, more inane dialog (much of which is hard to understand because of ambient noises,) Monster movie? NOT. It might as well be an attack by a foreign power or a bunch of crazies.<br/><br/>Is this a realistic depiction of what it might be like in Manahattan during an attack? Yes. Does that make it a good movie? No.<br/><br/>A good movie requires a blending of many elements - Screen writing, acting, directing, cinematography. A good script should have a few basic elements such as meaningful dialog, plot, character development.

You know, like when you see Alien and the monster comes out of the stomach, or like some scene in The Hills Have Eyes that I've half forgotten. The hand-held camera used throughout the film helps, of course, and indeed much better than in, for instance, The Blair Witch Project (which was a laugh, honestly). The plot isn't much to say anything about; four young persons run through Manhattan (to help a friend) after a monster has attacked ditto, the army tries to bomb the monster to smithereens, but to no avail. It's the acting and directing of the film that makes it so good. You actually don't see the monster in so many scenes, but when you do, it's from the victims', the humans' point of view. That's nice! Some scenes are sure to stay in your mind for some time; the horse-carriage without a driver, the little creeps in the subway, the head of the Statue of Liberty laying in the street. And also, as a bonus, no-one ever utters the words: - Is it a terror-attack? The non-Hollywood ending opens for a sequel, of course. But why not?"

A very poor script, which seemed to be ""Oh My God, Oh My God"" ad nauseum, or, at least ad boredom. The acting abilities of the cast were amateurish, at best, and the cast will probably be like a group of characters in an X-Files episode. They'll never be seen again, apart from the pretty younger females who'll probably be seen in a few teen TV programs, or straight-to-video movies, probably with less and less clothes as the films get poorer, with lower and lower budgets. Every expense seemed to have been spared on the special effects to stop viewers getting a good view of the monster. This is a bad thing in a monster movie, JJ. Why 2 stars?

I'm an especially huge fan of Godzilla (with the exception of the awful 1998 version) and I wince a bit to say I enjoy Cloverfield more than Godzilla, but I have no choice but to acknowledge that it is superior in its ability to completely suck you in and keep you invested in what's happening on screen.<br/><br/>The storyline the film is built around is a bit cliché but it works well as a backdrop to the disaster that is unfolding. It creates some decently believable motivations for the characters and while I wouldn't be very moved by it as a romantic story in any other context, I think it serves its purpose well here.<br/><br/>I think the reason this film works so well is that it focuses on the experience of being inside a monster attack, rather than focusing on all the logistics and militaristic drama of battling one from the outside. This makes the film much more gripping and psychologically tense than other films of the genre.<br/><br/>I tend toward motion sickness and the shaky camera thing bothered me a bit when I first watched it in the theatre but viewing it at home I've not had any ill effects.<br/><br/>I have seen this film a minimum of 25 times, and I know I'll watch it many times more. If you haven't seen it before I recommend checking it out."

","Call me crazy but I think that a monster movie should have a monster in it! Why do I feel like I'm the only one who believes this. This movie was like a porno without sex. Characters in monster movies are meant to be fodder. The only thing you are meant to care about is how they die. This movie was an insult to monster movie fans everywhere. I like sex in my pornos, action in my action movies, blood and guts in my horror movies and MONSTERS IN MY DAMN MONSTER MOVIES! Take your complex characters and their dumb ass relationships and stick them in a Julia Roberts flick. I'll take mindless entertainment over this character driven drama crap any day."

","I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in ages. No, it isn't the greatest movie of all time, but it's one of the best of its kind I've ever seen. So the hand-held POV isn't wholly original, who cares? It works. And works so well.<br/><br/>What is striking about this is it actually ends up being moving. Too many of these films make it (a) easy to spot the order in which characters will die and (b) make you start wishing they would all die horribly. This isn't so predictable. And by the end of this, partly because of the intimacy of the viewer's involvement in the action and partly because this is refreshingly thin on stereotypes, you end up caring about them.<br/><br/>A thoroughly good watch, some genuine jump-in-the-seat moments, enough cleverness and allusions for the movie geeks amongst us and just plain enjoyable, which is rare enough in any year."
"Imforeverone","3","1","2","9 April 2008"," Interesting, But Not Memorable
","Cloverfield is unique in the sense that the entire film is supposedly filmed by the actors. This makes it interesting because it makes the film seem very real. Also, for a hand-held camera, the special effects were notable. However the cons outweigh the pros by far. The entire movie can be summed up in these words: ""Look, big, mysterious, scary monster; lets all run for our lives!"" Their is no plot, subplot, or other, the characters are as shallow as the movie's concept and the theme is tired and redundant.<br/><br/>If anyone does wish to see it regardless, go ahead, but it is not a movie that stands out particularly. You can watch ""Blair Witch Project"", ""Spider-man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" and see the same kind of action (and scenarios) as here. The dialog was interesting, the acting even I can say I liked, but the story is empty, devoid of any true depth and very predictable.<br/><br/>NOTE: The writer also seemed to enjoy being as exceedingly blasphemous and showered the script with enough Oh My Gods and ""Jesus Christ's"" to save a nation.<br/><br/>In all 3 out of 10 is the most I can give for this attempt at entertainment. Even the monster is void of any depth; no details on what exactly it is where it came from. Let me stop commenting before I drop the rating down to a 2. Truthfully, the manner in which it was filmed is unique, the acting is nice, and the ""scary moments"" are intense, but ""Cloverfield"" is shallow and lacking in the entertainment sector of movie making.<br/><br/><ul><li>F.N.

"ahmad3682","10","1","2","8 April 2008"," Cloverfield: Clever Movie , Fantastic Movie!
","Three months ago when I saw the movie trailer and the advertising for the movie I knew that this movie will be ""The movie of the year"". And now I know I was one million percent right! The element that made the movie so good is the Hand-Held Camera that used to film the movie. <br/><br/>Some people say that the movie is bad because there is no camera that can film 9 hours continuously and that ""hud"" (the camera-man) film all the interesting scenes although he did not know what is going to happen.. I say that the movie is almost 84 minutes what means that the camera didn't film everything , and I think that the camera-man did everything right and the movie that he filmed make sense because , he began filming in the party when the attack begins and then he filmed on the streets , in the tunnel and also when saving Beth , what I'm trying to say is that the progression of the movie is good and make sense , and not like some people who think that Hud was like knowing the future and that's wrong. Another thing that bothers me that people attack the quality of the camera , like there is no hand-Held camera that can film with so great quality , but in my opinion there might be , and also nobody told us that the movie was filmed in 2008 , maybe it was filmed in 2011 and the cameras will be more advanced!<br/><br/>I have watched hundreds of movies in my life , but like this movie I never saw!! Because it's really outstanding. So I advice every person who didn't see the movie yet to buy a ticket and enjoy 84 minutes of extraordinary Thriller."

","If you saw the trailer already you saw it all -- shaking camera and a lot of ""oh my god"". Unfortunately that does not make a great film.<br/><br/>It is like cheap version of Godzilla (which was disaster), a bit of Alien feeling and Blair Witch Project (I believe, because I didn't see it) -- hand-camera artsy-style.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this movie gets only high rates, well, then, good for producers. If you want to save your money, shake your head a lot, scream, and bang it from time to time against the wall.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a pity, because I would like to see some new great sci-fi thriller, but unfortunately every attempt is bad clone of something. I hope we won't see Cloverfield 2."
"medmom54","3","1","2","7 April 2008"," Not nearly as good as trailer hyped it up to be
","So lets just get this part out of the way; Cloverfield is most likely the most well advertised movie I've seen in the past few years. The teaser trailer shows two awesome clips; a distant building being blown apart accompanied by large chunks flying past the camerman, and the Statue of Liberty's head tumbling through the streets of manhattan. Now for those of you who viewed the trailer, you'll notice that in between these scenes, you see about 4 ridiculously quickly cut shots of people running down a stairwell. Guess What? That wasn't done just for the trailer... its actually one continuous scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Thats just one example of the irritating Blair Project-Rip Off of a movie that Cloverfield is. While the 1999 horror movie used the first person camera perspective as a way to trick the viewers to thinking that the movie was an actual documentary, Cloverfield uses this to make sure the audience gets the blurriest, and quickest shots possible of the limited amount of special effects in the movie. And as if that wasn't irritating enough, the camera man is retarded. I could most likely tape my digital camera to the top of my dogs ass while forcing him to run on my treadmill for a piece of steak and STILL get a better shot than the moron who recorded this movie. *end rant* Okay, with that out of the way lets focus on the movie's plot.<br/><br/>Oh wait... there isn't one. You see the other reason why I hate this movie so much is the fact that it scored a 7.8 on this website while Godzilla scored a 4.6. Because that makes a lot of sense. Okay sure, Godzilla may have had its issues with a couple of actors, and maybe all of the fans complained about him not breathing fire, but at least it had a plot.<br/><br/>Cloverfield opens up with a good 25 minutes of absolute irrelevant crap. The writers attempted to have some character development, but it never really works, or for that case matters in a movie with such ordinary boring characters. Have you ever gone over a girlfriend or boyfriends house and got stuck watching one of their god awful home movies? Well thats what this is... a really bad, boring home movie.<br/><br/>As far as the special effects go, they work... although theirs never anything really special about them, as most of the time the creature is covered in smoke, or so dark that you can't even see any texture on its skin etc. They aren't bad but theirs so few of them due to the ridiculous budget constraints, and that just sucks in a movie with such an epic scope.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie was its 85 minute run time... because when it ended, I got the hell out of that theater.<br/><br/>For the love of god, save your money 3/10"
"andrefbento","8","1","2","7 April 2008"," We've never seen a movie like this before
","Does this movie have any meaning? Although some may disagree, I think we could really say a few words about it... While Godzilla had an ecological message and criticized the experiences with nuclear power, I believe this one is a metaphor of the unpredictable world where we live, when from a moment to another the thousands of people may die in an airplane crash, in a tower hit by an airplane, etc, etc... These are new times, when with certain technology in the hands of the crazy people that will always exist in the world, thousands of people may face a horrible death in seconds. <br/><br/>Unless you were previously informed that the movie is about a monster, the first scene in the top of the roof makes you remember 9/11, which is by the way also quoted in the movie. This is quite intentional, since we see an explosion in the building and the same building collapsing in the next scene screened in the street. The monster is only introduced after some minutes, and surprisingly I could well accept as something that could really happen, since everything looked so realistic in the movie. On the other hand, this monster is quite different from others, like Godzilla, Hulk or King Kong. This one is more powerful and does not have a soul. Its purpose is basically to unstoppably kill, destroy and eat things and people like if there was no tomorrow. Where does it come from? Why is he doing this? Well, I really appreciate that the director has cut those stupid explanations such as that it was a dormant monster in the depths of the ocean, or that it has visited earth inside a big spaceship coming from other planet, or crap like that. As the trooper says near the end of the movie, ""we don't know what it is, but it is winning"". We could not listen to such a vague and at the same time so disturbing statement if one of those stupid explanations were given. We just need to know that this monster is there and it is damned as hell. Sometimes explaining these types of films turn them more simple and less scary... If this was a thriller maybe the rules were others, but this is a disaster and scary movie, and here sometimes it is better not to give details. <br/><br/>I would say that the movie is essentially an experience. Until now, I only remember the amateurish ""blair witch project"", certain scenes of John Cameron's ""strange days"" and an interesting episode of X-Files exploring the concept of the movie being entirelly filmed in a hand-held. I agree that we should not abuse of this method... But I won't also claim that this is not art; I really believe it is, but the way of filming should be adapted to the theme and only in these tense and scary movies there are reasons to film this way, without slow motions, background music, cheap exhibitions of special effects... <br/><br/>I have seen lots of people criticizing the characters but I think they are perfect here. I am also glad that the director has not chosen famous actors; it would not be so scary if we saw leonardo di caprio trying to rescue the girl... This really adds more reality to the movie. I think that the dialogues of the characters are also purposefully casual and sometimes stupid, since usually people will not say grandiose statements in a situation like this; they will most likely talk in monossylabes... In sum, we get the feeling that we are really there living the moment. And, without less importance, we have incredible fun watching this movie!"

","To be honest, It is not very good. It reminds me the movie REC. But Recwere original and this one is not. Shortly I could say you can watch it, but just don't expect a lot. Acting and the rest are moderate. I think it is an ordinary Hollywood movie. In my opinion, American cinema is in a big depression and they cannot produce original scenarios instead they reproduce Asian or European movies or simply take the ideas from international independent movies. And they make high budget movies with stolen ideas. This one is one of those reproduction movies. And even introducing high tech. effects and expensive tools to the movies is not enough.<br/><br/>I like the hand camera in the movie maybe this was the only successful thing. But again problem with hand camera is that it is bit professional and when there is an action scene cameraman does not stop. I found it not realistic."

","After reading several good reviews of this film, I figured I'd go and check it out. I'm still not quite sure what to make of this one.<br/><br/>The film centers around a group of teenagers caught up in a dangerous situation in New York. The mysterious ongoing destruction about the teens forces them to try and make a run for it - head for the hills.<br/><br/>The photography and plot line of this movie is not unlike the Blair Witch Project - in fact it is nearly exactly the same: frightened teens caught up in something spooky try to escape and someone finds the shaky film documenting the events at some later point. Except this film takes place in a city and the mysterious events are a bit more Hollywood than BWP.<br/><br/>I was really quite unnerved during the first 30 minutes of the film in which next to nothing happens. We get introduced to characters that are really nothing more than their clothes and a name tag. We do learn that they can all run and scream real well, though.<br/><br/>If you liked the BWP you'll probably like this, too. It's not a bad film action film, per se. If you're over 15, you'd do better to find something else."

It's almost as if they wanted to take a wonderful idea and ruin it.

And it's not feasible either, I mean. when a monster's chasing you you don't run holding your camera up and filming everyone around, you run like hell before you get killed. It's just stupid. The idea was great, but it was badly put into practice - such a waste of potential. I prefer classical camera angles, where you can actually see what's happening. And also, the ending sucks, although I'm not going to spoil it for you. Please take my advice and don't go see it; you'd be better off renting Godzilla, although it's like 10 years old, compared to this one it's brilliant. Maybe a sequel would be more interesting."

","Cloverfield is an interesting movie, for several reasons, the biggest of course being the Cinematography. It's a little heavy and slow for the first 20-25 minutes, but then the mystery starts to spread among the main characters. What it is? Is it bird? Is it plain? NO! It is a cheap and spider look-a-like monster, Godzilla's cousin who was beaten with a hanger as child. A big nasty and apparently very angry on humans? Althoughs unanswered questions contributes well to story, and for audience as well, making us feel totally clueless of the situation. Again Manhattan is the playground of another paranoia monster, only this time is could use some Botox and be run through a Commodore 64 to get a better and more realistic look. It is a real mood killer when you see a destroyed in flames (nice!) New York from the top of a skyscraper, and then the monster is as scary as Super Mario. See it for a different experience."

Then we get to the action: a few good parts, great special effects, but the cameraman, although realistic, is NOT picking up the ACTION! He is looking at the ground and at everything BUT the aliens. Lastly, the characters have to be some of the most emotional and stupid people on the planet! When it comes to survival you have to get back to the basics: food, water, shelter, and of course, PROTECTION (in the form of weapons or some sort). These fools didn't do as much as pick up a stick let alone find some guns. In conclusion, if you like realism, stupidity, and a bad plot, then THIS is your movie.

Even without no background-music during the whole movie it still manages to build up a dense atmosphere since the viewer is (as he experiences the events through the eyes of a small group of people - or their camera) left with almost no information whatsoever. There is no scene in which the viewer for instance gets a good look at what is wreaking havoc in Manhattan, which again contributes to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The down side is that at the point, the movie ended, I found myself expecting a ""second half"" of the movie.

","On paper, cloverfield is a great idea: A giant monster invasion movie shown entirely from the perspective of hand held camera has potential for all sorts of coolness. However, while cloverfeild has some good things going for it, it doesn't quite live up to that potential.<br/><br/>The problem with cloverfield is that it feels a little too Hollywood- its supposed to show the action in a documentary style, but thanks to some teen soap style drama and unnecessary character development, that sense of realism and immersion that horror mockumentaries need to evoke to draw you in, isn't always there. Thats not to say that the film is bad- the film is definitely scary in places. There is a serious sense of dread and panic in scenes when the crowds are fleeing from the monster and news footage of monster attacks are chilling and shocking to watch.<br/><br/>Cloverfeilds biggest problem is the very thing thats most integral to the movie: the camera. I understand that the bad, sickness inducing, extremely shaky camera work is supposed to add to the realism but it makes the film difficult and at times, frustrating to watch. Even the micro budget Blair witch project had better and more realistic camera work and that film didn't have a CG monster to show off.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a unique take on the 'monster attacks new york' theme that the American remake of godzilla tried to do 10 years ago and its good for a few scares, but its not as as effective as it should be."

We either die here, die in the tunnel or die on the surface"" I've seen better dialogue and production values in the Teletubbies!!!

"the-perfect-murderx","10","1","2","11 February 2008"," Amazing!
","I'm going to answer some questions..<br/><br/>People who are commenting this are so annoying. Seriously stop whining and pay attention to the movie. No one understands why the movie ends so suddenly. If you actually pay attention you hear the military say that they are going to blow up Central Park if the 'monster' doesn't die soon. Then, while they are under the bridge, you hear the sirens meaning that the bomb or whatever is about to go off. Then, the movie ends. Clearly they both died. If the bomb killed the monster, I'm pretty sure if would kill them too. And it is a little hand held camera so if they both died, who's going to take over? No one, hence the quick ending. Moving on...<br/><br/>I liked the hand-held camera. It made me feel as though I were in that situation. Yes the first 15 minutes may cause motion sickness but you get over it after a while.<br/><br/>Also, people are saying that the first 15 minutes or so are pointless and boring. I thought it was great because you get to know the characters. It's basically the only time you have to get to know them because the rest of the movie is spent running from the monster. Not much time for socializing and getting to know them. Also, what kind of a movie starts with the monster attack as soon as it starts?<br/><br/>Marlena's 'unexplained' death: If you pay attention when they first get caught by the military and borough into that mini hospital thing, the camera focuses on a stretcher going by with a body that has basically the entire ribcage and gut eaten. Then they find out that Marlena has been bitten and the military and nurses freak out. When you get bitten by the spider-things, it basically releases eggs into the wound. Which lead to growing spiders inside your body. Then they take her into the tarp and you see the shadow of her exploding basically from the spiders.<br/><br/>And as for the ""Where did the monster come from?"". At the end it shows him and Beth on the ferris wheel (a clip from a while back that was recorded over). If you look closely in the background, you'll see something falling from the sky into the water. Hmmm...what could that mysterious object be? The monster of course! I thought the movie was amazing. Definitely worth the $10. It was the best movie I've seen in theaters."

I cant stand a women crying and moaning, looking and staring into their hands when there is a frikin monster around the corner??? in real life you are more likely to be silent in fear and concentrated on the situation.. get rid of the women, and its a good film.<br/><br/>However this film is original in that it expands on the blair witch first hand approach with good effects and CGI. Maybe a glimpse of why the event happened may have been good to tie up the story possibly at the beginning or end.. but its not as bad as ""no country for old men"" as a plot dropper, at least this film has a plot and story you can follow to the end."
"DiabolicalJC","10","1","2","7 February 2008"," An excellent piece of cinema (no spoilers)
","For those who kept an eye on the publicity / viral campaign for Cloverfield (aka Slusho / Clover / Cheese / 1.18.08 / Milk), you'd be forgiven for expecting a film that doesn't live up to the hype. Well, Cloverfield squashes the hype.<br/><br/>An excellent all out monster movie, director Matt Reeves brings you a package of horror, action, drama, suspense, and a little bit of sublime comic relief every now and then.<br/><br/>Set in New York, the basic story (for the uninitiated few) involves a huge monster attacking the city, and gate crashing Rob's (Michael Stahl-David) leaving party. Before long, a small group of survivors take off across the big, wrecked apple in order to save Rob's potential girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman). Sounds daft, and may niggle at you for a moment, but you probably won't care ten seconds later.<br/><br/>The film starts well, setting up the characters with quite a while before the mayhem begins. For a film that is all through the lens of one impromptu cameraman, Hud (TJ Miller) - H.U.D, geddit? - the complexity of the characters by the end is quite something.<br/><br/>Cloverfield looks the part, too. The main attraction here is obviously the crumbling city, the various buildings meeting their demise (most people by now have seen the Statue of Liberty's severed head). Also, don't worry; without saying too much, the monster looks the part. Oh yes it does.<br/><br/>A film involving the destruction of NYC is obviously going to bring up some queries of subtext, specifically about 9/11. Reeves and producer JJ Abrams are quite aware of this, and give you the subtext if you want it. There's also denotes of Katrina and Iraq, again, if you want there to be. But hell, this is a monster movie, so you can choose to ignore this and just enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>This is also a movie that wears its influences on its sleeve. Apart from the obvious monster movie look, you can also see Independence Day, War of the Worlds and Escape from New York in there. In one delightful scene which uses the camera's night vision abilities, we get an homage to / rip-off from The Descent. Plus, players of shooter epic Half Life 2 will see some familiar things there too.<br/><br/>Seeing as it's all through one camera, there's no non diegetic music, either. The absence of cinematic effects such as this makes Cloverfield a scarily authentic experience, with believable characters and a not-too-unbelievable plot.<br/><br/>With few, if any, real flaws, this makes Cloverfield a fantastic cinematic experience. This is the type of film you compare to the likes of Jurassic Park, or the aforementioned Independence Day. Do not wait for the DVD; this is something that must be witnessed on the big screen.<br/><br/>* * * * *"
"Hugo_diaz","9","1","2","10 February 2008"," Totally underestimated!!!
","I think I understand why this movie is so underestimated. It is clear that we have not seen a truly re-invention in a long time and many viewers doesn't know how to react. And the thing is, all the main good reviews and press notice that this film has received are not for nothing. All the praises have been given by people, I mean critics, who actually knows a lot about cinema and storytelling, characters development, etc.<br/><br/>I am not saying this is a sort of citizen Kane, just referring to the fact that the form, the way this movie has been made, may distract from the substance and the value this piece has as a drama.<br/><br/>Marlena, for instance, is a great character, and it totally shows a lot of work in his creation and performance.<br/><br/>I think this film should be called ""Cleverfield"", because it is not just a success regarding marketing campaign (the filmmakers actually create a parallel universe), but also as an entertaining film.<br/><br/>It impressed me, and not because of ""the monster"". It simply took me by surprise in a good way."
"ramzaw","10","1","2","6 February 2008"," An excellent film.
","First things first, the movie does not reveal all the information to the viewer in the film. Either you need to watch the movie closely in order to derive some of what is going on, or you need to surf the internet. That's right, you heard me; the movie uses something called ""Viral Marketing,"" which is when you find out a whole bunch of information about the plot over the internet.<br/><br/>Now for the movie itself.<br/><br/>Many people complain that the camera wouldn't stop moving; well, it's supposed to be a hand held camera the whole time, so it wouldn't make sense for the camera to stay still if it was hand-held, would it? And many people rate the movie down because it made them sick. Look, even if it makes you sick, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It just means you get motion sickness. Live with it.<br/><br/>And it very much had a plot, if anyone is curious. It's actually incredibly deep, but like I said, you need to do some research to fully understand the plot - which is quite in depth.<br/><br/>My overall rating: Very good, tense monster movie, but obviously not for everyone."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","2 February 2008"," A cut above most monster movies (spoilers)
","Let's face it. Most monster movies are rubbish. Even the original King Kong leaves me cold, featuring as it does bland characters and atrocious dialogue. But wait, it features a massive ape tearing stuff apart. Isn't that, like, totally awesome, dude? No, not really.<br/><br/>So does Cloverfield buck the trend of the rubbish monster movie? Well, it does and it doesn't. I mean, the characters here are amazingly bland. I cared for them not one bit. And the dialogue is serviceable at best. It's basically, 'Let's run!' or 'We've got to go back and find Beth!' But because of the film's central gimmick, the fact that it's supposedly shot on someone's digital camera, it ends up being a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The fun that's to be had in the movie is from the tension that is generated by the way the movie is filmed  one camera, no music; the sound design is the score. An example is an excellent little sequence in a subway tunnel. It's dark and we can hardly see. Yet we can hear something  the main monster sheds little monsters, so we know these little bastards are pursuing the characters. And so their reveal via one of the characters turning on the night vision on his camera delivers a bigger jolt that it ordinarily would.<br/><br/>And the use of the single camera makes ordinary scenes of death and destruction far more expressionistic. We see bits and pieces but we rarely get to see the full monty. Which in the case of a monster movie is actually a good thing  Godzilla and King Kong wreaking havoc is so ludicrous when viewed from a safe distance that it usually elicits yawns and laughs. So the single camera helps ground the film  to ensure that it doesn't become one massive flight of fancy.<br/><br/>However, I just wish that the filmmakers had the balls to go all the way with the concept. I was perfectly happy only seeing pieces of the monster. But at the end we get the grand reveal. Yep, it's not good. To picture the monster just imagine a massive frog-like mouse that has ape-like arms and which seems to have mated with an old man somewhere along the line. In all its glory, it looks terrible. It really takes you out of the film.<br/><br/>And I also got fed up with the numerous endings. Oh, the helicopter's crashed and they're all dead? Okay, that's pretty brave: a bleak ending. Oh, no, they survived. And here comes the monster and he's killed one of the main characters. Okay, another decent ending: the cameraman is dead and the rest will lose their lives too. But no, someone else has picked up the camera and the film's still going. Rather than end with a bang, the film ends with a splutter.<br/><br/>But to be honest, the film doesn't start much better, either. The first twenty minutes or so revolve around a party where we get introduced to the main characters. And what a dull lot they are  lots of bland late twenty-somethings. There's not one bit of fat anywhere. Not one ugly face. But there's also no personality. Indeed, the charisma void is so chronic that I had no idea who had perished  someone called Jason dies and I was left scratching my head. And then later I found out that it was the hero's brother who is quite prominent in the party sequence. Oh, okay.<br/><br/>But once the destruction starts there are some very enjoyable sequences. There's a great bit where we see devastation in the distance and then the head of the Statue of Liberty comes bouncing off buildings before resting in the middle of the street. Finally we have a monster movie that isn't up in the skyscrapers, watching from the heavens.<br/><br/>I also liked the street battle the characters get caught up in. For a brief moment it becomes like a war movie  the cameraman hiding behind a car as the army tries to take down its enemy. And there was something grimly enjoyable about the moment where one of the main characters, who's been bitten by the little monsters the big monster sheds, is taken to a medical tent and we see the silhouette of her head exploding. The film is surprisingly violent in places.<br/><br/>But although the action is superbly done and the central gimmick works a treat, it's still very traditional at heart. The main character is in love with a girl he's been friends with for years. And because he's leaving to go to Japan, they kind of have a fling. So you're watching a guy go back into hell to rescue the woman he loves. Now this isn't a film where you feel like there's a deep emotional bond between the characters, so the central story is a bit of an eye-roller. Okay, you love this girl. Okay, you've spent a blissful morning in bed and you had a lovely day at Coney Island. But please could the pair of you just be a bit more than pretty. Please.<br/><br/>But as it stands, the film's good entertainment. The action is well choreographed and the single camera works superbly. But it still can't transcend the monster movie limitations. It's still basically a bunch of idiots running away from a silly creature. Plus instead of a bunch of morons in top hats fleeing from an ape, we now have morons in khakis filming everything with their mobile phones. Yes, when the apocalypse happens it will be scored to a cacophony of obnoxious ringtones."
"Rob_Yeomans-1","7","1","2","2 February 2008"," Better Than Expected
","Given that i am not the biggest J.J Abrams fan, i headed into this with some reservations. However, i am pleased to say that 'Cloverfield' is a great success for the monster movie genre in the 21st century. By playing on the current western fear of terrorism, the film presents the kind of fear that the cinema goer can invest in, in 2008. The film also boasts some strong performances from its cast of relative unknowns, who, because of their anonymity, also add another layer of reality to the film. Having said this i feel that the films biggest success, is the use of only the camcorder footage captured by the group, which in many parts of the film greatly adds to its atmosphere and intensity, in particular in the subway scene. Despite its many strong points i feel there were two problems with the film, which hampered it slightly as an experience: Firstly, i feel that the monster itself did not quite live up to its hype, which i suppose is not surprising given, the films promotional push prior to its release. Secondly; I feel the film suffers from what i like to call return of the king syndrome with respect to the ending, as it feels that the filmmakers couldn't quite decide what they wanted to do, so they packed everything in at the cost of the films coherence.<br/><br/>However, despite these issues, 'Cloverfield' is great, daring, and genuinely scary popcorn cinema, and a very strong addition to the monster movie cannon.<br/><br/>Rob Yeomans"
"sunandsteel","9","1","2","2 February 2008"," It's like Marmite
","You either love it, or hate it. I thought it was amazing. Brilliant special effects; so much so my jaw actually dropped, plus the camera angles and shots made you feel like you were actually witnessing a real event. I was enthralled from the very beginning. The storyline itself is well thought-out, and it doesn't disappoint when you find out what actually is doing the damage to New York. There's even slight bits of comedy which had the whole audience laughing. The ending is only bad if you need your movie story lines spoon-fed to you. Personally I think everyone should see this movie. If you don't like it then there's really something wrong."
"cck_tail","7","1","2","2 February 2008"," A revitalising experience
","First and foremost what I liked about Cloverfield was the hand held home movie camera filming style, which as far as I know has not been utilised before in a monster movie. This is what ultimately makes Cloverfield a unique experience and a unique film. I believe that if it was not for the amateur movie making style this film would have never been made because Godzilla, King Kong among other monster flicks have already been created on large budgets, so for anyone that complains about the shaky camera movement and the fact that it is extremely fast at times you have to remember that this movie would have no merit as a film if it was not for the amateur filming style. The Blair Witch project was the first mainstream film I recollect that attempted this style because it does create a more visceral atmosphere and as time passes, and we as humanity are subjected to more and more violence, such as the news that is always displaying negative material we become more immune to being scared, surprised and frightened. All you have to do is compare the violence in movies today compared to the earlier days and it has increased dramatically. Special effects and visual effects have been incorporated into films to give us filmmakers the opportunity to broaden our imagination to what can be adapted for screen, but to generally scare people, especially older people it is becoming harder all the time that is why film crosses over into the documentary style genre to try and reflect reality. I think Cloverfield was a good idea because it does reflect reality (obviously minus the monsters) ultimately making it more scary, thanks to the amateur film/documentary style.<br/><br/>The fact that terrorism is prevalent in society today and peoples psyches is another reason why Cloverfield is a power film and made for this era to reflect a first person experience of what it would be like in the midst of a major attack and the affect it has on people. Films generally are the most successful when they have an impact on people by incorporating present issues and fears. The story is so simplistic and obvious for those of you expecting a complex plot, but sometimes it is the simplist stories that are the best and Cloverfield works, but again coming back to the filming style which makes it fresh and worth making. Cloverfield also relies on the hidden enemy method to create fear. The less that you see the more your imagination can run free usually making the experience more frightening, just watch Jaws for example. I believe the film/documentary style is the way forward to create generally more scary films or if 3D cinema becomes the mainstream then that will be the way forward. Imagine watching a film like Jaws in 3D. We need fresh experiences in cinema for new eras as technology grows and I believe that Cloverfield is a good example, although if I might add a very obvious one in my eyes."
"Kmyelin","8","1","2","2 February 2008"," Not a masterpiece, but still a breathe of fresh air
","It seems that most people who rate this movie badly went into it expecting a special effects extravaganza, chockablock with wide shots of the monster causing mayhem. If that's what you're looking for, go rent ""War of the Worlds"" or any of the dozens and dozens of the other disaster/monster movies that have already done it.<br/><br/>While no masterpiece, this movie takes a novel approach to the genre, fully commits to it, and in my opinion, pulls it off very well.<br/><br/>The 9/11 allegory is relatively bland and unimpressive, until the second-to-last scene (the final scene in the story's chronological line). Its raw authenticity is extremely powerful, and for me, ended up raising the whole picture's impact and value considerably."
"TOMNEL","8","1","2","1 February 2008"," Very well done, Great entertainment.
","""Cloverfield"" is just a downright entertaining movie. It's got suspense, good humor and cool looking action scenes. The shaky camera wasn't even bad, it added to the overall effect.<br/><br/>Rob is going away for his new job, and a large group of friends throw him a going away party. Unfortunately, the party must end abruptly when a giant grasshopper looking monster begins destroying the city. The cameraman for most of the movie is the comic relief best friend character Hud, and him being the cameraman works very well. Some intense scenes needed a bit of comic relief, and he worked just fine. The action scenes are usually shaky, but they still look great. Because the first 20 minutes of the film are used to introduce the characters and their backgrounds, the audience can actually relate to these likable group of young adults.<br/><br/>It's a very entertaining flick. See it in the theaters for the amazing sound effects.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 74 mins. PG-13 for violence."
"kevin_crighton","6","1","2","1 February 2008"," Good monster movie, but... (contains plot reveals)
","At a leaving party for Rob, who's heading to Japan, explosions are heard in the city. Going out onto the street, the head of The Statue Of Liberty crashes down and in the distance a glimpse of a creature is seen. Rob and some friends heads into the chaos to find Beth, who he's in love with, as she's trapped and hurt in the city. all the while recording everything on digital camera.....<br/><br/>The actors are mainly unknown, which is a good thing as it keeps you wondering who will survive, and how many as the monster and the military battle it out on the streets. The script is okay, but most of the lines are of the 'OH MY GOD' variety or screaming at some points. The actors do enough to convince with their performances being scared and on occasion funny.<br/><br/>The start of the movie, during the party is long enough to introduce the characters and how they relate to each other. This of course, means that when the destruction occurs you do care who is going to live or die.<br/><br/>The director Matt Reeves does well not only in keeping the story moving, but also in the decision to only show glimpses of the monster. This makes it more frightening. There are a couple of moments from a story point of view where the director has obviously set up a scare to happen, but on the whole it's done well<br/><br/>The appearance of the monster is never explained, which is good. Most movies of this nature, such as Godzilla tend to explain the origin on the monster, but here it simply shows up and chaos reigns! The effects are impressive. The scenes of devastation in New York are stunning, and the creature effects are pretty good, both the huge creature, and also it's 'offspring'.<br/><br/>There are some good shocks through-out the movie, the stand-out scene being a tunnel attack from the 'offspring'.<br/><br/>But.... there are flaws.<br/><br/>The story is very similar (guy looking for girl in a city in chaos) to an 80's movie Miracle Mile, right down to the downbeat ending.<br/><br/>The idea of the movie being showing from the point of view from video being recorded isn't new. Movies such as The Blair Witch Project and Diary Of The Dead have used the same point of view, but to be fair the footage shot is impressive.<br/><br/>The movie is only around 90 minutes long. As a result, things are kept tight, and also believable with regard to the battery of the camera. A longer movie, might have had battery problems with the cameras!!<br/><br/>As a monster movie it's great. Does it live up to it's hype? Not quite. But it's still worth seeing."
"Greasemonkey201","9","3","12","19 January 2008"," Don't Listen to The Small Minded, This Movie is Great.
","I was very anxious to see the film, not only because the concept of a Monster attack on New York, but the fact that they kept the monster a mystery until the film came out for release and the fact that it was shot in the eyes of people trying to survive, if it were to be a big budget film like Godzilla, which sucked, then I would have passed. Now the movie does start out a little slow, but if you pay attention to the characters, you can tell who will live and who won't, and to see that they are real people, not heroes. Now if you are some sap where you want every detail given to you like you are some robot and have no taste for a real film, then you should stay home and leave the rest of us to enjoy the movie. I mean if you know your an a##-hole, why rub it in our faces. But back to the movie, I felt the camera work was the best part, and you can't even compare this to Blair Witch, it gave the movie a more realistic feeling and it stayed away from the same old story line where we have a solution for everything. In reality people, if a monster did attack us, we would be fuc%@^ Just like in the movie. Now the look of the monster was the best choice for a because it was different, scary, and had no background story, so it made it more intense. Now for the ending, perfect, just how it should have ended. So don't expect to see a Disney B.S. ending where everyone sings and is happy, it's a monster movie, that ending doesn't exist. I highly recommend the film to the people who really get movies, not the ones who like Meet the Spartans. It's a great film, very original for a known concept, and will leave you with a new idea of what film making is turning into, not the same old crap."
"da_villan","8","3","12","16 January 2008"," Enjoyable ride
","It's too flippant and easy to call this Godzilla meets The Blair Witch Project. Cloverfield deserves better than that.<br/><br/>What it is in reality is a tense, highly enjoyable ride that (with a reasonably short runtime) never outstays its welcome. It's able to convey a tangible sense of menace that other mainstream Hollywood disaster films like ID4, the Godzilla remake and the remake of War of the Worlds couldn't, and does it without having to resort to laying on the gore.<br/><br/>Those who have trouble with shaky camera work and need everything in the plot tied up in a nice neat little bow need not apply to see Cloverfield. If you do, I'm sure you'll be annoyed by the films ""conclusion"". It feels and plays like found documentary footage so it lacks the normal structure (like Blair Witch), which is exactly the intent.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this film and was completely satisfied by its end."

","Cloverfield (2008) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project meets a Godzilla type movie in this action film that has NYC being ripped apart by some unknown monster. Okay, this film has some really great moments but the screenplay really left me cold. I understand the whole gimmick of having a hand held camera capture all the action but the screenplay gives us four rather bland characters and none of them are more interesting than the actual monster and destruction of the city. Even though the film runs under 80-minutes I found myself getting bored whenever the film focused on the characters but thankfully there's still plenty of action to keep things going. I hate CGI but the effects are used very good here with some really great scenes of the city being destroyed. The ending with the monster on a full rampage while coming under attack was very thrilling and I also enjoyed how the film ended but the very ending was a little frustrating but perhaps this will be cleared up in the upcoming sequel. The performances were okay but the screenplay really didn't give them much good dialogue and the love story was just downright stupid."

Many others complain that it didn't have every aspect of the story laid out with surgical precision, leaving no room for the imagination. Boo-whah! The first 15-20 minutes allowed us to get to know the characters. The rest was just go-go-go and is what you'd expect from a first-person experience. They didn't linger on the creature, but just their own experience while it was happening.<br/><br/>This is a movie that depends on the intelligence of the viewer to let their own mind fill in the blanks - the beginning and end of the story.

There were a few good scenes I suppose, but as soon as I started to get interested it was ""cut to new scene while camera bounces around like it's being shot by an epileptic having a seizure"". Character development was horrible; I didn't empathize with any character in the movie (if someone would have put a bullet in all the main character's heads within the first 30 minutes maybe I could have empathized with that), and was pleading for them to die before continuing to assault me with their overacting and annoying ""self awareness"". Bottom line for me, this movie sucked - and if you did an exit poll of the people in the theater that day I believe you would have got a 99% thumbs down....the main theme of conversation walking out was ""WTF was that piece of s*#t!"""

","I decided to write this a full 24 hours after watching the film because it usually takes me that long to come to a critical decision. If I had written this immediately after viewing the film, I would have written that it was a great movie. I never once was bored, the explosions were nice, I was satisfied because I got to see the monster and I was even more satisfied that the film never told where the monster came from. I do think audiences are sometimes better off using their imaginations because nothing is ever as creative or terrible than something you make up for yourself. People leaving the theater were complaining because they felt they hadn't been told enough. Not me - I had fun. I expected total trash. Maybe the fact that it was so much better than I anticipated lead me to overrate the film.<br/><br/>Yes, I was never scared. It was action-filled, but predictably so. I knew the bridge would be torn down. I told my husband that as soon as they directed everyone to the bridge. I knew they would see rats running in the tunnel and why as soon as they went into the subway. This film is not a horror film. It is an action film. At least, I do not think the intention was to scare the audience, but rather, keep them involved in the action. Predictablity is par for the course in action films.<br/><br/>However, I was disappointed that the film was not more realistic in some ways. I fully expected that girl to change her shoes in the department store - I would have. It would have taken the military longer to get there. I am no expert on weapons, but the monster looked soft-skinned, still, nothing hurt it. Come on, I don't believe it. A more realistic situation would be trying to escape while waiting for the military to get there with tanks and whatever else. But other things were unrealistic as well. The three people who survived the copter crash weren't strapped in as far as I could tell. If the camera's auto focus had problems in one part, why not in any other part? But, hey this camera did much that mine won't. I don't think mine would have made it after falling from the monster's mouth, let alone the crash or even some of the falls. I didn't mind the camera jumping, but the little break-ins from what was supposed to originally be on the tape were overused. Finally, the whole ""Hold on to someone you love. That's what's important - love"" stuff is a little too obvious. Other movies have made far more serious statements about society in far less obvious ways. Like Romero or Takashi Miike (spelling?).<br/><br/>I enjoyed myself. It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't ""groundbreaking"" or ""unique."" I certainly did not ""make my entire life"" as some have claimed here. I am glad I was talked into seeing it."
"Roger_Sterling","7","2","7","19 January 2008"," Simply doesn't live up to the hype.
","Since the untitled teaser trailer was released with Transformers in July, hype and mystery have been on this movie like flies on crap. Sad to say, Cloverfield doesn't live up to it.<br/><br/>The biggest hook this movie has is ""What does the monster look like?"" I won't spoil it, so don't worry. You DO get one clear shot of the monster near the end of the movie; the rest of the time it's bits and pieces. For the first 10-15 minutes of the movie or so there is no attack. It is a going away party for Rob, the main character.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the camera. I was expecting it to be used for the party, not for the ENTIRE movie. When the camera isn't focused on the monster, I felt sick looking at the screen. It feels a little too realistic most of the time. However, the special effects and sound are spectacular.<br/><br/>I would've given this a higher rating, but the camera, overall forgettable characters and terrible ending bring this to a somewhat generous 7/10."
"william_995","8","2","7","18 January 2008"," Not very thrilling, but it was awesome.
","This movie mainly focuses on the people, and not on the monster itself, unlike other monster-related movies, which somehow focuses on how 'great' or how 'cool' the monster is. Be real. When a monster comes, do you know why it came? Do you think that the monster is 'cool'? Would you return all the way back for someone you really really love? Or would you just run? Would you even bother showing the world what really happened?<br/><br/>I really liked the way they ended the movie. It was real and it makes sense. In the first place, who would survive a hammerhead? Unless God protects you, otherwise. NO!<br/><br/>The entire movie was shot in a hand-held camera style. I'm amazed by the production. It didn't make me dizzy, and i was pretty nervous all the way till at home. Even now, as i'm typing this review.

We witness a dark time from the eyes of an everyday group of social butterfly's. The exception is that we see a change of survival instinct from everyone involved.

They Don't. This is the Alien of the 20th Century. We are only being introduced to the beast. Running and being scared is just natural.

"Will-Hare-89","8","2","7","18 January 2008"," A Movie Fueled By Viral Hype That DOESN'T Disappoint!
","So what has months of internet hype and viral marketing given us? Apparently, a pretty damn good movie by most people's standards. ""Cloverfield"" is the lovechild of a bunch of guys who got bored with writing and directing TV and decided to try their hand at a film. And it paid off, big time.<br/><br/>As is evident from the trailers, ""Cloverfield"" is the story of a group of six friends trying to escape Manhattan during an attack from an unknown monster. All of this seems utterly familiar from any other monster movie, but the thing that makes it original is the Blair Witch-esquire storytelling from the point of view of a handicam. The film starts out by showing a series of screens, followed by the text ""SD Memory Card from the camera retrieved from US Site-???, area formerly known as Central Park"". We are then introduced to Rob and Beth, two of the main characters. They are seen laying together in bed, planning out their day, just like you'd see in any home movie. The rough cuts fit well, as it shifts from that day to another where Rob is planning on leaving for Japan for a job. The camera is now in the hands of Jason, Rob's brother, as he and his girlfriend Lilly, Rob's best friend Hud, and a few others prepare for Rob's going away party. It all fits the bill of being a home movie very nicely, until the monster attacks. Hud, the cameraman, decides to document the night to let everyone know ""how it all went down"". From there, we are introduced to the sometimes nausea-inducing shaky camera movements.<br/><br/>But you cannot fault Reeves for doing what he did: the camera is very shaky and during a few scenes almost unbearable, but it never breaks the illusion that we are watching a first-hand account of what is going on. Frequent turning on and off of the camera give the film a seamless quality. Hud, the resident idiot, also filmed over the tape that Rob used to film his lovely date at Coney Island with Beth - so when Hud turns the camera off improperly, we are given a few brief moments of the tape he recorded over, helping us to understand Rob and Beth's relationship.<br/><br/>The idea is nothing short of genius. I seem to keep reading people chastising the film for being overdone or unoriginal, but all I can see is originality and a fresh idea. It's Blair Witch meets Godzilla. But it's done with style, heart, and a surprising amount of substance. The cast, which is comprised of mostly no-name television actors, pulls off a collaboratively believable performance. Every actor in the film helps sustain the illusion that this is real footage from the night, and that they are being completely natural on-camera.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" avoids many easily ensnaring pitfalls and clichÃ©s. The film takes a few minutes to warm up, but then it launches into an hour-long, bloody, terrifying, no-holds-barred rampage where no character or set piece is safe from the destruction. Ignore the naysayers - ""Cloverfield"" is an adrenaline rush with thought and characters. Finally, I've seen a Hollywood Hype-Machine that was worth all the hype, especially considering the brainless, mind melting action poo piles that they've been throwing at us the past few years. Abrams also dishes out to the hardcore fans of the film, dropping little hidden tidbits of clues and hints, and rewards the diligent seekers by putting in hidden secrets only the truest of nerds would be able to find. It's films like these that make me embrace my nerdiness.<br/><br/>Great film, and a great way to start out 2008."
"naubol","10","2","7","18 January 2008"," Insane, tense, intimate, and compelling. A must see.
","I thought going into this film that the hand-held camera would be just a gimmick but it actually turns out to be highly effective at creating a sense of intimacy in the early sequences and shear terror in the latter.<br/><br/>It doesn't compare to Blair Witch even though everyone will make that comparison. There are long awesome sequences that show incredible visuals but also give a sense of realism because the camera really does feel hand held.<br/><br/>I was blown away, you will be, too.<br/><br/>N"
"Moogle-X","10","2","7","18 January 2008"," Incredible and thrilling BUT NOT for the weak of heart or those easily frightened by horror movies.
","PLEASE NOTE: This film is EXTREMELY intense. There are a lot of sudden terrifying moments and shocking turns throughout with borderline rated R violence, terror and gore. This movie, particularly near the end absolutely terrified my poor wife who swears she will never go to the movie with me again after this (and ""I am Legend"" a few weeks ago)<br/><br/>I just got back from the midnight premiere of Cloverfield at my local theater (Yes, I got the free camera, no I haven't used it yet). My wife and I went as today was my 30th birthday and I have been looking forward to this film ever since the first trailers. I really thoroughly enjoyed the film and thought the ""shaky-cam"" approach was particularly appropriate for the story being told, though my wife had a hard time with it due to the erratic motion made by the camera holder in most scenes and I noticed a few other people getting a bid queasy from it.<br/><br/>Again, if you like thrilling, shocking and intense thrill rides, this is it. SPOILERS POTENTIALLY BELOW THIS LINE: --------------------------------------------------------------- I don't see this as spoilers, but if you are exceptionally worried about being spoiled on the basic layout of the film, please be advised of it in the paragraph below:<br/><br/>This film features a group of friends who get caught up in by some sort of unknown attack on New York and the entire film is solely from the perspective of the person holding the camera who basically is partly trying to document the horrific events unfolding and partly just holding onto it as an anchor to his own sanity in the situation. Scary stuff at times, but beautifully executed. Also, make sure to stick around through the credits and you will hear an audio only tack on to the end of the film that is important (in my opinion) to resolving a plot thread.<br/><br/>I'm ready to see a sequel/follow-up now!!! (?)"
"redballa112003","8","2","7","18 January 2008"," Excellent, Take the Movie for What it is!
","Cloverfield brings a whole new take on the dying monster genre of films. First off take the movie for what it is. It is a home-movie type filming style that represents the YouTube generation being obsessed with capturing everything on video. Thus, naturally questions that people had prior to the movie could not be realistically answered as the movie's plot or story is simply being in the midst of a giant monster attack in New York City. We know as an audience as little as the main characters do about what is happening which is a good thing that fits the story. The movie can not spoon feed us every answer to all our questions, because that is not the point of the movie. The point of the movie is not to tell us the origin of this monster and why it is attacking the city. The main characters our likable enough to carry you through this experience. The main character in a sense is you or Hud (guy filming event) experiencing this giant monster rip apart the city. Let's be honest there is plot loop holes and some unreal situations, such as Hud filming this event and not putting down the camera, but it is a movie! Overall this movie utilizes an effective hand held filming style that has not been done since Blair Witch, which brings a shockingly realistic feel to the movie reminiscent of 9/11 images. Take the movie for what it is, an experience that will still leave questions, but nonetheless an excellent frightening tale of a group of New Yorkers being attacked by a 4 legged-dinosaur like monster whom unleashes all his rage on the city reviving the giant monster genre."
"sackjigler","7","2","7","18 January 2008"," Very Good and Thankfully not too Long.
","The reason I say thankfully not too long is that the hand-held cam is so headache inducing that it almost isn't worth having. But, without it the movie would lose what makes it so cool. Looking at the visuals like this really made it seem like it all was being destroyed. The best scenes are seen in the previews but they really are amazing to behold. It makes it all the more terrifying that it's happening in New York and it seems like another terrorist attack at first. The chaos is very cool when it is about, the running around, while necessary, very hard to keep watching. The monster is what it is. It's pretty cool I guess, but you really never get a great enough look to tell. To me it looked kinda like a oceanic praying mantis. There are some really well done intense scenes and pretty serious shocks. I really enjoyed the film and do recommend it. However, if the shaky hand-held cam makes you sick, you might want to avoid this one."
"rich8606","8","2","7","17 January 2008"," A fresh idea executed well
","Well, this is my first review, so go easy on me.<br/><br/>I had my doubts about this movie, I don't know the director or any of the actors, it only has 30 million dollar budget and no real synopsis. Have to say, this is the first movie I went and watch driven by hype only, and in some ways I think it did live up to its hype.<br/><br/>The good parts: Let's face it, we go to watch this movie to see a giant monster wrecks Manhattan, so I wouldn't go too far about the plot. The movie is about a rescue and escape, and that's all I'm going to say about it. It's a decent plot that drives the movie, at times it can be pretty stupid but the actors did well for this kind of movie.<br/><br/>So they promised us a giant monster. Many of us, me included, thought that due to its small budget, it will only appear briefly at the end of the movie. Well turns out this is not the case, the monster appeared early and often in the first 30 minutes, albeit only glimpses of it, around 40 minutes into the movie, we get to see it face-to-face. It's early appearance was satisfying considering all the hype and mystery about the monster's appearance. But most importantly, in the third act, we get to see the monster as a whole, and how did the filmmaker executed this with such a small budget? I'm a 3D animator myself, so I know quality special effects when I see one, for a 30 million dollar movie (if this is true), the special effects look proper and very well made. This can be attributed to the whole movie taking place in the dark and most of the special effects shot are always full of movements and quite short, with an exception for a single one: the statue of liberty's head scene, it actually looks quite cheap, fortunately when it comes to the scary stuffs, this movie done all-right.<br/><br/>The bad part: The origin of the monster is not quite explained thoroughly even until the end of the movie. This is, because the entire movie is told from a first person perspective of the protagonists. This way the whole movie is constrained only to its protagonists fight for rescue and survival, so, no subplot about a scientist with answers like in other monster movies. The origin however is explained only by a single split second scene at the end, blink and you'll miss it.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but just like ""I am Legend"", i feel that the third act kinda collapsed. The concept's quite fresh, Hollywood has not many giant monster movies and after the disastrous attempt on adapting Godzilla in 1998, thanks to J.J. Abrams for producing this movie. I would like to see more of this franchise, too many questions are still unanswered, maybe a sequel with a bigger budget and a different narrative. But for now, this is a very good start."
"TheUrquhart","8","2","7","17 January 2008"," Did Hollywood just do a cool film???
","If you like having everything explained to you, tedious backstories, and all loose ends tied up in a no brainer so you won't have to use your imagination, don't go see this movie.<br/><br/>If you like cheesy Hollywood music scores telling you when to be frightened, when to be sad, or happy, don't go see this movie.<br/><br/>However if you want a visceral, original, immersive experience and are prepared to take this film as the monster film it is (albeit done in an original and interesting way) then you'll love it.<br/><br/>It was like an amusement park ride. loud, tense, INtense, and not exactly Shakespeare.<br/><br/>And for once the characters (mostly) made believable decisions, and were believably scared, freaked out, and ran like hell screaming most of the time.

"d_sutaman","8","2","7","17 January 2008"," A Decent Film
","Like many of you, I was intrigued by this film when I first saw the teaser come out with Transformers. Then, between the initial teaser and the film's release, the hype for this film built up higher and higher. Days before the release of the movie, I began to worry that Cloverfield wouldn't live up to its hype, so I went into the cinema with mixed feelings. However, after watching it, I was not disappointed at all.<br/><br/>The basic story of Cloverfield is that there is a group of 5 people trying to evacuate Manhattan because of a monster attack. While there are some people who would disagree with me, I say that the one of the best parts of the film is the lack of a background story for the monster. All we know is that it most likely came from the ocean, and decided to attack.<br/><br/>Whilst this movie is not really a perfect film, I was entertained throughout it. My only complaint about Cloverfield was that the camera was too shaky. Unfortunately for me, I sat in the front row of my cinema, and felt slightly sick when the movie ended.<br/><br/>Overally, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. 8/10"
"yourdrunk","8","2","7","17 January 2008"," My View of Cloverfield After Seeing the Debut,(SPOILERS INSIDE)
","Great Movie Overall 8/10, great scenes and decent acting, but the Blair Witch Project point of view, kind of gets old, very quickly, This could be my 2 cents, where i like long pan shots and close ups where i can see in detail, but it does add to the action, in each scene and the point of view of the monster etc. And at first, I thought it was the sequel to Godzilla, but changed very quickly after seeing the close up of the Monster.... It was a great movie till the ending, which really disappointed me and as i walked out of the cinema at the end, i was hoping there to be a sequel, cause this would have intrigued me to see the next one, but was sadly disappointed to find out NO SEQUEL!!! AHHHH! I found that the plot was quite good, but for those die hard sci-fi fans it has the action and CGI of the best, But it doesn't reveal the nature and origin of this Monster/Alien, Which i found Upsetting. Would have liked to seen a little more concentration on alien background, but the action was great, Its just one of those movies which is perfect till the ending, Where it looks like they ran out of Money, And you feel that there should be some closure. I do recommend seeing it, Great Action Flick for All, As its in the point of view of an everyday bystander, as you feel you could walk into that persons shoes and imagine the choices and feelings you would experience, which is great."
"lothd","9","2","7","17 January 2008"," Quite gripping and much better than I thought
","I live in Thailand and caught the first show today. After all the hype I was pleasantly surprised. The story starts a bit slow, but the monster attack began before I got bored. The shaky camera work puts you in the middle of the action. Other than ""The Blair Witch Project"", to which this has been compared, the characters are sympathetic enough to make the story compelling. There's so much action that the movie seems to be much longer than the actual running time.<br/><br/>The monster design is fine, if not completely original, with flailing, spider- or crab-like legs. The ""face"" reminded me a little of Ray Harryhausen's Ymir. The beast has only one clear close-up shot near the end of the movie, but its massive body is glimpsed several times before. It looks very impressive. The small offspring or parasite monsters are barely glimpsed, but they are vicious.<br/><br/>No explanation is given about the monster's origin. The camera-bearing protagonists are all killed - no Hollywood ending for this movie.<br/><br/>Altogether a solid entertainment with a big potential for sequels. Also one of the best uses of surround sound ever."
"Jeditt69","9","2","7","16 January 2008"," Cloverfield!!!
","So Cloverfield is a different type of monster movie. You get quite a bit of quick shots of the monster that eventually gives you an overall idea of what it looks like. aside from the looks for the creature you don't get much info on it at all.. Like what it is, where it came from, how long it's been here? They do explain why its in New York and what it wants.<br/><br/>There actually presentation of the movies also is hurt by the fact The Blair Witch Project looked steady compared to this stomach churner. The movie keep looked into like a vise tho and made me feel like i was along for the ride. I also feel i want more! i want to know what happened after the movie ended, why is the movie named Cloverfield, will there be a sequel? i have to know!! <br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie tho is at the very end when you realize that Rob and the monsters fates are tied together long before the attack. I almost missed it but at end there is a scene with the camera overlooking the sea and i think you can see the alien creature splash down in the ocean!! i was impressed.<br/><br/>P.S. The Star Trek trailer got me so pumped!!"
"arcades_on_fire","7","2","7","16 January 2008"," Pretty Darn Decent
","One thing I have to commend Abrams on is his marketing. If I had known anything about this movie before I went and saw it today it would've lessened the impact greatly as you literally spend half the movie trying to piece the monster together out of hurried camera shots until finally everything is revealed. Thats not to say EVERYTHING is revealed. In fact, nothing is revealed except what the monster looks like, how bad ass it is and how screwed humans are. So don't expect any investigation into why the monster's in New York, why it got there etc etc...<br/><br/>The presentation is aesthetically pleasing, at times dizzying, but nothing groundbreaking. It manages to carry an otherwise stereotypical storyline all the way to the finish in fantastic flair.<br/><br/>Cloverfield's faithfulness to the handicam style is really what makes and breaks the film as while it provides a more personal and realistic experience, nothing goes beyond the boundaries of the camera so don't expect any answers whatsoever. <br/><br/>The storyline is where Cloverfield falters, as it is essentially 1997's Godzilla shot from a handicam - a pretty sturdy one at that - so nothing revolutionary and it will not be replacing my Evil Dead collection somewhere near the top of my DVD pile.<br/><br/>Cloverfield blatantly lauds style over substance and it is pretty much exactly what would happen if anybody picked up a camera and started recording during a giant monster invasion. It makes for an entertaining cinematic roller coaster but nothing truly great.<br/><br/>Has Abrams and Reeves created America's own Godzilla? No, probably not. Gozilla is timeless and fairly simple in design, the Cloverfield monster is too complex and awkward, original nonetheless but I'd pick Godzilla in a fight."

"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","2","8","4 February 2008"," I have to say, I am extremely impressed
","I didn't want to see Cloverfield when I saw the trailer, it looked like another Blair Witch Project, it was going to get all our hopes up and then when it played, it would disappoint. But when my friend saw the film, she said that it was interesting and worth a look. So I went ahead and saw the film today and I was very impressed with the story. Even though the camera work made me a little nauseous, from where the story was told from made it all more real. It was interesting to see the film from the character's point of view and not only that, it looked so real and really scared the heck out of me. I was thinking how weird it was though that someone would record the whole thing, but in today's world, unfortunately, we have those people who think they are automatically professional documentations. This film was a mix of the 1950's sci-fi and Blair Witch that was actually scary.<br/><br/>A group of friends are having a celebration for a their friend, Rob, who is going away to Japan. In the middle of the party, Rob and a girl friend of his, Beth have a fight and she leaves. While a friend, Hud, is filming the party, a huge crash happens in the middle of Manhattan, they go outside and see the Statue of Liberty's head in the middle of the street and see something like Godzilla destroying the city. As the group makes a run for it, Rob hears a voice mail on his cell from Beth that she's trapped, he, his brother's girlfriend, Lily, Hud with the camera, and Marlena go to get her, but end up getting attacked by little creatures. But when three survive, they continue on to save Beth, but time is running out before Manhattan is truly gone.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a good film because it's different than any other horror film we have seen for a while. Believe me, it's a thousand times better than the Blair Witch Project, this has truly scary and intense moments that will leave you breathless and make you feel like you're right there with the group just wishing to get out of there. Strangely, there is a love story in here that was actually touching, Rob is so determined to get to Beth and he risks his life big time, even though there's a possibility she's already dead, so it added some terrific emotion to the story. Cloverfield is a great horror film, I was very impressed and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"riverview8989","1","2","8","25 January 2008"," Horrible Pretentious Movie
","I wanted to like the movie, the people who edited the trailers should be given an award for making this film look actually interesting. The movie technically begins, but doesn't take of after close to 20 minutes of hipster types talking useless banter, trying to create some sort of depth to a shallow script. Many people have complained about the camera movements, I however found this to be a perk, added some interest to a bland film. Cloverfield tried desperately to paint three love stories in the backdrop of the monster chaos in NYC, this however it did abysmally. The film would have been better served had they focused more on action, and less on character development, when the films running time is short enough as it is, and having used almost 2/3 of the running time trying to set up the opening ""party scene they did not use their screen time wisely. The cast as an ensemble left much to be desired, especially the leads. It seemed as if JJ Abrams plucked a few hopefulls from a college acting course and threw them in front of a green screen. All in all, if you do watch the movie, be prepared to wait and wait for the movie to take of, and then be prepared for an ending thats nothing short of ludicrous. Save your time, effort, and money and instead treat yourself to a movie actually worth watching."
"chicachick14","10","2","8","19 January 2008"," Best Monster Movie Ever
","When I saw the preview for Cloverfield, I was very excited. The hype was contagious. I had huge expectations for this movie and that made me wary because like most movies that have the kind of hype Cloverfield does, expectations turn into disappointments. It happens a little too often.<br/><br/>But within the first 2 minutes of the movie I knew my expectations were about to be lived up to, in fact they blown away.<br/><br/>This is by far the most entertaining monster movie ever made. I've never enjoyed one so thoroughly. The first person camera is extremely effective and it truly made me feel like I was one of the characters. I appreciated that they used more unknown actors. The characters were equal, thanks to no major actor stealing the show.The monster itself is effectively menacing and the small monsters that drop off of the large monster are used so well to deliver the scariest parts, yet are not over used. The camera work may make weak stomached folks queasy, but it truly adds to the chaos and fear that any person in that situation would experience.<br/><br/>I think a majority of the movie was unscripted, which if true gives the air of panic and true fear with genuine feel. I loved the fact that it didn't go down the Stephen Spielberg route, needing 20 mins of needless dialog to spoon feed the story to the movie going masses. It makes you wonder before, during and after just where this monster came from, and why its so indestructible.I cannot stress enough that people should and need to see this movie. It is movie going at its finest, its passionate, intense and terrifying.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is one of those defining movies that will hopefully reanimate a genre that has long been played out, predictable and boring. The movie is at its best on the big screen, it might not have the same effect on DVD. <br/><br/>A cinematic experience not to be missed and finally a monster movie worth the movie ticket."
"browstg","7","2","8","17 January 2008"," Go ahead and see it, you will be entertained.
","As with most monster movies, the monster in this movie is awesome enough to outshine bad writing, bad camera work, and a bad plot. The monster, in fact, is so awesome that I would recommend seeing this movie just for the grainy, fleeting glimpses you get of it. It's been said that the monster is based on H.P. Lovecraft's Mythos, and I can definitely see the connection there, although there's no direct connection to any of Lovecraft's monsters specifically. Several scenes are directly ripped off from Blair Witch, and if you had any problems with that movie (like I did) you will have the same problems with this movie. Given the unrealistic reactions of the main characters and the totally unbelievable elements of this movie, there are still enough explosions and destruction to keep things moving. It would be nice to have more story revolving the monster, but I'm sure that's coming in the sequel."
"degeneration_xtreme","10","2","8","16 January 2008"," Great Movie
","I just saw this movie an hour ago in Australia.<br/><br/>The movie itself is very original with a great story to it made better with it being shot through hand held camera.<br/><br/>The monster itself you actually only see twice in it's whole but even then it is quite hard to take in all the details of it, while the rest of the movie you see bits and pieces of it. It isn't explained were it came from or why. It also seems to reproduce what seems like some spider monkeys with several legs and the head of a piranha while displaying different characteristics to the actual big creature it self.<br/><br/>The main characters were very good and it was made a lot better by not being big name holly wood stars. Also at the end of the movie you aren't really told if one of the main characters actually escaped in the helicopter. It does take a while to get into the movie before it does come extremely intense and you really want to know what happens next or if it has ended, as there were several times in the movie when you think it is over but it isn't.<br/><br/>Overall J.J.

","This is the worse movie I've seen in years. Aside from the dizziness and headache it caused me,the story is soooooooo unrealistic. How could somebody be so stupid to carry a camera in a situation where your life is at stake and still have time to have its lens focused on their face. They're not some war journalist for crying out loud. Everybody were moving out of the city and here is this guy going the opposite direction along with his friends who were also not using brains..The monster should have eaten them in the first few minutes of the movie so that we could go on with the story.He and his friends almost got eaten and yet still went out to look for his girlfriend. I should have stayed at home and not spent my money on this piece of crap. Watching cartoons would have been much fun than this. No wonder the theater was not packed with viewers.

","My recommendation, save your money and wait till it's released on video, but if you do go, bring aspirin and plenty of it. While I'm sitting there trying to watch the film and feeling my head spin, I happen to notice that some of the people were getting up and walking out on the movie and they never came back. I stayed till the end, hoping it was going to get better, I was sadly wrong. I was not alone in my feelings either all of the remaining people were booing the screen as the credits rolled on. I even heard a couple of people saying that they wanted their money back. Alright, alright I'm not saying that the movie was all bad, I think that the idea behind it was a very good, interesting idea, the movie I feel just needed a little more control and lots more on character depth and feel. The monster, I feel like it was really nothing new or special about it. They probably would have done better if they had just stuck Godzilla or the Staypufft Marshmellow Man in there as the big bad creature instead."
"my_anywhere","9","2","9","21 January 2008"," Cloverfield: The Explanation
","I already wrote a review the night I saw this movie, but I need to change what I wrote because I just went through and read a whole bunch of reviews that were complete sh*t. Let me start by saying I have never seen such a huge bunch of weak stomachs in my life. Some of you said a lot of people ran out of the theater sick. Where do you live? Lameville? I sat through this entire movie, as did the rest of the people in the theater I was in, and not a single person left feeling sick at all. If you are running away from a giant monster you are not going to have a steady-cam, so what did you expect? Next, this movie didn't have all the answers because it was shown just as it was supposedly ""recovered"" from the scene of the attack. People experiencing the attack are going to be less bothered about finding answers than they are about getting the hell away from the giant, 300-foot tall monster attacking them. If you want an answer to where it came from, watch the very last scene closely and look behind the characters at the background of the frame, that gives you mondo clue to where the thing came from, so don't say they didn't give you anything. As for no character development? I don't know what movie you were watching, but Cloverfield has ten times more character development than 80% of the movies Hollywood turns out nowadays. What do you think the entire beginning 15 minutes was all about? Oh, and the ""Why are those 15 minutes even there?"" this is supposed to be a real videotape meaning that the characters in the movie didn't go out expecting to videotape a monster attack, they were expecting to videotape a going-away party. Someone else said there was no plot. I'm going to try not to spoil anything, but the plot was that there's a giant monster attacking Manhattan island and 5 people are trying to survive the attack while documenting it. Also, they discover that someone the main character cares about is in trouble, so they go to help her! How is that not a plot? Write a comment when you actually know what you're talking about."
"villifiedgd","9","2","9","21 January 2008"," Why all the grumbling?
","I know a lot of people have been whining about certain aspects of this movie ie; the shaky-cam, the ending, the beginning... I see all of those complaints as being reasonable but why it is being touted as ""garbage"" by people is beyond me. I don't recall the trailers telling people It will move you....A Masterpiece.....Oscar Contender. No this was a balls to the walls MONSTER MOVIE, the only way I can explain it is as a theme park ride. If Universal Studios had this thing I would be there right now. Who cares about the creatures origins? This wasn't about introducing us to the next Godzilla, it was about throwing us into a crazy situation and letting us feel the hysteria felt by the characters. I personally wish more Hollywood blockbusters were like this, I mean the plots to those are usually just thrown together to pad the running time anyways, at least this movie gave you something you haven't seen before. Besides a few thousand unlucky souls in NY none of us have experienced this amount of pandemonium in our lives. Maybe not everyones cup of tea, but it was a rush to sit through.<br/><br/>Personally my only complaint is the beginning, I know they wanted to set up and easy to relate to situation for us. But these characters were not real and the things they said and did were not real. The ""Guy Talk"" about Beth was ridiculous, I don't ever recall my friends actually talking to me like I was in a Real World episode. So its funny that the only thing resembling a story is what bugged a good chunk of us. This is because we wanted a thrill ride, and we got one, it just took about 15 minutes longer to get there than we wanted. But when it did it kicked my a**. Also there were a number of people talking behind me about the shaky-cam ""do you want to leave? I told you it was like this, so stupid"" They stuck it out for about 15 minutes and then the first attack came and their a**es never left their seats. Neither will yours, unless you have some nervous tick that makes you hate movies well things aren't spelled out to you. I mean honestly, would it make the movie better if they were like: OMG thats a Gidransaurus!!! It was thought to be extinct in the Jurassic Period only to resurface because of chemical waste from earth pollution! I think that may ruin it.<br/><br/>Anyone who got past the lack of back story in Children of Men and saw what a great movie that was(though Children of Men is in a totally different league), will see what I saw in Cloverfield. Thrill ride from Hell....New York."

","I agree with your comments. I thought the POV camera really intensified everything that was going on, even if I thought the actors were a little lame. But after a while I noticed that I didn't think of them as actors any more- I thought of them as real people.<br/><br/>THIS is how Blair Witch failed- while I enjoyed the concept of Blair Witch, I always felt that it failed to achieve its goal of really frightening people. Instead, it was a very long and poorly shot film that circumvented the scary stuff for as long as possible, finally starting to get into some weird things by the time the movie was over. Cloverfield trims the ""fat"" off a sturdy plot line, goes for the jugular, and really puts you in the characters' high-heeled shoes.<br/><br/>This movie will stick with you for a while. I do recommend it."
"movie_lover928","7","2","9","19 January 2008"," A Simple Yet Entertaining Monster Movie
","So i went to see ""Cloverfield"" yesterday and i know a lot of you are dying to see it. So i decided to write a review about it.<br/><br/>The story of ""Cloverfield"" is simple. A bunch of people are hanging out and minding their own business when the city is attacked by a huge creature and they have to try to make it out of the situation alive. Its your basic monster movie plot and there's nothing really special or different about the plot to make it anything more than your basic monster movie plot. The characters are all fairly shallow. The only ones who have any real sort of depth are the Rob and Beth characters but they aren't much deeper than the rest of the cast. Any actor aiming for an Oscar are likely not going to get a nomination for these roles. Not because they're bad actors but because there's not much to work with when it comes to these characters.<br/><br/>Speaking of the acting, everyone did what they could with these characters. There aren't any breakthrough performances here but at the same time there aren't any terrible performances either. It's all pretty average. In fact, most of the acting consisted of running and screaming and the occasional fall now and then. But the parts when they weren't running and screaming were pretty convincing so props to the cast there.<br/><br/>The special effects were undeniably good with this film. The visuals of the tore up and broken New York city were pretty beautiful as ironic as the sounds. The most impressive visuals, in my opinion, were the statue of liberty's head when it came crashing down into the streets. Watching that scene in the commercials is great and all but you really have to see that on the big screen to get the full effect of it. To put it simply, this movie had some really great special effects. Not as great as the special effects of ""Transformers"" but then again i doubt that anything in the next few years will be able to top that movie in the special effects department.<br/><br/>Anyway. The one big complaint that i have against this movie is the way it was made. Don't get me wrong. The concept of the film and how it is shown through a hand held camera was a brilliant idea but that was the very reason the made this movie extremely hard for me to watch. The camera was really shaky, especially during the scenes where the camera man was running. Halfway through the movie I had to tilt my head back and take deep breaths and i had to continue this every few minutes so i was watching a lot of the second half of the movie through the corner of my eye. I usually don't get motion sickness but this movie really had my stomach turning.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that if you can get past the shaky camera you'll have yourself a simple yet entertaining monster movie. But if you're looking for something that will make you ""feel"" things this is not the movie for you. As long as you don't look too far into ""Cloverfield"" and just take it for what it is i'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it. And you might want to bring a barf bag just in case.<br/><br/>My Overall Rating: 7 out of 10"
"Cmcwill06","10","2","9","19 January 2008"," For all who say it sucks, you missed the point
","First of all, commend the actors for such long cut scenes, imagine how difficult a movie must be when after 5 minutes of shooting ( with a camera intended to move all over the place)on one scene someone skrews up a line and you have to start over. Second, of course the camera is everywhere, your supposed to get the feel your in the chaotic setting.<br/><br/>There's no explanations, because the main characters don't know. thats the point, your not supposed to know whats going on, you cant pretend like you weren't into this movie, the movie is great and it delivers an experience and not the same tired cliques. ( except of course giant monster attacking new york city)<br/><br/>Its the answerless, suspenseful, scary chaos that one would expect if this were an actual situation. Spoiler - Take for example when they rush the girl who gets bitten into quarantine. Instead of doing a resident evil style explanation as to what happens when your bitten, they just keep the movie going because guess what? The characters the movie is focused on don't know. Hud's camera is all over the place because hes being pushed around while hes trying to find out whats going on. Get it? Your there! your trying to figure out what the hell is going on just like the character!"
"dangeles","9","2","9","18 January 2008"," Cloverfield: Must See
","I saw a midnight screening of Cloverfield last night and I must say....I was highly impressed....I first found out about the movie early last year when Spider Man hit the theaters with Cloverfield as a preview....I was intrigued since that time. I was worried that after so much hype and anticipation I would be let down by the actual film itself, but to my surprise, I enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>It's basically a fictional documentary about a group of young people in New York City when a mysterious creature (monster) surfaces and begins destroying Manhattan. This is what you see in the previews, but underlying the surface, the film has some comedy, intense action, suspense, a love story and more. Basically, it actually had a plot. The movie is more about the characters and their story, than the monster itself. You won't be disappointed though because you WILL see the monster and it's not just a brief glimpse...or teaser as I call them.<br/><br/>The only draw back to the movie is the cinematography. The film is recorded in a first hand person point of view. In close comparison to the way ""The Blair witch Project"" was filmed. You're seeing what is going on as if you were behind the camera. Although it can get a little bumpy at times...you never really think about it because you are so entranced with the film and the character themselves. Don't let this deter you. The film had an unpredictable ending that left me wanting a little more but closed the movie enough to satisfy my curiosity. With a good story line and everything that I have mentioned above I would Highly Recommend this flick as a must see. Make sure to let me know what you think when you do!! :D aniel"
"lightzonlycast","8","2","9","18 January 2008"," Words can't express how awesome it was, but I'll try anyways
","If you aren't already a little curious about this movie, you've been living under a rock since Transformers came out. We've all seen the trailers, we all know the tag lines, hell we even knew the damn release date before we knew the name of the movie.<br/><br/>Like most, the idea of seeing the Statue of Liberty decapitated in a trailer very much made me want to know what the hell 1-18-08 was. Then the title came out, followed by one of the most ingenious viral marketing campaigns ever. Bottom line, whether or not you wanted to see it, you knew what Cloverfield was.<br/><br/>The trailers hit. At my particular showing, you got a trailer for Step Up 2, some MMA movie that looked God awful, and a teaser for the new Star Trek film (also being produced by J.J. Abrams). Bad start I must admit, as I don't like Star Trek and all of the rest of the films were things I'd never see, even for free.<br/><br/>Then the film started. The whole opening and character development was to be honest rather weak. You're given sorted little details about people and then they flip the script so you feel bad for the main character Rob (played AWESOMELY by Michael Stahl-David) cause this chick he is in love with is totally with another guy and blah blah blah. Like I said, a little boring. 20 minutes in though, the actual attack begins. From then on this movie is edge of your seat.<br/><br/>I won't give away much of the plot (everyone should already know what it's about), only critique it. The character development was pretty bad at first, but while you watch these kids through the eyes of a video camera (the whole film is shot via hand held camera a la The Blair Witch Project)you actually really get into it. The plot itself is pretty basic and doesn't require you to really engage the script to understand what is going on. Go into this flick prepared to focus on visuals.<br/><br/>Visually, even with the flaws that come with a hand held camera (meaning if you get motion sickness this might really suck for you) the visuals were unbelievable (in a good way). In the trailer, when you see the head of the Statue of Liberty get hurled across the screen, you really don't think much of it; in the film however, this scene will give you chills. It's important to note that while the monster has very little on screen time, the path of destruction it leaves is enough to scare the hell out of you. The images in this film FEEL one-hundred percent legit, and that's what made this movie really enjoyable and genuinely terrifying. Director Matt Reeves did an amazing job capturing a city that is in utter chaos. The special effects in this movie are mainly limited to explosions and such and looked dramatically realistic as well, big plus for a film nowadays where it has become the norm to have the CGI not look all that great. The team really nailed every aspect of the visual, I can't stress that enough.<br/><br/>As far as the sound department goes, they must have had a hard time doing this film. Where many movies rely on a score or soundtrack to build tension, this film had to rely simply on the sounds made by the actual monster, explosions, and people, and they did a fantastic job. One of the this most horror films lack nowadays are awesomely put together sound fx, which make the movies fall flat. When you hear the roar of the monster, you're freaking out, so you know they did their job damn well.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part was nothing to write home about. In fact, you don't really pay much attention to whether the acting is good or bad simply because you are so caught up in the visual. As mentioned before, the main character you will focus on is Rob, and to his credit Michael Stahl-David did a great job portraying emotion on screen (which is to be expected as he has done theatre in the past).<br/><br/>To write a review of this film won't do it any justice, it's just something you have to see for yourself as the devastation can not be put into words. The carnage you witness on the screen will no doubt make up for the lack of screen time the monster actually has, but when you finally do see the monster in all of its glory (yes, it is glorious) it makes everything well worth it. The only thing I really have left to say is kudos to the crew who worked on this film because you did something that is damn near impossible to do when making a movie about a giant monster attacking a city: you made a film that didn't really at all remind me of Godzilla.<br/><br/>Overall I'd give this film a full 10 stars because it's going to leave you focused entirely on the action and when it's all over, you're going to want to talk about it."
"thejacksonlp","9","2","9","17 January 2008"," Amazing
","Cloverfield was always in danger of dying by not being able to live up to it's own hype, but coming from someone who wasn't closely following the viral marketing and waiting with bated breath for any new piece of news on the film, the final product is one of the most impressively engaging films I've seen in a long while.<br/><br/>It's pretty much 4 people going through a torn to pieces New York city whilst a huge creature who's origins are unknown rampages through it. The action is 'documented' through a domestic handy cam, and the rest takes care of itself.<br/><br/>A lot of people are complaining that the story is weak, or there are things not explained, the ending is too abrupt and so on. What these people fail to realise is that this is no conventional film. First of all, you can't really devise a clever, compelling story from the a film that is intended to be viewed as a real life, homemade, handy cam job. (In the context of the story) There is no experienced Director calling the shots, the man behind the camera is not a professional cinematographer, it's a regular person doing their best to capture the madness that has gripped the city. It's from the first person perspective of people caught in this chaos. So if you expect high quality visual storytelling on a level such as the Coen brothers, you really are being naive.<br/><br/>I personally feel that if the origins of the monster and the whole ""what happens next"" song and dance would have let this film down. The sudden ending keeps with the nature of a real life essence of the thing. You only see and hear what you need to and you can draw whatever conclusions you want after it's over. The final 15-20 minutes you know that an event will occur that will likely end the picture, and when it arrives, that's it. I didn't think the ending was abrupt or annoying at all. An annoyingly abrupt ending would be something like the batteries on the camera running out in the middle a big action sequence. There's none of that here.<br/><br/>If you don't go into this film expecting a simple, fast & loud wild ride then you will be disappointed. But if you do take it for what it is, it'll be one of the cinematic highlights of the year."
"ryanlammi","9","2","9","17 January 2008"," Better Than I Expected
","I have to admit that I was pretty hyped going into the movie on Wednesday. I think the cinematography was brilliant. Who wants another monster movie where everything is explained to you while leaving no room for your own interpretation. No one wants another Godzilla. The way this movie was done lets you know a very limited amount of information about the scenario. They don't give the monster a name or explain where it comes from. The only information you know by the end of the movie is what the main characters know. This allows you to feel like you are running around Manhattan with them. Despite the fact that the movie is supposed to be in the view of a person's camcorder the quality is still excellent. The movie is amazing and is definitely not one of the worst movies that will come out this year. A lot of thought was put into the making of this movie and the finished product definitely reflects that. As for the male characters seeming like the same person, you have to keep in mind that there are only three male characters with much time, and majority of the time there are only two. One guy is behind the camera, and only other guy for majority of the movie is the main character. How this is confusing I don't know... The movie is not perfect, but it deserves a 9 or 10 out of 10. Go see it and judge for yourself."
"Kaino1212","8","2","9","17 January 2008"," Chillingly unique...
","At the beginning of 'Cloverfield' you get the feeling that the documentary-like way the film is shot etc will be annoying and get rather tiresome by the end of it's running time. Funnily enough, you ease into it and it soon fades out of your attention. The beginning of the film gives you a look into the characters and does so in quite a different way due to the home video feel. Surprisingly, you slide nicely into the false sense of security the beginning presents. But this eventually dissipates into one of the most frightening, exceptionally well done and thought provoking sci-fi thrillers that we'll probably see this year, or for many years to come.<br/><br/>Though it is not for the jumpy ladies, it definitely is for the lads who take jumpy ladies to films to frighten them into a cuddle. Your pretty much cuddle-guaranteed with 'Cloverfield'. Amazing CG, superb acting, unique feel (doing what Blair Witch failed to do) and you really leave wondering with a slight chill down your spine.<br/><br/>See it."

The sound was magnificent and the suspense brilliant. People are complaining about the camera work, but it gave exactly the feeling which I always wanted to have in a movie. The feeling that you are actually experiencing what they have been through.<br/><br/>You don't see to to much of the monster and it did not bother me one bit. Do not watch this movie for the story but for the whole experience. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely a cinema roller-coaster!"
"MandersonPWNs","9","2","9","17 January 2008"," Cloverfield isn't for everyone, but it's definitely for me.
","I saw an advanced screening of Cloverfield on the 16th and came away from the movie both entertained and impressed. The movie, as I'm sure you all know, is shot entirely from a hand-held camera pov. Doing this took a lot of guts and I think that ultimately it pays off much more than just an easy on the eyes cookie cutter monster movie. Yes, there ARE sequences where you literally cannot see anything that is happening (specifically when the camera operator is running), but little glimpses of action and excellent use of off camera sound make for an even more effective film in my opinion. If The Bourne Ultimatum made you queasy with its shaky cam, then Cloverfield will send you into convulsions. However, I loved the film, and the realism stuck with me(On my drive home I half expected a monster to leap up and kick down the Sears Tower). Also, this movie has a great sense of humor from the character Hud, who spends most of his time off screen being the camera operator, but often finds opportunities for colorful one liners to lighten the mood. All in all, Cloverfield isn't a perfect movie, but it's definitely entertaining and the best attempt I've ever seen at this kind of film making (Blair Witch sucked!!!)."

It's for people who can follow a fast-paced story (which is not that complicated), frequent jump cuts and a pretty shaky camera. The beauty in the film is that it's so convincing. From the moment I started watching I was convinced that these were real people. Why? The dialogue is snappy and what you'd expect from people their age. The characters are also persuasively youthful. I would disagree that the pacing and detachment of the film are a hindrance. The quickness with which critical events occur is literally breathtaking. As with what could be believed to be reality, the film doesn't magically slow down to illustrate death. There are no pauses. Things just happen. It's great."

","No spoilers here, just a warning. Cloverfield isn't great in a 'godfather'/'lord of the rings' totally awesome story telling kind-of way. BUT, the idea of movies is to immerse you in another world for a few hours and make you feel something different and forget about your problems. There is no better movie at this than 'Cloverfield.' The first person perspective that Hud's camera gives you leads to a totally intense and personal experience. Rarely does it feel forced and it never fails to offer the requisite monster movie thrills and still have time to allow you to feel empathy for character's in key moments.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time i forgot i was just watching a movie.<br/><br/>Video gamers will already know the feeling from 'Half Life''Halo' and 'Doom 3' and i couldn't help but think if they used a similar first person perspective on the Doom movie, you would have had a far scarier and involving cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Best of all (and unlike 'Lost' or 'Blair Witch') it is never boring and doesn't wear out its welcome. Just remember to keep breathing."
"leonghk12","6","2","9","17 January 2008"," Cloverfield review
","The entire show was literally hand-held footage. It was very shaky throughout the show. Due to the fact that it's a hand-held footage, the perspective of the whole show was very limited. It's basically from a first person point of view. It's like comparing between watching a football match in a bird eyes' view and a close up replay on a few players, except that it's really shaky and can be pointless sometimes. If you do not like the close up and limited view then this is not a show for you. However, there's suspense throughout the show, and quite some bits of thrills and excitements.Ending was too abrupt though and lots of parts left unexplained. Not a bad movie overall."

The movie is less than an hour and a half but I was waiting for it to be over by the end of the movie. I enjoyed the way the movie was shot from a perspective of a dude holding a camcorder it made the movie seem to be more realistic and gave the impression that the viewer was seeing the movie first hand.<br/><br/>While I wouldn't not recommend to see this movie in theaters due to the outrageous ticket prices I would wait to see this movie on DVD. The camera style resembled a Blair Witch style which other horror movies should follow because it made the viewer connect with the characters. This style also forces the viewer to only know the same things the characters of the movie know.<br/><br/>In my opinion I would wait to see this movie on DVD but if you want to watch a movie that is shot interestingly and done in an interesting way this movie could be great for you. This could be the type of movie that could spawn a completely different breed of horror movies and this would not be a bad thing by any means."

This film may have used a little of J.J.'s money and his name, but it's not a J.J. Abrams film.<br/><br/>As for the content, the film is a little slow.

At times, it's easy to forget that this was supposed to be a disaster film, because there is no disaster and the filming of the party gets boring.<br/><br/>Lizzy Caplan is great in every role she plays, and she carries this film.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect in 2019 is use of the technology in the film. ""Taping Over"" something is a concept that some viewers in 2019 (and most viewers in the future) will not understand. Since ""taping over the past"" is central to the storyline, 'Cloverfield' (2008) will eventually become a cultural nostalgia piece. The effects are dated and cheesy, the technology is dated already, and this will become a film that people watch to see the past - not to enjoy a SciFi/Disaster film.<br/><br/>RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

","Just saw this now with my wife at home on a 50 inch tv. Wife got sick and dizzy after about 10 minutes and I stopped the movie. Watched something else and finished the movie by myself sometime later. I understand what they were trying to do here but really? This could've been a great horror/action flick but the handheld camera action made it almost unwatchable. If this happened for real and your life was in danger, would you film it constantly? Nope you'd fight for your life. There's a movie in there, somewhere but they forgot to properly put it on film. Two stars for the effort and blowing 40 million on a shaky mess."

","Cloverfield is a mixed bag. I enjoyed the film, but there are problems that I had and that others might have with the film. Cloverield is another attempt by America to do our own original monster movie. This time they used the found footage format to make it their own. Compared to other American monster movies or monster movies in general, I'd say that this is my second favorite. Though, as I said the film has problems.<br/><br/>With Kong Skull Island being first, I'd say this is my second favorite American giant monster movie. I like this more than most Godzilla movies, and I like Godzilla. I even like it more than Pacific Rim. What makes it good for me is the different approach they took. Instead of focusing on the monster attacking and the military fighting it they focus only on a select group of average people trying to survive, get out of the city, and find out what's going on.<br/><br/>They focus all of it on the civilian point of view of what they're going through and they show the immense destruction and casualties from that angle, which you rarely see in other movies like this. It's supposed to be more real in this is what it would really be like if a giant monster did attack a huge city. Plus it took place entirely at night which evoked a greater sense of despair and atmosphere in the film which added to the realistic angle they were going for.<br/><br/>They also kept the monster mostly in the background or in quick clips until the end which evoked a sense of mystery of what it was or where it came from. The latest Godzilla movie tried something similar but it didn't work. It worked in this film and not that Godzilla movie in 2014 because we already knew what Godzilla was, so keeping him in the shadows the entire movie is pointless, other than to save on the budget. Here it works better because we know nothing of the monster so there's more mystery behind it. Also the character in Cloverfield, while not that great either, were still more interesting than the ones in Godzilla 2014.<br/><br/>One complaint I have is the found footage format. I like that they tried a different approach to making a monster movie, but it did not always work for me. The point was to get a sense of realism and put the viewer right in the action like you're actually with these characters during this major attack. It was trying to be a more real experience.<br/><br/>However, the camera was too shaky and it often did not focus on a shot long enough for the viewer to completely take in what was happening. Though I could buy it in the beginning, as the film went on, I found it hard to believe that they would not drop the camera. It would've been better if it had just been a regular movie revolving around these people trying to survive a monster attack.<br/><br/>Another problem is the characters. I did not find them annoying, but I thought they were bland. I did not find one of them especially interesting. They weren't terrible characters. I got with them enough to be invested in the story and what happens to them, but there's nothing much to them either.<br/><br/>The effects were good. I thought that the design of the monster was cool and looked very original. There was a ton of hype surrounding this film when the teaser first came out. People were wondering what this thing was that was destroying New York City. Some were probably let down by the fact that it was a monster. I did not get into the immense hype this film generated so I was okay with it. This film also had a great atmosphere to it as well.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy this film. However, it is not for everyone. If you can't stand the found footage style or you're not a fan of giant monster flicks, for both, than this isn't for you. If you got into the hype like so many did and wanted something more than just a monster than you'll be disappointed. However, if you just want a fun and slightly more realistic take on a monster movie then check this out. I admit I didn't like this film when I first saw it but it grew on me. Now I actually think it's fairly good despite its faults."
"Woodyanders","8","1","3","6 December 2018"," Super intense creature feature
","A group of young folks find themselves in considerable jeopardy after a vicious giant monster suddenly attacks New York City.<br/><br/>Director Matt Reeves, working from a tight script by Drew Goddard, takes time to develop the characters, grounds the fantastic premise in a believable everyday reality, and generates plenty of nerve-wracking tension. The total absence of a music score and the expert use of a shaky hand-held portable camera give this picture a bracing, riveting, and above all extremely harrowing sense of immediacy and intimacy that basically puts the viewer in the thick of the terrifying action just like the hapless people in the movie; the acute feeling of blind panic and complete chaos is frighteningly well captured. Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Michael Stahl-David, Mike Vogel, and Odette Annable are all credible as the imperiled protagonists. The scenes of destruction -- the Statue of Liberty's decapitated head rolls down a street, the Brooklyn Bridge gets demolished -- are quite potent and startling. The grim ending also packs a shocking punch. The special effects are convincingly done. An on the money nail biter."

As an extra special bonus, the first 15 or 20 minutes of the movie is nothing but 21 year old drama that doesn't further the plot whatsoever. All you need to know is guy #1 is with girl #1 and guy #2 is with girl #2. It doesn't matter that somebody is moving to Japan or somebody likes a different girl. Nothing matters. Think of any horror movie with an ""attacker"". We know the origin of Freddy, Jason, Michael Meyers, even the piranhas, (as stupid as that movie was). Something doesn't just show up and start killing people randomly (except Jaws, which shouldn't even be mentioned along with this movie). Just because it's shot on a hand held cam doesn't give it any credibility. It's been done before and it doesn't automatically make something creative or revolutionary.

","Cloverfield 6/10 The opening twenty minutes of the film might hold the dullest scenes in any movie I've seen. The party provides nothing to the movie, no good character development, interesting dialog or purpose. It's a terrible party I'd leave in real life. Getting past those initial scenes and into the bulk of the monster film is well worth the wait. The fact that the monster is never shown right away is a great tease, which builds up the wanting to see more throughout the film. The monster itself looks realistically clammy and the little monster fleas that come off of it are a great little twist into the equation. The destruction scenes by the movie are great and so are the military action effects. The story, dialog, and action scenes improve as the movie goes forth. Although the ending is typical of a giant monster film its filmed well and tops of the hopeless feeling perfectly."

","I finally watched Cloverfield, which I've been interested in ever since the mysterious trailers came out and impressed my monster-movie-loving-middle-school self years ago...and I wasn't let down. This could have easily turned out to be a lame gimmick flick (and many people will see it as that) with all of the shaky cam and found footage aspects, but I never found those to be a hindrance to my enjoyment of the movie and I even thought that it enhanced the atmosphere and mood of the disaster. After seeing the newest Godzilla movie recently, Cloverfield came along and gave me everything that I thought was wrong about Godzilla 2014. It shows a human perspective and a city dealing with chaos that came out of nowhere. Shocking, chilling, impressive...all shown in a way that reflects a lot of the fears from 9/11 (a lot of the footage reminds me of some scenes from 102 Minutes That Changed America. Instead of focusing on the monster (which I thought could have looked cooler) it focuses on the human reactions in dealing with the problem. BUT, it does have its fair share of monster movie glory. The destruction looks great. Buildings collapsing, explosions, smaller faster monsters, a good amount of gore, screaming citizens, military action...it's all there, just with a unique twist in the form of hand-held camera-work. It's definitely not a great quality movie when considering all of the standards in assessing film, there are flaws. The actors aren't great, the writing is below average, the constant commentary gets a little old. But I'm willing to overlook all of these just because it's a monster movie that I think really captured the initial and following moments of terror in discovering a huge alien creature destroying all of Manhattan. There is also a romantic sideplot added in, which I wasn't too excited about, although I will admit it adds a whole element that adds a personal touch. Annnd although it could have been better, I have no complaints about the ending. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 Watch again?: With pleasure"

","This is NOT a good movie. It has a terrible plot, awful characters that you couldn't give a toss about, wooden acting of the ""scream and run"" variety, takes an interminable 30 mins to get going (said 30 mins taken up with incredibly boring scenes from a farewell party for upwardly mobile brats - out of frustration I fast forwarded to the good bits) and has an annoying shaky cam for the entire duration. The camera wielder makes things worse by being whiny and yelling inanely throughout the movie. It was an enormous relief when he finally snuffed it. Nothing in the movie made sense especially not the gang of idiots charging around a city in the middle of an intergalactic war and not taking the many opportunities to get out. And last but not least, the ending. Seriously bad & totally predictable. There were so many plot holes in this thing it resembled swiss cheese. I wont go into them all, I notice some other reviewers have covered some. Suffice to say, there are dozens more of them. Nothing is explained about the sudden arrival of the monster either. No build up to it or context at all. This leaves the whole movie without much of a foundation. There was nothing here that was original, fresh, unexpected or interesting apart from.... THE SPECIAL EFFECTS which were reasonably good. All of my points are for that and that alone. If only this had been more about the monster and less about the use of terrible gimmicky camera and sappy half-baked love plots. <br/><br/>Watch The Host instead, it has heart and soul as well as a brilliant story and awesome effects. Or even The Bay which, tho not as good as The Host, has a far superior plot, engaging characterisations and better acting than Cloverfield. The Bay is so tightly constructed you are pretty much convinced it actually happened. You'd be hard-pressed to find a plot hole & the back story is brilliantly conceived. But more importantly the directors etc had a MILLION TIMES better grasp on how to use the ""found footage"" concept to it's best advantage to draw the viewer into the ""reality"" instead of annoying the cr*p out of & alienating them."

However, for whatever reason, I didn't get to see this brilliant film until now(pretty sad, I know). But luckily I was able to fix all of that just now and can honestly say I'm a better movie lover because of it. Everything starts out innocent and normal enough with a group of friends throwing a surprise going away party for their other friend when IT arrives and as soon as it does, all hell breaks lose. Feel the tension as our heroes try to find a messing a friend while battling the ever growing chaos caused by the destruction of the visitor and the breakdown of all law and order. What is this visitor? Well, let's just say that it isn't looking to make friends, that's for sure! What makes the film stand out above everything else is the chilling realism that the filmmakers are able to incorporate into the movie, from the realistic shaking of the camera to the excellent performances of all the actors involved. The more down to the wire things get, the faster and faster our hearts beat. I wish I could say more but this is really one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better (and more bone chilling) it will be.

"hbk_nwo33","10","1","3","27 August 2013"," Great monster movie that focuses more on the characters than the monster
","Cloverfield exceeds as both a monster flick and a horror movie. It does so by being old-school in its approach and showing restraint. The film is all about the characters placed in this situation, not getting carried away with plot or set pieces or making the film about the monster itself. Atmosphere is more important to establishing the horror for the characters, with them not feeling safe at any time after the party.<br/><br/>A good horror film knows that less is more, and that is a philosophy that Cloverfield nails. You rarely see the monsters face (only three times) and only see it in its entirety once. Instead you get glimpses that allow you imagination to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>The film's atmosphere is also to its credit, with the constant feeling of insecurity even though our characters don't face direct danger all that frequently, they never once feel safe. The anticipation of something horrific happening is much more powerful than the actual act itself, something that many modern horrors could do with taking into account. This is achieved, in part, by the hand-held camera effect, but it also a credit to the writing of Drew Goddard and direction of Matt Reeves. There is no fear of placing the characters, and the viewers, in complete darkness and situations that are barely lit and when you cannot see what's happening you naturally assume the worst in a situation like this. The amateurish camera work (with bad shifting focus, weird angles and close-ups, even sometimes missing the action) all immerse the viewer in the story of the characters within the invasion rather than just being a plot film centred around the invasion itself with characters secondary.<br/><br/>The performances are all good, particularly from Jessica Lucas and Lizzy Caplan, with every character progressing in some way over the course of the feature.<br/><br/>Rob's character progression relies solely on his relationship with Beth, initially reluctant to go after her at the party but after the accident he dedicates his life to save her. The love story between the two is sincere and endearing, you really believe that Rob would risk his life on the slightest chance that she is still alive. The abrupt cuts to their Coney Island trip (that is being recorded over) help their story, but the true heart of the work is done by Rob during the opening party sequence.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest character change throughout falls squarely at the feet of our designated cameraman: Hud. He is annoying to the point of almost being unbearable during first third of the film, with his endless stupidity and questioning, but as time goes on he becomes much more likable. His dedication to capture both the party and the 'Cloverfield incident' on camera is admirable, doing it simply because ""people will want to see this.""<br/><br/>A detail that is unlikely to be picked up by most people, but is still fantastic nonetheless, is that the film is the exact length of a DV Tape (the type of film the characters are filming on) to show a true dedication to the lost-footage genre. The opening governmental graphics were also very effective in giving the film a genuine feel of legitimacy (as well as providing LOST fans a little Easter egg)."

Yes, the monster is cool.the stupid hand-held camera didn't bother me. Yes, the special effects are great Fantastic casting, great acting, wonderful writing, excellent music, and camera work that perfectly suits the story.I like this movie a lot, it is something quite different from the usual comedy, drama, love story.

","The film was full of surprises and in each scene it made me more curious about what is going to happen next at the beginning of it. However, I did not find it that much realistic, though. There were too much exaggerations and it did not have any introduction. One of the reasons why I did not find it realistic is, not any camera's battery lasts this much long. The other valid reason for me is, no one can survive this long in this kind of disaster. On the other hand, the presentation of their friendship was nice, whereas the love story between the three of them was childish. After a quarter of the movie, when everybody started running, it was annoying that the handy- cam was very shaky. The idea of the shaky camera is an imitation of Blair Witch, I think. However, the special effects were good. The acting was decent, it was not that much bad. I did not get bored. Nevertheless, I regret to say that it is waste of money. We could not learn where the monster was coming from. The story was weak, furthermore, the ending of the film was really empty and left the viewers with full of questions without any answers."

","I hated this movie,it's way overrated. Don't get me wrong the acting was pretty good, and it didn't take to long for the action pack scenes to start either. The story plot was pretty good too. Giant monster bug takes over Manhattan and no one knows where it came from. Not bad at all! It also wasn't the fact that the movie was taken at a 'POV' hand held camera angle, since I'm used to those types of movies.I actually love those types of movies, Quarintine and Blair Witch Project being good examples. The problem with this movie is that it's BORING. Even though there are a lot of action/attacks scenes it was still boring. It did hold my attention for the first 40-50 minutes, but then I realized how boring this was. The characters themselves were bland with no personalities, they weren't likable, nor interesting. So that itself made me instantly hate this movie. If I don't care about the characters then the movie will be a waste. To make things worse the characters are stupid. For example Rob Hawkins(whose name I had to look up since he was so boring I forgot), makes it his mission to find some girl whose his girlfriend or sister (I really don't know), whose in trouble at her house. Even though there is a giant 100-200 foot monster attacking the city along with thousands of baby monsters running around, he goes out of his way to try and rescue her. His friends don't want to leave him alone so they decide to go as a group through the DARK subway tunnels. You may think he is brave and a so called hero but in my eyes he's dense, and so are the other characters even thought they tried to talk him out of it. The smart thing would have been to tell a trained soldier about his sister or girlfriend about her being in trouble! They would have got to her sooner and no one would have been killed or hurt. Oh did I mention that there were hundreds of soldiers in the streets trying to guide everyone to safety? But no that wasn't good enough, the group had to recuse the girl themselves. Silly me, of course we can't have a movie without dumb characters! The characters aren't the only thing that got on my nerves, it was also the cheap cgi effects. Not only did the monster look fake but it looked like something out of a video game. For a movie that had a pretty high budget you'd think you get decent effects. And if you can't get decent effects then don't show the monster so much! Leave it to the audience's' imagination, it's scarier that way. I'm sorry but I just couldn't take this 'film' seriously. Please leave the filming to the pros."

We are treated to incredibly bad amateur photography featuring every bad angle made by people who apparently never saw a camera before.

And now, after seeing it, I still don't like the style, but the movie has aspects in it, that makes some of it a fun watch. Though, I did find the movie a bit boring, despite it was trying so hard to be frantic and portray a feeling of a great urgency. And that isn't a good thing, as the movie isn't that long either.<br/><br/>The scenes I'm talking here are of course the scenes of destruction and pretty much everything the monster of the movie has a bigger part in. The destruction of Manhattan is fantastically done and the monster itself is just glorious, even in the close shots it looks stunningly real. The monster is the real star of the movie and the way it has been executed manages to save a lot in this story. <br/><br/>While it's a good thing the movie wasn't centered around some standard gun ho military personnel trying to kill the beast, I didn't warm up to the pretty forced plot line of good bye party turned into a rescue mission of one true love.<br/><br/>The actors are surprisingly pretty good, but honestly, this movie works only because there's a huge monster mashing things around."

I see some people are comparing it to a Blair Witch project, but my thoughts are that they only concur in the fact that there is no sound story line in any of them. Just mass panic, couple of kiss kiss frames, then more panic! Also, the actors are just portraying the fact that they have been isolated and distanced in this huge commotion, having to find each other. Maybe there is some hidden meaning with this movie, like that we are all in the same city but so far from each other at the same time, running away from dangers, trying to keep ourselves alive while people who we love the most suffer from within.<br/><br/>All in all a nice little thriller."

","I had the unfortunate pleasure of paying $15 to watch this 'movie' when it first came out and man did I regret... in more ways than one! I like the idea of a huge monster attacking a city but not if some idiot is going to film it all through a video camera.. I'm sure my rating would have been higher if they had just made it as a normally filmed movie. It would have worked just as well.. As I have written in the title, I watched this movie hungover in the cinemas and I had to throw up halfway through it which, if it hadn't been filmed through a camcorder, then I'm sure I would have sat through all of it with no problems. In saying that, I'm feeling sick right now reading through other people's reviews of this film as it's giving me flashbacks of a film I most definitely want to forget..."
"meeza","8","1","3","27 December 2009"," See the magic of Cloverfield!
","A monster movie set in New York? Why not? Maybe not in 2002! But I do not think acclaimed Producer/Director J.J. Abrams was ""lost"" in left field and was timely appropriate in reintroducing the monster movie theme in present time via the narrative form in his ""Cloverfield"". Director Matt Reeves helms this surprisingly fine film about a grandiose monster attacking Manhattan. Hey, I have felt like a monster myself with a few too many Manhattan cocktails. What gives ""Cloverfield"" a visionary edge is that all of the chaos is seen subjectively through the video camera of one of the film's characters named Hud. The film's narrative structure starts in a New York apartment where the lead character of the film Rob has been thrown a ""going away"" surprise party by his friends; including Hud who is videotaping the guests testimonials about Rob using the soon-to-be infamous camera. But the real surprise comes right after in the clash of the Clover Monster; buildings explode, debris is everywhere, and even the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the streets of Manhattan courtesy of monster Clover's unstatuette left hook. The rest of ""Cloverfield"" focuses on the film's hipster characters trying to survive the Clover Monster's destruction. So to end my review of ""CloverÂ…"" Oh No! What's that coming at me! It is a humungous monster looking like a 300-foot Roger Ebert telling me to give it up as a film critic! AAHHH!!!! Where is my camera? I want a shot of this! His massive Thumbs Down is about to trample me! Help!!!! OK enough! I did enjoy the ensemble acting of ""Cloverfield"" from newcomers Lizzy Kaplan, Jessica Lucas, Michael Stahl-David, and T.J. Miller. Stahl-David played Rob; and Miller played Lite, I mean Hud. ""Cloverfield"" had extra special visual effects which were monstrous in recreating a New York tackled by a monster. I do not deny that ""Cloverfield"" did a have a few silly rudiments to it, but it did not intercede within the sheer entertainment value of the film; or maybe it was that good luck clover that did it. Nevertheless, ""Cloverfield"" does warrant for you to play its viewing field. **** Good"
"steerpike2000","8","1","3","4 November 2009"," Monstrous success
","I cannot recall seeing a film quite like this before. After the initial 15 mins or so of characterisation, this movie is utterly gripping . I am not surprised that Cloverfield has polarised its audience. It really is a marmite movie; not one to sit on the fence about.<br/><br/>Criticism of poor characterisation, weak plot etc. are senseless for this kind of film. Seriously, it's a monster movie - who cares about the depth of character development and credibility of the plot line?!? Take this film at face value (i.e. 50-storey leviathan rampages through the streets of Manhattan) and suspension of disbelief should be a given. Why bemoan the shaky handy-cam filming, when it creates a very immediate sense of fear - not for the characters so much as for you, the viewer! Without this hand-held filming style, this would not be half the movie it is.<br/><br/>This is an absolutely terrific monster movie, which takes the genre to new levels at times. I wholeheartedly recommend you leave any preconceived expectations of realistic plot structure, believable characters, flawless camera-work at the door before you immerse yourself in this jaw-dropping cinematic adrenalin ride.<br/><br/>Groundbreaking, and oh so good! 8/10"
"chrisdouberly","8","1","3","31 August 2009"," Something new and real
","Cloverfield delivers a stressing array of mass destruction. The film quickly jumps into action during a going away party. Filmed by an 8mm camera the city quickly becomes helpless from a giant monster as the characters travel to the center of the city to save a friend. For the most part I thought the storyline was kind of weak but that's not why you're glued to the screen. I was very impressed from the amazing footage of destruction and chaos that has engulfed the city. If you're not a fan of the shaky camera, I do not recommend this movie. But I am, films like these put you in the front row and make it as real as possible. Still to this day I enjoy watching it, especially while smoking up. I give Abrams credit for going out on a limb for this project. I recommend seeing this film, don't listen the nay sayers. They're just upset about the camera work."
"foxt2372","1","1","3","12 August 2009"," Not quite the worst movie I ever saw.
","I can't imagine how anyone could find this movie creepy, much less scary. I know five year old kids who would find this a bore fest.<br/><br/>Everything except the visual effects, which were anorexic to say the least, was a complete disaster. The plot was juvenile and poorly thought out. The single camera 'techinque' was an obvious low budget dodge, whose sole purpose was to avoid the time, effort and expense of producing a real movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I can see why the producers put so much effort into keeping news of the movie quiet until production was complete. If word had leaked, everyone would have known from the start that this was just a cheap rip off of Godzilla produced by a bunch of untalented lazy bums.<br/><br/>The really sad part of this bad joke is that the actors and actresses all had potential. This movie, unfortunately for them, will likely prove a career killer."
"kirksworks","7","1","3","2 August 2009"," Interesting Experiment in VFX and Giant Monsters
","Although I liked this film it wasn't as successful a variation on the giant monster genre I was hoping it would be. The VFX were integrated into the film flawlessly, and by my mind, were some of the most impressive I've seen in a film. More impressive than the Cloverfield monster itself was the completely convincing creation of Manhattan under siege. The fact that the film was shot on sound stages in Los Angeles is mind-blowing. <br/><br/>Some have complained that the script was thin and the plot not much to write home about, and I would concur, however, a more polished and scripted affair would have reduced the sense of realism. And that is what this film has going for it, its sense of capturing a rampaging monster ""by the seat of your pants"" so to speak, via the clever use of seeing the whole story from the viewpoint of a single video camera lens.<br/><br/>The 9/11 video cam realism manufactured by this technique was extremely effective indeed, but I have to add that it also had the effect of distancing me from the on screen violence. I was never scared, even during the film's most harrowing sequence where the characters are attacked in the subway tunnel by fierce crab-like creatures. I guess the hand-held camera only catching glimpses of the action and moving all over the place toned it down for me. It felt like another proscenium arch that made the whole thing once more removed. <br/><br/>This is strange because I'm sure the filmmakers intended just the opposite reaction from an audience. I found myself much more involved in the Korean film ""The Host"" than I did in ""Cloverfield."" And of course, ""The Host"" is more conventionally told, showing the monster clearly and creating a more melodramatic product by its obviously scripted dialog. <br/><br/>Yet, ""The Host"" had characters I got deeply involved with, even though they were people from a culture I know very little about. With ""Cloverfield,"" even though the main characters were American and relatively believable in their reaction to events and each other, the nature of the idea of keeping everything close to reality (with an unscripted feeling and unpolished camera work) lessened the melodramatics, making me want more from the characters. <br/><br/>And finally, most everyone dying in the end, though clearly an attempt to maintain the ""Blair Witch Project"" found footage idea, was very unsatisfying. People do survive horrendous things, even in real life. <br/><br/>Yet, as someone who grew up on films like ""Godzilla"" and ""Gorgo,"" ""Cloverfield"" has a lot going for it. I was often impressed with how harrowing the whole thing was, even if I did feel somewhat removed. And Michael Giancchino's ""Roar"" overture that plays over the 9.5 minute end credits is killer. If giant monsters on the rampage is your thing, ""Cloverfield"" is worth a look."
"cheshire551225800","8","1","3","25 February 2009"," Very Good and Actually Shocking
","I rented this on DVD, but I wish I had seen it on the big screen. I thought that the ruse of seeing it as if it had been filmed by people actually in the situation was effective, although there are those who decry it as a ""Blair Witch"" rip-off technique.<br/><br/>In our Youtube & reality show obsessed world, I don't find it strange at all that someone would want to try to document events so strange. I think it would be a natural impulse to a 20 or 30 something individual and a natural way to try to feel like they had some kind of control over an out of control situation. Or maybe just for the $$$ or fame from being the one who got such footage. <br/><br/>This movie isn't supposed to be analyzed, it is supposed to be experienced as if you were there. That is why the dialogue is as banal at times as it is. How thought-out and snappy do you think conversation is during a natural disaster/terrorist attack etc.????? People do things that seem strange, hmmmm ever heard of victims of large scale events being in a kind of state of shock? <br/><br/>If you need everything spelled out for you, you won't like this movie. They tell why it is named Cloverfield in the opening scenes. If you missed it, you need to try more movies that aren't so formulaic.<br/><br/>Some of the reasons people are posting for not liking this movie are soooo funny. Like someone said it wasn't ""realistic"" because the character of Lily would never wear those shoes. Um, okay, hello? It was supposed to be an unforeseen disaster situation, was she supposed to know that ahead of time? Do you think anybody caught in 9-11 wore shoes not conducive to fleeing the scene??????<br/><br/>I cared about the characters and I was glad that they didn't go to the easy ending of letting everybody live. I was disappointed that they did go for the ""money shot"" of clover at the end. It would have been more effective to have only seen parts of clover and try to put it together in your head.<br/><br/>I found the wry comments of Hud throughout to be pretty funny in such a dire situation. I definitely recommend the move, but not if you have a queasy stomach in general, need meds to ride in a boat, or are easily frustrated by a movie where you don't have someone to tell you what is going on every second."
"rumbleinthejungle","9","1","3","13 February 2009"," Breathes new life into the monster movie
","I can't understand people disliking this film?! This is what needed to happen to the monster movie - 'Cloverfield' has shown the way. The film has characters that we care about, humour, and one of the most awesome monsters to ever stomp all over the silver-screen. There are several little touches that just make this film better than great - the scene in the electronics store where Hud is filming the TV broadcast, the part where they are caught in the crossfire between the monster and the military, and the attack on the Brooklyn Bridge. Also, the parasite creatures are very creepy and add another dimension of terror to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Why would you go to see a monster movie in the first place? Because you want to be entertained, right?<br/><br/>If you put this film on a good sized TV and crank up the sound in stereo, then there's no way that you couldn't have a blast watching this flick. People that fault this film on the basis of shallow characters or lack of plot are missing out. When one compares it to similar films such as Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' or Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' then I truly believe that this film comes up trumps.People who expect a nice tidy resolve and all the exposition that usually sucks the life out of these kind of films should steer clear. The film's writers have, perhaps inspired by the events of 9/11, posed the question 'What if this huge, terrible creature showed up and started tearing the city apart and no-one could stop it? What would people do?' Brilliant."

I HAD to see this movie.<br/><br/>So, last night, me, Quel, and Neels all got together and watched it. Despite the fact that I'd read EVERYTHING about the movie prior to watching it, I was still on the edge of my seat the entire time. (Oh, and I saw the splash.

","My boyfriend and I saw Cloverfield in a movie theater while we were living in Georgia, on Valentine's Day to be exact. It was a cold night and we had been debating about which movie to see, but due to my initial interest when seeing the trailers on TV, we decided on this, and in my opinion, we made a great decision. I have only seen this movie once, but will eventually add it to our DVD collection. I personally enjoyed the entire movie-- I found it scary, thrilling, funny at times, and thought-provoking. The sound quality was amazing, and leaving the theater, the night seemed eerily quiet, and I was still so tense- half expecting to hear some freaky roar, gun shots, screams or see some gigantic creature plow through the area. I admit that I did have to close my eyes during some parts, and I squeezed/clawed my bf's left arm a little too much in fear. The most memorable, and meaningful, thing about this Valentine's night thrill-fest was the intertwining story of love and sacrifice throughout the movie, and the ending. Beth and Rob shouting their love for each other as they prepare to die was extremely moving. Thanks to this film, I can honestly say about February 14, 2008: ...I had a good day."

One of them videos everything in a desperate attempt to ""document"" the attack of a monster from the deep. And that's the movie, folks! Mercifully this movie is over in about 75 minutes.

I remain puzzled though at how battery life technology seems to have remained static for almost 10 years, but I suppose it's nothing partial recharging can't explain.<br/><br/>While I discussed and analysed ""The Blair Witch Project"" for weeks after the movie, I'm amazed I remembered ""Cloverfield"" long enough to write this review."

"p_jones92","4","1","3","16 November 2008"," Pointless and poor
","Wow, talk about a movie not living up to the hype, or even it's own trailer.<br/><br/>I can't begin to tell you how disappointed (and sick, more of which later) this whole movie made me feel. Who's fault is that? The studio for all the great hype, the reviewers and critics for falling for it and calling this great? Or for the clear references and rip offs of the 9/11 tragedy that are seen throughout this film? First off, I will mention that I watched this on DVD, and had to watch it in 2 installments. Not because it was bad, but because the whole camera constantly moving around made me feel sick and I had to take a break half way through for fear of throwing up. If you suffer from any form of motion sickness be warned, this will bring it out in you. Making your audience vomit through scares and gross out scenes is good, making them sick because of the way you shoot the movie, NOT good.<br/><br/>The idea itself I like, following a group of random people enjoying a party and then suddenly tragedy strikes and we watch it all unfold, as confused as they are, not too sure what it is that is attacking - great idea. Shoot it from a POV - great idea too. However, it's the execution of the idea that this film is poor.<br/><br/>The whole guy meets girl, guy loses girl, girl & guy get separated by monster attack, guy try's to save girl from monster attack thing is fine, but the story elements within it are quite cliché.<br/><br/>The problem also lies in the POV itself. The point of it is that is supposed to be in the style of a video you might see on YouTube or something, but it doesn't actually look like one, because it's shot in Hi-Def for a start, not a proper everyday camcorder, but also it's directed in a very specific way. Although the camera is POV, it's panning and looking in a very specific way, to show very specific things (be they close ups of hands holding or people faces, or quick look at a monsters leg or something crashing into something). And it's so obvious that it doesn't feel on the fly, or amateurish, as it's actually supposed to be. You're very aware that you're deliberately being shown certain things, which goes against the point of shooting it this way, and stops it being the last video of an amateur camcorder user trying to capture events on camera that the premise of the movie sets it out to be.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe though is that, having seen the 9/11 tragedy unfold on TV, as many of us have done, you can clearly tell someone looked at the events of that day, and the many amateur clips seen on TV during that day capturing the attack, and thought they'd do that for this movie. People in NY being caught up in a sudden unexpected attack - check. Amateur footage of the unexpected attack taking place - check. Famous NY land mark being destroyed - check. Clouds of dust chasing stunned NY'ers down the streets as buildings collapse - check. It's so obvious that it's offensive. The producers, writer and director have taken a national tragedy, turned it into a monster movie and used it to make themselves money. I'm disgusted by the clear 9/11 references in this movie.<br/><br/>Add in the lack of character depth allowed by the story the way it's told in this instance, it means you quite frankly couldn't give a rats ass about them either. I understand the need for picking a bunch of unknown actors to help tell this story, as we need them to be everyday people, but the acting is very poor, with Hud (the guy holding the camera and from whose POV we view the entire movie) particularly cheesing you off, with his light relief/comedy role within the movie just not working at all.<br/><br/>I think this movie was made for 15 year olds, anyone older than that or who actually has a brain will see right through the ""creative"" execution of POV story telling for the bad, rip off, story that this actually is."
"DelBongo","7","1","3","13 November 2008"," Cloverfield
","If you're a misanthrope or a pedant (ideally both, obviously) then prepare to have a field day with this one.<br/><br/>A steadily decreasing number of impossibly pretty and wealthy New York twenty-somethings scramble around Manhatten island as it is briskly destroyed both by a gigantic, unseen creature of some kind, and the US military, who are trying to kill it. There's a very rough through-line involving a missing ex-girlfriend, but as far as story goes, thats your lot.<br/><br/>The film's premise and plot are all riddled with more holes than you'd find in a very productive tea-bag factory; the central conceit - that the entire movie is composed of home video footage shot by a civilian luddite - is visually and conceptually inconsistent; and if the story's decision to focus on a set of characters who are almost profoundly unlikeable is the injury, then a light smattering of utterly diabolical acting is the insult.<br/><br/>But you simply can't argue with populist film-making this effective. The shocks pull no punches and hit home every time, the aura of suspense and expectation is ferocious and beautifully maintained, the effects are outstanding, and at barely 70 minutes minus credits, it is as tight as a duck's sphincter.<br/><br/>Love it, hate it, relentlessly rip the pish out of it... just make sure you watch it."

In the time of Zombies, Vampires, and King Kong/Godzilla remakes, This is a monster movie of it's own genre. That part with the Statue of Liberty head flying through the street and landing on cars was awesome. <br/><br/>It gave me a sense of vulnerability watching the movie seeing how we could really be affected by a 500 foot monster. There wasn't a Ripley-type-hero around to gun this nemesis down, and that was the thrill of this science fiction/pseudo horror film. That first person camera view point was very ingenious. <br/><br/>Cloverfield is centered on normal human beings who are bewildered and are struggling to survive and evacuate New York City by real world means. The props were realistic and the ""reality camera concept"" really pulled this movie off. <br/><br/>The only thing disappointing about Cloverfield is the ending. I guess J.J.

Just look at the pretty young woman who gets hacked by the monster's offspring - hardly shows any pain with such deep lacerations - all the way down her back and shoulders... Either she has no pain receptors or the creature had something in its saliva which dulled her nerves (neither was said in the movie) and the victim later winced when another character was dabbing these bleeding rips in her skin ...

Umm One would think she would have let's see like - **Left Already!!!** Oh my God! There's a huge, mean monster attacking! Slashing, crushing, as it goes, ripping buildings apart. Oh My God!!

Just like Blair Witch - another boring no-brainer) It takes ages to get to the action, the party scene a complete snoozer ,,, And when something *finally* does happen, you're wondering if it's aliens, terrorists or monsters (I was hoping for something more original). Oh my God. It's devoid of intelligent plot, script, or anything intelligent, period. Where was the monster from exactly - the ocean, but where? Was it originally from another world? I was assuming it was female as it was breeding, (well dropping its offspring like poop), everywhere it stomped. Was it acting on instinct or malicious (could just've as well been some primordial beast without a clue)  though you hardly saw the damned thing, but even then it was probably the best actor in the whole movie. Will say it had good special effects, with Clarice (well somebody has to give the monster a name :)  the explosions and the Statue of Liberty head ... That was probably the only thing in the entire movie that brought any feeling whatsoever. (However not so special-effects to write home or best friend about.) The fact that it was short usually counts as a negative, but with this I was glad when this overrated slag pile came to an end. THANK God! Though I heard they're planning a sequel *Oh My God!!!* Haven't insulted our intelligence enough, I see. (The more intelligent reviewers will understand this as sarcasm.)<br/><br/>And then I find out this waste-of-time & money effing hogus sorry a$$ excuse for a movie insultingly ... won the 2007 Saturn Award for best Sci-fi movie  against **Transformers?!?!?** *Jinn shakes her head in disgust and dismay and utter shock ... and barfs.* I'll give *them* a monstrous thrash & bash! ;)<br/><br/>Don't waste your money or time on this uber-moronic, un-intelligent piece of over-hyped crud. Want to see *real* thrash and bash?  Watch Transformers. Actually *has* an intelligent plot (and more than just thrash & bash ) and with decent acting (from the humans as well)  And one that has you actually feeling for the characters (Transformers and humans alike), has feel good scenes and *Actually H A S an ending* then save your Energon chips and watch Transformers."

You really don't see very much of him. You mainly hear him continually yelling for/at Rob!!, Rob!!...At any rate, he's definitely got the best lines and with the slight lisp (lithsp), he's pretty funny too...All in all (aside from the lack of camera(s) planning), it's a pretty decent flick...And on the risk of repeating myself, AGAIN...I really wish it had been shot from the 3rd person perspective with 'Hud's camera-work' sprinkled in between. I'm convinced that's all it would have taken to be a really watchable and much more enjoyable film...I guess its true - sometimes less is more and this feels like a prime example of it...

After getting some of his friends killed in terrible ways, the main character and his girlfriend are hiding under a bridge right before the monster gets nuked.

","Cloverfield made me curious when it came out. The whole thing with the film-makers not wanting to give anything away before the release has been done before. And the other similarities to ""Godzilla"" were also worrying... But i chose to ignore them and feel curious nevertheless. Cloverfield looked it had something pretty unique to offer. But you never know until you actually watch it.<br/><br/>And was it unique? Both yes and no i guess. The whole ""monster attacks New York""-thing is old as King Kong. But Cloverfield did have a few things to offer that sets it apart from most other movies. First of all the whole home-movie style works pretty well. We only get to see what the people in the movie see, nothing else. It creates both a sense of urgency and actually being there. That was a good move. I might also mention that the camera work is still not that bad considering it's supposed to be handy-cam. The picture is clear, the effects are really good and there is very little of nausea i can feel sometimes when the camera is waved around a lot.<br/><br/>There are however a few things that i didn't like as much. While Cloverfield highlights the way the feel of a movie can really benefit from an unusual approach (handycams), it also shows one of the classic weaknesses of horror movies. Namely the monster itself. I'm afraid it works just as bad as it did in Godzilla. In the end the movie is also a more or less standardized action movie with a more interesting presentation.<br/><br/>I did like Cloverfield fairly well. I think there are things that could have been done better. Not least the monster (how hard can it be?) and also it could have been more experimental with the story, like it was with the presentation of the story. But in the end this movie is pretty original and i did enjoy it. I think it's good to see something that at least tries to break the mold a little bit. I rate it 7/10."

Boy loves girl, girl loves boy, boy and girl have sex, but boy is moving to japan, so girl finds another boy, monster comes and attacks Manhatten, original boy magically gets to girl and ""saves her"". Really he just post pones her death. She dies in an explosion anyways. You never get any answers. And its not one of those un-answered movies that leave you wondering. It's one that leaves you mad you even wasted your time watching such a stupid movie. You never find out where this creature came from, how it got here, what it is, if they kill it, if everyone dies, does it go world wide...and so on. Considering this movie was essentially based of multiple movies from the past, and much better ones at that, you'd think it would be pretty decent. Come on, all the work is done for you, you just out your own spin on it and hire some people to act. I could even stand the horrible acting and cheesy love story, if things were just thought out better. If loose ends were at least kind of tied up, it would have been tolerable. But they weren't.

Secondly, it was annoying to have to listen to such a bunch of whining, hysterical guys. The number of ""of my god"", ""jesus"", etc. in this film must surely set a new record?

","This is best monster movie of last few years. You can imagine yourself in this movie. You can't hide, you can't escape, because monster is everywhere. You must run, really fast run. You can make a record, but you'll never see it. Sometimes you don't know if you incidentally don't playing in your own nightmare, if you don't only sleep. Do you want to wake up? You can't. Everything is real. Dead bodies, panic, fear... You are trying take a look around, but you have no time. So you're running again. Scream of scary people and strange noises force you to run still faster. But is it worth still run? Isn't this battle of Manhattan beforehand losed?"
"Deschenes","7","1","3","24 April 2008"," Worth My Money
","While deciding to see this movie, I thought it was going to be a waste of money and time. The runtime looked too short, under 1:30, the genre looked too dumb, and hearing about the filming style, I was having doubts. At first, after taking up what seemed like half the movie, I thought I knew that I was right. Then, the action started. The action was fast paced, there were no long periods of time with nothing happening. The ending was kind of a surprise, but ended like the Blair Witch. After thinking about it, I have realized that this was a great movie. It had a monster that couldn't be described in words, great killings, and lots of blood. A different style monster movie."
"nohthink","8","1","3","24 April 2008"," Simply Most Memorable Monster Film in Our Generation
","The movie got its styles. It has lots of pop cultural references such as Sponge Bob Squarepants, Sean Kingston, Sephora, Superman, Garfield etc. Those references make the movie feels like it's actually happening. In a way, it is the most realistic monster movie ever. I cannot emphasize enough that the movie got its styles. Unlike other movies such as Godzilla, or King Kong, the focus of Cloverfield is not the monster. The viewers never know or learn why the monsters are attacking New York City. In fact, we don't learn where the monsters came from. The monsters are neither some accidental result from nuclear waste nor extra terrestrial who wants to invade the earth. We simply do not know, which makes us even weaker than ever for about an hour and a half. It is the people that the movie focuses on and it is the people that make the movie unique. Because of that, it doesn't feel like a monster movie. It almost feels like a drama or documentary with a monster twist and it works really really well. Also, the movie constantly shows two totally different video clips because Hud, the camera man, accidentally recorded over the previous tapes, and it adds so much layers and depths into the movies. In fact, I thought the ending was overwhelmingly emotional and dramatic. It might be too bold say this but I truly think it is going to be one of the best monster movies in the Hollywood history in our generation."

The first 20 minutes are a stupid beginning of somebody going to Japan, he gets a party, sex scandals and drunk people. But when the statue of liberties head falls down it picks up. It has all the usual horror movie things we've come to love- a giant man eating monster, weird spider crab creatures that make peoples stomaches explode, and underpaid actors swearing in the streets.

I guess the best description of this travesty would be Godzilla meets War of the Worlds meets Independence Day and filmed in the style of The Blair Witch Project. These were all good movies in and of themselves, but the attempt to combine elements of all these movies and try to make something original was a disaster. In the ""The Making of Cloverfield"" section of the special features, one of the actors states ""None of us has a clue what is happening, and somewhere in between a movie is going to happen"". I guess this about sums it up."

I have not clue why anyone with 25 million dollars to spend on a movie would choose to waste 2 hours of countless viewers time to make a movie that is a load of junk and without an ending.

"maatmouse-1","5","1","3","20 April 2008"," nice premise for a horror movie spoiled by home video style
","What an incredibly original idea for a film! Make a horror/disaster movie in the style of a home video, complete with rotten, shaky camera work and the camera operator speaking as he is recording the 'video'.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this has been done before and no better. The Blair Witch Project got there first and, although, this film uses CGI effects to enhance the disaster movie experience, the premise is the same; horror movie in a home video style.<br/><br/>I have to say, I was watching this on a DVD, not the cinema. I probably couldn't have coped with it on the cinema with its big screen, which would have made the home video feel absolutely horrific. I can imagine leaving the cinema to be ill or suffering from motion sickness. As it was, every time the camera/operator did one of his 'spins' to push the camera around to talk to someone else, I had to look away. This is not really something you want to do in a film like this.<br/><br/>I have to say, but Sam Raimi did this so much better in Evil Dead. However, he didn't use a video camera and his shots were far better done. The acting was basic at best, but then you weren't watching this for the acting nor the dialogue. The disaster aspect was nicely done, but only if you could tolerate the camera work long enough to appreciate it.<br/><br/>This film also took a long time to really get started. There was a lot of completely pointless 'background' setup which could have been cut so easily and the plot brought more swiftly to conclusion.<br/><br/>My advice to the filmmakers for a sequel is: ditch the home video feel and shoot it properly without home video, but maybe use the home video sparsely, and you'll make a better film."
"herbiefrogg","1","1","3","19 April 2008"," Absolute crock
","This has got to be one of the most annoying and disappointing films I have ever watched, particularly in view of the hype that surrounded its release. I had no empathy for any of the characters so I didn't care at all what happened to them. In fact, that's not completely true; there were many times when I wished the characters would just die, so annoying was their non-stop screaming and shouting out to each other. The acting was truly dire, the dialogue non-existent and there was precious little footage of the monster itself throughout the film. The character with the camera, supposedly recording events for posterity, evidently thought it more important to record the inanities of his friends rather than focus on the main event. And these were supposed to be terrified people running for their lives!<br/><br/>An absolute crock of a film - no one can afford to waste 90 minutes of their life watching this abject rubbish, unless perhaps they are in solitary confinement in a maximum security jail with no other option."

Any first semester student could have done better on the graphics(CG)that they loosely call a creature here. I really didn't mind the low/no-budget, home-video filming style that was used, but even Blair Witch was done with more style and suspense...lol.<br/><br/>It frightens me to think of him doing a Star Trek film after such a bad outing but I guess I will have to wait for that to hit video now too. I was interested in going to see it but with how poorly this was done I certainly will not.<br/><br/>For all that liked this, everyone is entitled to an opinion and rightly so.

The camera is swinging around wildly so you can't focus on anything, and when it is held steady half of what should be there is missing. In reality, is anyone that bad at operating a video-cam or was he completely oblivious to the concept of the view screen on the digicam ??? Don't tell me it was done deliberately to make the film raw and edgy, I understand that, but because it was so obviously done on purpose it became really annoying. Add to that the moron and his comments from behind the camera, discussing tramps being set on fire in the subway, it was all so formulaic I'm surprised the studio let them get away with it.<br/><br/>Add to that all the things they did that no-one would have done in a real situation and it all adds up to an hour of your life wasted if you watch this film."
"Pee_dee","2","1","3","14 April 2008"," Questionable story , Awful Photography!
","Story ends unresolved... Where did it come from, was it defeated? The photography was atrocious, I know it's supposed to be from the point of view of one of the characters, but you can't see most of what's happening. The shaky camera with inadequate light doesn't contribute to the story or feel thereof, it just serves to annoy. Also, where there is color, there isn't much of it. It's a shame, because, if you could see most of the film, that might offset the unresolved storyline, which I could handle. Godzilla (1998), which was put out by Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin got average reviews and was a similar story of a monster attacking New York City. It was well filmed and the scenes were exciting and easy to see. The color was great and the story showed the origin of the monster, and followed a smooth storyline to the resolution. The special effects were awesome. In my opinion, Cloverfield fell short in every area. The actors were wasted as they were portraying their characters well, but you couldn't see them most of the time. In many scenes , the camera was pointed at the floor and all you saw was the ground blurring by. It may be the intent of the movie, but what a difference it would have made to have filmed it in a similar style to Godzilla. I sure hope film makers get over this shaky camera and poor lighting and color kick they are on. There are some good movies out there, Minority Report, War of the Worlds to mention a couple. If only they weren't distorted by lighting and color manipulation and shaky camera work to set a mood.... an annoying one."
"Bunuel1976","7","1","3","14 April 2008"," CLOVERFIELD (Matt Reeves, 2008) ***
","To begin with, I found this to be somewhat better than I had anticipated (though, admittedly, advance reviews had been generally positive). That said, the opening fifteen minutes are quite deadly - (even if the extended party footage helps to flesh out characters and, thus, heighten the later relentless anxiety passages). Thankfully, the teen relationships stuff gets forgotten pretty quickly  but, when they occur, the elegiac intermittent video footage of the happier past gives one a much-needed breather.<br/><br/>This is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) meets THE HOST (2006) or, if you, like a Hollywood monster movie of yore updated for the MTV generation and filtered through with a post-9/11 sensibility. SCREAM (1996), THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT itself and SAW (2004) are all recent examples of the next big thing in Horror films; and, yet, who today recalls (or even misses) the film-makers of BLAIR WITCH? The director of this one, Matt Reeves, is already 42  and his previous film had been the comedy THE PALLBEARER (1996); in any case, CLOVERFIELD is more renowned for being a J.J. Abrams project (who produced it).<br/><br/>The film is compact (even with its tight 75 minutes duration, barring the typically lengthy closing credits, it stills sags slightly and interest starts to wane towards the end), the title obscure, the monster(s) undefined (the shapeless main creature is creepy and admirably one only gets to have a real good look at it when gobbling up the Hud character! The young cast is variable, anonymous (with the most interesting characters being the misfits  Helena for being a Latina and Hud a geek) and, fashionably, indiscriminately disposed of. As for the cine'-verite' approach, the film-makers' over-reliance on it becomes rather self-defeating: would it be plausible for someone to keep filming this stuff? Besides, while aiding in the immediacy of the destruction and the ensuing panic (with such effective shock sequences as the demolition of the Brooklyn bridge, the tunnel attack and Helena's mysteriously violent and messy death), it never allows the audience a moment for reflection  coming across as a sensation rather than an experience and, given that nothing at all is explained, one isn't any the wiser by the end of it! <br/><br/>In retrospect, it seems obvious that the traumatic 9/11 events has transported the U.S. back to the days of political/nuclear/alien paranoia which, back then, was also transmitted into cinematic terms via any number of sci-fi parables but where it's evident that the film-makers of that time were utmost professionals (in their strict majority) whose mission was to provide thought-provoking entertainment rather than merely computer-generated publicity stunts. At least, it does manage a couple of lingering images: the disembodied head of the Statue Of Liberty tumbling to the ground and an empty horse-carriage eerily wandering by night on a practically deserted city street. Sadly enough, but hardly surprising, a sequel is already in the works; the film, then, is no masterpiece but very well done nonetheless: smart, exciting and highly effective  in essence, what the much-hyped Hollywood remake of GODZILLA (1998) should have been in the first place! In spite of my reservations, I still consider it to be the first must-see movie of 2008 (which I chose not to watch it in the theater for fear of the dizzy camera syndrome proving to be a bit much but, actually, one gets used to it pretty quickly)."
"dweberspam","10","1","3","12 April 2008"," Excellent movie, draws you into the characters, seems like almost ""real"" events
","In my opinion, this movie was excellent. The fact that it played more on realism than on Hollywood crap makes it even better. Now given, the Blair Witch Project was a big stinking disastrous bomb. The realism of that movie was just *puke*. I kinda think it's funny that people are comparing it to that just because it's filmed in a hand-held video camera way. It's nothing like that movie in any way. Most of the bad reviews start ""cry cry, the moving camera made me ill, cry cry"". I think that fact made it easier to get engrossed into the movie and actually care about the characters. Given the acting wasn't completely perfect. But how can you possibly act exactly as you should without being in that situation. And the references to 9/11, what's the big deal, who cares. It's probably just another ploy of Bush trying to get our minds off his retardedness.... again. Oh, and I loved one of the previous comments that start: ""Why do Americans feel the need for stupid, totally unrealistic disaster movies?"" Ummmm, we're not the only ones that make these kinda movies. We're just the only ones that make GOOD ones that anyone remembers other than the Godzilla movies (which are fantastic even at their old age btw). All in all, this movie you will either love or hate, doesn't seem to be an in between. I usually only write a review if I feel strongly for a movie. I loved it. The ending was fantastic. Leaves you thinking ""wow, that really sucks"". Heh, for all we know, if a giant monster attacked New York that's exactly how it would be."
"apetitefor","9","1","3","6 April 2008"," Really Good
","An amazing movie! Original, full of unknowing segments which can stop your heart out and most of all- done with a lot of thinking and analyzing how a person can react in dangerous situations. It's not just the crazy action scenes where the American soldiers fire at the monster and the guy with the camera is trying to take cover, giving you the chance to experience something that has never been done before in the world of cinema. It gives you the preview of normal daily life with a bunch of people who are throwing a party for their best friend who is going to somewhere and you don't want to loose contact with him. And everything goes on and on, until suddenly the reality strikes you and last but not least, fear is contacting in you in a full circle of madness.<br/><br/>As final words, I don't want to spoil anything for you, I just strongly recommend you this movie, done by a real genius, who knows how, when and where to put his big sack of money. And truly he should be taken as an example of how can you do an amazing job, without wasting cash on something that has been already seen. 9/10 <br/><br/>By the way I'm giving 9 out of 10, because there were some parts which i really didn't like- for example the way the monster is showing up . Its true that it can be seen from another side, like who cares, this is the real world, this is really happening, a monster is coming, so i don' t have time to read news or something like that.But, it would have been cooler and more satisfying to have hidden- mini introduction of the terror. Again, this could be a hint, a step for another sequel, and if there is... ooo I'm going to watch it, definitely. :)"

There is no way I could have come up with that climax!

It is simply, hands down, the best and I mean THE BEST movie to be ever made! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it on the BIG SCREEN!!! The Sound is Perfect, The Effects are Perfect, The story is Perfect, I simply cannot find any reason whatsoever to give it a 9!!!! 10 out of 10 for this bad boy!"
"mattwaterhouse","10","1","3","3 March 2008"," A piece of art
","There are films that take your breath away, and this is most definitely one of them. What could have been just another crappy monster movie is instead a piece of art, with incredible realistic performances from a largely unknown cast. The scriptwriter was clearly at the top of his game, the snappy dialogue keeps the plot moving at a good pace, and the set pieces in the film were genius. Never clearly seeing the monster also gave this film an edge and a sense of enigma. It makes a refreshing change not to have the stock goofy scientist, or any of the other stock monster/disaster movie characters, you find out the information as the characters do, which makes it easier to identify with the characters.<br/><br/>J.J.Abrahms made a risky move in shooting this film on hand-held cameras, and thank goodness he did. Contrasting films like the Blair Witch Project, it works brilliantly, and contributes to the success of the movie. The sequence in the subway tunnel for example shows how the camera can build tension and create suspense. That this film works makes me look foreward to Diary Of The Dead, which will be an incredible experience if George A Romero utilises the camera half as well as Cloverfield has. Definitely a must see."

","First off I would like to thank all the people who gave honest reviews... I should have listened to them... I did like the concept of having the film be from the point of view of an amateur camera man ... unfortunately this film fell way flat.. the characters are so one dimensional it is ridiculous the only scene done well was the subway... <br/><br/>I have seen where people have stated that this was supposed to represent the horror of 9-11 .. again that is a thin statement at best .. I lost some very close friends during 9-11 and to say this captures that horror .. I am offended.<br/><br/>There were absolutely NO surprises for me during the viewing .. to be honest I almost walked out ... I kept saying to myself "" it has to get better... everyone said this was thrilling ..."" boy was I wrong..<br/><br/>Again I loved the concept however they could have done much better pulling it off .. OH yeah BTW what video camera do you know of that can run for what is supposed to be 7.5 hours without needing a new battery while using both light and night vision .. sorry just ain't happening ... <br/><br/>I would like to see the movie redone in the future .. however done correctly .. maybe flesh out the characters a bit more in their reactions .. and telling us why the bites have the effect they do .. ( natural question when you see that happen to a friend!) gah I did end up getting my money back from the theater and got a free ticket to Sweeny Todd .. NOW THAT WAS A MOVIE WORTH WATCHING"
"Redcitykev","6","1","3","28 February 2008"," Not a bad film, but...
","Whilst this film is not exactly bad, I can not say it is particularly good either. The main reason for this I thought that it was full of plot holes and obvious events, as well as making me feel decidedly sea-sick! Part of the film's problem is the fact that it took so long to get going. For a film as short as this the opening party scene seemed to go on for hours, and was the kind of party that I would personally have avoided like the plague! In fact by the time the action actually got going I was already wishing for most of the party goers to 'bite the dust'! When eventually the film did get into its stride the comparisons with 9/11 were so blindly obvious to be quite painful. The falling building, the rubble and dust rolling down the street etc could not have existed before that dreadful day and the subsequent TV coverage. Following on from this the film really became not much more than a chase movie, with a lot of running - and I mean A LOT OF RUNNING! - about, plenty of screams and some really dumb actions by the characters.<br/><br/>The most puzzling part of the film for myself was when the surviving lead characters went into the subway system. Now surely, with New York being attacked in the manor it was, this system would have been heaving with like-minded souls attempting to escape from the happenings on the surface? Yet when they got down there they were the only ones. As for what happens down there, well I would spoil it for those who have not viewed the film yet, but to say they were obvious is like saying Manchester United play in red at home! The few things that save this film from being a complete duffer is the special effects. The monster, which is only slowly revealed, is really quite scary, and the destruction is well done. The action, when it gets going, is fast and furious, and the acting, whilst never being Oscar worthy!, is not bad for a film of this type.<br/><br/>Of course I am sure that there is a whole essay to be written about this film - and others like the recent 'Invasion', 'I am Legend' etc - and the whole post 9/11 scenario, but I will leave that to much more learned minds than my own! Surfice to say that if you are willing to leave your brain at the box office, and can cope with the opening party scene full of horrid little people, then this film offers up a reasonable amount of entertainment."
"a-p-d-d","10","1","3","24 February 2008"," Only two words suit this movie: ""thrilling"" and ""unique"".
","Cloverfield is unique among it's fellow monster movies, in that it is infinitely more sickening. And I mean sickening in the best possible way. To put it frankly, Cloverfield is brutal. This isn't your cliché ""guy in a rubber suit attacks city in campy manner"" monster movie. This is something that will leave you shaken, and for various reasons at that.<br/><br/>But first, a word of warning. If you have motion sickness, you might wish to wait for the DVD release. Cloverfield's camera work is designed to emulate a hand-held camera in the possession of a scared young man as realistically as possible. As a result, it's going to be shaky. Very shaky. While it sounds disheartening at first, it helps add to the realism of the disaster portrayed. It is a very effective manner of filming in that it significantly raises the heart rate of the viewer. This style, combined with the non-stop panic and chaos Cloverfield shows, is a brilliant way to portray a monster attack. Cloverfield gives you exactly what you would expect from a real monster attack, or even any disaster, and that is total chaos. And when it comes to portraying total chaos, Cloverfield does it more or less perfectly. This is helped by surprisingly competent acting considering the fact that the cast is full of near-unknown actors. (What did you expect? It's a relatively low budget movie which requires lots of effects because of it's very nature.) <br/><br/>The monster itself is totally original, and very well designed. It looks totally unique, with nothing to compare it to. But I will say that it has probably the best design in monster history. And I won't spoil the movie, but I'll say that it isn't the only thing that's well-designed. The events of the movie are all very memorable, with some that are simply shocking. But don't be fooled, although this is a monster movie, the characters take priority. The monster isn't the only thing the camera records. It also shows the struggle the cast go through and their relationships with one another. The characters are all rather well-done, particularly Hud, the cameraman(and oh-so-subtle pun). Cloverfield is in many ways a very well made film and a great revival of the dying monster genre. Additionally, it provides some commentary and messages amidst the destruction, much like the original Godzilla did well over 50 years ago. I would highly recommend Cloverfield, but do not expect cliché white lab-coat scientist exposition about the monster's origin. the movie shows what people caught up in the havoc would see and know, but if that is really so important, look up the viral marketing which explains more of the overall plot. But Cloverfield is about more than just that-it shows struggle, and panic, and how helpless we are against our own planet."

","I recently went to the movies to see this film before it hit shelfs. I went with the impression that I would be minutely disappointed with the movie because of the style of film, but soon found the first movie that amazed me. Truly.<br/><br/>The movie started abruptly with no credits, which I prefer cause I want to get strait to the movie. Then it set up the characters in a romantic real life comedy sort of way, that in a way made me feel like one of their friends and this was just a memory I was reliving.<br/><br/>Because the movie was written and filmed in such a way that it made these people real and not fictional characters, it became an amazing watch. Everything I or another person would want to witness, feel, do, encounter during an horrific ordeal was show and done. I felt as if I was living this experience with them. <br/><br/>Also, they style of film added to the dramatic suspense and horror of it all. I was immersed into this event and scream out loud every time something happened. I felt as if I was in a virtual 3D movie and when I walked out of the theater I expected to see people running and screaming and some creature tearing up the mall. <br/><br/>So really my first thought and impressions were wrong. The movie would not have been the same without the shaky camera. All around great experience, couldn't ask for a better way to spend my night."

","I actually went to see Cloverfield with six friends of mine before I shot the footage for my own film for film studies coursework in college. We saw it in a cinema which wasn't really the best one around, but when the film started, and moved slowly into the disequilibrium of the narrative, it didn't feel like I was in a cinema at all, but I was in the movie amongst the other characters and the action.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is one of those films which is most likely going to be one which will be bought as soon as it is released out on DVD so the audio commentary from the directors or producers can be heard so they can reveal any secrets about Clovie, and where the hefty 'fella came from. This is simply because the amount of enigma codes present within this film causes the audience to ask themselves a number of questions, but then forgetting them as another piece of action thrills them into asking even more questions.<br/><br/>I must admit, despite looking forward to seeing Cloverfield, I was a little hesitant about the whole 'shot with a hand-held camera' thing. But I'm glad I saw it because I was pleasantly surprised. You may feel a little sick with the fast camera work, but it's nothing to worry about. Just take note of the warnings which are usually on the counter near where you buy your tickets at the cinema, or when it is out on DVD, look out for anything on the back of the case.<br/><br/>I don't want to reveal too much about this film, but it is certainly not one to be missed. It is full of mystery, suspense, action, and romance. It's hybrid genre makes it unique along with the way the film is shot. I loved it, and so did my friends.<br/><br/>The CGI is awesome, as well, so go check it out! One of the best films of 2008, I'd say.<br/><br/>I Am Legend, eat your heart out.

The monster is killer.<br/><br/>The acting's *ok* and doesn't really let the film down but is questionable in places of high emotion.

","In this rip-roaring, home-movie styled monster movie a group of teenager partying for the departure of one their closest friends find themselves amid a blaze of destruction when a giant 'thing' starts ripping the city to shreds. One of the unlucky scamps happens to be filming the entire thing, and thus we get a faux-documentary much in the style of a megabucks version of The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla. Although the shaky camera and choice of the 1st person view may put off some viewers who suffer from motion sickness, Cloverfield for the most part is barnstorming entertainment, fully exploiting the resources available to it. The idea to shoot entirely from some poor sap's camera is not entirely original, dating back to the Italian cannibal movies of the early 80s. But it does make for an interesting take on the monster movie."

","Hello, I went to see Cloverfield last Tuesday. I was so excited about the idea of seeing it, the trailer made me eager to see the whole thing for a while. Well let me tell you, I've been badly disappointed. This movie is nothing but a mix between The Blairwitch Project and Godzilla. The camera just keeps shaking and moving around the whole movie, which gave me the same feeling you have in a bad roller coaster ride. At the first fourth of the movie, I was wondering if I could sit there the whole movie without running to the bathroom to throw up because that camera effect made me dizzy and nauseous. Nothing to do with the actual movie and the 'disturbing' scenes (didn't see any, by the way). I badly needed fresh air when I stepped out of there. The monster is a cheap rip off of Godzilla, only a little better computer-made, but still the same thing, same type of story. The start of the movie, that party thing, was way too long. The movie was also too short for the price. Including the trailers, 1 hour 20 minutes? Completely ridiculous. Sincerely, I stepped out of the cinema thinking I had spent some money for nothing, except getting a bad case of nausea. It disappointed me like no other movie did in a long, long time."

"richard_sleboe","7","1","3","11 February 2008"," With Hud's own eyes
","Starting with the fabled 16th century ""chain map"" of Florence, Rennaissance draughtsmen would place likenesses of themselves, sketchpad and feather in hand, in the foreground of their cityscapes. These tiny self-portraits act as warrants of authenticity: they had been on site to see their subjects first hand. Similarly, Matt Reeves makes us believe that we witness a monster attack on Manhattan through the lens of a party-goer's hand-held video camera. To authenticate the footage, he has Hudson ""Hud"" Platt (first-time screen actor T.J. Miller) shoot flashes of his own face at regular intervals, exactly the way the draughtsmen inserted themselves into their designs. The camera tilts and jiggles to suggest Hud is actually filming this as he runs from a very ill-tempered lizard the size of the Chrysler building. But the crystal-clear footage is on 35mm film, not videotape, and of course the jiggling isn't at all like the shakes of ""real"" hand-held video. But what's real anyway? The whole thing is an illusion, fabricated to corroborate an illusion. This is also how this is different from ""The Blair Witch Project"", which was actually (mostly) shot on video. ""Cloverfield"" starts out as a fully-fledged rich kid relationship drama. Until the monster hits town some 20 minutes later, you can't even be sure you're in the right movie. All in all, I think it's pretty clever for a mainstream thriller. Oh, and Lizzy Kaplan is very hot in the part of Hud's love interest, deadpan beauty Marlena Diamond."

","I went to watch Cloverfield with low expectations. I expected to watch the film, appreciate the hand-held camera gimmick as far as I could and leave feeling a little nauseous. I was insistent on seeing it in the cinema though, rather than waiting for the DVD release and facing a far inferior experience.<br/><br/>Maybe it was partly due to my own cynicism but I was extremely impressed.<br/><br/>There is much more humour here than I would have imagined. Hud (T.J. Miller) is our socially awkward cameraman and, thanks to him, this movie becomes much more than the typical ""giant monster"" movie. It might be a British sense of humour that finds it funny but at times I was in hysterics. <br/><br/>The romance at the centre is no longer the generic sort where the good-looking girl is captured by the monster. The personal camera idea works exceptionally well in making everything feel very human and real. At times you do actually feel directly involved in the action and the friendships. When the humour suddenly stops and things 'hit the fan' I was stunned. It all emphasises the way catastrophes aren't anticipated, they just happen when we least expect it and feel safest.<br/><br/>Some people will be annoyed with 'the monster'. I'll say little about it for two reasons - I don't anyone to feel their experience has been ruined and I can't really find that much to say. It's a monster. It does what you expect. It's big and it smashes things.<br/><br/>Obviously the concept of the movie isn't an original one. 'Big bad monster attacks Manhattan' has been done so many times. It's the personal side of the movie that gives it just enough originality. The audience know that whatever they see is through the eyes of a character and that is a comforting thought. There is someone else there, with you.<br/><br/>Some have accused the film-makers of exploiting post-9/11 paranoia. There is an element of that in there but I don't see that as a bad thing. You feel as if you are in the middle of a disaster, rather than watching someone else filming a disaster, which is an interesting feeling.<br/><br/>I don't tend to like the big budget monster movies. The Godzilla remake didn't thrill me. I wasn't remotely interested in the remake of King Kong. This, for me, has a lot more to it.<br/><br/>Sequels are on the cards, I just hope they don't kill off the Cloverfield concept when this film alone works so well.<br/><br/>In the end I wasn't feeling any nausea, just glad that I'd taken a chance on a film I didn't have massive confidence in."

","A giant monster attacks New York City: the idea is at least as old as THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953). What distinguishes CLOVERFIELD is its perspective. Stealing THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's gimmick, it tells the story exclusively from the point of view of five twenty-somethings armed only with a video camera. Instead of the usual panning shots of thousands of anonymous screaming extras fleeing in panic, which has the effect of distancing the audience from the action, we are right down there in the carnage, underfoot as it were, in danger of getting trampled like the rest.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this verisimilitude has landed CLOVERFIELD in political hot water. Some people claim it offensively exploits the memory of 9/11 (like a certain former mayor of New York/ex-Presidential candidate). Just to put things in historical perspective, GODZILLA was made in 1954, just nine years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. (In an early scene, CLOVERFIELD acknowledges its kaiju roots when it is revealed one of the characters is moving to Tokyo to pursue a career.) CLOVERFIELD isn't a classic like GODZILLA, or even as good as THE HOST, another recent giant monster movie that focuses on people. The characters--the heroic guy, the heroic girl, the nerdy guy, the stuck-up girl, the heroic guy's heroic brother--are far too generic to be memorable. On the other hand, it towers over the disappointing 1998 remake of GODZILLA, also set in New York City. CLOVERFIELD is efficient scary entertainment that will hold your attention for its scant 84-minute running time."

It didn't develop like a movie, or begin or end like a movie, or ""work"" like a movie - unless it was a movie done by 7th graders w/ mom's cheap camera... I didn't get 'attached' to the characters, and I thought their decisions were idiotic - and at the same time, perfectly rational. And that is why this ""movie"" worked for me.<br/><br/>It didn't pretend to be a ""movie,"" - it was erratic, poorly lit, poorly shot, and - my favorite aspect - absolutely, brilliantly acted.<br/><br/>These people were so unbelievable real.<br/><br/>There were aspects which I thought were 100% realistic, like their behavior and reactions in the subway (other than the fact that they were insane to go into the subway in the first place...). I was so very, very ""with them"" in the subway! But that was why I didn't think of this as a movie. A movie makes you think, makes you feel, makes you connect (or hopes to). This had no such goals - and yet, I found myself responding to the events along with the characters.<br/><br/>I should think that generation-X which (according to marketers is all about 'experience') will ADORE this movie - nothing to think about, nothing to connect to... but lots and lots of reactive emotion."

","When a group of friends are at the goodbye party of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) some strange creature attacks the city of New York. The film show to us the experiences of the friends dealing with this unknown creature.<br/><br/>This all the plot of this film and certainly is not the best thing of the film. But the way the film is made with the style of an amateur tape and the hand held camera is great and the visual part is just perfect. To talk about the monster is unnecessary because is still a mystery and is going to be very useful to create a franchise in a very near future. But still i think it missed something with the monster because i don't like the love story that is behind the main plot, i know that they are trying to make us feel something about the characters but for me the love history is not even credible.<br/><br/>The cast of the film is good, with new actors making a nice job but still nothing special and again the visual part is more important and in consequence is the best thing.<br/><br/>And i haven't watch a marketing for a film like this one in the last years, create almost a cult for the film before it release. I wasn't very excited about the film but i was expecting the revival of the monster film and for me in this film is missing something.<br/><br/>Conclusion: judging by the reaction of yesterday's audience, the result was really strange because most of the people didn't feel that the film has an end and some people was like in shock but most was really dissatisfied. I didn't feel any of those feelings and i think that is what is missing, i mean to feel really disappointed or to be in shock and confused about it. Anyway for me is a decent film but of course is not the best sci-fi/monster of the last years but still have some really interesting things. Worth watching it in the cinemas for the perfect visual part, well only before the release of ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" in my country. 7 out of 10"

","I'm sorry that was by fare the worst movie I paid money for. If you know Dogma movies you are sort of used hand cameras but this was really over the top. There is no real story telling you just see what going on. monsters, dust sounds.... I'm normally not very critical about movies but could I get my money and time back?? I visited the cinema with 4 friends and all of them were disappointed and I had the feeling we were part of the majority of the people. Due to this movie I registered here because I thought this movie is fare overrated on IMDb. It really never happened for me that there was such a huge difference in my impression of the movie and the average comments."
"mtiago-sh","1","1","3","5 February 2008"," Full Disappointment
","I don't see how people can consider this film an 8 out of 10. The producing of the film annoyed me, as it was very poor. I'm not talking about the camera shaking, that's supposed to be like that, but the way it shakes, the effort the producer had to make it real only made it excessively unreal.... At any time, the camera was always ""moving"", always pretending that it really was a legit-tape, but that was 250% exaggerated. The panic and the shouts were all very poor.. Like, the Empire State Building collapsed, everything was on fire and they say ""Waw! Did you see that?"", instead of ""OMG, what's happening, i can't believe OMG!!!!"", or of course something like that.. And what about the ""sons"" of the monster? Why did they look electronic? Isn't he supposed to be a King-King biological animal? What about the US Army? Did they only had rifles to kill it? The 5-10 aircrafts that showed up - are those the only one's US has? Where did the animal come from? I know this is a Sci-Fi movie but.... Other planet? No. Below the water (as said on movie LOL)? No. A mutation of a monkey/whatever lie king-kong? No. Someone said it was a 9/11-after creation, and i started to laugh. I don't seem to understand what is Hollywood making to the movies. This is just like Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem.. They have a great opportunity to make a movie like Armageddon/Independence Day/etc, and they blow it up adding actors that even godzilla don't knows, and a director that's making millions out of creating some special effects that anyone with 15 years old can do. Matt Reeves.... How could you let this be? Gosh everyone's asleep.... Sorry for bad English. Peace."

","I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy. The first twenty minutes were so boring I actually fell asleep, the first time ever for any film. It would be bad enough watching this part if you knew the people in this home movie, but with complete strangers it was dire. If this had been on You Tube for free I would have turned off after a minute. I was woke up by the loud sound effects and thought at last it started, but I might as well of stayed asleep. The jerking hand held camera made it agony to watch, and I would rate this the second worse film ever made after The Blair Witch Project, which used the same dreadful camera technique. The awful camera angles must of made it easy for the special effects department as they only had to put the lights on dim, add lots of flickering lights and wave the camera about so nobody could see how bad they were. Yours very disappointedly Tony"
"SecSilver","8","1","3","5 February 2008"," Puts you right in the action
","I enjoyed this film, It's very different from other movies you see out there right now, in that you feel almost a part of what is going on. Its true that the camera is hand held throughout the film, but that gives it more of a realistic vibe. I can see how people would get easily sea sick, but really just closing your eyes or looking away for a second clears it up rather quickly (for me, anyways). <br/><br/>It is most def not your typical monster movie. There is no all powerful character on the outside summing up what the monster is, why its attacking, or anything really. This movie literally drops you into the middle of the action, where realistically you WOULDN'T have any idea what was going on. The acting is overall good-I thought that the guy behind the camera was especially realistic to how a normal person would actually react to the situation.<br/><br/>One scene in particular did conjure up strong memories of 9/11, but it wasn't done in a tacky way I don't think. It is true that NYC seems to be the only place that people want to destroy in movies, but I guess that was for the drama of a lot of people being trapped on a small island with a big old monster causing a ton of problems-which would be harder to do at other locales. If you are very stomach sensitive (or have an ear infection) i'd recommend waiting for it to come to DVD so you can see it at home, otherwise I enjoyed this film and recommend it."

","I've seen a LOT of movies in my day, but this is definitely in my top 5..actually, it's probably number 2, but that's beside the point. All I've heard about this movie was how shaky the camera was and how bad that made the movie: I find this to be inaccurate, as I could not have seen this movie in any different form. If this movie would've been in a third person camera view, it would not have been the same. It is very unique in its art form. Besides the camera view, the story was very well told. It kept me hooked for the whole ride. The actors were very spot on in their performances, especially the guy who filmed most of it. I won't ruin anything for you, but there is a slight shade of comedy at some points in this movie, which puts a lighter sense on the whole experience. Overall, this whole movie was an experience I will not be forgetting any time soon. In fact, I will be buying the DVD when it is released (hopefully they'll make a 2-disc!!) Final words: if you haven't seen this movie...go see it soon!! It is one of the best theater experiences of my life."
"lord-reign","8","1","3","4 February 2008"," Finally, an original monster...
","I was very excited about seeing this film, I even had to talk my friend out of wanting to see Sweeney Todd first so we could go see this. Well I'm glad I did (I haven't seen Sweeney Todd yet, so I'm not sayings it's crap), this was one of the most exciting and original films I've seen in such a long time, well maybe apart from No Country For Old Men.<br/><br/>The film has a slow start, with the first 20 minutes just introducing the characters, and many people will be already put off by it's Blair Witch style camera work (all hand held, as I'm sure everyone who knows about this movie should be aware of). Though stick with it, after 20 minutes we get our first disaster scene and from then on this film rarely slows down.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is surprisingly good, especially from an unknown cast. Though they seem to stupidly step into danger throughout the film, when you'll be screaming in your mind ""Get the f**k out of there!"".<br/><br/>The camera work makes it all seem more realistic and exciting than many other movies of this sort, from the first moment we see the monster attack, to the final helicopter crash, we feel as though we are being attacked too. Though I have to warn people, it may make them sick and disoriented...hell even I felt a bit disoriented at times.<br/><br/>Finally, the monster. There has been so much speculation as to what exactly it is...and I gotta say, it's nothing like I would of imagined. this is like the kind of deformed brother of Godzilla, but much cooler. I wont describe exactly what it is, as that'll be spoiling it for everyone. But I'll say that he is one ugly motherf**ker! Really weird looking to...<br/><br/>Overall I loved this movie, it had me on the edge of my seat every time something big happened. Highly recommended! This was my first ever review heh..."

","The user before me wrote ""don't waste your money"" basically wrote the film is crap - I totally disagree, and it was his/hers review that prompted me to write mine.<br/><br/>the previous user said 'there was no steady cam and was shaky all over' - do these people actually have a brain? the film is completely filmed thru a camcorder hand-held, and from the point of view of the survivors from an attack - what were they supposed to go? travel to a film studio and rob a professional camera set up - I'm sorry i don't know the full terminology, but i have used a cam before, and if your running or moving fast (as you would from a explosion) its going to shake!!! anyway the film was excellent - better then i expected, i heard it was a monster film, i was worried we wouldn't actually see the monster or anything, as its from survivors point of view - they're not always going to be in best position to see stuff, well this film was very well thought out and executed, a little like a cross between the new war of worlds, and new Godzilla - taking the best bits and making one better movie.

"goleafs_33","10","1","3","3 February 2008"," Awesome
","@bloodmane Dude, Hud continued to film while the monster was attacking because to him it conveyed a sense of security. That little black box, too him, kept him safe and was his shield against what was going on. Thats what people do during times of disasters, they find something and hold onto it because that is what is keeping them sane.<br/><br/>Anyways, onto my review. The movie was amazing. It felt real, like I was actually there. This is the first time in a long time that I have built a kind of emotional attachment with the characters in the film. They weren't over the top, or action heroes, they were normal people who were just caught in the middle of something terrible. In summary, the characters were awesome and some of the best I have seen in a while.<br/><br/>The monster was amazing. I was expecting to see something more reptilian, but this thing kicked ass! It didn't need to breathe fire or have atomic breath to be bad-ass, it just owned everything. The scene where Hud sees it close up is fantastic, the detail of it is amazing, I think JJ Abrams has succeeded in giving America it's monster."
"Tibokan","8","1","3","3 February 2008"," Excellent
","I went to see this movie with a couple of friends the other week and I found it to be a superb movie, full of suspense and action. The whole videocam experience was done really well, and really added to the on edge feel that I experienced through the movie, especially when something major happens and the camera is dropped or bouncing as they are running away. These touches made the movie seem and feel more immersive and believable. Character development was well done, and, for me at least, I began to care about what happened to the characters (unlike Blair Witch). Some criticisms was basically the special effects were nothing special, and the monsters in a similar sense were unimaginative. Also the movie is not particularly long at all, and with the fast pace of the movie, leaves you wanting so much more. However these minor complaints shouldn't detract from what it is a suspenseful and entertaining horror film, and in my opinion the one of the best new films of 2008."
"john-lucas-2","8","1","3","3 February 2008"," Fantastic

The way in which it is shot really captures you and make you believe that that its actually real.<br/><br/>The special effects are fantastic and the acting is very well performed.<br/><br/>There are some bits that I would have liked in there, like some better explanations, and ""what happened after"" the events that I will not mention.<br/><br/>Overall, very good, well worth you spending cash to see it."

If this were you, you wouldn't have the monster explained to you, or be told why it attacked or what happens after the camera stops rolling.<br/><br/>You would be going through it just to escape with your life. The few emotional scenes are as if it were you going through it, and the ending to me was fulfilling, because if it had ended any other way it would have been cheesy and without taste.<br/><br/>If you believe that you were going through what these people were and still have everything explained with what you consider a fulfilling ending to your own LIFE, then go ahead, bash the movie.<br/><br/>It was great."
"kyoquadon","8","1","3","3 February 2008"," Fresh Perspective
","Many people had negative comments on the movie because it was shaky, and caused nausea, giddiness and what-not, and thus they had trouble focusing on the movie. However, even though after the movie I felt a little off my feet, I thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, it was the shakiness of the screen that impressed me most.<br/><br/>The shakiness comes from the video camera in the movie used to document the whole experience, thus it really makes the whole plot realistic, as if you were watching a recorded video of a toddler's birthday party. If the image was crystal clear and unmoving, it will be very obvious that they had used multiple computer graphics, and that everything is thoroughly scripted.<br/><br/>This however, really made me treasure my life while watching the movie, and I literally had slight breathing problems as the thrill got to me. It is no longer a normal Godzilla or alien movie, where the U.S. govt. comes up with some secret weapon to save the day, but from the perspective from innocent people that you see in movies who are running away frantically from the monster.<br/><br/>To say this movie stinks due to a shaky screen means either you are really prone to motion sickness, or you are childish enough to ignore the wonders of the movie.<br/><br/>The only thing I wonder is how a video camera could still work for so long after so many hours and damages."

"Gutta624","9","1","3","3 February 2008"," Adults don't need supervision when crossing the street!!!
","I'm usually a read the posts kinda guy but I got upset when reading some of the comments from people who didn't like it. Most negative opinions came from the first person camera perspective (which I admit can be nauseating if you have a condition), poor acting, and lack of character development.<br/><br/>The camera action I thought was a necessary component of the film and definitely served the movie - it was not just a gimmick. It explains why we are not hand-held thru some annoying and implausible back-story for where the monster came from and why I felt immersed in the action of the movie.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the characters are like you and me. Partygoers thrust into a situation they had no control over. They're not scientists, military, or superheroes. Just average joes trying to get somewhere, anywhere after a catastrophe.<br/><br/>Character development is useful in stories that span days, weeks, months, and years. In a situation of this magnitude, the characters aren't the center, the situation is the main character. Why do people think there would be time in a movie that spanned 7 hours - most of which was spent running, hiding, fighting - that any character could be developed fully.<br/><br/>I haven't been excited about a movie in a while and I actually avoided all the hoopla surrounding it. My girlfriend wanted to see Juno tonight and I wanted to see this because I remember my friend telling me about the teaser trailer during Transformers. Oddly enough, she preferred this to Juno and we spent the whole car ride talking about the flick. It avoided most horror movie clichÃ©s like using music to heighten tension and having a neat tidy solution to killing the monster. The thought process is simple - there is no warning, no brainiac at the party who happens to know what to do, and no superheroes. I was impressed at how well the visuals and sound added to the movie. A great experience that I will not forget for a long time. People who want explanations should go see Deep Blue Sea or some crap like that."

","So it doesn't quite live up to the hype, but nothing that's had this amount of fan-boy speculation wanked in its general direction could live up to it. The fact that it very nearly does is incredible in itself. Genius marketing campaign aside and taken on its own merits this is thrilling event cinema at its best. Having the entire attack seen from the point of view of a camcorder-wielding everyman is a masterstroke. For the duration of the film you're there at street level among the panic and smoke, only catching glimpses of the threat and thus not being able to quite grasp its anatomy or scale. It causes a palpable sense of terror and it's sustained impressively for most of the run-time, only slipping on the odd occasion when you're shown too much (which is why I'm praying all this talk of a sequel comes to nought).<br/><br/>Of course these shaky-cam deals aren't to everyone's taste, and the character-driven realism might not satisfy people who want some fast cuts of fighter jets and slow-mo explosions in their blockbusters, but these people would be missing out on the most visceral thrill-ride to come out of Hollywood in donkey's yonks. A genuinely frightening and unsettling triumph of a movie, so for once you can (almost) believe the hype."

","Oh yes, what a movie! Having waited since the first trailer in Transformers, I finally get to see CLOVERFIELD! Considering everyones been bashing it for being similar to Blair Witch, that being one of my favorite movies, you'd think I'd give this a million thumbs up. But, alas, with every movie, there is always those negatives...<br/><br/>THE BEGINNING: Cheesy. Boring. I can understand why they had to do this but, blah. The hype was for the monster, not the story around the people."" OH NO!, THE LOVE OF MY LIFE CAME TO MY PARTY AND IS WITH ANOTHER GUY!"" It should have just been 10 minutes long, at least showing the connections with everyone fast, not spread out. I think it was just to get the audience to be attached with them so that when the died, they'ed feel remorse.<br/><br/>THE CHAOS: Amazing. Beautiful. The first explosion got me. I could'NT wait for more and more to happen.<br/><br/>THE MONSTER: Good. Creative-ish. It's a good monster and not really what you'd expect, since they never really gave any details. I liked the fact that little monsters came off of it, very smart, maybe unoriginal, but smart. The way the monster is presented is in a way that every monster movie is, give a little glimpse and build up from there. all in all, its a good balance.<br/><br/>THE DESTRUCTION: Wow. Spectacular. The special effect work was very well, some points the people did'NT fit well with the background. What I thought was just amazing was the subway scene. The CGI'd little monsters were very, very impressive. It was as if the were real. Obviously the lighting of the subway and the small camera played a big factor in making it look so impressive.(getting off subject a bit). The damage to the city was just, well, it looked a damn monster destroyed it! THE CLIMAX'S:Jaw-dropping. Unexpected. The death's, Wow, it was a good idea to just kill of everyone, basically. The girl exploding was great. Of course they had to put in a close up of the monster, which was served up well. Although it was as if the monster targeted just these people at one point.<br/><br/>THE END: Gripping. Sequel?... YES! YES! KILL THE MAIN CHARACTERS! JUST DO IT! Ahh its always good to have sad ending. More of a satisfying ending. If you did'NT know already, before all the credits there's the subliminal message that say ""It's Still Alive"".. possible sequel or just a way to make people go FREAKING CRAZY!!?!?!?!!?

"james_norman1981","Null","1","3","2 February 2008"," The template for many an inferior clone
","This movie represents either the nadir or the zenith of modern film making. Shot on a tiny budge and with an unknown cast, a deceptively simple advertising campaign has turned it from just-another-monster-movie into what will probably become the most profitable film of the year. Whether it will make stars of its actors, director or anyone, other than JJ Abrams, is a moot point, people will be talking about Cloverfield for many years to come and, sadly, poor imitations will soon be crowding our screens, especially if the writers' strike persists.<br/><br/>So what makes Cloverfield so extraordinary? That can be summed up in a single word: restraint. Sure the viral advertising campaign that has garnered so many column inches since Transformers first aired was a massive operation, but it succeeded, just like the movie, because of restraint. Throughout the whole film there are only occasional shots of the monster and they're never stable or show the whole thing in relief. In retrospect, I'm not even sure what the monster looks like except that it has a tail! But that's nothing compared to the restraint in exposition. Everyone knows that the unknown, unseen menace is much more dangerous than an identified, quantifiable antagonist, but it must've been less apparent that you could shoot an entire movie without answering a single one of the obvious questions. What is this monster? Where did it come from? How did it come to New York? Why is it dropping off little insect things with some very nasty bites? We don't even find out what fate befalls many of the characters, except the near certainty that several of them die. Yet this sparseness of information, just like the marketing for this movie, works to whet your appetite, not turn off your interest. Right now IMDb is getting a post a minute on its Cloverfield forum and that is only going to increase as the weekend progresses. Where Abrams takes his behemoth next will be the topic of much of that speculation, although I admit I haven't got the faintest idea what the answer is.<br/><br/>So, what about the film then? Sure it's puzzling, tantalising and motion sickness inducing, but is it any good? My answer is again I'm not sure. You see, the fact is, I came out of this movie wanting more, which is Hollywood's idea of heaven. But I'm not yet convinced this film is that great. All the characters are fairly bland, their motivations not entirely believable. The monster does eventually get revealed, pretty much in its entirety, but also appears both indestructible and curiously focused on our hapless band of New Yorkers. And the helicopter really should've flown at a higher altitude. I can't stress that enough. IT SHOULD'VE FLOWN AT A HIGHER ALTITUDE! I mean come on, it was flying through an area about to get blown to hell and back.<br/><br/>That brings up the main problem with the movie. Cloverfield makes an excellent job of generating our suspension of disbelief for the monster: it has turned up, we don't know why and neither do the characters so let's just get the hell out of there! I can believe all that. I just find it less believable that cell phones could work in such a situation (the networks were jammed for days during and after 9/11), the military lay on helicopters for civilians who ignored the mandatory evacuation, the little monsters get a hold of just about everyone in the tunnel but only bite one of them, those little critters also wait until the night vision is switched on before attacking and so forth.<br/><br/>Little questions like this are the scourge of films like Cloverfield, but that doesn't mean they still don't detract from the experience of the movie. However, the fact is that this film still swept me away with its visceral thrill ride, although I strongly advise no one to sit within ten rows of an even medium sized screen. From the sitcom style build up where everyone is in tangles over their love lives to the sudden transition to terror when the ground shakes and the lights go out everything is very immediate and, with no music and a shaky camera, very realistic.<br/><br/>Sure there are questions that occur, not least how incredibly close to exploiting 9/11 Abrams and his team have sailed with this movie, but those queries nearly all arise after the film has finished during it, you have little to no thought but for what's happening on screen. In short, though I can't rate it as, from one moment to the next, this movie sinks from ten stars to six before shooting right back up again, I would strongly recommend that you go and see Cloverfield and decide for yourself. If nothing else, that will stop you from having the entire concept spoilt for you by other people that, and the fact that this is a movie that definitely requires viewing on the largest screen available... and before every other producer in Hollywood tries to generate the clones that will, with depressing frequently, be turning up in multiplexes for ever more."

Way to bring us together.<br/><br/>Most of the time when there is a monster in an overall realistic movie, they usually explain where the monster comes from.

","To be honest, I never really expected much of Cloverfield. I saw the trailer and got pretty interested. I ignored a lot of the marketing, not being a fan of chasing pointless leads like a sheep, and went straight to googling Cloverfield monster to find out anything I possibly could about the monsters appearance.<br/><br/>You see, I was most concerned it would end up looking like a fake CGI monster that only made me laugh. This film would fail if it weren't for the design and look of the monster, which I won't give away, I'll just say, go and see the film and you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Okk, the beginning was a little slow and to be honest, I wasn't all that fussed by the characters. They're acting was good and understandable for someone in their situation but I refuse to listen to Hud ever again..Funny as he was, he definitely wasn't the brightest bulb.<br/><br/>The films plot was basic. Nothing else I really want to say as not to spoil the film. Cloverfield is more of a roller-coaster. The CGI blends incredibly well with the hand-held camera work, which I have barely mentioned because it hardly fussed me, only making the film feel more realistic then it could of possibly been without hand-held.<br/><br/>The film stands out as an incredible piece of work which should be seen. The CGI is fantastic, you do get to see the monster properly, the camera-work is excellent, even for hand-held and to be honest, by the end of the film you won't care about any of the questions that may not have been answered, you'll be enjoying the film as the excellent and even slightly disturbing roller-coaster it is.<br/><br/>Don't miss it. 8/10"
"veetoo","9","1","3","2 February 2008"," One kick ass popcorn movie
","Being somewhat long in the tooth, it takes something very unique to capture this particular individuals attention. Cloverfeld did it for me with it's totally original visual style (video diary) and CGI the likes of which I have never before seen. The only drawback for me (and to be honest it was minor, on this occasion) was the total lack of character back-story (apart from flashbacks going back some months of two of the main protagonists). Although the film was cast with the obligatory 'beautiful people' their acting skills were pretty damn sharp. In summation .. the best popcorn movie I have ever seen. The Making of DVD is at the top of my most wanted."

","I went to the opening night of this movie...because to be honest I was one of the marketing victims from the trailers...all though I had my mind ready to see another stupid Hollywood movie with heroes and the American Army at its best as always!!!... But with a few words I could say that Im proud to watch this movie...! I really appreciate how difficult was for the director to show as all this amazing special effects coming from the ""home camera""...shaking...with not filters and huge color resolutions... If the director's idea was to make it look and feel real....then he did the best anyone has done until now in the movies history! So what if the camera was shaking all the time?...why everything has to be so perfect in the Hollywood industry?..and had to be a ""perfect"" studio movie?.....believe me if it was a huge ""perfect"" movie I would had this warm feelings about it right now...and I would'not siting and writing a comment about it! Im really proud watching this...it gave me a lot of feelings..some of them horror ones...some happy ones! I would really like to watch a sequel soon...I look forward for it..even if its not going to be the same good like the first one.. Mr director you have a lot of explaining to do !!! and keep up the amazing work and brain you have!"
"hesdeadjim82","10","1","3","2 February 2008"," A new genre is born
","When the film ended in the cinema, the audience was silent. Amongst the silence all I good hear were ""that was brilliant"" or ""wow"" comments. I have to agree with them!! It shows that a movie doesn't have to have a detailed story line or background explaining origins, to entertain you. It was a movie made purely for the viewers experience, you are on the journey with them and know all they know as they try to understand the situation. The camera work makes you feel a little dodgy at first, but you get use to it. I must say that the editing to make a big budget monster movie look amateurish was inspired. This monster really puts Godzilla to shame! The look of it is very different to my preconceptions to what it was like. I am disappointed at people who expected more from this movie (in terms of the story). Nothing else was needed, you are meant to use your imagination and fill in the gaps. That is what makes this movie great because it was different."
"thegoodcatholic","2","1","3","2 February 2008"," get a lobotomy instead
","I have to confess, I was just as drawn into the hype as everybody else was. Eagerly awaiting to fill my morbid fascination of our civilization's demise at the hands, or claws or was it paws?, of yet another disgruntled genetic mutation. While I was handing out tums in the parking lot to my sons, it hit me; I was framed, mislead, swindled. But wait, perhaps it was silly of me to expect such notions as a plot, character development and acting in a, what do you call them?? Right, right, a movie. I never realized that Martha Stewart was a consultant on this movie, how else could have J.J. pulled off that initial 15 minutes of ""How to host a party for pretentious and over bred 20 somethings""? So once my mind had managed to resurrect itself from that particular segment of drudgery, well, it was exposed to further lamentable and pathetic attempts at acting. Not only did I view the characters with that particular form of disdain only reserved for ex wives, but within seconds of their plight I was salivating at the though of their inevitable and hopefully torturous death. ( Thank you, exploding head.) The script was mesmerizing. The studio must have had a roomful of monkeys employed to do this, thus the wonderful plethora of 'Oh, God', 'God, Oh, God!' and the unforgettable 'Oh, No, God No!'. Editing was also top notch. Thus scene A where everybody is covered in dust to scene B where everybody is not. The special effects, well, they must have been special but I saw very little of it, for I spent most of the remainder of the movie doing my best not to imitate a gerbil and regurgitate my previous meals. There were characters with re-bars pulled out of their chest, half devoured by giant cockroaches, involved in helicopter crashes, but apparently all well enough to compete in the three mile sprint in heels. (Which should definitely be in the direction of the nearest acting school.) The accumulating effect of it all had given me enough strength to overcome my nausea and raise my hand in support of the enraged creature. Tears swelled in my eyes, as bomb after bomb was dropped on its obviously bomb proof shell. Hoping that it abandoned its crazed speculation in Manhattan real estate and instead would locate its agent and shook him until his innards came loose. Here is free advice for the sequel. Just make the creature watch the first film. Surely, after that, it will give up consumption of human meat, go vegan, retreat to its oceanic lair to study Haiku and fill the rest of its days doing soduku and devouring seaweed. OH, does anyone know where I can get one of those cameras that never run out of batteries and can withstand large chunks of concrete and a nuclear explosion?"

","This movie has been done many times before, ""godzilla"", ""king Kong"" and other big monsters attacking huge cities. you name it. The camera work makes this film 'special' but doesn't make the plot any different. The first 20 minutes, are boring, but the director successfully 'draws' us in into the characters had he not had the 20 minute introduction. Meanwhile, the entire movie is about running away and being chased. The plot and story are not there, and let's just say nothing is explained by the ending, making the movie a bit pointless- wouldn't you want to watch a movie to see what happens at the end? I doubt there will be a Cloverfield 2."

","I was not impressed at all with this film, particularly when I leaned forward during the third act and discovered that my back was wrenched. Looking back, that was the best part of this film experience because at least then i actually felt something other than contempt for yet another unoriginal Hollywood rip-off chock full of one-dimensional, clichéd characters. The best thing that happened was when they all died. Except for the dog. God, I loved 'Lil Scruffy. I hope he (she?) turns up in the sequels. P.S. Note to J.J.

"Eggy499","9","1","3","1 February 2008"," Rip-Roaring, Retina-Raping Randomness!!
","Cloverfield is a species of film that rarely comes along, due to the potential for utter disaster and bombing at the Box Office. Godzilla sucked, yet the Blair Witch Project was highly successful and deserved the money it won. Perhaps if you heard about a combination of these films, you might be worried that they might ruthlessly combat with each other, until they cancel each other out, and you end up with a bland film.<br/><br/>But you would be well, well wrong.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is probably the most Hollywood Un-Hollywood Hollywood film ever, meaning that its story was 10000000% Hollywood, but was done in a way that isolated it from Hollywood, but a monster attacking New York and a story about ordinary people filming it and the way it was flaunted was also Hollywood. Firstly, if there was a monster attacking my city, I would RLH and go the opposite direction, fearing for my life. And if I was on a street in NY, with M1 Abrams and Marines firing over my head at a 25-storey monster behind me, I would not keep searching for my friend, who is probably dead, but i would burst my eardrums and run, run far, far away. But our motley crew of ''average Joe's'' decide to look for their friend, whom they have not copped on that is probably stone dead. Cloverfield, in all his vehement, hideous appearances, is not like King Kong or Godzilla. Whereas King Kong is a giant ape and Godzilla is a big lizard, Cloverfield is more random and complex. Indeed, his big close-up is negated by the run-up. You would expect him to be something a lot more simpler in his design, but he is quite disappointing to look at. He is no cult monster, like KK or Godzilla or even as cult as the aliens in MARS ATTACKS! But this film is superlative to Godzilla, or the Blair Witch Project, and most certainly Mars Attacks! The special effects are superb, and along with the shaky-camera-work (I would not recommend this to motion-sickness prone people, but, thankfully, I do not suffer from it, thanks to the Incredible Hulk coaster that shook it out of me) make the scenes seem credible. The characters are highly underdeveloped, but that was incidental, as Hud (the cameraman) probably knew all about them, and couldn't be boogied to inform you. The ending is notoriously crap, much like Godzilla's, and also like Godzilla, it left room for a sequel to answer those unanswered questions. I thought that the unexplained attitude was interesting, but I was like ''WTF???'' when the film ended.<br/><br/>The special-effects and exotic choice of storyline attracted me the most, but i deduct 2 marks for the pure idiocy of the logic in the film, but just refer to the title for my verdict on the film.<br/><br/>So 8/10"

","I'm surprised that this movie had such high reviews from everyone. I was disappointed. The movie is only an 1hr 15min long, I timed it - not that that's a problem, per se. But you're essentially watching a ""monster attacks city"" flick that's very short and ends abruptly without resolving much at all. I don't stand alone in my opinion - most of the people in the theater were grumbling and the entire row behind me expressed their disappointed when the credits rolled. Some comments I can't post but lets say they wanted their money back. The camera point of view was neat - similar to blair witch but they did a better job here. Good action too. But, overall, I expected it to be much better. I give it 5 of 10 stars."
"kjpcards","7","1","3","25 January 2008"," Great movie. wasn't expecting much...
","May contain spoilers.<br/><br/>I don't typically like monster or horror movies. I saw this with my uncle 'cause he wanted to see it. I registered on this site because there are so many people that hated this movie that I just had to voice my glowing review.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so of this movie are all about character development (also, I think we are supposed to be seeing the ENTIRETY of the film in the camera). The back story is touching and I wondered if I would have the courage to search for the one I love if I was facing the same circumstances and didn't even know if she was still alive. Hud, the guy with the camera, was, at times, annoying, but I'm sure most of us are good friends with people like him. I felt connected to them. I think the people complaining about character development were looking for really hot people with some cool one-liners. These characters are much more personal and realistic. Their decisions and actions seemed to be real and rational.<br/><br/>Once the action began, there was non-stop suspense and fear. Not knowing what's out there is much more effective than just explaining it up front. Even though many are disappointed that explanations aren't provided at the end, I think the movie was more effective without them. Do you think people knew what was happening when buildings were collapsing on them on 9/11? This movie intends to put that fear of the unknown in the viewer. Everything isn't always spelled out. However, we can deduce that the monster was either killed or moved on because the film was recovered.<br/><br/>This movie captured me. I was rooting for Rob's, the main character, heroic attempts would eventually pay off for him and Lizzy (i think it was). unfortunately it doesn't. It turns out that Rob probably got the group killed. Sometimes movies end badly. Without variety, everything would be boring.<br/><br/>This movie had more impressive effects than I was expecting for such a low budget film. The scenes of destruction are convincing and chilling (i actually had chills go up my spine). The bridge scene in particular was scary as hell.<br/><br/>I gave this a 7 instead of a higher rating for several reasons.<br/><br/>1. This movie will not be nearly as exciting the second time around. The suspense and the fear will not be the same. I feel a top all-time movie should have great replay value.<br/><br/>2. Mylena. this character seemed pointless, except for a few small laughs. At the beginning of the film, she keeps saying that she doesn't even know rob. Then why the hell is she following him to almost certain doom? what does she care about his quest? I'd be getting the f$%@ outta there.<br/><br/>3. The survival of the helicopter crash was a little too unbelievable. Up to that point, I felt the teams survival was quite believable (with the exception maybe of Lizzy's).<br/><br/>This movie did what any great movie should do. It kept the viewers asking many questions and wanting more. If there is a sequel, I'll see it, but it won't be as ""new and exciting"" and will probably only serve as an explanation of the monster. Overall...... quality watch."
"ccollins1985","Null","1","3","23 January 2008"," Different... In a GOOD Way!
","When I first heard of Cloverfield I was browsing through this very site. Curious, over the lack of information I was finding, I looked for whatever I could find. Only to find very little, other than a few mostly vague trailers, some sketches of a sperm whale with legs and tentacles and some information which pretty much lead me to believe this movie is being held overly confidential for its (in a couple of months away) release date. Most trailers and sites have given any and all information on the movie as well as show every good scene within 1-2 minutes. I was Incredibly INTREGUED by knowing almost nothing. The only other thing I could find a mere days before the release was the entire movie was filmed with hand-held cameras... again, VERY intrigued.<br/><br/>So naturally I went and saw it. I didn't feel the least bit let down.<br/><br/>I was drawn to how mysterious the film seemed... though a monster movie is entirely unoriginal these days. But to me it really wasn't a monster movie, it was something I've always wanted to see, a movie filmed essentially from the point of view (POV) of the main characters. Like an old episode of the TV show M*A*S*H, except the character has a known identity. Yea so the movie is very, ummmm, ""bouncy"" but if you were running around through a battlefield and things were falling down, blowing up, etc... do you really think you see things as if standing perfectly still? Just how perfectly still do the things around you appear when your trying to sit still? I think the above mentioned made the characters that much better too. You didn't really want them to die, because you were them. They were your friends. You lived with them through brief but fun and hard times of their lives and then get thrown into this incredible situation.<br/><br/>The film wasn't overly comedic, it wasn't overly girlie/romancing, and it wasn't packed with ridiculous action scenes. I hate how almost EVERY movie, the main character is some kind of (SAVE THE DAY/WORLD and/or DESTROY THE ENEMY) type of hero. These characters did some crazy things... but they didn't defeat the monster, or come up with a way to defeat the monster. They didn't have some sort of scientific way to be attached to it (their mom or dad was some geneticist working on a government experiment). These characters were just chill, REAL people living their lives.<br/><br/>I wont have the chance to see many movies in the theater this year. I will be shipping out for Basic Training and Military Police School, which will last me most of the year with little to no time for movies. I am definitely happy I had a chance to see Cloverfield.<br/><br/>**!!SPOILERS BELOW!!** Not to many movies kill off ALL of the main characters. Though we are only left to assume that one may have made it out alive on the first chopper. Honestly... I thought this was great.<br/><br/>The ending kind of sucked, I see a sequel in the making. In my opinion, it wont be a whole new monster somewhere else or that the original didn't die in the final bombing run. I think that it may pick up from another persons perspective during the original attack, and lead to answering the many unanswered questions we are left with."

To be completely honest i actually enjoyed this movie until it ended and this is where i have my beef with it, which in turn ruined the entire movie for me. No explanation is ever given for the entire event. It is simply them running and action happening but no explanations, no plot development, no real insight into why it happened, how it happened, the aftermath of it all or even what the thing was. The way the movie was shot and how it ended also left a distinct Blair Witch feeling about the whole ordeal. If your looking for pure action, which is still mediocre at best then this movie may be interesting to you.

","First of all, get over the shaky camera work. What is it supposed to be like when you're running for your life and/or being attacked by some pretty nasty and messy monsters? Our camera man does more than amazing work, hanging on to his video camera as he runs from one battle zone to another, is attacked by some vicious insect-like pests, has to find a way to move between two buildings that are in the best of shapes, and he has to correct a few crisis of his own, as our four characters try to keep one step ahead of a creation that Godzilla would envy, and the U.S. Army has a hell of a time trying to keep under control.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure, we are left wanting more, as the X-File look and feel of the film doesn't really tell us much about the origin of the creatures, the final resolution, and well, we want to see more of the damage and destruction that is done to NYC. One thing is certain. there is plenty of nifty special effects, as fire balls, bombs, bullets, minor earthquakes, and some destructive attacks make sure some landmarks go from contemporary masterpieces to historic ruins in seconds. The shots involving the Statue of Liberty and a famous bridge are cinema classic moments now.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" doesn't lack suspense, excitement, and some very scary moments.

The sound and action in the film are amazing, a perfect blend of horror, thrill, and even comedy.

","Cloverfield was amazing. It was only an hour and twenty minutes long, but that's how long it needed to be. There were no boring spots. The movie begins by introducing the characters at a going away party for the ""main character"" Rob. Out of nowhere it seems like there is an earthquake and when they all go outside, it just happens that the Statue of Liberty's head comes crashes down to the ground. The terror begins then and goes on to the very end of the film. They did a great job with exploiting the ""monster"" as well. You didn't see it too much or too little. At times it looked like a giant spider, at others a dinosaur. Also the cameraman, Hud, added some comedy to the movie. At one time he was more worried about a ""flaming hobo coming out of nowhere"" than the monster. Every time you saw the monster at a distance you couldn't help but sit there in awe. Oh, and if you guys didn't know, which I didn't when I saw it either, if you click on FAQ, it tells you that at the end of the credits you hear an audio clip of a guy saying ""help us"" and ""it's not dead"". We can only assume that it's Rob because he said help us and not help me, and he was with his girlfriend Beth at the end, when we all thought they were killed. Also if you remember Lily was put on a chopper before the rest of the gang and you never saw it go down or be attacked. So basically you can assume that three of the main characters are still alive;Rob, Beth and Lily. This definitely makes a possibility of a sequel. Oh yeah, and the person who said this movie sucks, you can kiss my ass. I give it an A+."

I personally think the way it was shot, is what made the movie. Why? Because you feel like you're actually there with these people going through this horror. Just imagine you being there running and looking around and seeing all of this go down. What you see through the camcorder is what you'd see through your own eyes. That's why I loved it.

"voicelessone19-1","10","2","10","19 January 2008"," Incredibly Effective
","When I first saw the trailer for Cloverfield, it didn't even give a name, simply the date 1-18-2008. Furthermore, I didn't know what to expect. Thanks to a wonderfully viral marketing campaign, neither did anyone else. That led to tons of speculation, mostly false, about what would occur within this movie's incredibly intense, groundbreaking 80 minutes.<br/><br/>That, alone, made me feel like paying to see this movie.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Cloverfield lived up to the genius of its ad campaign by maintaining its intensity and compelling drama throughout. The monster, unlike the American Godzilla, seems impervious to conventional weaponry, and the story basically leaves you in the dark about everything, which I loved.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield both used a hand-held camera. That's about it. Cloverfield, despite its hand-held appearance, actually contains amazing cinematography and carefully planned shots. In many scenes, simply the placement of the camera behind people or objects allows the obstruction of terrible events, which serves to fuel the viewers imagination. I never felt the same way about the Blair Witch Project. To me, at least, Cloverfield's cinematography is groundbreaking.<br/><br/>As a psychology major, I always look for convincing characters. Cloverfield contains multiple characters who, while never becoming incredibly deep, manage to convey the action and react incredibly realistically to the situation. Some characters simply shut off their fear instincts, some simply break down, while still others cling desperately to ideals or, in the case of the cameraman Hud, objects. Hud's fascination with the camera didn't require any suspension of disbelief for me; I believe it served as a vehicle through which he could maintain his sanity.<br/><br/>As a writing double major, I also considered the story. Unlike most action movies which toss around a few ideas while remaining centrally generic and derivative, Cloverfield takes a rare, character-driven approach. This movie succeeds on its basest level simply by using the characters as a medium for the progression of the plot. Instead of relying on tons of deus ex machina and far too many coincidences, the plot progresses by the actions and desires of the characters.<br/><br/>Cloverfield certainly contains some genre conventions and even some flat-out clichÃ©s, but the groundbreaking style and evincing character-driven narrative render those minor problems nearly invisible. Even at its most generic points Cloverfield simply nods to the founding fathers of its genre, which I can respect. After all, the movie is a genre movie, and most good genre movies nod to the classics.<br/><br/>I will say that I don't believe Cloverfield will work for everyone. Those who find monster movies completely stupid, those looking for plot explication, or those seeking anything more than a visceral shot of how people react during an emergency should probably look elsewhere. However, those looking for an astounding event movie, a monster movie instant classic, or a surprisingly deep character study should check out Cloverfield. It may surprise you."
"m_bd89","7","2","12","15 February 2008"," Not as good as people say
","After all the hype me and a couple of friends decided to go watch Cloverfield a few weeks earlier, and I have to say I was not that impressed. First of all, all the shaking and the bad camera work was not nauseating that's all just an exaggeration. But what really bothered me is that the character holding the camera (conveniently called HUD or Heads Up Display) wasted most of his time filming people and soldiers running around rather than the monster itself, I found this very annoying and quite stupid. The quarter of the movie is in a party, an extremely boring party might I add. At the end of the movie i felt kind of unsatisfied for numerous reasons. by the end of the movie nothing was clarified, I felt that the hole movie was just a big publicity stunt for the producers to make more money out of the sequel. The monster itself was very good and extremely cool, I did however recommend Cloverfield to my brother but I told him not to expect much. It is very over-hyped and they try to pass this movie as something that it is not like I told my brother it's just another monster movie nothing more."
"zetes","7","2","12","20 January 2008"," Bland yuppie characters don't make me care much that they might die. But the monster is scary!
","I've been thinking of this movie as the Blair Godzilla Project for months now, and I was pretty much entirely correct on what to expect. It's a good concept. I mean, everyone decided to hate The Blair Witch Project after it opened wide, but it was an excellent idea, and an effective film. It didn't work more than once, but that first time packed quite a wallop (for me at least). Cloverfield has the same flaws as that film. You spend a lot of time wondering why the character with the camera wouldn't at least set the camera aside some of the time (they do attempt to make it more believable than BWP did, but it's not always convincing). Also as in BWP, the characters are bland, vapid and not much worth caring about. They're all very TV-style good looking (in fact, most everyone involved with the movie came from that medium), and you'd certainly stare at the girls' butts if you saw them on the street. But on TV or in the movies, they're average. Does any real-life woman actually find the scruffy, unshaven look sexy? Hollywood has been shoving that look upon us for years now, and I don't think I've ever known of a female who wants her face ground down by stubble every time she gets close to her guy. Two of the male characters look so much alike I was relieved when one of them bit the dust. At least I wouldn't be confused anymore. But, oh yeah, there's a monster. And it's pretty scary. And the filmmakers are smart enough to hold back on what you see (although I should mention that Korean director Bong Joon-Ho made a much better monster movie last year in which the monster is seen in toto almost immediately). All in all, Cloverfield is a moderately entertaining monster movie. If you didn't like The Blair Witch Project, I would definitely avoid it. But if you did like BWP, and like Godzilla, it's not a bad way to spend 90 minutes. Make sure, if you do see it, to sit through the credits sequence. There's a lot of buzz about an impossible-to-hear mumble that is audible right before the studio logo comes up, but the real reason to stick around is to hear Michael Giacchino's bombastic and hilariously unnecessary closing overture and what it's called. It makes the movie."

This movie reminded me entirely of the 1997 Godzilla movie, same city being destroyed New York, except this one seemed like it was done right. Monsters are much scarier if you don't see them constantly, and they just pop into view briefly and unexpectedly.<br/><br/>I thought the whole idea of starting the movie off like a love story, and then totally changing the type of movie after a quarter of the way through was an extremely clever plot device. It's what kept the movie completely unexpected for me.<br/><br/>Some people complained about feeling nauseous from the hand-held camera movement effects.

","The impressive teaser trailers for Cloverfield revealed some stunning footage of the destruction of New York, but refused to reveal the film's title, creating much conjecture and discussion about the true nature of the project amongst film fans. Ironically, it was this well orchestrated hype that made me give this one a miss at the cinema, for I had fallen for this kind of marketing ploy before and wasn't about to be duped again. It's a shame, because for once, the film lives up to the hype and I would have dearly loved to have seen this in all of its big budget, blockbuster glory on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Written by J.J. Abrams, the man who created compulsive but confusing TV series Lost, Cloverfield has been described as The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla, a summary that proves to be very accurate: utilising hand-held POV camera-work (video footage supposedly shot by one of the characters) to achieve a sense of naturalistic realism, the film follows several 20-something New Yorkers as they try and escape from Manhattan after it is attacked by a huge and very destructive monster.<br/><br/>Director Matt Reeves imagery is deliberately reminiscent of footage taken during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and instantly brings to mind the horror of that unforgettable event; this connection with something so real and terrible makes Cloverfield all the more harrowing. Add to this Abram's well constructed script featuring credible and occasionally witty dialogue (my favourite lines: What was that? I don't know... something else, also terrible), an impossibly good looking but largely unknown cast who all give very plausible performances, and superb special effects that merge seamlessly into the live action, and the result is a surprisingly enjoyable experience from start to depressing finish (like REC, Cannibal Holocaust, and The Blair Witch Project, which also used the documentary style to great effect, Cloverfield ends on an extremely downbeat note)."

It is stupid to look for logic in this kind of movies but this is beyond any reasonable thinking. Just imagine that something so awful is happening to you and your friends and one of your friends through the whole terrifying situation, where you are literary fighting for your lives, is holding a camera in order to document it. There were a few scenes where they were in great danger and that stupid and annoying guy instead of putting the camera down and helping them, he keeps on filming! It is an insult for the viewers' intelligence. Further comments on this movie are not necessary.

"Boba_Fett1138","10","1","4","21 July 2008"," Perhaps the only movie in history that got really made by its marketing.
","Of course every big movie has a marketing strategy and whole team behind it but in this case it really seems as if it was the marketing idea that made this movie, rather than the actual movie inspired its marketing strategy. I don't know if it's true but I would suspect that the marketing strategy was already ready way before the movie got completed. It was it's mysterious marketing approach that made this movie one of the most anticipated and mysterious movies ever released. No one really knew what this movie was about, until the time of its actual release. Before that we got to see mysterious looking trailers in which nothing got revealed. For a long time even the movie its title was a mystery, with only the name ""1-18-08"" as the promotional title. But does the movie also lives up to its hype and expectations? In my opinion it seriously does and the movie is better than I even could had ever hoped for.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" got made for a fairly low budget (about $25,000,000), which is mostly due to its approach. It's entirely shot with an hand-held camera and the movie is made to look as if it was shot by a group of 'bystanders' who happened to have a video camera at hand at the moment New York City mysteriously fell under attack. This of course gives the movie an unique as well as realistic look and feeling to it. It also helps that the movie its cast are unknowns, so you're never too sure about it who is going to die in the movie and when.<br/><br/>Despite its low budget, it's still a visually impressive movie. Buildings are collapsing and things are exploding- as well as the Cloverfield-monster itself is great and realistic looking. For most of the time you can only see her(?) tail or a leg but toward the end you of course get to see more and more, perhaps a bit too much at times. Too much because it at moments goes at the expense of the movie its realism. Where ever our main heroes go, there is the monster as well and not just miles away but often right next, or even right above or below them.<br/><br/>The movie is a very original new way to bring 'monster' movies. The movie isn't following a real script, in which it tries to explain everything. This provides the movie with an uncomfortable feeling and also makes it an unpredictable to watch. It's its approach and actual handling of the concept that makes ""Cloverfield"" such an highly effective, as well as a modern classic to watch.<br/><br/>Beauty about this entire concept as well is that you can bring countless more sequels without having to worry about continuity or characters. You can tell endlessly new stories, from survivors who shot the whole event with a video-camera. You can tell the same story basically over and over again that way from different angels, each time perhaps giving away some more information each time about where the creature came from and how, what and why all. A new Cloverfied movie has already been announced at this stage.<br/><br/>Already one of the best and also most original movies of this decade.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","First off, this isn't a flick for your typical and conventional movie goer. If you are one that needs everything to be laid out for you in black and white and have all the details explained and explored, you will hate this movie. The brilliance behind Cloverfield is that its not supposed to be conventional. It's not about heroics or character development. It's a surreal journey into fear and terror. There isn't a moment without frenzy or panic. Sure this movie evokes feelings of 9/11 but as horrific as that event was it only adds to the terrifying beauty of this film.<br/><br/>What makes Cloverfield so great is that it doesn't waste time with the characters because in actuality they are meaningless. They are your everyday regular people caught in a middle of a disaster thats seemingly impossible to escape. The whole shaky camera aspect serves the purpose of bringing the frenzied reality of Cloverfield to life. If this movie was filmed as a normal movie would, it would have never worked. In a time of nothing but sequels and rehashes it was a breath of fresh air to see something fresh and new. Cloverfield doesn't deserve all the critical pans it has received."

","I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite movies but it was well worth renting. I initially expected the monster to be something different than what it turned out to be but still had a great time watching it. The things I liked the most about the movie were in the way it was filmed. Many people complain profusely about the camera moving and bouncing around, but hey, you were told about that before seeing it, so I don't know why you rented it if that bothers you. If that would bother you, don't rent it. If you didn't like the way ""The Blair Witch"" was filmed or you get motion-sickness from it, you probably won't like this movie.<br/><br/>The best thing about the camera bouncing around, to me, is that practically everyone has operated a video camera at one time or another and the home-video feel of the movie immediately connects you to the actors in a way that a professional handling wouldn't. You feel like you are one of these people going through this experience in a way that the Godzilla movies can't invite you to participate (although I do love all the Godzilla movies, Japanese and American). I was genuinely ""on the edge of my seat"" and I haven't felt that way watching a horror movie in quite a while. Actually, the only ""critical"" thing I could say about the movie is that the detached Statue of Liberty's head just doesn't look big enough to me."

There we find out that the woman Rob's in love with has brought another guy and an argument ensues. The gathering feels what is originally reported as an earthquake. The initial attack has taken place. The movie gives you hints as to what the monster looks like. The parasites are quite frightening as well. I really enjoyed the fact that I felt part of the movie at some points as I became engrossed in the story line. The only problem I had with the format was it can make you a bit nauseous if you're sensitive to motion. It's like when you watch someone's homemade videos and they move the camera too fast.

","This is the movie that technically talented but shallow people (people who think Star Wars is deep) would make. Even if you buy the premise, of all the people this event would affect in Manhattan, we have to spend the whole movie with dumb, inarticulate, shouting, self-absorbed 25 year olds (all of them white, natch), who couldn't think their way out of a dumpster. I guess all non-white people over 25 made it off Manhattan. You just get the feeling that these shallow dicks cannot wait to tell everyone it happened to them.<br/><br/>The movie takes all of about twenty minutes to squander its potential. It starts with an interminable, dumb party scene whose entire purpose is to convince 25 year old viewers that the characters are cool enough (and the right age) to identify with. There is nothing of later importance that you need to take note of in the party scene. Then we're deposited in the poorly developed, intelligence-free creature half. The design of the creature is just a massive dud. Its semi-revelation comes way too soon, at which point it's such a lame concept that the only thing the movie can be is ""Biggest zoo animal ever, loose in the city."" If you don't have better ideas than that, just never show the damned creature. <br/><br/>Just because your chosen format (video journal) doesn't allow the characters to fully understand the story, doesn't mean filmmakers can proceed without one so they can blow crap up. Why an undersea creature farts flaming bombs is just one of the juvenile resolution/conception problems (who knows?). Even if you read about the creature's back story, it makes no sense.<br/><br/>I was trying to imagine which idiot would be the tastiest. And couldn't this thing eat them quicker? And then track down the writers? For this to receive accusations of originality is just sad. Everything in the movie is how Hollywood does it.

And furthermore, anyone who was alive and watching 9/11 knows that this was nothing short of a very bad joke. The worst amateur photographer would have done better. According to my nieces who saw this movie at the theatre, it simply made them sick to their stomachs. They left the movie early.<br/><br/>You had such a great monster that was ruined by the filming and the main character 'Rob'. I have an idea, go back and treat this movie as a documentary, put in a real beginning and add commentary, show us 'how, when, where, why, and what' about this monster, then put in a real ending showing whether the world survived or not (we don't care which), re-release it as a DVD and we might even accept it as a decent film. Rob and his friends should have been secondary to the actual story of Manhattan being eaten by a monster. That Is A Great Story!!! But this is the worse film I have ever seen.

","Blair Witch really does meet Godzilla in epic disaster movie which thrills and entertains.<br/><br/>It must be said that a fine job was done of using viral networking to promote this movie. This built up hype beyond what marketed promotion can ever achieve, but of course has the knock on effect of creating a monster (no pun intended) which may fail to live up to the expectations.<br/><br/>With Blair Witch already having used the same method of advertising, and being of the same filming style, Cloverfield had to hope its product was at least as good as that seminal classic.<br/><br/>And quite frankly, it is probably better.<br/><br/>Cloverfield, in brief summary, sees Manhattan attacked by a huge beast which appears to come from nowhere. Obviously, this basic premise is caked in 100% fantasy but there are clear 9/11 overtones throughout, particularly the main characters coughing in dust-dense air, but these real life comparisons should end there.<br/><br/>This movie is fiction, and is about a group of 20 somethings as they desperately try to survive the onslaught, and of course, the main selling point of the story is that it is all told through the camcorder one of them has, in order to document the whole ordeal. There is no 'fancy' and glossy Hollywood celluloid here, it is all through the eye of a 'gritty' camera. Of course, the wonderful benefit of this is that by having the 'real' look, the actual special effects also manage to convince entirely. Under a glossy movie, it is that bit less convincing, but out of this kind? It really works much, much better - same budget, but real look.<br/><br/>The acting is also extremely good, and frankly barely even looks acted - the real look correlates to how the performances come across - they look terrified, confused, and there are even moments where dialogue seems improvised or 'stumbled' - further increasing the realism instead of pristinely articulated lines.<br/><br/>A love story is even thrown in for good measure, but rather than being cheesy, it fits well - indeed, the whole movie just fits - and even manages to amuse in places. Hud, in particular, with his inept and ignorantly awkward conduct, provides many laughs.<br/><br/>This really is a great movie and a hell of a lot of fun. Yeah, it's only 74 minutes or so long, but I'm not sure more could have been added to it to lengthen it, and of course there's the point about the camera's battery life. Further realism.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this one unreservedly."

So be sure to watch this with at least decent surround because that is half the fun of this movie. The gimmicky tool of Blair Witch hand-held is cranked up to full effect giving us a sense of first person perspective of the horrors unfolding around a small confused group of friends/colleagues. The tension and spectacle is breathtaking but there also some much needed humour provided mostly by the dorky cameraman. But what elevates the film is that we care for the main characters and there is even a subtle love story that cleverly encapsulates the chaos. The movie maybe ridden with horror/SF clichés but they are all given a fresh and unique spin. A terrific monster hit"

","The marketing department for J.J. Abram's Cloverfield did an excellent job to build up the mystery surrounding this film; it was the first time in years I had gone into a movie theatre without knowing much of the film's premise.<br/><br/>The film seems to be combining elements from The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla in this tale of survival and love amidst a monster attack in New York City. Although this sort of apocalyptic story has been done well over a thousand times in New York, it is executed brilliantly and it seems as though the filmmakers have reinvented the way we see monster films by taking this home video style approach to the film. However, the shaky cam could make some individuals feel somewhat disoriented as a result.<br/><br/>Many people criticise this film for not shedding light on where this creature comes from, what it is, and what happens afterwards, although that is the film's strongest asset; keeping the audience in the dark allows them to let their imagination run wild and fill in the gaps themselves. It is a much smarter approach than to have a random scientist in a lab coat spoon feeding the audience exactly what is happening, but unfortunately, that is what many people were expecting. The exclusion of recognizable stars gives the film more credibility, but that could also have been because of budgetary constraints. What the actor's are experiencing looks genuine and convincing enough for me to watch the film without judging their acting performances."
"christinekay","9","1","4","16 February 2008"," Cloverfield - not your average monster movie
","""Cloverfield"" features a gigantic monster that terrorises New York, and the military seem powerless to prevent it rampaging through the streets. If this seems a familiar plot, then it is - it is a basic horror/fantasy theme that has featured in ""King Kong"", ""Godzilla"", ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", and no doubt countless other productions.<br/><br/>However, a look at the film will show that this takes a different stance: with the use of the hand-held camera throughout, this is, as far as I know, the first to show what it would actually be like to be caught up in an attack by such a creature. Most monster films have a buildup that shows the monster beforehand (ie Kong in his natural habitat before his capture and arrival in NYC, or the creation of the various dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park""). As frightening as these films are, we are at least prepared for what we are going to see: we can find some comfort in knowing what these monsters are, and we are not exactly surprised when they go on the rampage. ""Cloverfield"" takes a different stance. We are watching what seems a rather tedious party, when we hear noises - are they explosions? Fireworks? Gunfire? We don't know and are as puzzled as the actors themselves. We feel unnerved, and are glad to have our curiosity at least partly satisfied when someone turns on the TV (our source of immediate information) and find the news that a tanker has gone down in NY harbour. At least we now know what has happened .... or do we? When the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the street, then we realise that this is something far worse than an accident . We are as helpless as the partygoers: what to do? Stay in the apartment or get out? Eventually, there is the sighting of something so awful, we cannot describe it. Our instinct is to flee to a safe place, of course, but this is not your normal emergency. There is the obvious panic and hysteria, and sheer inability to comprehend what is happening, and it is the fear of not knowing what to do, of being in a totally alien world, that scares us, for we the audience, are right there with those involved.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" has been criticised by some critics for not giving enough definition to the leading characters, yet I do not feel this is entirely fair. We do care about them - after all, if they feel safe, we feel safe. It's also important to remember that they are characters following a very basic human need: that of keeping themselves alive at all costs. You cannot expect wisecracks or eloquent speeches on the future of mankind in a situation like this - your focus will be on finding that elusive place of safety.<br/><br/>Many have also made reference to the film and its parallels with 9/11 - the unknown enemy that threatens us. This is certainly a valid point, and yet I feel that the film would still have succeeded in its aims even without that analogy. ""Cloverfield"" shows us the human race in danger from the unknown, be it flying saucers from the 1950's, or the Spanish flu epidemic of the 1910's, or the atom bombs of the Cold War. There is always something out there to scare us and it is up to us to confront it."

There was absolutely no chemistry between the key characters. Bad camera angles. Cheap special effects and puppet-like monsters that belong in a B-movie. Predictable ending. The movie trailer is great because it makes you wonder what the movie is all about.

"antoniotierno","7","1","4","11 February 2008"," original disaster movie
","The experiment is not about an epic disaster but regards a kind of style injecting a strong sense of terror into the whole story. It's not a life changing film but it focuses soberly on the reaction and humanism of a small group of people, on the way they react under such circumstances. The overall effect, probably helped by the moving camera, is terrifying, ""Cloverfield"" is really intense and gripping, scarier than other apocalyptic movies I had seen so far. It was defined a ""Blair Witch's Project"" bigger budget flick but this one is influenced a lot by 9/11 and You Tube. Actors are quite unknown but they did a good job."

A friend of my partner said she came away feeling quite ""unnervered"" by the film... how?? she must have just thought she was watching Cloverfield but was actually watching something else.

Then suddenly you get pulled into the story, And from then on its suspense till the ending. As the characters struggle to survive in the city of New York. You feel as if you are right there.<br/><br/>The way the movie is filmed probably helps create that feeling, and people that get sick of that type of filming will probably not like the movie.

","A 'Godzilla' movie for the YouTube generation. A giant building-sized monster came out of nowhere and just wrecks havoc in New York City. The thing that makes this movie different is that the entire film is captured with a hand-held camcorder by a bystander. Couple that with the excellent special effects and the movie has that gritty and yet out of this world realism.<br/><br/>Conventional narrative, this movie is not. I heard a lot of disappointed groans from the audience at the end of the movie. Just treat the movie as a documentary and that this film was just extracted from the rubble during the aftermath of the monster's attack. This gimmick has been done before in The Blair Witch Project. These two movies really share a lot of similarities by the way.<br/><br/>The movie production tried very hard to give it that amateurish film-making look at the expense of the viewer's comfort. The cam is so shaky I heard stories people throwing up while watching the film, so beware. It didn't bother me but my only beef is that the lighting is so dark. A lot of times I can't figure out what the hell is going on or even the entire look of the monster. I guess it's the intent to show as little as possible to make it more ambiguous, and hence scary.<br/><br/>A very good monster movie but the acting and story are so-so.

","What a wonderful idea it was to combine the cult classic Blair Witch Project with a big budget monster movie such as Godzilla or King Kong and the result is well and truly a waste of time. I wish I could turn back time and see Sweeney Todd instead. The concept was nice but the shaky hand-held camera work which created so much tension and realism in Blair Witch just became annoying and culminated in me feeling more like I was in a computer game than a cinema when the unreal graphics of the monster were fully exhumed. Please do not be sucked into the hype associated with this movie, it is directed by the guy who made Lost which has become more of a joke than an intense thriller it began as, on the whole this film is also a joke and will leave you unfulfilled as you don't know if certain characters are still alive and where the monster even came from, people will argue that this paves the way for a sequel but I am certainly not interested. Such a disappointment but I think it was just too difficult of a concept to make into a decent film, you may as well watch an episode of power rangers, at least that's a little more realistic."

"daniel-lakhdhir","9","1","4","1 February 2008"," Believe the hype
","There was so much hype for this film that a ""Snakes on a Plane"" style disappointment seemed on the horizon. The unknown actors, the shaky camera, it all seemed too much, too ambitious for a TV producer, director and writer. I'm happy to say, you can believe the hype. Cloverfield is at times shocking, consistently tense and absorbing and occasionally terrifying. The shake of the camera, instead of ruining the film, adds to the atmosphere, as does the lack of music. At a certain point, the air raid sirens seem to have an orchestral majesty to their sound. The acting isn't stellar, but does it need to be? The cast's expressions of shock, fear and anger are believable, the relationships legitimate and a certain empathy and concern for the characters' well-being is generated within minutes. The pace isn't frenetic, but neither is it slow. Instead, there is a perfect meld of slow parts, which (in the case of a certain subway tunnel) are often more intense than the brief, heart- pounding flickers of action. Complaints that you don't see enough of the monster are absolutely unjustified. The ending will leave you pinned to your seat in shock. This is a film, in short, for both the film connoisseur, who will appreciate the allegory for terrorism paranoia, and for fans of action films like ""Independence Day."" Believe the hype. J.J. has done it again."

","First off, I saw this film, the day of release. I woke up and very excited to hop on the nearest Western bus & go to Kerasotes Theatre right down the road. As I wait in line for my tickets, I'm anticipating to see & hoping it's going to be an out-of-this-world overall great film. I get my popcorn, my sour patch kids & a large Dr. Pepper, & I got into the theatre the atmosphere of the entire theatre room felt fantastic, I could already tell, in the simplicity so far, I was in the best mood & mindset to enjoy this upcoming film. Once the previews began & credits of the film began..I was so excited to see how'd it start. The movie started at a party of their long-known friend, who's on his way to traveling to Japan on a business trip. The party is going great, all around likability to the characters that were intro'd from the get-go. Then as the party intensifies with the drama of the bachelor who's leaving for Japan (his girlfriend/bestfriend enters the room.) There's much tension between the 2 of them, obviously there's a bit of hardship their both dealing with, since he's leaving & she's dealing with a broken heart over his departing. Then, out of nowhere, there's a huge explosion outside the balcony, People panicking in the room, I won't give away too much. I'm gone into detail this far. The Statue of Liberty, her head does BLOW CLEAR OFF! Was an Awesome Shot! (as soon as I saw that, I thought of Ghostbusters 2, when the plasmic slime they used to bring Lady Liberty to life!) :). I would definitely recommend this film. There's definitely hard critics who have perfectionist views & expect highly of the film, to the point the critic/critics bash it to pieces. The movie IS very shaky, it's being filmed by the crew who've been watching & documenting every step of the way of the causes&effects of what's truly going on in the city. I will also inform you all who take the curteous time to read this..the film does require patience to understand where the crew, the people who've documented proof of what happened beginning to end, their story will live on & in hopes of becoming re-knowned world historians/heroes in senses. The visuals of the monster were fantastic, a lil-cliché of the realism mixed with CGI Animarion, but overall pulled off successfully. I hope this was helpful & hope to hear some feedback. Enjoy the review :)!"

","...Cloverfield certainly did not disappoint!!! Six months ago, while settling down into my cinema chair getting ready to watch transformers, i saw a teaser trailer that bemused and intrigued me. It instantly grabbed my attention and my first thought was ""Wow, what is that film?!?!"". Since that day myself and my three house mates have counted down the days and analysed all of the information that Cloverfield's viral marketing campaign had to throw at us, each of us becoming more and more hooked on a film that we still knew so little about.<br/><br/>But now after all the waiting i have just returned home from watching a staff preview of Cloverfield at Cineworld in Milton Keynes (UK) and it is safe to say that the film completely blew me away and far surpassed my expectations! I won't give anything away for the sake of people who have followed the viral marketing and these boards here in the UK but trust me when i say this film is in one word ""amazing"". The pacing is perfect and as soon as the action hits the film never lets up and it never lets you go. Never before in a film have i literally sat on the edge of my seat (trying to get a better look at the monster because i felt so involved with the action!!!) and held my breath during some of the most intense sequences and situations ever committed to film.<br/><br/>Everyone who hasn't seen this film yet needs to go and see it as soon as possible, this film is perfectly crafted for the big screen and waiting for a DVD release will not fully do it justice. Also do not be put of by talk of ""motion sickness"" and ""overly shaky camera"", neither me or my friends felt any of these effects, if anything the camera style just puts you right there amidst the action! <br/><br/>Cloverfield - 10/10 <br/><br/>p.s - The monster is FANTASTIC, it looks like something ripped from the world of silent hill mixed with one of the creatures from resistance fall of man...simply brilliant design!!!"

","I loved this movie. It was one of the most intense films I have ever seen in the theater. I loved the look. It was nice to see movie do something new (even if it has been done before). The fact that this was a monster movie and that the story line was nothing new and it still felt so fresh and unlike anything I have ever seen before made this movie so enjoyable. The only reason it does not get a 10 is because of a major flaw in writing. The fact that the little clips were spliced in only would have happened if Hud fast forward every once in a while, which does not make a lot sense. Maybe he was stopping and watching what he just recorded and on his way back he went to far, but it happened at too perfect of times and too often. Also the fact that he filmed things when no sane human being would have and turned off the camera at weird times made it seem a little inconsistent. I am not sure how they did it (maybe it was with the little clips of the past), but I really got to care about the characters. The most defining moment of the movie was when the mom called. I really felt it and it really made it feel like the hardest thing he had to do that night. The decision to go get Beth was easy, but answering that phone had to be the hardest thing to do. I like how we got little to no closure about what happened at the end of the movie and I almost wish that they decide to leave the movie as it is. I was excited by the hype and I was not let down at all. I might even go see this movie again in the theater. As much as the film was just another monster movie it really turned out to be a piece of art that will be remember for a long time for trying something new and succeeding."
"Panterken","8","1","4","31 January 2008"," Intense.
","'Cloverfield' isn't a movie you can persuade people to love. There are no real arguments as to why it was so good for me. I guess it's just an experience, either you feel the movie or you don't at all.<br/><br/>This comparison has been done a million times but I'm going to bring it up again...it's not (at all) like The Blair Witch Project or Godzilla. A movie is more than just the main plot outline or the camera technique used. For me, Cloverfield is simply a great movie-going experience, it's best seen in the theater and in the company of people who know how to keep their mouths shut during an intense movie.<br/><br/>The use of (relatively) unknown actors was a brilliant move, it contributed a great deal to the reality factor and the high shock/scare factor that accompanies it. The use of a home-cam isn't 100% original of course and neither is the idea for the story outline itself but does it really matter for a movie as hypnotizing as this? Some scenes had me literally on the edge of my seat, biting my nails and pulling my hair. I'm a pretty easy empathizer but still...not a great deal of movies have this extreme effect on me. This is partly the cast's credit, who all did a good to even fantastic job. Of course, a role like this is a dream for an actor, you really can go all-out (explore the extreme emotional side of your persona) in movies filled with extreme crisis-situations like this. Especially the guy who played the lead-character came off very natural to me, both during the relaxed opening scenes and the unnerving ones.<br/><br/>You might not agree with me, but even the haters have to realize what a great breath of fresh air this movie is compared to a lot of Hollywood movies coming out recently. There have been a lot of great ones this year, I'm not complaining, but I can only think of two movies that really where special (NCFOM and this one).<br/><br/>Finally, the question that plays in everyone's head...did it live up to the hype? In my opinion...most definitely. You may not like it but I'd strongly advise everyone to check out the movie, you may end up loving it to death...<br/><br/>7.6/10"

It shows just how corny going away videos are. But when ""earthquakes"" rock New York the fun begins. Cloverfiled doesn't try to be revolutionary with it's Blair Witch style making. It's designed to make you dizzy and then throw monsters at you. It does exactly that.<br/><br/>The film spins from one intense monster scene to another with surprising well fluidity. The action is nonstop and the characters are very well acted. I was at the edge of my seat for about the whole film. I love the subway scene.<br/><br/>It's nice to have a monster movie where you have no clue what is going on. I don't like how in every monster movie you find out what the monster is halfway through and it's always some mutated thing. Cloverfield doesn't tell you what is attacking New York because they don't know either. The characters speculate whether we created it, if it's an alien or some oceanic Godzilla.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is pure fun if you can turn your brain off and enjoy the intense scares."

Great idea done very well.<br/><br/>Many people complain about the shaky camera, but that doesn't bother me. It adds very much to the believability of the plot. When I saw the Blair Witch Project I hated it because the camera was pointed at the ground two thirds of the time. Not the case in Cloverfield. You see a lot of great action. First, in small doses, but they increase as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>If the film had flaws, they were minor. They could have cut a couple minutes of the character introduction stuff at the beginning. Also, I understand that the hand held camera was necessary for the entire film, however, it was not plausible that the guy holding the camera would have continued to hold onto it when his life was in grave danger. But that aside I found it very believable and compelling.<br/><br/>The acting was not great, but believable.<br/><br/>The monster was very cool and the plot about how someone will sacrifice there own life for love also made it interesting.<br/><br/>The best part about the film was that it made you feel like you were actually experiencing it.<br/><br/>I will definitely being buying on DVD as soon as it comes out to watch it over an over and look for stuff I missed."
"gpeltz","8","1","4","28 January 2008"," Amazing
","Well, It's been out now for a week. it's no secret what I thought of the film. I caught the premier of it in a Midnight showing. The theater was packed. <br/><br/>It kept me up and interested. To see a monster attack a city, as a spectator, as it happens in real time, is a stroke of genius. The movie made something seemingly simple, look real. To see a hand held camera spin, to catch a building falling is an awesome feat. When The camera spins pointing down a side street, to pick up an image of army men, using crowd control tactics, with mobs of people, it adds a feeling of reality and urgency to the document.<br/><br/>One of the most surprising moments for me, was the end credits! A list of production people, a mile and a half long, gaffers, electricians, set designers, wardrobe. How can that be? the film was shot with a hand held camera, by an amateur. The illusion is that good. Then there is the technique of storytelling. The camera is there at the dramatic personal moments, When the guy is talking to his girlfriend, the close up is on his face and conversation, but when it is done, the person holding the camera backs off, with a gesture that reminds us that it is a friend holding the camera.<br/><br/>The conventions of film making are cleverly skirted. The Jump cut is achieved by turning the camera off momentarily. Thus running up thirty six flights is shortened in cinematic ways, yet in a natural style. Things like this make the movie an outstanding feature. The shortcomings however were with the Monster itself. I respond half jokingly that it should have been a Mega. (Check out my Mega Boy photoshoped pictures over at ""teen giants.com"")<br/><br/>Seriously, the Monster lacked motivation. Was it evil, was it just big and clumsy? did it enjoy pushing down buildings? We don't get to find out. First of all, we don't get to see too much of it. And when we do see it, one feels an overview shot would be needed. The advantage of the old Monster giants, was that you would once in a while get a Monsters eye view of the tiny mobs by your feet. This movie precluded such a shot, except for the helicopter view towards the end. Yet this kind of shot was needed to give us the full perspective of the Beast. Also mentioned at my other sites, was the need to make the monster something recognizable. I still don't think I could draw this one. Worse yet, the movie lacked ""Big Feet"" honestly, how could they do a Giant monster, where no one gets stomped. Oh well. All this aside, I give the picture an eight out of ten stars."

","OK, so if you ever wanted to get involved in a film now is your chance. You will feel like the people on the screen are your friends, you get pulled in and engrossed like no other film.<br/><br/>It grabs you and doesn't let go, you just wait for more and you get it. Its visually stunning and the sound is something else, unreal, its sounds just as if you were there in the middle of NEW YORK as the action is taking place.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes really gets you involved with the characters. Quite slow to move at first but i think thats the trick to this film, making you feel as though your in this film and know the people in it.<br/><br/>The whole concept of just video recording seemed quite stupid and i thought it wouldn't be much good, how i was wrong.<br/><br/>Intense action, on the edge of your seat from start to end, no exceptions. Just enjoy the sound as i mentioned, it really is stunning.<br/><br/>Go now! 9/10"

","Now this was a very hyped movie. Yes it was. I believe it was when I went to see Transformers, that I seen the teaser trailer. My friend, and I were a little surprised by the short action scene, and then a date appeared... and that was it!!! No title..nothing. Got to admit, this of course had a lot of people trying to figure out about this movie.<br/><br/>I went to the theater, KNOWING that this movie was shot in VERY REALISTIC way, by someone running around with a camera filming the movie like they were actually there!!! So, I was expecting a SHAKY camera. I went to this movie, expecting a movie that had real life scenarios, and situations...not just a mad, crazy, powerful monster on the loose. Grant it, that was the main thing, but like in real life, other things matter. There was some-what of a plot.. not very strong mind you, however there was a plot. That was the courage for one to go out of one's way, in the face of unrelenting danger, to attempt to save another. Sounds sappy, but it does really happen. The acting was strong, the cast was mostly upstarts, but good. The NYC backdrops, and scenes were great. The monster was awesome, and VERY original. The camera work was spot on, makes you feel like you were right there!! I really liked that, the sense that you part of the situation itself.<br/><br/>So, let me say this.. You should not really compare this movie with Blair Witch.. I liked Blair Witch, but originally, the Blair Witch movie folks (storyline) tried to make you believe that was actually a true story...remember??? This movie (Cloverfield), we all SHOULD know is FICTION!!! I give this movie a 9 out of 10, for the originality, and cinematography. Good work, folks. I was impressed!!!"

I thought it was great that we saw some original monster instead of a t-trex or Godzilla and have being a creature that no one ever expected (sorry for those who haven't seen the film its for your benefit that i do reveal the creature) The film was also great due to the unknown cast and i would also like to add made the film very scary and very realistic. The camcorder idea was original which was great to see. I did find the ending irritating as it was like the end of a sentence with no full stop. I will say this to anyone who is thinking of seeing this film that if you like original material you will definitely love this film."
"dj_wang","8","1","4","26 January 2008"," A Monster Movie About Human Bonds Very Well Done
","What makes life meaningful? As human beings, what kinds of experiences contribute to an existence with purpose and significance? These are the kinds of questions that watching ""Cloverfield"" made me ponder.<br/><br/>It's a movie about a monster, but the monster is just the ""catalyst"", the ""pressure"", the ""mover"" that really tells a story about the bonds between people and those bonds being tested under great duress.<br/><br/>One of my fellow moviegoers told me he read some people left the theater crying after seeing the movie. I can believe it. People who knew what it was like to have truly strong bonds formed with other people. People who knew what real friendship was. People who knew what love was. People who long deeply for these things in their own lives (I would be one of them, though I did not cry, though I would have been OK with doing so. I have before. Crying feels...good.) <br/><br/>The movie made me think about the separation and distance we all feel between us and how powerful experiences like the one in ""Cloverfield"" force us together. I think we are seriously lacking these kinds of experiences in our society, the kind that prompt us to drop our barriers and connect with one another because a potent situation demands it. Now, the city we live in being attacked by a giant monster is highly unlikely (still could happen though...who knows what lies buried in the Earth's depths...), but there are plenty of powerful experiences we could make a regular part of the time we spend alive as humans. Any experience which demands that people rely on one another would do.<br/><br/>The movie makes me realize, keenly, I need these kinds of experiences in my life. So, was it a good movie? It made me think these kinds of deep thoughts, so I'd say : yeagh.<br/><br/>Oh, and ""Marlena"" was a great character. She represents a new kind of personality type emerging in our society. Outwardly attractive in an unconventional way with a disconcerting reservation on the surface covering a noble soul within. Her heroism struck a resonant chord in my heart. ""Hudd"", in his duh-ish simplicity, was attracted to a special girl. I liked that."
"cornelius543","9","1","4","26 January 2008"," What a great movie
","There are some people out there who just don't seem to understand this movie. I have read reviews on here that have almost brought me to laughs.<br/><br/>I thought that the movie was previewed and then presented exactly they way it should have been. I feel bad for all those who did not have the intellectual fortitude to enjoy this movie for what it was. This is not Godzilla. Godzilla showed everything you ever wanted to see in the monster, and it did everything but stand in front of the camera and smile. Not to mention that at the end of the movie they kill him and you almost feel sorry for the poor monster that just destroyed a city. And the fact the there was never a single instant in that movie that he felt threatening. <br/><br/>Cloverfield on the other hand put in at ground zero of a unknown monster mercilessly destroying new york. Butthis is only a backdrop to a story of a man trying to reach the woman he loves. The special effects were amazing to the point that they almost never caught your eye. They seemed as real as everything else. The sound was just as spectacular. The monster was something we have never seen before. I also enjoyed the fact that all the action was going on around them, helicopters and fighter jets were flying over and the army was trying to evacuate people made it all feel very real. And the ending was amazing well done. But for those of you who did not like the ending I only ask, how the hell did you expect it to end? <br/><br/>So I am sorry for those of you who have to have your movies spoon fed, I am sorry your time was wasted and steered for so long away from your mindless entertainment. And for those of you who enjoyed the ride, I'll see you inside for another screening."
"heebyjeebys","10","1","4","26 January 2008"," Cloverfield...need I say more?
","Unlike most, I had done absolutely no research whatsoever when the virals started coming out, and I didn't plan to look into it. I went to it opening day, and I must admit that...Cloverfield has changed the face of monster-movies. Everyone knows the plot, so I'm not going to explain things that have already been said. I will say, though, that it by far exceeds expectations. Yes, the camera is shaky, especially during the Underground Subway scene, but the shakiness only adds to the effect. To those who feel the camera was a crapout, they don't understand the aesthetics of the movie. Put in a nutshell: we see only what the camera sees. The back story on the monster is purposely left out to create the hopeless illusion. Without knowing the monster's weakness and where it came from (possibly Japan), all reassurance is lost. The movie is a roller-coaster all the way through, until the very end, when we finally get up close and VERY personal to the creature...and watch poor Hud die."
"saint_leon_hfh","9","1","4","26 January 2008"," Perfect...
","This review contains SPOILERS I watched it today. It was released in Portugal under the name of ""Codename: Cloverfield"". Good thing the cinema I went to has special rooms for these films (it's called Cinema City, and it has lots of rooms specialized on certain movie types: there's a room with chairs that have liftable arms for the romantic movies, a room with about 6 speakers on each chair for horror movies, a room with hydraulic chairs for motion simulators (""Cloverfield"" was also available on that room, but I had to pay another 3 euros for it, and my back is not very well cuz I had a though PE class yesterday) and a room with a 4-story-sized screen, just for examples. I watched it on one of the ""Horror movies rooms"", and let me tell you it was an experience of a lifetime. I might miss some classes the next week to watch it again.<br/><br/>I liked the beginning. That whole intro with the party preparations, I mean. It was good for us to meet the characters and a basic storyline for each of them: Hud's crush on Marlena, Jason and Lily's relationship, Rob and Beth's friendship/love. It was very enjoyable to see all the characters reunited on that party, dancing and having fun, probably for the last time on their life.<br/><br/>Then, the monster attacks. And it seems that everything happens to the characters, each and every type of death seems to occur: Jason gets smashed by it's tail, Marlena's stomach blows up thanks to the parasites, Hud takes a visit to the monster's mouth... and the movie itself wraps all these events and many more (I loved the scene where they go to Beth's apartment to rescue her, and the building is resting on it's side on another) in a way that when the characters are resting or just staying put, we don't feel like they're resting at all, because we know the monster is out there, we hear its growls, its steps, debris everywhere.<br/><br/>Another thing that surprised me was the monster itself and its parasites. Many people didn't like it. I, on the contrary, felt extremely satisfied with it. I loved its concept, its body... it was a good surprise to me, and I felt like it could be a real menace in every environment. It's not a giant lizard, it's not a giant shark, it is a giant ""something that we've never seen before and we're not sure about how dangerous it is, but we know it's immune to our weaponry, it is incredibly strong and it leaves behind a huge amount of parasites that will make you blow up from the inside if you're bitten"". And, in my humble opinion, that is pretty much more terrifying than a Japanese giant lizard who just walks on Manhattan destroying buildings for the sake of finding somewhere to nest and breed.<br/><br/>Also, another thing to mention are the sound effects: this movie, like ""War of the Worlds"", will lose a lot when it is released on DVD/Blu-Ray, unless you have a home cinema system and the volume on the max. Each growl of the monster, each step it took, each time Hud fell or each time the camera was stroke by debris, the sound effects made my chair tremble. Although I am not sure if it was the chair trembling or if it was just me shaking with the events I was watching.<br/><br/>As for the ending, which was a deception to many people, I felt like it was as good as any ending. It also ended up with a small romantic touch, that wrapped up the film in a nice way. When the final credits started rolling, I said to myself: ""Classic... perfect in many ways"". And after all, it was perfect."
"CEO_Legacy_Inc","9","1","4","26 January 2008"," Monster Masterpiece
","'Cloverfield' is probably the best monster flick I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Other than the fact that it is simply incredible fun, it's actually quite realistic when it comes to people's reactions and interactions. So many people complain about the 'shaky camera', but I believe that this is what makes this movie so amazing. It's hardly fair to compare this movie to 'The Blair Witch Project,' because that movie had no effects. 'Cloverfield' has plenty of good (and realistic) effects throughout the film.<br/><br/>In my opinion, one of Cloverfield's best achievements is that it actually scared the crap out of me. (Kind of...) I mean, it wasn't the director saying, ""Okay, now make something pop out here!"" No, sir... It was suspenseful, and when any moment came that you were afraid of, you enjoyed every second of being scared out of your mind.<br/><br/>Bad acting? Hardly! I mean, you can't really use people like Johnny Depp and Phillip Seymour Hoffman for titles such as this. It becomes just another Hollywood movie. No, Cloverfield's cast is wonderful, and the movie is very well-acted. Most people just can't see it because they're too busy whining about the 'shaky camera.' Trust me when I say that CLOVERFIELD is certainly worth a trip to the movies!!"
"unkyrich-1","9","1","4","26 January 2008"," Got what I paid for and expected
","Right off the bat - I liked this movie. A lot. There are very few movies that pull me in as well as this one, where my brain doesn't analyze everything and I just accept what's on the screen and go with it.<br/><br/>The thing people seemed to forget is that the monster is a macguffin. It serves no real purpose except to make the plot happen. The plot focuses more on what people will do for love.<br/><br/>Would you risk your life for the friend you loved? Would you risk your life for the person you think you romantically loved? In uncertainty, do you go with the unknown or with what is at least a little familiar? I'll admit I didn't like most of the characters. I didn't like 20-somethings like that when I WAS in that age group. But watching what they would do for each other when things were at their worst was much more important than liking them.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with JJ Abrams, Lost, or anything else he's really worked on, as far as I know, but if it's like this, I'm sure I'm missing out.<br/><br/>The film stuck with me, and entertained me. And it didn't make me feel nauseated. It had good tension, which yes, was telegraphed in some situations in order to make the audience tense.<br/><br/>It had some surprises.<br/><br/>If you are going, expecting a re-enactment of the standard ""Giant Monster smashes a city"" plot, you're going to be disappointed. That's not the plot at all (and I never thought it would be). If you're looking for a good movie that tests the characters and what they would be willing to do for each other, this movie is the one."

","This film is, in my opinion, one of the better horror films of the decade. Now, that may be giving it a lot of credit, but in a world of cheap Hollywood remakes and lackluster new attempts at a scary movie, this piece of work stand out like a monster in Manhattan. Literally.<br/><br/>The secretive way in which whatever attacking the city is kept makes for very intense film seeing. I myself got motion sickness twice during the film. This is the only bad thing I could find about it: So intense it tricks your eyes into believing it. Yet in a horror film, this is exactly what you want.<br/><br/>Without giving you any spoilers, I will just tell you this: There isn't anything cheap in this film. No 'Oh...I knew that would happen. ' or 'This has been done before.' When you are sitting there in the theater and this movie starts, all memory of others similar fades far and away. <br/><br/>You are in Manhattan. There is something there. The city is being destroyed.<br/><br/>This film is a piece of art, with seemingly no beginning or end. Just a moment in time that you get to experience first hand.<br/><br/>Completely worth your time and money. I promise."

It is original because of the whole idea of the movie. Yes it's another monster movie, but how it was filmed is something new. It was scary because come on a huge monster attacking Manhattan. There were some parts I jumped out of my seat.<br/><br/>I love how the movie completely takes you in a new world. I felt as if I was in the movie with all the characters. There were a couple of times my friend and I would look at each other and say we felt like we were about to run out of the theater lol. I just couldn't take my eyes off of the screen for a second.<br/><br/>Now the movie is really about the characters which was interesting. Rob and Beth were exes that still loved each other. Jason is Rob's brother who is dating Lily. Then there is the one and only HUD who is great comic relief throughout the movie. There were times I would be freaking out and Hud would just say something and I couldn't stop laughing. He was the best character in my opinion. Lastly, Marlena who is just sarcastically funny. She reminds me of my best friend so I really enjoyed her character.<br/><br/>Enough of me rambling but I will say again this movie was amazing and everyone should just go into the theater with an open mind and really concentrate on the characters more so than the monster."

","Reality shows Fans will have a blast with this movie, also F/X fans Won't be disappointed at all, but movie busters have to child out on this one regarding the unfounded critic about the supposed everlasting camera battery, if you were paying attention you will only see 90 minutes of flat video clips taken ""as is"" and that is why this movie is short. Basically you get video clips of the most visceral wrenching events ever lived by the characters and that's it, them probably the character holding the camera shuts it down just to later on record another significant event, and some of those events will stick in your mind for some time due to the fact everything was documented in the most realistically way possible, which will make you wonder from time to time if what you see is for real or not.

"a_echoes2112","8","1","4","25 January 2008"," Great, realistic portrayal of a typically cheesy premise
","First of, I want to address an important issue:<br/><br/>Those of you who went into this movie KNOWING that is was first-person hand-held camera and then COMPLAIN are fools. THAT IS THE POINT! The idea is based on the YouTube era where everyone has a camera and all events are now documented by normal people Yes the camera is an incredibly shaky, and no you never get a good image of the monster (which remains off screen for most of the film).<br/><br/>But this is where the film succeeds. The monster is not the center of the picture, you don't have clichÃ©d scientists and generals trying to fight this thing,you have five normal civilians constantly threatened by a great terror that is often out of sight but overwhelms you when you are in it's path. The monster is off screen but it's presence is constantly felt (the distant explosions, the loud crashes from above the subway).<br/><br/>Are the characters flat? Yes. Do they make dumb choices? Yes. But this makes it realistic. Sitting at your desk and ranting about how running into the subway was stupid, consider the actual situation. In that moment, with the monster right above them and tanks and soldiers coming down the street, what choice would YOU have made? Yes the acting wasn't great BUT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE. If this was you would you be given an Oscar for you performance? NO.<br/><br/>Where does the monster go? Does it matter? Only if you like a story tied up in a nice little bundle. The best stories are the ones that leave you guessing.<br/><br/>If you are looking for The Godfather or Citizen Kane, you won't find it here Finally, the movie is an allegory for terrorism.

The action sequences in the film are very well done, considering how low the film's budget is. If you liked ""War of the Worlds"", this movie plays with your mind just as well.

","So like most movie buffs, I lined up for the 9 o clock showing on Friday night for cloverfield. The previous viewers, the 7 o clock showing was leaving and of course some game away the movie, but luckily enough I had already read all about it on IMDb before hand. The movie at first starts out with a warning that this is evidence found from central park, which pretty much insists that the characters that were in central park were dead. The relationship is built between the main character Rob and Beth seamed helpless... however, that is what the movie is pretty much based upon.<br/><br/>I think the most intense scene in the movie is when they are sitting in the subway station waiting. It almost seamed crazy they were going down there, but where else would you hide? I was waiting for a loud boom, or some creature to appear suddenly while at the station, however, nothing happened. Which left you with more fear of what is happening above ground. <br/><br/>Marlena exploding was amazing. Some people in the theater thought that she was shot, however, you can clearly see the two army men holding her and her body going crazy and her head exploding. <br/><br/>The run to get beth was full of intense action and loud noises. The camera was NOT steady at all during the running scenes, however, it was easy to catch everything going on.<br/><br/>The monster seamed to be a cross between a crab and a spider.. with little babies? or workers. Some believe that the monster WAS a baby, and the mother will be the main MONSTER in cloverfield2.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED!<br/><br/>SPOILERS.<br/><br/>*while on the bridge there is a quick shot of robs brother on the pole, then for a brief second the camera focuses on someone else recording.<br/><br/>*at the end in the central park scene, at the very last second it cuts back to the ferris wheel, then back to them. if you look closely you can see that the monster drops the minis into the ocean/lake right before heading towards central park.<br/><br/>*end credits. at the very end of the credits there is a code that is written backwards. of course, i didn't have time to figure out what it said. but stay until the VERY END."

I thought this movie was a very refreshing change from what you typically see in theaters, in fact there's nothing like it out there at all. I don't think I've ever seen a movie before that was as intense as this one. Cloverfeild accomplished what it set out to do, in its opening weekend it grossed 41 Million dollars, a January record. I don't know that everyone will like this movie, because it is for a somewhat selective taste.

","I think people are getting waaay too worked up over this (put down the Taurine and step away from the computer) - let's strip everything else away and focus on what CLOVERFIELD truly is - it's a giant monster attacks a city movie - that's it - from Godzilla to Reptillicus to Beast from 20,000 Fathoms - it has been done forever and the fact that these filmmakers tried to create a new way to do it while still remaining faithful to the genre itself - well - they should be commended. Many things in the movie work - first off, I really appreciated the FACT that they did NOT explain the monster - who cares - you want a military scientist rushed in and blab on about toxins in the water or pollution or microwaves or Lindsay Lohan being responsible for it - all the old movies have that and you don't need it - whatever caused it - it's there and it's ticked off and ready to destroy. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)I loved how we saw glimpses of it - in my humble opinion - you did not need the big shots of it over Hud at the end - it was on camera too long and that's when the whole CGI of it looked lame to me. I tried to go with the whole premise of Hud filming as much as he did (otherwise you don't have a movie) but that was too much to swallow at times - like, hey dude - there are tiny scorpion/spider thingys trying to kill us - could you put down the *^&%$% camera and help me shut the door on them, please thank you very much? The way they taped over the previous Coney Island day was clever and I thought that was effective. There are some great scenes - the bridge being attacked - the initial ""earthquake"" - the news cameras showing glimpses of the creature moving through the avenues - the subway tunnels scene and the helicopter crash - in fact, if the movie had ended when the copter crashed - that would have been fine with me - I did like how it seemed all the main characters died. Good ending. As for this talk that something is possibly seen falling in the ocean at the end of the Coney Island tape - I thought I saw something too and I liked that touch very much. See, that is one thing I did enjoy - they didn't overexplain, they let you figure stuff or analyze stuff yourself. Use the old brainbox, what. Don't need to be spoonfed everything."

","Cloverfield won't change your life. It might make you puke in a movie theater, which I guess could be life-changingly embarrassing, but aside from that you'll leave this film the same person as when you entered.<br/><br/>That said, it does what it sets out to do admirably.<br/><br/>The first few minutes of action are extremely intense, very heavily evoking 9/11 memories for better or for worse. The film keeps a fast pace from that point on, but never again recreates those initial moments of fear.<br/><br/>The characters are likable, realistic young New Yorkers who are established ~quickly~ and effectively. Their behavior throughout the film fall somewhere short of realistic and there is heroism to a degree that seems sometimes unbelievable, and yet... people do heroic things in times of crisis. I'm inclined to believe that some people (not most people, but some) would indeed do what our main characters do.<br/><br/>The ""camera work"" is a mixed bag. It's sometimes very effective and fun (the beginning and the military scenes are stand outs). It's also frustrating at times, and occasionally feels like it's try to save budget by not showing us what we obviously want to see. Overall I think it works in Cloverfield -- it gives the film a unique sense of immersion -- but I would not want to see this approach overused. It will become one-note very quickly.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away: the ending is a shock. It will leave some viewers frustrated and others impressed. I was impressed. I thought it was ballsy and unique, and I appreciate its purity. I do not blame people for being annoyed by it, however.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed Cloverfield. It's a rush. It's funny and honest and likable. It's different. Give it a look, but temper your expectations: it's just an action flick, folks."

","I personally did not think I would relate with the characters or feel immersed in their situation or stories, but I did. The dialog was incredibly off the cuff and realistic, the relationships very easy to relate to right down to the love interest with Beth. Perhaps at that age many of us were in love with a girl like Beth who got away. But I digress.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was incredible, and hopefully it will have a sequel but of course the sequel would not use the same hand cam reality format, but rather a straight sequel to continue the story. It would not make sense to make another film using the same techniques, but a sequel would definitely help to bring out more of the story and answer questions people will have about what they witnessed in Cloverfield.<br/><br/>The way i saw it, it was perfectly designed, but there will have to be a sequel, in which case the film will be very different, obviously no hand cam, but it was set up to be a very personal video the kind that so many kids are into right now, its what drives myspace, and youtube, etc... its really what this generation is all about, talking about our lives with video, and thats why Abrams did it. To reach out to that audience who could relate. <br/><br/>Hud was the voice that carried us through the movie, but like Dante's Virgil he can only take us to the gates of Hell, and now that our characters are there, so our guide has left us alone, but the monster is still with us.<br/><br/>Perhaps Cloverfield is Hollywood's response to Japan's Godzilla, and if so... we can expect to see more films to follow up and expand on the story. After all it worked for Godzilla, but Godzilla was a very charismatic monster, and only time will tell if our new monster has the staying power of a Godzilla.<br/><br/>The problem some are having with the camera surviving the way it did, through all that destruction, is a cautionary tale. That we have made some amazing advances in technology. We can make hand cams that can survive the apocalypse in a word, but we cannot save ourselves. Perhaps it shows a deeper understanding that we are off our path, that we have lost sight of what really matters, and what it really means to be human. <br/><br/>I look forward to seeing a sequel and hope one will be forthcoming, the monster looked pretty sweet especially near the end.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams is the master of symbolism, as lovers of the series ""LOST"" will agree, and I knew this movie would not be any different. So I took special care to notice every detail and consider the importance. For those who couldn't care less, you can stop reading now <br/><br/>I honestly find no fault with this film. Though it really has to have a sequel, it just HAS to.<br/><br/>So, what were some of the symbols that stood out to me? Cloverfield is perhaps our symbol of terrorism in a post 9/11 world just as ""In part, Godzilla is a symbol of the atomic bomb and the tragedy that befell Japan in the final days of the war. But in part Godzilla is a symbol of Japan's future, and its reconstruction into a newly technologized power following the war,"" said Allison, chairman of Duke's cultural anthropology department.<br/><br/>The first big one was Sephora, the name on the first building they stop at after the bridge collapse.<br/><br/>Sephora written on a wall with black lines.<br/><br/>Sephora in Hebrew means bird, and Sephira is singular for the spheres of the tree of life in the kabbalah, and the black line in the tree of life represents the tail end of the abyss, or the dark night of the soul.<br/><br/>So you have the bridge, and abyss between the two realms of existence. The bridge has been destroyed, there is no escape, no exit as shown by the sign in the subway we focus on quite clearly. The time is 3:16AM, biblical reference John 3:16.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams loves detail and references like this, anyone who watches LOST will attest to that.<br/><br/>The first three Sephiroth, called the Supernal Sephiroth, are considered to be the primordial energies of the universe. The next stages of evolution on the Tree of Life are considered to exist beyond a space on the tree, between the Supernals and the other Sephiroth, called the Abyss, because their levels of being are so distinct from each other that they appear to exist in two totally different realities. The Supernal Sephiroth exist on a plane of divine energy. This is why another correspondence for Binah is the idea of suffering, because the Supernal Maternal energy gives birth to a world that is inherently excluded from that Divine Union.<br/><br/>The Tree of Life does not only speak of the origins of the physical universe out of the unimaginable, but also of man's place in the universe.<br/><br/>Not a well thought out idea here but it's all that comes to mind and though I'm probably just over thinking it, J.J. Abrams has a tendency to delve very deeply into the construct of his films.<br/><br/>When Ben places a call in the subway to mother in the subway, it's 3:16 in the morning... possible biblical reference? Also in the subway, closeups of the sign that reads ""NO EXIT"".. perhaps foreshadowing, or simply a simple truth that we are all mortal.<br/><br/>The empty carriage being pulled by the white horses... perhaps the pale horse of Death in Revelations.<br/><br/>Saturday May 23, 6:42 AM 3 days before Memorial Day Apr 27 6:17PM"

","This could be one of the best movies of the year. The story revolves around Rob and 5 friends. Rob's going away party is crashed by a large unknown creature that uses NYC as his playground. But before I begin some things need to be said. The major complaints with this movie are things like, ""It's filmed with a camcorder"" or ""I hated the ending"" and finally, ""This movie left too many questions"". As far as the camcorder complaint, this is a great new form of story telling. Yes it's been done in the blair witch project but, not like this. Things don't stop moving once they start. You feel like you are part of the crisis, trying to escape death brought by this huge creature that preys on anything that moves. I have heard of people complaining that the camera gave them motion sickness but, it's hard to hold still when you are about to be killed by that thing. As for the ending, what did everyone expect? Things don't always have a happy ending. And yes it left questions but more on that later.<br/><br/>Once things start moving you follow Rob and his group through NYC as they make their way towards Beth's apartment (the girl that Rob is in love with). They encounter the monster and its creatures along the way. Each time the monster would appear, it would show just enough to keep your attention, making you want to stick around to see what it really looks like. By the end of the movie, you do see the creature in full form. Which is a good thing, but the movie leaves many questions, which is not surprising since you are seeing the events unfold through the eyes of civilians, not the eyes of a scientist telling you where this thing came from or what is going on. By the end of the movie, you will have likely formed an opinion of where and what the creature is, but you won't know for sure. Which is a good thing, because it leaves you wanting more. The creatures could and should continue with the franchise, hopefully revealing where and what it is. And the fates of the remaining characters.<br/><br/>But, if you are gonna see the movie, I highly recommend looking at some of the viral marketing websites on the net (there are like 4 or 5). They provide backstory to what lead up to events in the film. Along with this, there are numerous hidden items in the film, Slusho commercials and T-shirts ( like the one Jason is wearing at the party). But if you go in not knowing anything about the backstory, you might still enjoy, but the backstory certainly makes it more enjoyable. Either way, I will be going back again and again to watch this movie. Waiting for Cloverfield 2 and the DVD which will be released later this year.<br/><br/>-Hardrocker943"
"Robert_duder","8","1","4","23 January 2008"," The first big monster hit of the New Year fares well
","Shrouded in mystery Cloverfield will likely be remembered for a brilliant marketing campaign that left everyone who saw Transformers in the summer wondering what the heck is that monster clobbering New York City. My first instinct was whatever was big and strong enough to decapitate the State of Liberty and make that much disaster was going to get over hyped and be disappointing to finally see on the big screen but I was dead wrong in that aspect. I wasn't even remotely disappointed by the monster. JJ Abrams is a brilliant director, and writer and has created some really terrific things including the mystery shrouded ""Lost"" TV Series and you can definitely see some of that carry over into Cloverfield. The one thing that everyone should know and will know coming out of this is that all the questions you have going into the film, you'll have the same ones coming out and probably a lot more. But this is the idea because you're not watching this film...you're experiencing it. You're right there with all the other survivors trying to stay alive and there are numerous ways that they went about doing this. The first if the much debated about 'hand cam.' I do agree it was overplayed, a little annoying, but didn't make me motion sick. They left it still enough to really get the feeling of the whole situation but I just really wanted to see everything slower and more stable. I understand perfectly why they did it that way...I just wasn't a huge fan. Second of all I've never sat in a movie where the sound was so carefully plotted. When that beast roars for the first time it literally vibrated my seat and you felt like you were right there.<br/><br/>The literal cast of nobodies are brilliant. Michael Stahl-David is the lead Rob Hawkins who is looking at moving up in the corporate world and is attending a surprise going away party for him when disaster strikes. Stahl-David is a hero because he's just a regular guy caught in disastrous situations. He looks smooth, cool, well liked and yet normal. He goes through the emotions perfectly and draws you in and has great charisma on screen. T.J. Miller is a very important character but probably has less than 5 minutes of screen time and is yet probably 'on screen' more than anyone else. He's the man behind the hand cam and his acting relies on his voice and his emotion and his actions and he does well. He's inappropriately funny at times but I think that IS his character's way. He is basically narrating the situation while experiencing it and it works. Jessica Lucas is Rob's brother's girlfriend and does a good job in her role. She is sort of the scream queen of the situation and in that aspect she does very well. Lizzy Caplan is terrific as the straight faced, goth like girl who is the only one victim to being actually bitten by part of this beast. She has one of the most talked about and mysterious scenes and she is terrific in a very subtle quiet way.<br/><br/>There is obviously a certain suspension of belief required to see Cloverfield and kudos to Abrams for attempting to deal with it. The idea that someone in this situation would continually ensure they were holding on to a video camera no matter what is kind of ludicrous and although he insists in the film that people will want to see this...there is a point when any normal person would have dropped the camera and ran like hell. Still I completely understand why they opted to do the hand camera...it feels real and it works. I also understand why they left the shroud of mystery BUT it doesn't make either one of those things any more tolerable. I enjoyed experiencing this monster attack but I wanted from an entertainment value to KNOW the background, the secrets, the origin....nobody likes leaving with that many questions and maybe they'll serialize Cloverfield but it'll never have the same impact that this original film has. Despite some unfortunate fatal flaws Cloverfield is a monster of a movie and a great time at the movies. The first blockbuster of the year. And it makes people argue, debate, and wonder and that is always healthy for intellect. 8/10<br/><br/>*************** NOTE <br/><br/>Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home. I just want to wish his family, his daughter, and Michelle Williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and I always believed he was destined to be a big star. I will most certainly miss his work."

","So here's the gist of it. Yes, Blair Witch came out before this (and it sucked) Yes Godzilla (the one that took place in New York) came out before this and that blew. But seriously, the only thing that this movie has in common with both of those is that A)its a monster in New York B)it uses a hand held camera to ""document"" the events. Other than that its an AWESOME movie. Kept me on my seat. Now, the key to fully enjoying the movie is going with A) other movie buffs and/or B) going with girls. The first is self explanatory B) is useful because girls seem to catch the little things that a lot of guys miss. Like why would a guy go back to save a ""one night stand"" girl. I didn't catch it in the dialog but the girls did. They've been friends for a while, they just finally did it hence the whole deal with ""They had sex... don't tell anyone I told you"" Also I heard that the first 10secs help explain a lot... maybe I'm gonna go have to watch it again... but for sure the last few seconds of the movie, if you watch it when the camera turns to the oceans, you actually see something plummet into the sea in the upper right corner. Explaining its origin. I was the only one who caught that amongst my friends.... So anywho, the point, go watch it. Its the best monster I've seen... I wanna say ever. It really gets you immersed. I was cursing up a storm every time there was an explosion or the monster popped out. hah. Enjoi"
"mjjusa-1","8","1","4","22 January 2008"," Life Interrupted
","This may be the first post postmodern film. A MTV inspired style of self-conscious life narrated in real time with a herky-jerky style that becomes a topsy turvy big screen reality. A real time reality not found in traditional movies. Sure, the Blair Witch Project pioneered the style, but Cloverfield, a big movie, a big budget movie, a big story movie, that takes The Real World and makes it an epic movie. Sort of a combination of The Real World's young adult swirling lives, The Amazing Race's group dynamics, and non-professional documentaries found on Youtube. But, in Cloverfield, the ultimate prize isn't money or fame, but survival.<br/><br/>With a story that is universal: love and loss. A behind the camera Falstaffian figure telling the story, and the story told entirely in the moment. Despite the shakiness of the camera and the rules of the reality game, a movie with a delicate suppleness showing time suspended through the replay of the discovered disk containing a preexisting real-time love story caught in calmer more innocent times. The camera captures the sensibility of a younger generation in its use of language, raw feelings of young love, and a realism that engages viewers of any age. The shaky camera does become a bit much at times, but a glance or two away from the screen at a static theater chair, or the empty box of popcorn on the theater floor restores the movie viewer's center and eases the stomach.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough: a going away party of twenty-something's at a Manhattan apartment have their lives interrupted by an unimagined evil and violence. Told with in a self-indulgent egocentric style of narrative familiar to us all from television. A style that has leapt from the small screen to the big and creates a new effective form of movie making. Off putting at first, the various narratives spoken to the camera keep us up front and close to the action and up to date with their stories, viscerally involved, with the fantastical growing disaster that has torn their comfortable lives and New York to pieces.<br/><br/>Interesting movie making, done with incredible art direction, control of crowd scenes, special effects, believable nightmarish monsters, and style. Done in a way that brought all of 9/11 back to me. What it might have been like if a camera had been found in the rubble of the Twin Towers detailing the lives of real people the same age as the characters in Cloverfield with the same hopes and dreams and desire to live long lives as they confront a fate they could not have imagined as they woke up and got ready for the day on that beautiful morning.<br/><br/>I am still a bit sea sick and oppressed by what I saw on the screen. I am also incredibly impressed by this post postmodern movie. I remember the story about the long time New York Times movie reviewer panning Bonnie and Clyde. He did not appreciate the new style and stylized violence of the movie. He just didn't get it, and by not getting admitted to the NYT's readers that the times had passed him. He retired shortly after the movie became a hit, his artistic point of view too rigid to admit the brilliance of Arthur Penn's vision.<br/><br/>In 2008, after a decade of radically changing media and media content delivery systems, it's idiotic to hold to a rigid view of what constitutes movie art. Digital, high speed downloads, cell phone movies, blogs, iPods, iPhones, electronic books bang bang boom and poof... something new was probably invented whilst I write this. I watch a downloaded mini movie by Martin Scorsese late one night, a take off on Hitchcock for a Spanish champagne, and it is so good I smile in bed like an idiot. I email it to a friend in London and ten minutes later he emails me a video taken with his phone that day of a walk in a park with leaves so golden and red that the video seems hand painted.<br/><br/>Cloverfield, a movie as metaphor on many levels: a going away party for a young executive leaving for Japan, the land of Godzilla and Mothra, dependent as metaphor on what your definition of 'going away' is. Cloverfield, first person self conscious narratives with more Oh My Gods than a Catholic mass, a life boat in a stormy sea mounted camera, focus and film quality that would not have been allowed in the Golden Age of Hollywood, and the lives and fates of a group of generation Xers (or is it Yers?) whose lives are suddenly in the grip of a mindless evil, made for this movie lover a new kind of movie, a movie that I would recommend highly."
"white_flour","9","1","4","23 January 2008"," A whole new kind of movie, Excellent.
","An excellent movie which is on my top list of favorites. the composition of this movie draws you right into the action. It's unfair to underrated this movie for it's lack in explaining what goes on. Doing so would have caused it to be another ""Godzilla"" and would have made it to ""been there seen that"". Leaving and open unexplained ending draws you into the movie. The civilians had no idea what was going on, it was a shock, and that's exactly how you will feel.<br/><br/>Hand-held camera action further pulls you into the action, although would have caused motion sickness for some viewer hence -1 point.<br/><br/>This film had an ending of like no other. Typicaly people leave the film during credits. The viewers (including myself) were stuck to the seats in amazement. The audiences response to the end of the film it self is worth experiencing.<br/><br/>Not a film for those who need explanation.<br/><br/>9/10"
"brandenr","8","1","4","22 January 2008"," I think people missed the point
","No it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but I found it to be very entertaining. I think that sometimes movies provide to much information and that knowing everything takes some of the fun out of a movie. All movies some form of questions unanswered. This was at least a solid movie that doesn't follow the same boring format of big films in the last few year.<br/><br/>It is a little hard to watch with so much bouncing around and it made my wife sick and she had to walk out 1/2 way through.

"brighton2007","8","1","4","22 January 2008"," Clovefield, giant monster, with a civilians POV
","I was very skeptical before going to see Cloverifield. I felt that this movie would turn out to be another snakes on a plane. However, I was very surprised.<br/><br/>When the movie starts and goes to the party you begin to learn of the intertwining relationships between the characters. This small introduction leaves a lot of details out of the picture but also allows people in the audience relate to at least one character later on. Although the lack of character development is highly criticized in other reviews, it is forgotten that this lack of character substance allows for an easier way for a viewer to think, ""Hey thats what i would do in that situation.""<br/><br/>Another highly criticized review talks about the motion-sickness caused by the camera movement. I agree that the movie can be hard for the eyes, but this camera angle not only becomes key to the story (night vision/light for the subway scene), but also creates a unique environment not seen in a monster movie. THe majority of monster movies are seen through multiple point of views such as the scientist, military, housewife, etc. By using multiple POV's many monster films are led to rely on cheesy plots, and special effects. Cloverfield breaks that barrier. It solely captures one groups experience as they try to survive and draws in an audience to relate to their situation.<br/><br/>the last thing I will include would have to be the special effects. As previously stated the movie has a great number of them, but many are subtle and hard to view due to the camera movement. This movement actually creates great suspense about the monster itself, and exactly how several people die in the movie. The final full body shot of the monster as it looms over Hud shows a computer generated monster that looks completely original compared to the giant lizards stomping down other metropolitan areas.<br/><br/>Part horror movie, part disaster movie, with a good deal of action mixed in. Cloverfield actually lives up to its viral reputation. Take it from me as an audience member and not a distanced movie critic."
"middle_earthfan454","8","1","4","21 January 2008"," Good...but not what I expected
","When I first saw the trailer, I was expecting a solid monster movie with an original but enjoyable and fair plot where the monster is eventually, destroyed, everyone celebrates, the day is saved, etc.<br/><br/>But instead, there is limited plot, only the characters get an actual backstory. Almost nothing is revealed about the monsters origin or purpose. In fact, only glimpses of the monster are shown until a clear shot of it is seen near the end of the film.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending (as well as the whole film) is quite dark themed and full of unknown, making it difficult to determine what happens at the end of the film.<br/><br/>However, there are some pretty good points that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>The shaky, realistic motion of the camera adds tension to the experience. It almost feels like your actually there. <br/><br/>There is no music, but the sheer amount of gripping sounds(explosions, screaming, the monsters roar) was enough for me and they are pretty realistic.<br/><br/>Finally, there is plenty of action and it is enjoyable to see the immense destruction the monster causes while fighting with the military.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie for the most part and it is one of the best modern monster flicks I've seen. But all too often, I prefer a movie that is a little less gloomy and with an original ending."
"thousandfour","8","1","4","21 January 2008"," made me a little nauseous...
","Overall, excellent. It was a breath of freshness in its documentary style. the camcorder effect was very effective in capturing the chaos, but i'd have to say, it made me a little sick. I would recommend perhaps sitting towards the back of the theater. I think the monster should have made its debut a little earlier in the movie, because after the first 45 minutes, i was thinking ""they're never going to show us anything, and just leave everything ambiguous."" even when we do finally see the monster, it's a little hazy, and the camera moves around too much for you to get a good look. but i give credit to the spiders that attack and eat people. I would also have to ask, why are so many movies being made about the fall of New York? just something to think about."
"hogs_rule2000","7","1","4","21 January 2008"," Scary Movie, but the way it was filmed makes your viewing stressful!
","I voted 7 out of 10 because even though people may not like the way this movie was made, it makes you jump and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The way the movie was made also makes you feel you are part of the movie and your body actually feels stressed out and irritated. Course some people walk out but if you sit through the movie there is some wicked monsters. When the movie ends I wanted so much more to be explained, this movie could have been rated higher but I hate movies that just end without any explanation or continuation to what happened next. Definitely see the movie but if you did not like how Blair Witch Project was filmed you definitely won't like this movie."
"cyclone-18","7","1","4","21 January 2008"," The half of it I saw was great
","I was worried that it wouldn't be worth it, and to a certain extent it wasn't, but maybe it will be better on a small screen.<br/><br/>First, I should mention that I don't get motion sickness. I can read in the car, I've flown in acrobatic aircraft and I've ridden out turbulence on planes and boats (and enjoyed myself). So it came as a total surprise to me that I was about to hurl before the monster even showed up. Actually, I think that it had more to do with the ""rules for holding the camcorder"" that Abrams must have given. Rule #1: always hold it at the same 30 degree right tilt no matter who's holding it or what hand they're holding it in. Rule #2: keep the camera low enough that you see a lot of people's necks. Rule #3: when something interesting happens, shake the camera like your life depended on it.<br/><br/>I actually only saw about half the movie because I had to keep my eyes off the screen as much as possible. However, the parts with the monster(s) in them were incredible. I don't know what it would actually look like if I shot a giant monster on a camcorder, but I'm pretty sure it would look like Cloverfield. Aside from the coincidence that the monster kept wandering across this one group of people in a whole city, you see just enough of it to look believable, without overdoing it. I'd have to see it again, but the monster seems to change scale. At one point it looks like its mouth is big enough to swallow a couple bus's whole, but then it looks just big enough to eat a human. Also, those little monsters, which I assume were its babies. . .what kind of parent drops off its babies in the same place it's under constant attack? I like the ending too, it kind of flips it from a monster movie into a romance. . .in a twisted, Hiroshima/Nagasaki sort of way."
"Cube_TX","7","1","4","21 January 2008"," Not very original, but much better than I thought I it would be
","I saw this film yesterday with my wife and oldest son, mostly because my son wanted to see it so badly. My wife and I both expected a total fanboy blood & gore monster/disaster flick with a bunch of characters only there to die in a loud and gory manner. Granted, for the most part it WAS a fanboy monster/disaster flick but it did manage to impress all three of us and somehow live up to the hype. I hadn't seen or read any websites or message boards so I was able to see the film without knowing any outside theories or leaked information.<br/><br/>Yes, this film borrowed heavily from other films of its kind. I was reminded often of Aliens, The Blair Witch Project (itself an idea copied from Cannibal Holocaust) and the original War of the Worlds. I even saw some parallels from 9/11 video clips. It also had the generic disaster film elements of the troubled relationship that was being saved in the midst of disaster (just like Independence Day and Twister) and the heroic protagonist who disregards safety for the woman he loves. I think everyone knew that the end (spoiler alert!) would show the two troubled lovers one last time to remind us that they were happy not too long before. Despite all of this, I was still impressed with how the film was put together. They did manage to keep it all entertaining and I was never bored. I legitimately cared about these characters and the viewer felt like part of the disaster. I wanted them to escape even though the very beginning of the film had already suggested that they wouldn't make it.<br/><br/>I've seen better films of this genre, but I still recommend Cloverfield to anyone who likes these kinds of movies. Not exactly family-friendly (our 1-year-old didn't come with us) but an entertaining way to spend an evening. I'd probably buy it on DVD. The only complaint I'd have would be the fanboy audience made up of skinny wannabe punkers who wore jeans so low they looked like they'd pooped their pants and identical-looking underage goths talking and answering cell phones during the movie."
"chromeboy2","6","1","4","21 January 2008"," Mixed feelings...
","I love going to movies. Flat out. I love movies, and I even get crap for loving indie films where everybody dies in the end (because that is what happens sometimes). But I don't like movies that feel as though they don't have much point. The entire movie just didn't feel like it was going anywhere. It felt a little like a dream that you wake up and don't remember much of, because there's not much for you to remember. And all kinds of controversy comes from the first person camera view. My friends and I all couldn't eat for a good hour after the movie ended. None of us really had motion sickness, but my girlfriend started getting a little dizzy and we had to duck out for a second. It absolutely adds to the intensity and effect, but at a price. Overall I did enjoy it, but it just seemed like more of a rental movie than an $8 blockbuster."
"elandyll","6","1","4","21 January 2008"," Disappointed
","The movie, despite (and certainly not thanks to) the shaky camera was enjoyable. But did it live up to the hype it tried to generate? No, at least not for me. Not even close.<br/><br/>The Story can be summarized in just one sentence: ""Giant Monster attacks New York and a bunch of friends are caught in the middle."" This is what is generally called a ""pitch"" in the Hollywood biz, and it is supposed to generate interest, and make you want to know more.<br/><br/>Alright. There's been worse teasers in the past. But what's -beyond- this pitch, this one-liner? I mean, you gotta have a script, a story, right? Not here, I am sorry to say. This one sentence, this ""pitch"", -is- the story, from beginning to end. Oh there are some great moments, visually very impressive, and even some genuine scares (fewer than some people might have you think). But in the end it's going nowhere fast. If you could imagine the bastard child of Godzilla (the Emmerich version) and ""Friends"", that'd be it, also thanks to the weirdly out of context ""humorous"" comments made by the cameraman (who, for someone intent on filming ""how we all went down"", is doing one hell of a crappy job at letting us see what is going on. I swear he was shaking the camera on purpose at times).<br/><br/>Acting is suitable, certainly not Oscar worthy, the script nonexistent, and some rather stupid decisions made by the characters will rapidly leave you uninterested in their fate, letting you picking while talking with your friends who did which ""most stupid"" action or decision.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie will be probably a hit due to teenage interest in great FX, mix of action-horror (kinda ""light"" on the horror side) and the bunch of friends stacked against impossible odds. Some could also mention the same recipe used in Lost (more questions than answers thrown in the mix) and doing something ""just because it sounded cool at the time"" and let people think there is something deep behind it. No wonder with J.J Abrahams at the production.<br/><br/>This being said, rarely have I seen such a vacuum of a story put on the big screen, and that is saying something.<br/><br/>In the end, I cannot bring myself to rate ""Cloverfield"" any higher than 6, despite having genuinely enjoyed some moments, between the headache inducing camera moves. Great visuals and a few scares do not a movie make. If you look for great visuals, an actual story where you care about people and that makes you think, try to find a theater where ""The Mist"" is still playing. You'll thank me later."
"zrxrider2002","6","1","4","21 January 2008"," Could have been much better
","Cloverfield has a good story line, likable characters and plenty of excitement. Unfortunately, the filming is constantly shaky which is a constant reminder that you are watching a movie and therefore you are never really drawn into the movie. In that sense, the idea of making the movie more personal and terrifying by shooting it in this manner simply does not work. As high tech as the camera was, containing infra-red, flood light, lifetime battery and media that withstands a nuclear blast, why not put a gyroscope in it so that the filming could be better than amateurish. I thought the 84 minute length would be too short, but actually it is too long, the filming gets old very quickly. The party scene was great for character development but seemed to drag out too long thanks again to the filming. It's unfortunate that a film with so much potential falls short because it resorted to gimmickery. Too bad it was not done by Spielberg, it would have been much better."
"gypsyelfayden","5","1","4","21 January 2008"," What did I just watch?
","Honestly the only reason I went to see this movie was because my friends wanted to. But I came out knowing nothing more about the story then when I went in. This was just a blair witch style of shooting with an unknown monster that sheds smaller monsters that make people explode when they bite you. But what's worse then no plot is no ending. The movie just cuts off and gives you no explanation to what the monster is, where it came from or why it's tearing up New York city. The special effects were amazing, it was awesome how seamless everything was, but if you watch the trailer then you know all there is to know about Cloverfield."
"thainofshire","6","1","4","21 January 2008"," You've got go in with an open mind.
","This film is in no way bad at all. The people who you hear hating on the movie have, more often than not, gone into the movie with one of three things.<br/><br/>1. Extremely high hopes because of the marketing campaign, which is never a smart thing to do with a movie.<br/><br/>2. Expecting an average, common Hollywood style movie. Which is exactly what this is not.<br/><br/>3. A lack of diversity in camera angles. These people have not seen enough Paul Greengrass to be prepared for the shaky camera effect.<br/><br/>This being said, if you go in with having a grasp on the shaky cam effect, with hopes of seeing something entertaining, and you're ready for something different, you'll absolutely love this film.<br/><br/>The film is, obviously, a taped recording of the new york attack, thus the tape starts, and ends. That is all there is to it. Instead of comparing this to an average Hollywood film, compare it to a taped recording of one of your family's Christmas'. When you tape that, either the tape runs out of time abruptly, or you just finish, no plausible end is in sight. Thus when this film ends, it ends abruptly and it works with this style.<br/><br/>This film is one you will enjoy in some way. The only way you won't is if you won't let yourself."
"Seven_Thunders","8","1","4","21 January 2008"," Succeeds beyond the hype
","What a trip. The movie that was the hype-fest of 2007 has finally hit screens, and after the first viewing it left me wanting to see it again. For those of you who aren't quite sure what this movie is trying to do, it is a monster attack from the POV of the man on the street. 'Cloverfield' is the military codename for the event in the area formerly known as Central Park. It follows a group of young people as they are caught in the middle of this disaster, all caught on a camcorder. It feels like you are there. This is not a movie with your traditional plot, nor is it trying to be artful or dodgy. If the movie had a plot, it would have been ruined. Thus, being done as it is, it's immersive (if you don't mind the shakiness at times), intense and, dare I say, realistic.<br/><br/>Though it starts off a bit on the slow side, it gets in your face from the moment the city shakes from its arrival. People die in brutal ways, and their emotion is so real and guttural at times that you wish you could take a nuke to that beast to end their suffering.<br/><br/>The direction of this movie is done incredibly well for the chaotic scenario that it is. It doesn't feel directed at all, with the possible exception of the character ""Hud"", who is the guy with the camera. Though almost all of his interactions are behind the lens, he still has a great amount of character. His personality comes through even with the movement of the camera. He is comic relief, but you love him all the more for it.<br/><br/>You may be wondering how much of the monster you actually see. Well, I'm not going to spoil anything. But you won't be disappointed in this regard. Go see the film, who cares what people are saying about it, and make your own judgment. Cloverfield is the best monster attack movie ever. It leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>Great job, Drew Goddard and Matt Reeves. Here's to hoping we see more out of you two."

","I didn't realize so many people are afflicted with motion sickness. With the omni-present ""Shakey-Cam"" so popular on MTV, pretty much every Youtube video --- even in your Aunt Mildred's 75th birthday party footage has more shakes than this movie does. While I agree the beginning was a little too drawn out and the friends going back to ""save"" the girl was ridiculous, I wouldn't say this movie was a throw away. I saw this on a Sunday night and no one walked out. I over heard 3 people wonder why it ended the way it did (thought the air-raid sirens were ""tornado sirens"") this film simply wasn't made to answer questions....it was made this way to makes people think for themselves for a change. What if you found a ""real"" tape someone had shot, brought it home, plopped it in your player and were watching it? No one tells you what's going on...you have to watch and figure what's going on for yourself."

","After reading some of the bad reviews on here and in the news paper I was kinda worried that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. I was wrong! The movie was very well done and believable. The camera work made sure you saw the necessary things and didn't frustrate you like I was worried it would.<br/><br/>The creature wasn't cheesy and I actually cared about the characters. The camera does jerk around some but it isn't a reason to avoid the movie and I found myself so engrossed in the story that I hardly even noticed it.<br/><br/>Were there a lot of unanswered questions? Sure there were but not so many that you felt cheated, just enough to make you want more. To me this played into the believability of the whole ""this is a tape we found"" part of the movie."

","Umm. Cloverfield is scary and I got nightmares from it. No seriously, this movie freaked me out. I thought I was going sit in my comfy theater seat and have a good laugh as I watched an overblown version of the Blair Witch Project. I was wrong so wrong.<br/><br/>The fear this movie plays with is the fear of not knowing anything during a catastrophic situation. Something bad is happening and people are dying. You know there is a monster, you know that it is huge, but you don't know where it came from or why its attacking. Most monster/alien movies are told from the military or a scientific point of view and experts come up with way to defeat the beast. Cloverfield is about being on the ground level of a horrible event. It's about people running for their lives from things that they have know time to study or understand. There also parts that will be very reminiscent of September, 11 footage, which also plays into the formula of fear. As if the giant unknown monster wasn't enough there are some more nasty surprises in store.<br/><br/>Sure there's a love story involved. Also, in classic horror movie style, the main characters embark on a mission that places them in even greater personal danger than they are already in, but that's all par for the course. The frantic camera angles will make you kind of ill, but it was less annoying than the Bourne Ultimatum.<br/><br/>This was a great movie, the premise worked and exceed my expectations. This was what the American version of Godzilla should have been. Eat that Broderick! Unlike the Blair Witch, I would go see the is movie again and own it proudly. Will there be a sequel? While this movie can stand on its own, but I can see how they could ""f"" it up with a sequel. So in the meantime enjoy!"

","I would never consider myself a critic for movies, but just someone that enjoys them, and goes to them on the premise that I want to be entertained and see something cool.<br/><br/>Clever filming and creature design weren't enough for this movie to be worth the time or money I invested in it. It can't be helped to draw parallels to Blair Witch Project in terms of buzz or how it was filmed. As one user said before this was indeed the better movie, but I felt cheated. If anything could be learned from the home video feel that both movies have it is this - it is a gimmick. It really didn't add to the movie. I felt that it would have been considerably more interesting to have the home movie be and introduction to the main movie - cut to a recovery team. To Aliens to you? Okay... then perhaps something else. I wasn't the only one that was irritated after spending the time to watch this. I have never heard as much cussing at the end of a movie as I did after watching this all the way through. The crowd was clearly as displeased as I, and I tend to have a bit of a snobbish taste for movies, and think tailoring a movie to a test crowd is stupid, but it left me wondering what those people thought.<br/><br/>In the end great idea - in fact clever, but clever can't carry the movie in this instance. I felt nothing for the characters, in fact was waiting for them to get wiped out by the beasties, and was disappointed they didn't. Ending was too Blair Witch, and those that saw this you have to admit it was. The only thing I thought was worthwhile was getting to see the Ironman trailer, but still wasn't worth eight dollars to see. Rent it, don't buy it. I see no re-watch value in this."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","4","20 January 2008"," Sci-Fi Thriller and Indie give birth to the exciting creature that is ""Cloverfield""
","In a film where a giant monster attacks Manhattan, there are a lot of questions. What is it? Where did it come from? Why is it being destructive? ""Cloverfield"" doesn't want to answer these questions, it just wants you to ask them.<br/><br/>It's a hard concept to grasp, but this film, brought to the screen by LOST's J.J. Abrams and his property Bad Robot, doesn't want you to get caught up in the details. Your job is to experience what goes on and react to it and for much of the film. Sure, it's frustrating, it doesn't make sense, but Abrams and director Matt Reeves are aiming for that for a reason.<br/><br/>As soon as disaster strikes, images and feelings of 9/11 are conjured. With a cast of unknowns and a single camcorder as the source of the images, ""Cloverfield"" feels very real. While the film takes off from there as a monster attack/alien invasion, for a majority of it you are interested in what's happening to these people and how they're handling the situation. There is a lot of stuff that's hard to believe, but without it there's not much of a film. In general, the dialogue and the reactions of the people are very realistic and for a majority of the film keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>In a sense, ""Cloverfield"" is a sci-fi, fictional United 93, a gritty retelling of events (although false). The undertones of tragedy are difficult and it's amazing how these young actors are able to convey such realism.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" takes several different styles and genres and fuses them into something new and successful. It is the kind of film that if imitated in any way by any future film will clearly not get by without constant references to this film. It is exciting and innovative and exactly the kind of twisting of the norm that Hollywood needs to stay fresh while staying successful. It's not mind-blowing or genius, but it's got style. It goes to show that big blockbuster-style films can be done in small independent film-style ways."

","First of all, let me say that I understand the moving and shaking of the film in Cloverfield, because it is supposed to render the experience of the first person account of the beast attack on Manhattan. But COME ON!!! I realize this is a fantasy movie, but DAMN, must the characters always be in the same place the monster is? I live in New York, and anyone who has ever been here knows that Manhattan has enough places to hide, both above and below ground, and run whereby a person can avoid the beast. But these characters just happen to always end up in the right places and the right time where the monster is. Also, someone please tell me two things--why and how the dude with the camera manage to keep shooting through every attack and from hours on end, and what's with the alien, monster-sized locusts that's running around the subway tunnels? I must admit, the movie had its moments of suspense. The characters and the monster(s) needed way more development. But let me not read too much into this movie and waste anymore of my time and energy--nice idea, crappy movie."

","I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it twice. It is amazing what you see the second time around. I thought the movie was done well. At first the camera moving around was kind of disorienting but I eventually got use to it and got sucked right into the suspense and action. It is not anything like the Blair Witch Project except for the camcorder view. I wish there were more movies like this. All too often the teasers they show are not even in the movie and this is something that ticks me off. However, this movie gave little in teasers but what they gave was in the movie. Moving along, one of the controversies is where did the creature come from. Did it come from a deep sea trench. Did it come from space. Well actually it came from space. When you see the end of the movie when Beth and Rob are at Coney Island the it shows a panoramic view of the ocean. Right before the camera pans to Beth and Rob on the ferris wheel there is a large splash out in the ocean in the upper right hand of the frame. You have to be quick to see this."

It was fast paced and just didn't let up. It is done in a under utilized (thank god) style that suites it.<br/><br/>This film did something that I haven't seen since Alien, it didn't show the antagonist fully, until the very end of the film. All you see are little bits and pieces. This movie is all about what you don't see rather than what you do. The effects were top notch and the whole film just left me feeling drained.<br/><br/>This is what I was looking for when I saw the oh-so disappointing War of the Worlds. Cloverfield is much more human and in depth. War of the Worlds is for the ""I need closure and happy endings like oxygen"" crowd.

At the same time, however, it could be slightly irritating to not see certain things clearly.<br/><br/>The visuals were amazing and the acting was top notch.

","Let's be totally honest here... PG-13 horror movies absolutely suck with very few exceptions. The characters are annoying and unlikable, the acting is usually bad, and the suspense is terrible. I think this is all due to toning these films down so that they're acceptable for a wider age range, but it's still a pain. This movie goes against that rule fully and completely.<br/><br/>I loved so much about this film. The POV cam gave it that real feeling, kind of like watching a home movie of a UFO landing or something like that. The story is simple but it has a right to be as this is only documenting a group of people trying to survive these attacks. I only have one complaint about this film and it's the acting, it was very rough at times and completely unbelievable but the rest of the film made up for it. I will definitely being seeing this again.<br/><br/>Anyone who is a fan of films like Gojira and The Host or The Blair Witch Project and Behind the Mask will find a place for this film somewhere in their heart.

","After like 30+ years of being a kaiju and giant monster movie fan and an adult now that watches about like a 100 films a year in the cinema as part of my life/job - I gotta say, this ones one of the damn best monster flicks amerika has ever produced. (with the exception of one, dumb, unnecessary, 5-minute scene - you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.)<br/><br/>With its inventive storytelling device *the entire film remains true to its hand-held camera first-person perspective!* (unfortunately tho' shot from the perspective of some white, financially privileged NYC kids as the protagonists, who are ridiculous/annoying unto themselves) and in doing so, its managed to revive the sense of thrill and the unknown in the genre and the overwhelming collapse of the order of expectation and delivery, while still being a totally effective genre-piece. I can't help but think that this is what ""Creature from 20,000 Fathoms"" or the original ""Godzilla"" must have been like seeing in the theatre when they came out last century.<br/><br/>I just witnessed it last night on the 3rd(?) largest screen/soundsystem on the west coast (yes the Cinerama!) and came out pretty well stunned. No work of high-art or whatever, but an amazing reinvention of a genre that has been pretty lame for decades. Props to Matt Reeves!"
"argolife5","8","1","4","20 January 2008"," It was entertaining, but the logistics were off
","As a New York guy, I have to question not only the plan of the main characters but also the logistics. Why anyone would stay at the Spring St. stop for 20 minutes and then FINALLY start running through the subway is beyond me. And how exactly did they get to 59th st and Columbus Circle from Spring St. so quickly? And was the quarantine space in the Manhattan Mall at 33rd and B'way? If so, how did they get there? I could've ended the movie in 5 minutes - instead of going to B'klyn over the bridge, they could've walked (btw, no respectable New Yorker would ""walk"" anywhere in a situation like that, and the characters did nothing but walk) the opposite direction to the World Trade Center and taken the PATH Train to New Jersey, and thus we would have been able to watch the whole thing while not trying to adjust our eyes to the blur of the moving camera. Btw, Rob was selfish as hell to go after Beth the whole time - he killed Marlena and Hud because of that.<br/><br/>Even though I was just all over the movie for poor planning, I must say the entertainment factor was still high. It was still a creepy movie packed with great scenes and good surprises."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","4","20 January 2008"," An Experiment In Film-making Indeed.
","Rob is about to go away to Japan for a new job, so his friends decide to throw him a good-bye party. The party is quickly disturbed by an earthquake, which is later discovered to be from a giant unknown creature terrorizing the city of New York.<br/><br/>To describe this film would be saying what everyone has been saying since its release. Cloverfield is Godzilla meets The Blair Witch Project. This is not a bad thing; to negatives make a positive remember? If it weren't for films like Blair Witch we wouldn't have Cloverfield, then again if it weren't for films like Cannibal Holocaust, we wouldn't have films like Blair Witch. What Cloverfield does is take this idea and spin it on its head. Cloverfield is an experiment in film-making and it is quite successful.<br/><br/>Just like Blair Witch the film starts off with a message that this footage was found and we are about to watch this uncut material. For the first 20 or so minutes we get character introductions, these are the people who will be seeing the destruction through; these are the eyes and ears. We don't get much characterization, but enough to know who's who in the grand scheme of things. We see a romantic sub-plot that will no doubt become more important as the film goes on; we meet our cameraman, a sarcastic guy who doesn't have the guts to talk to this one girl, this one girl who is only there to meet up with her other friends later. We also see the main characters brother and girlfriend, but we never get to really know these people. Which is fine, we only get a glimpse into their lives because it's all about the destruction right? <br/><br/>The destruction itself is very well done. This is where all the money went. No high tech cameras, just special effects for destruction for New York. Every bit of it was realistic. I was scared this was going to be another monster running around New York bit that Godzilla pulled on us, and yes while it is that, the film is much more. Not once did I ever believe anything in Godzilla, here I was entertain and engaged. I felt like I was actually watching real footage. The unknown actors were a good choice, it adds to the ""found footage"" feel.<br/><br/>The monster itself is cool looking as well. You never get a full view of it until the very end, but it's the bits and pieces of it that make it scary. Reeves builds up great tension as the monster is roaming the city and we see the destruction from a distance, yet we still have fear that it could kill us.<br/><br/>In addition to the giant creature, there are little ones. Apparently they are parasites. They seem like giant spider-crabs to me and they are quite scary. I'm glad that Abrams and crew decided to go with something original and not re-tell Godzilla. This was a brilliant choice and helped the marketing of the film immensely. The sound is sharp and loud. Specifically when the army blasts away at the creature, it makes the viewer feel like they are there.<br/><br/>I never once felt sick with the camcorder shaking around everywhere, but others in the theatre were. They were also disappointed with the ending, as half the theatre moaned and asked if that was it. I don't know what they were expecting, maybe some answers? Well you won't get any here. We saw the destruction through the eyes of this camera; we don't know what's going on. The characters don't know what's going on, they speculate that it could be alien, or government secret. There is no scientist with a white lab coat here explaining what the monster is or where it came from. If you're content with this then you'll love this film.<br/><br/>Unlike Snakes On A Plane, which I loved by the way, this film lives up to the hype expected by the fans. All the speculations can go to rest Cloverfield is here. Now let new speculations arise."
"mccullog","9","1","4","20 January 2008"," Cloverfield..........
","Why do people need to have everything wrapped up in a nice neat bow for them? After reading some of these reviews for the movie I must say that America is getting dumber and dumber by the minute. Use your imagination people!!!! That's what makes the movie what it is!!! And the camera work puts you right in the middle of the action. I'm really surprised at some of the negative reaction to one of the best monster movies made in the States in a long long time. The comments about the choice of actors baffles me as well. Having virtual no-names helps to make it seem more ""realistic"". It gives you no clue of who is going to live and who is going to get eaten.

"secretagent_007","9","1","4","20 January 2008"," Monstrous Shakycam
","As far as pushing the boundaries of convention goes, I've still got to give it to Blair Witch Project for a simple reason: its hand-held camera-work does not inspire me to scream ""Hold the heck still!"" at the screen. Hud, the cameraman in Cloverfield, has got to be addicted to caffeine for all the shakiness and inability to keep the camera on something for more than 1.6 seconds. Or else it's ADD. I'm not one of those weaklings who got dizzy from The Bourne Ultimatum, but I appreciate being able to see what I'm looking at if the whole point of shooting a movie on video is to make it feel like you're actually there. But then the producer, J.J. Abrams, is famous for never making anything too clear (as evidenced by his TV shows ""Lost"" and ""Alias"").<br/><br/>This is a monster movie, along the lines of Godzilla or The Host, but with a twist. Everything we see is purported to be a videotape found after the monster eats Manhattan. The video starts as a collection of farewell messages to Rob, a 20-something who has a million 20-something friends and who is moving to Japan for work. His best friend Hud is running the camera, interviewing Rob's pals, and hitting on Marlena, who ain't hitting back. Then the entire city shakes and the lights go out, rudely awakening all the characters out of an awkward situation involving Rob and his friend (and more) Beth. Everybody's probably seen what happens next - explosions in the distance, panic in the streets, and the head of the Statue of Liberty crashes in front of Rob's building. Aside from this very sentence, I'll not make any comparisons to 9/11 - scared people in a city running away from something bad does not inherently carry political or social meaning. This is a monster movie and like any monster movie, people have to run away from the monster en masse.<br/><br/>What makes this one different, though, is not just that it's shot with a camcorder. This is a special monster movie because we rarely see the monster and therefore are stuck with the characters and we learn only what they learn. This story is about the human tragedy that is glossed over in all the old Godzilla flicks where someone screams, ""GOJIRA!"" and takes off. What about that man's family? Is his home destroyed by the creature? Those other movies are usually about scientists and military people scheming to kill whatever beast is plaguing Tokyo now. From Mothra to Independence Day, that's the formula. Formula is turned on its head when we stop caring if the General will drop an A-bomb on the thing and we start seeing the battle in the streets between average people and the boar-sized insects that live on the huge thing's back. One scene in a dark subway tunnel is one of the best of its kind, where the stalking creatures aren't there and then, suddenly, they are. See The Descent for more night vision camcorder scariness...<br/><br/>Special credit must go to the special effects artists on this movie. With maybe a couple exceptions, everything that would be fantastical and impossible in another movie looks perfectly real here. The bugs in the subway don't look like a special effect that we are meant to admire, they look like vicious, man-eating creatures from another dimension or something and they really are terrifying, the same way a rabid dog staring you down is terrifying. The effects tricked my brain into thinking everything was real and I can't remember the last time that happened. Cloverfield has a really simple story at its core, about a small group of survivors looking for an injured friend, and it has some rather annoying camera-work (which is absolutely worse than just motion sickness-inducing camera-work), but it is effective as an intense adventure movie and the totally natural-looking effects prop up the characters who are basically operating without a plot most of the time. This isn't a perfect movie, but it is a ride; that cannot be denied. I only hope Paramount doesn't sequel-ize it and make themselves a franchise not unlike the Godzilla movies that inspired it.<br/><br/>http://www.movieswithmark.com"
"angelynx-2","9","1","4","20 January 2008"," Top-notch 21st century monster flick
","I was really looking forward to this movie, and it didn't disappoint me a bit. It's got everything I hoped for: an original monster, a breathtaking pace, genuine shocks and scares, some poignancy, some mystery, and absolutely no snarky condescension or cheesiness. This is a stripped-down, kick-ass dynamo of a movie experience unlike any giant creature flick I've ever seen, and I've been watching them since the 70s. It takes a little time to set up and get rolling, but once it's out of the gate it doesn't let up for a moment. The use of the hand-held camera gives it terrific immediacy and believability, since we see only as much of the creature and its rampage as the characters underfoot do. They're a pretty typical batch of well-heeled kids, used to getting immediate information on everything, and when they're suddenly plunged into violent chaos they react with terror and confusion. Yet despite that, they attempt a heroic rescue, acting with the kind of courage ordinary people show in the face of disaster every day. (Yes, some sequences do evoke the imagery of 9-11, but I wish people would quit sounding so indignant about that; surely it's off the sacred list and into the pool of legitimate film topics by now. The Cloverfield/9-11 = Godzilla/Hiroshima analogy ought to be enough to settle the point.) I liked them a lot more than I expected to (in fact I completely choked up when one character had to give his mom some very bad news) and felt completely pulled into the headlong rush of the story. It's as convincing a portrait of an event like this as I can imagine, and will leave you gasping for breath. I only have two credibility quibbles, in fact: the overly-helpful soldier and the apparent army of available helicopters. But those are minor. [[--I'm not going to say anything about the monster, except that it's none of the things people have been speculating it was, it's 100% cool, and I can't wait for the action figure.]] --I can't imagine anyone who really loves daikaiju cinema being disappointed with this: it's a fine, scary piece of work. Too nihilistic? Could be, but these are dark times, and we already know this film was intended to mirror the right-now dread and tension of our War on Terror landscape. There's no reassurance from those in power, the military doesn't know any more than the characters do, and all you get in return for facing the worst is the close-up rush of the adventure. Which, after all, may be all you ever get."

","Well, I admit, I expected to come out nauseous after this movie. Amazingly, I didn't. I thought it was perfect. Much different then what you expect. A lot of people were angry that there was no story behind the monster, well what do you expect, it is done with a hand held camera in first person, your average New Yorker won't know what's happening. A lot of people were angry at the fact that you didn't get to see the movie that much, well what do you want the camera man to do, turn around and get trampled by the monster trying to get a good shot of it? I wouldn't. The monster, even with the little screen time, was brilliant in design, the monsters it dropped were really cool, the way people would explode if they got bitten was really cool. Above all, this movie was unique and very well made. So why do i give this a 7/10 instead of 10/10, well (oh no, bad news!) Why would the group go to save a girl that across town were the monster is (I would run away).When they find the girl, she has a steel bar through her, she should have been dead of blood loss. When the monster hits the helicopter it crashes, no one should have survived that crash. Why would the monster only nibble on the camera man instead of eating him whole? To finish this off, a lot of people were disappointed with the ending, But like the the monster's origin, how would a camera capture the monster dying (if it does) if a bridge just collapsed on it? Well, I liked the movie, others may, others may not but I liked it."

","Saw Cloverfield this weekend. I was really excited about it as I have been a huge fan of J.J. Abrams. However, I did find the shooting style to be extremely distracting. I mean I agree that it added a certain visceral experience of really being there, but after a while it became obnoxious and distracting. I just think that there were better ways to tell the same story with out being so sickening with the motion of the camera. All in all I would recommend seeing it as long as you aren't given to bouts of motions sickness.<br/><br/>The other problem is that it becomes hard to believe that with such harrowing things happening to these people that they would make the choice to continue filming it. I mean understand the need to suspend disbelief, but this was a convention that was just a little much. At one point Hud, one of the Characters is told to put the camera down, he films himself saying if this the last they see of him he is dead, but his putting down the camera doesn't look any different than when he did have the camera. I can't believe that if people are that scared, that they would make the effort to continue filming especially while trying to outrun something that is trying to bite their heads off."

","Alright, so I've read a lot of reviews on here giving this a 1 or 2 star rating because it's not a deep, thought-provoking film wrought with wit, symbolism, or metaphors. Make no mistake, reviewers, this is not an art film; this is an unconventional action movie filmed from the perspective of a group of survivors in the case of a giant monster attacking NYC.<br/><br/>I see complaints that the characters make poor decisions, which I agree with. The truth, though, is that you don't know what you'd do in a situation like that, where your body is getting ravaged by inordinate amounts of adrenaline because the situation you're in is getting more and more horrible by the second. I applauded them because they had the strength to carry on, to be honest.<br/><br/>And to the complaint of ""the camera is too shaky"", THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF ONE GUY WERE FILMING THIS MOVIE FROM A HAND-HELD CAMCORDER. I was honestly more annoyed about the few really steady, spectacular shots in the film because it would have been so hard for someone to pull them off with a camcorder and no tripod.<br/><br/>(And here's the reason I clicked the spoiler box) My biggest problem with the movie, however, was the way Hud's death was handled. The guy froze, sure, I can believe that, but the monster didn't even try to go after Beth or Rob. It did, however, lead to (in my opinion) the best moment of the whole film though: the auto-focus that can't seem to choose whether to focus on Hud's face or the blades of grass. That shot threw shivers down my spine. For real.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved this movie for what it was, and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel(s)."

","What's the buzz, tell me what's a happening, what's the buzz ...<br/><br/>To put it simply, Cloverfield is Blair With Project and Godzilla with big budget. Everyone who saw this movie in the cinema either found it very creatively executed or a waste of time. I found it intriguing and engaging.<br/><br/>Although at the beginning of the movie, not knowing what to expect, I felt dizzy after a few minutes into the scenes. I had to close my eyes occasionally to keep myself from getting nauseated. Just as I was regretting a little at this technique of story telling then it got all exciting and I forgot all about the swinging and shaking of the camera.<br/><br/>It was done pretty well and believable throughout the entire movie. The only thing that I expected more of was the monster itself. I thought it could have looked better.<br/><br/>If this had been just another monster movie like Godzilla, War Of The Worlds or King Kong then there wouldn't have been so much hype about it to make it one of the most outstanding creature features for all times."

","Excellent film. A story of friendship, bravery, doing things because they are right, not because they are easy. Ultimately one of hopelessness - and I guess that would be my beef - - some indication that the humans were getting the upper hand would have been nice, and make the sacrifice of the friends worthwhile.<br/><br/>As it is, their friendship and subsequent ""mission"" to rescue Beth became futile.<br/><br/>The film was well made and got the viewer completely engrossed in the quartet and their progress through Manhattan. The warning about motion sickness due to the hand-held camera is well meant I am sure but after a few minutes I became used to the effect an it certainly added an element of tension. Th cut-backs to the previous film, showing the couple in happier times on Coney Island was a nice touch. <br/><br/>It was also good to have no overt camera product placements - but maybe a real video-camera would not have survived the things this one did, so no manufacturer could claim it! <br/><br/>The benefits of having a charged cell phone battery at all times led to one of the (few) humorous moments as folk were looting an electronic store for plasma TVs whilst all our hero wants is a battery.<br/><br/>The PG rating is probably fair - no bad language - but any parent taking an 8 year old in needs talking to!!"
"moviewizguy","8","1","4","19 January 2008"," Blair Witch With Godzilla!
","Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives.<br/><br/>With an ingenious trailer from J.J. Abrams himself, along with clever marketing, all of us can assume that the film may not be as good as the trailer and marketing. Well, we were wrong. Not only is the film as clever as the trailer, it's also a lot of fun! It's nice to see a great film in January, don't you agree?<br/><br/>If you are still in doubt of seeing the film, let me continue on my review. Here's my take on the whole handy cam: Using this in the film makes it feel so realistic. During the action scenes, you feel like you're really there! I know a lot of people said this before but it really does! My only complaint is that it's sometimes annoying when the whole camera shakes around. Some might get stomach cramps.<br/><br/>As for the production values, they are really well done. The visual effects are amazing. The action scenes are unbelievable. What else can I say? If you're worried about not seeing the monster, don't. You'll see it. You'll see it up close. And I thought I would never say this but I really like the character development! I would never though character development could take place in a handy cam.<br/><br/>I'm also surprised to say, when we feel like we're there, that I actually felt scared. I had chills in my spine when something bad is happening. I laughed when characters popped up jokes. I felt sad when characters died. Also, there's no origin to this story, if you're looking for it. The performances by the unknown cast is above average. The most notable, is Lizzy Caplan, all the way.<br/><br/>It's just a big monster movie! So, the film is entertaining, funny, sad, scary, heart-pulsing...The handy cam was a great idea and the action great! What else would you want from a monster movie? This is the movie to see this week! Watch it now!"

","What a blast watching this movie was! Edge of your seat the whole time. It was very unique and the action and effects were great. This is an excellent take on the modern day monster movie. The filming is a little Blair witch-esquire but it works. The characters aren't all that much to remember but the movie as a whole makes up for it. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. If your looking for a cheesy cookie cutter movie with the same plot and lame dialogue look elsewhere. It was very new and creative as well as refreshing to watch. Interesting thing is as Roger Ebert pointed out, if you watch the Government message in the beginning how does this movie ever make to the big screen?"

","I went to see this movie yesterday and I have to say, it was pretty solid. Not too over the edge, but just enough to keep you interested. This is the type of movie you may watch once or twice and never want to watch it again. But I mean that in a good way.Even though the movie starts slow, it ends good. Really before I get into the comment, to everyone who says it has a lot of unanswered questions, you didn't understand the movie. The movie is from the point of view of a group of people who were affected. They didn't know what happened. They couldn't get an answer on what it was so why would you know? Thats why I say go in with a first person's view of the movie and you will like it. I must say I wont give nothing away. The monster looks OK, not cheesy or great. The story is entertaining. The actors do a great job. And despite what people say, the ending is quite good(To those who have seen it, what did you expect?). <br/><br/>P.S.-As a side note, I read that they are talking about doing a sequel to this movie. Not another monster, but from the same attack from a different group of people's perspective. Which i think is interesting."

","Going into the movie, I didn't know to much about it. But when the movie first started I thought to myself this is probably gonna suck, and I thought I was right. But as the movie progressed and picked up pace I found myself at the edge of my seat and constantly wondering what was gonna happen next. The Effects were magnificent, and story was great. The best thing about the movie turned out to be the worse thing for my stomach and my head, as you will come to find out if you decided to watch it, is the camera styling of the movie is refreshing, and brings the whole experience alive making it just that more epic. But it did leave me very queasy and with quite a headache cause I get motion sick very easy, but it was well worth it, and I would gladly do it all over again.<br/><br/>For the first time in along time, I can honestly say the movie was well worth the 6.50 So if you haven't seen it you should cause its diffidently a movie a thousand times more amazing on the big screen."

","I went to see Cloverfield the day it came out. Just like ""I am Legend"", its trailers were shown all over TV and the internet. It was almost impossible not to see it. I go with my friends and we get in the movie. The beginning begins with the characters getting ready for a man's going-away- party (it was hard to remember their names, as it was very fast paced). Well, this thing attacks and they're stuck in the middle of it. So this thing just starts coming at everything and destroys New York. Then, it starts dropping these little monster things and they start attacking people. They attack one of the group's friends and she eventually has to be killed...but why???? It doesn't explain anything...i mean nothing. It doesn't say why, it doesn't say how....nothing. So if you've been reading this than you're probably thinking ""wow this movie must suck"". Not quite, i liked it...except for that it didn't explain anything. The story was great, and I liked the Blair- Witch type filmography. But with doing it like that, they have to drop elements of the story. If you did not like how the Blair Witch was filmed, then you probably will not like Cloverfield."

Blair Witch didn't compare, because it was never as real as the terror I felt watching this movie.<br/><br/>I was there with these characters. To get as close as I can to a comparison, I would say it was like watching 9/11 videos and ""The Host"". But even then, don't just take it off that comparison. Watch this movie.<br/><br/>Even now I feel disturbed, shaky and paranoid. It was an amazing experience and the re watch value comes from wanting to see more clues and hints behind the monster and the attack. The first time you are just way too wrapped up in the drama unfolding.<br/><br/>And yes I can see already this movie will split people in two. Some will love it, some will hate it and both sides will be passionate.<br/><br/>They should be passionate, because this movie evokes strong emotions, and in my opinion, it is one of the greatest monster/disaster movies ever made."

Well we never really get a great look at it. Which i thought was a good idea. it go myself and the other people i was watching it with into the movie because in this situation you wouldn't get a good look. Although in one scene we get a close look at one of the creatures. yes i said one of them. there are at least 2 different sizes of monster, maybe three i will have to see it again to be sure. We have the GIANT one running around the buildings, then we have th little critters(actually about the size of a big dog) and possibly one around the size of a house, maybe a little bigger. we see it on the news and Hud, the character carrying the camera gets a few good shots. I will admit i caught myself yelling at him to turn left or right so we could see the damn thing a few times.<br/><br/>over all it was a believable story. in a lot of monster movies you follow the military or scientists and get explanation as to what it is attacking the city. not here. i will say one of my favorite lines of all time comes from this movie. One of the girls ask "" what was that?"" as the monster goes by, and Hud replies "" it was a terrible thing"" i laughed my but off. we follow the average joes in this movie and see it from the civilian p.o.v. which i enjoyed a lot.<br/><br/>I liked this movie a lot and cant wait to see it again.

In fact, this viewer was hoping after the first 10 minutes that one or more of the main characters —self-absorbed millennial yuppies — would just die, please. After 18 minutes of mindlessly banal banter at a party before anything remotely suspenseful even happens, I was also wishing the same fate on the director and screenwriter.

","First of all, ""Cloverfield"" is probably the last title that I would envision for a horror/sci-fi movie. But aside from the fact that it is, there are two specific things that I find very impressive about the film. The main aspect of course is that it's shot with a hand-held camera and contains a cast of unknowns so as to create very realistic sense. But I also would say that it follows the same structure as Alfred Hitchcock's movie ""The Birds"". You see, during the first fifteen or so minutes, both movies look as though they're going to be romantic comedies. But then the horrific element arrives and dominates the rest of the movie. And both films have the same sort of ending (although different things happen).<br/><br/>Anyway, this is more than a monster movie. I totally recommend it."

","I really don't understand why people didn't really like this movie. It's not your ordinary movie. The way the director set it up is you're basically watching a top secret government document. It's purpose was not to be filmed like every other movie, and in my opinion, it worked out better that way. Filming the whole movie on a video camera was the better decision. It makes it seem more real to the audience, like it actually happened. People compare it to the blair witch. How long ago did that movie come out again? I thought it was refreshing.<br/><br/>The actors were nothing special, which was better. They acted like normal, everyday people going through the same problems everyone goes through (minus a monster attack). Having big time actors would have made the film distracting and not realistic.<br/><br/>The monster itself was creative. It is not your average godzilla/t-rex man eating beast. I think it has a scary edge which keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>There really wasn't a complete plot to the film. You know what happens to all the people but you really don't know what happens to the monster. So in that respect, its unresolved. But like I said earlier, it isn't supposed to be resolved. They filmed it so it was like the viewer is watching a government document. I don't think it could have been much better.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought cloverfield lived up to all the hype it created, plus it exceeded what I expected.

","We were hanging out in the mall and we had nothing to do so we decided to watch a movie. I was choosing between AVP 2 and Cloverfield, but after seeing the poster, I thought Cloverfield might be more different, so we checked it out. I must say Cloverfield really blew me away! I really liked the movie. It's an action/sci-fi/thriller monster movie. It's got LOADS of very good intense action, accompanied with flawless special effects(wait, did they use any?). The action sequences were simply brilliant! Acting was great. Not top notch, but is still good and believable. The main monster was really cool and destructive, I kept thinking ""what's that thing? where did it come from? How did it get here? What will happen if that was real?"" the entire time. It's also got some scary and disturbing scenes which really creeped me out. The sound effects were awesome! It would be great if you watch this in theaters to get the best from the sounds. Oh and take note that the whole movie is shot using a home camera by one of the civilians getting attacked by the monster, so you might know how shaky the camera is, so it is not recommended for people who easily get motion sickness. The camera style was really good, making you think that the movie was real. It's no Godzilla movie; Cloverfield has a more different feel. I never thought I'd run into such a big movie like this! Usually I only go to cinemas for big movies like Spider-man and Harry Potter. It took my 2008 Big-Movies-To-Watch-In-Cinemas planner by surprise.<br/><br/>Some people will like it, some people won't. I watched this with my mom and said that she didn't like it; nothing in the movie was good and the camera shakes were irritating. Oh well......we all have different tastes.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Cloverfield is a very good action-packed sci-fi monster movie that made me happy(I actually smiled the entire movie!) and made my day at the mall. It was a superbly intense roller-coaster ride. Well done Matt Reeves and J.J. Abrams! Fine work indeed."
"mooncomix","9","1","5","30 January 2008"," So awesome
","I am not a man who is a fan of monster movies. I have never watched monster movies before and I even didn't want to watch '8 Legged Freaks' after my friend assured me it was funny, not scary. <br/><br/>But 'Cloverfield' caught my attention because of one thing. This was a review/interview in an Empire magazine. And it gripped me so much, even before I had seen a trailer! <br/><br/>So I went with a few friends, expecting it to be good, but I underestimated it. It was, in my own personal words, so freaking awesome. <br/><br/>The characters, unlike what some of the previous reviewers have said, were very realistic and I found it extremely easy to be empathetic with them, especially when they were killed off. The acting, too, made me think that these characters were real. <br/><br/>The way it was filmed was one of my favourite touches to the film, using only a hand held camera and having you watch the film from one of the character's point of view, making it seem like you're the person running away from whatever it is attacking New York (and don't worry, you'll see it). <br/><br/>And that brings me to the monster. The thing that made millions of people around the world flock to this movie. It is so amazingly well done, both graphics wise and everything else wise. It looked and acted so realistically and made me jump in my seat many times. The fact that we didn't see it outright made it even scarier. <br/><br/>I've read lots of the reviews on this website and I don't understand why people didn't like it! Okay, maybe the camera could have gotten on people's nerves and maybe they've watched 'Godzilla' too many times but I don't understand why they said the characters were unrealistic! They were completely human, not the scripted Hollywood clichés that clog up our screens. <br/><br/>In conclusion, go see this movie. It's well worth it, it's scary, thrilling and just plain awesome."
"das417","8","1","5","30 January 2008"," A twist on an old genre, Cloverfield shows that even an old concept can still sell
","My first reaction to seeing the ""mysterious"" movie trailer in which one is treated to the scene of large section of New York exploding, followed of course by the head of the State of Liberty bouncing down a street, was one of awe. Not only was this film being produced by JJ Abrams, better known in my opinion for the series Lost, but it was filmed in such a way that seemed unique. A hand held camera telling the story from the view point of one or at least a few other characters? Yes, we saw this before with the dreadfully silly Blair Witch Project. However, this was taking the concept to a whole new level even though no one had a clue to what actually was happening.<br/><br/>Now that the plot is known to everyone, the idea behind it is still unique. A monster movie based upon the limited view points of only four major characters? In movies such as Godzilla and King Kong the audience knew more than the characters so it was easy to dismiss their actions and thoughts if one disliked them. However, with Cloverfield the situation is different. Now the audience is forced to only know and experience what the characters themselves are facing. Frustrating to some, but I found it drawing me in further because I was so desperate to also know what was going on.<br/><br/>Rob (Michael Stahl-David) has been promoted and will now work overseas in Japan which of course will take him far from his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and best friend Hud (T.J. Miller). To honor the occasion, Jason's fiancée Lily (Jessica Lucas) decides to set up a surprise party with all of Rob's close friends so they could all see him off together. Of course Rob would want to remember this so Lily convinces Jason to record the party on an hand held camera which Jason then dumps upon Hud who finds himself enjoying the new responsibility as well as the opportunity to draw close to Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).<br/><br/>The party is a success until the appearance of Beth (Odette Yustman) and her new boyfriend. I should back up and explain that Cloverfield starts with images from the camera of Rob and Beth together. Images that are slowly being erased as Hud continues to film but since Jason and Beth now seem to be far apart due to some strange twist in their relationship, Rob claims to have little interest in them.<br/><br/>As if life couldn't get more stressful for Rob, the city is suddenly rocked by a strange earthquake. What is the obvious thing to do? Well, run up to the roof to get a better view of the city which of course everyone at the party decides to do. While Hud pans over New York's night line, it is then that an explosion literally tears apart a large section of the city. Everyone screams and begins running from the roof and only stop when they reach the city street where they are joined by other New Yorkers who stare with horror as buildings seemingly fall on their own.<br/><br/>What happens next is captured solely by Hud who runs, trips, falls, screams, and cries as much as everyone else around him. The idea sounds silly but it actually works and also gives the characters a deeper sense of depth in that the only camera, so to speak, they are acting in front of is the small one before them. The sudden motions, fuzzy images, and dusty shots gives one the impression that for the most part something like this actually happened. Some complained of sickness because of this however I was not one of them. Cloverfield's strength is in the way it is filmed and if you didn't like that then you have no reason to like the movie at all.<br/><br/>The movie follows the basic idea behind an escape movie in that Rob, Jason, Lily, Hud, Beth and Marlena, must escape the city at all costs. The deaths of Jason and Marlena, as well as the rescue attempt to save Beth, drive the rest of the drama of Cloverfield. It is easy to argue that there isn't much substance behind Cloverfield but one really misses the point if that is one's feelings about Cloverfield. Once more Cloverfield is a movie not just about the monster attack itself but in how the story is told. That is where the real strengths of the movie are found.<br/><br/>Cloverfield isn't a perfect movie and one can argue that the idea of someone really wanting to hold onto the same camera during a monster attack is simply unrealistic. Okay, so what? How realistic is a monster attack to begin with? One shouldn't be too critical of Cloverfied but instead should simply agree with everyone that takes place and enjoy the ride. Cloverfield shows that an old genre such as monster attacks can still work even today.<br/><br/>8/10"

This is an amazing movie that everyone should go and see.<br/><br/>Only problem is this, if you hate an awesome movie with a not so Hollywood ending then don't go , you wont like it.<br/><br/>But if you like Non-stop action, suspense, terror, and surprise then put yourself in the theater and watch this movie.<br/><br/>You wont be sorry trust me. And please please don't compare this to the Blair Witch Craft because this beats it by a million.<br/><br/>So in conclusion if you like a Non-Stop action thrill ride then go to this movie, and don't forget a barf bag, and don't eat tacos before going, i found out the hard way."
"mbelmont-1","8","1","5","29 January 2008"," Cloverfield flawed but good
","This contemporarily hip, memorably dark monster genre revival has moments of cinematic mastery as well as lapses of almost laughable ridiculousness (even for a monster movie), and the combination yields a good but not great experience that sticks with you with surprising firmness. The film follows a tight-knit group of trendy New Yorkers as they try to survive a hellish assault on their city by a giant, indestructible, and viciously pernicious amphibian. The ground-level portrayal of the attack is often brilliant, using 9/11 imagery (a cloud of dust chases people after the collapse of a building, and showers of office paper flutter down from damaged skyscrapers), ominous fleeting glimpses of the gargantuan perpetrator as it stalks and stumbles through the streets, and convincing special effects that make us flinch as cars are crushed like cola cans, missiles of rubble rain into crowds of onlookers, and a mass evacuation is organized in the opposite direction of rumbling tanks and shouting soldiers. The characters themselves aren't quite real enough for us to truly care for them, but we see enough of a going away party for the main character (Rob) immediately preceding the turmoil, and glimpses and pieces of stirring humanity during the attack (Rob is called by his worried mother presumably watching news reports from far away in one of the film's best scenes), to sympathize with them adequately. The dialogue, however, is too often tortuous, and sporadic attempts at comic relief make us consider rooting for the monster. Certain scenes break the trance of terrifying realism that envelopes most the movie. And ultimately, contrary to the director's intentions, the home video style filming technique hurts the impact of the terror by making the audience merely secondary, ""after-the-event"" observers. In order for us to be fully engaged in the victims' plight, we had to see and hear with their eyes and ears, not their super-durable camcorder. Yes, the thing made me nauseous. The director could have preserved the laudably tragic effect of cutting randomly to home video footage of the main character's romantic day with his lover a month before the attack by giving the characters a camcorder that they turned on only occasionally. Despite its flaws, the movie is a must-see."

","To me a good movie is the kind that leaves you wondering what's going to happen next. Something that makes you thinkwhat would you do if you were in that situation? How would you re-act? I liked the film. I really only had one real disappointment with this film and that was the how it was filmed through the eyes of a single camera. Some-what like ""The Blair Witch Project "" thankfully our camera person in this film was much less shaky then that of the Blair Witch crew so you could actually see what was taking place as it was happening. The character build up was nicely done. You're quietly introduced into the lives of a group of individuals that at a perfect time were all brought together. If not for this moment some may not even have spoken to one another. Within a second everything changes and the city feels like it's become a war zoneno one even knows what's going on. You, as well as the characters are left waiting wondering looking around for a clue as to what happenonce the chaos starts. Earthquake, plane crash, bomb? What?"

","I think that this movie is a very good one. But it is far from a mainstream movie. That is also the reason why I can imagine that some people do not see the point of this movie and even dislike it for that same reason. But I think that is with a lot of movies like Blair Witch Project, Babel etc. A group of people will see the point of the movie and like it and another big part sees it as some kind of strange art that they can not relate to.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of the movie start slow. But with the sudden arrival of the monster the movie starts to excel both in quality and speed. The sound of the explosions can be felt in your stomach. I especially like that the tension was build up and they actually did show the monster. And as a relatively low budget movie the monster and the special effect were quite good. The actors were unexperienced but they did play very convincingly.<br/><br/>If you get dizzy easily this is not a movie I would recommend."
"counterkiller_cs","9","1","5","27 January 2008"," Unique Monster versus City Movie
","Some people may argue that this movie was indeed bad just because of the filming of it. To me, the filming of it, it being first person and from the people who are the victims of the disaster, really is what made the movie and really brought realism to the movie.<br/><br/>Not only was the movie uniquely filmed, but it also was very realistic. I know it's hard to say that a monster attacking a city is realistic, but it is quite realistic acting, and the whole storyline behind it is realistic.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie and would recommend it to anyone who would be able to stand the consistent waving and moving of the camera. The movie takes a lot of attention to actually ""get"" it, which is why some may not like the movie due to the fact that they don't actually get it (Why it happened, where the monster came from, etc...).<br/><br/>Anyways, if you go see it, go with an open mind, and make sure you pay attention to every little detail."

","I used to be an elitist sort of movie watcher, turning my nose up at any sort of cinema deemed too base, or unsophisticated. I've changed this philosophy of late, and come to appreciate that our going to the movies is no different than Romans going to watch a gladiator being disemboweled. Movies are about the thrill of being alive, and no movie yet has better embodied this notion than Cloverfield.<br/><br/>The hand-held camera work created a highly intimate experience, as did the characters and their simpleton problems. The party scene at the beginning was a highly effective mechanism of including you the viewer as a partaker in the drama to follow; you enter an inviting scene and meet new people and just when you're involved, BAM. It really grounded this rapturous film, and made you understand what real urban warfare is like.<br/><br/>Watching Cloverfeild, -I- was nearly shot, -I- stood atop a crumbling skyscraper as jets flew overhead and -I- ran for my life.<br/><br/>I left the theater trembling, and the trembling didn't stop for an hour. It's a movie about thrills, the thrill of being alive and trying to stay alive. If you like adrenaline, Cloverfield gets you quite a lot of bang for your buck. I'd recommend this high to anyone:) Do try to see it in theaters!"

If you complain about the camera angles and walk out of the movie then you will miss one of the better movies you might see. The plot seems really random but it is actually very good. You think at the beginning, man this is so strange but as the movie goes along you actually find it to be entertaining and it makes you think about what you would do if that event actually happened.Overall the movie is very good and one of the better ones i have seen in a long time.

There was no build up and the first time you saw Cloverfield's face, I literally screamed.<br/><br/>I want more movies like this. I don't care how many potholes you can find in it, I believed it.

"CMBlighting","9","1","5","25 January 2008"," Something new in a time of remakes and unoriginality
","In a time where remaking of an already successful movie seems to be the trend, A time when anything new is seen as a possible risk and the success of such films cannot be certain(to producers etc.) Cloverfield steps of genre boundaries with a ""mockumentary"" style with a first person point of view. Cloverfield takes this ""Giant Monster attacks the city"" to a whole new level. Godzilla like films usually take on a third person view, mainly focusing on a simple love but mainly on what military action is being taken to destroy the creature. Cloverfield explores the events on a personal level, the film is the story of a group of friends reacting the best way they can to an unbelievable situation. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone, go out and see something thats entertaining, something new that allows active participation from the audience.<br/><br/>For those people who have problems with some elements in the film. The cynical people who complain about everything that is wrong with this movie and other movies, I have a suggestion for you, Don't waste your money going to movies anymore. If someone were to make a movie in which every element was real and believable, they would be sacrificing the entertainment aspect of the movie, the reason people go see movies. You are watching a fiction film. Everyone who sees the film knows its not real. For the cynics out there I challenge you to direct and produce a film, it's not easy, maybe you should take your place, which is in the seat, shut your mouths, and enjoy a film that someone has obviously put their heart and soul into."
"pressboard","10","1","5","25 January 2008"," This was extraordinary - the comments even more so
","I thought the reviews for I Am Legend were split - but the comments on Cloverfield are even farther apart - and reading the Hated It posts I cannot comprehend. This movie was fairly simple in concept - Monster attacks Manhattan. It was similar to Blair Witch Project - they both use a Hand Held Camera(s). But the similarities to Blair Witch and Godzilla end there. To begin with - most stories/plots have been done before in other movies. What makes most movies unique is the WAY the movie is done - not the storyline. The Hand Held camera may not be a new technique, but it is used to incredible effect in Cloverfield. You get to know the characters at a party in the beginning of the film and so you care what happens to them (or not). An atmosphere of tension and suspense is effectively created and makes this a Horror movie more than an Action movie - and an extremely good Horror movie. You catch glimpses of the creature until the entire creature is exposed - which usually defuses tension, but not in this case - if anything it ramps up the suspense. As some reviews have indicated - as many people laughed in the theater as gasped. There are visual surprises and shocks, all of which, are effective. I give Kudos to JJ - this is definitely a masterpiece. Heads-UP! - do not go drunk, the Hand Held Camera will make you throw up - as one guy did - profusely. Highly recommended - Enjoy!"
"jaxx-11","8","1","5","24 January 2008"," It does the trick. Big time.
","Just a little note on the ""Shaky camera comments"". In this movie YOU are on the run with these people. Not like in for instance Godzilla, where you are in your seat watching the movie. You are running, you are scared and you are liking/disliking people you are with. Thanx to the cam moving around you all the time it feels like you are with those people. I think Abrams did a good job NOT to make this yet another US boring CGI movie. This is different. This is the real thing. Could almost be European! OK, so don't choose the first 5 or 6 rows in your theater... I agree to that! But surely this is a movie to be seen on the big screen, with those nasty scary sounds putting chills on your back!"
"Renee_meel","7","1","5","24 January 2008"," If you're looking for a great movie, keep looking. Just appreciate it for what it does offer.
","I've never been a fan of JJ Abrams. Alias and Lost are both quite ridiculous, unfulfilling, pretentious and huge carrot-on-a-stick shows that have you keep on watching in the hope of finally ever making some real sense of it all, but that moment never really comes.<br/><br/>Anyway: People keep ripping Cloverfield for the ""homevideo gimmick"" that Cloverfield ""stole"" from Blair Witch for the sake of trying to be original. Who cares? It's just a technique a moviemaker can use to strengthen a certain feel. Most paintings are done in oil-paint, but sometimes a painting works better using acrylic paint or even crayons. It's all about what you are trying to achieve. And yes, the entire movie is filmed this way and sometimes you want to shoot the guy filming in the head for not pointing the camera where you want it to look and sometimes you do get a bit motion sick. But it didn't bother me really. Just that the shaking and pointing at the floor was a little over the top at certain times and could have been toned down for the sake of the viewer without sacrificing realism.<br/><br/>You can skip the entire first 18 minutes of the movie since nothing happens. It is supposed to set us up for the shock of when all hell breaks loose and enforce the feeling of realism of witnessing everyday life etc etc, but it's drawn out way to long and nothing interesting happens. 10 minutes max would have been really sufficient, or at least making this introduction more interesting and lively. It didn't even add much to the characters.<br/><br/>There is no obvious story during the entire movie, but what went on was entertaining enough, at least for me. The characters weren't fan-shrine material, but they did the job of pulling us along. Although, I didn't really care much about most of em. The guy holding the cam was funny and interesting and so was the first girl to get killed sadly.<br/><br/>The acting was..somewhat inconsistent. Some parts felt really good and natural, and other parts just made me sort of roll my eyes. (especially when certain people are hurt, they seem to be packing the magic Hollywood morphine which makes them ignore all pain and keep on flirting and laughing etc) It wasn't Oscar material tho.<br/><br/>The action, when it finally starts, is decent. Explosions, panic, soldiers fighting everywhere, people running for their life and loud noises. If you managed to stay awake past the 1st 18 minutes you will be on the edge of your seat for the most part. The CG and effects were very good and looked very real, but this is 2008 after all.<br/><br/>Now, the monster, the thing which all the hype is about. To me, the monster was a very big disappointment. It wasn't very scary or interesting. Not even when it flashes by in the background when our ""heroes"" are running across the street does it really cause any real scares. It simply wasn't terrifying, neither in looks nor in how it acted. It looked quite silly IMHO. The scenes with the monster also felt very secondary. It didn't feel all that present during the entire movie and as such killed a lot of the suspense, urgency, danger and claustrophobia.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good movie and a breath of fresh air in many regards. But be warned, pretty much nothing is explained. You don't know anything about the monster, what happened to certain people, what happened to Manhatten, nothing! There is no real beginning nor an ending here. All it is, is a hour and a half (not counting the snooze worthy start) of being thrown into a ride of panic and apocalyptic visuals. It's more of an experience then a story.<br/><br/>Many people really hate Cloverfield and I can understand them. If you go in expecting a real suspenseful action or monster movie, you will be disappointed because of the lack of any real storytelling or closure. I also hated the fact that there was no real ""ending"" but I liked the rest of the movie for what it was.<br/><br/>7/10 for me. 7 because it is not super duper great, but it still stands above average."

I wouldn't sit anywhere near the first couple of rows in the theater, but anywhere else and you shouldn't get sick a bit.<br/><br/>all for all, I can already tell Cloverfield will be one of my top movies of the year and recommend it to anyone who isn't bothered about not always knowing whats going on.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 baby!"

","I went with a group of 12 people to see this movie, and only 1 of them didn't like it because he didn't understand how the movie was set up, and another one of them got motion sickness. First off, the movie was made to be more of a documentary of what the characters would really do if a monster attacked NY. Second, the plot isn't supposed to develop like other movies such as Momento, or Donnie Darko, the movie is supposed to fill in what would actually happen. There is no scientist that knows exactly what is going on and knows how to stop this creature. Even then people are still mad that the plot is poor. The plot is great if you understand it correctly. The movie isn't made for you to just be watching the movie, the movie is made so that you feel like you are filming the characters with the handy-cam, and J.J Abrams does a great job of doing that. He makes the movie seem realistic and that is the perspective you have to watch the movie in. That you are with the characters, and this creature attacks, and you have no idea what is going on."

","Keeping this comment as short as possible, ""Cloverfield"" had the unfortunate pleasure of falling victim to the hype . I saw this movie opening night with a group of buddies and not one of us loved it, and only a couple of us even liked it a little. This is not to say the movie is awful, but given the amount of buzz about this movie, there is no way it could deliver....and it doesn't. It's only 84 minutes but feels like 3 hours with all the awful camera work (which will realistically leave you nauseated) and the empty dialog and pointless character development. Most of the downtime is full of empty, dull, boring dialog which is the first sign of bad screen writing. The parts that are meant to be thrilling deliver well enough but most of the movie is spent watching a video camera record the ground of various NY locales. Not to mention, the whole bit with the Starship trooper B list monsters biting people and causing their chests to explode was a bit unnecessary and kinda detracted from everything else. On the whole, I did not like this movie. It did somethings well enough but on the whole it was an experience I don't want to repeat. It hurt to watch and the monster is hardly part of the movie. While it was an interesting and, dare I say, good idea, ""Cloverfield"" fails to deliver."

I am sure that I were in the same situation, I would have dropped the video camera at the start of the attack. But I was able to look past that, much like other problems other posters have mentioned. I felt that the base story was solid, the action intense and the monster itself terrifying. Many complain that it only receives a mere 90 seconds of screen time. But, for me, that adds to the action. You are never desensitized to it. It frightens every time.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film based on one simple fact; I had fun. I was not preached to.

"I_am_Jacks_Revenge","7","1","5","21 January 2008"," Good movie, but a bit dizzying
","I would like to say that I wasn't particularly super-hyped to see it. Sure, a movie looks okay, but that doesn't necessarily mean I want to see it. Anyway, my friend talked me into it, and it wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>A vague description:<br/><br/>So, in New York City, this guy, Rob, is filming in the morning with his friend Beth, who he had slept with the previous night, so it seems. Later on in the movie, a bunch of people are setting up a surprise going-away party for their friend Rob, who's going to Japan. They have the party, but soon Beth comes with a date. It's not Rob. Lily tells Jason, Rob's brother, and Hud, Rob's best friend, that Rob and Beth slept together. Soon the word gets around, thanks to Hud. Beth leaves with her date. All of a sudden, an explosion occurs, taking the power out for a short bit. Just about everyone goes to find out what happened. They realize that it's a monster attacking the city.<br/><br/>Continuing on, Marlena, a woman from the party who Hud seems to like, comes from outside where she says she saw the monster eating people. I don't like that thought. The Statue of Liberty's head gets decapitated and lands where our main characters are, of course. What happens next goes throughout the city, where one by one, the people die. One of the people's future is uncertain, because you don't know what happens to them, but that's all I'll tell.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie is that it used unknowns in the lead roles, so it seemed more convincing, because why use Will Smith in a movie where he obviously would die when he's not really dead? This movie is sort of like The Blair Witch Project, which I haven't seen. It's all hand-held camera, and it feels like you're part of the movie. However, we know for sure that it's fake--unlike what some people thought about Blair Witch--because it's in New York. HOW MANY TIMES HAS NEW YORK BEEN DESTROYED IN MOVIES??!!! King Kong, Godzilla, Farenheit 9/11......well, the last one had actual footage, and it's a documentary.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about this movie was that the movement of the camera was shaking a lot. I felt pretty dizzy, but that also could've been because I ate a granola bar, a piece of pizza, and a bottle of pop. Also, if the setting were in the middle of nowhere, like Blair Witch, it could have been more convincing in my eyes, but New York has just been used too many times, and they should set it somewhere else. Another thing, although it's pretty cliché, I like the 'somebody lives' ending. I have never liked the whole 'Everybody Dies' ending. Even though Cloverfield went against what everyone expects and did well on it, I am a sucker for the ending where there's hopes for our hero(es).<br/><br/>Anyway, although I don't recommend it that much, it's an okey-dokey movie for me."

While a bunch of unlikeable twenty something's are celebrating a friend's career move to Japan, disaster strikes New York City. Pandemonium breaks out as the Statue of Liberty's head crashes onto the street and buildings burn and topple 9-11-style. A small bunch of party goers tries making their way across town to rescue a hot, bland babe trapped in a semi-demolished building. Is there nothing guys won't do for pussy? The cause of the commotion is an impressive looking lizard that could be the offspring of the creature in ""The Host"". This slippery critter is pig biting mad at something and is rampaging around Manhattan like it's Legoland. The film's special effects are dazzling and the monster is pretty damn excellent. There are some harrowing scenes of destruction (the collapse of the Brooklyn Bridge, for example) and some flawless, nightmarish imagery involving spider-like critters (ala ""Starship Troopers"") that fall like flakes of dandruff from the big lizard. Unfortunately, the main characters are either arrogant asses, bitches, or embarrassing dorks. Why the writers thought they had to populate their movie with such distasteful people is anybody's guess because you just don't care when they die. The film is recommended with reservations."

The movie starts out with actual realism to playing home video: really cool to me...After the camera is rolling about Robs personal life the monster finally attacks after his surprise going away party. His friend, Beth, whom had a sexual relationship with him weeks earlier is now trapped in midtown and is in need of rescue. During the movie I thought that their was no storyline but that the basis of the movie was for closure, more of a regret that Rob needed to say *I love you Beth* (At the end this makes perfect sense.) Well after they rescue her the monster crashes their helicopter that is taking them out of the city and they do die, but at the very end get to say,""I love You"" which was really what he wanted to do(Rob) Back to the realism of the whole movie: if a disaster was following a video recording on a home video of a group of people their would be now story line and no background to what it is or why is it happening...The realism of the movie is spectacular*gratz for director* because their was no music no huge orchestra to outline a foreshadowing event.The movie was dazzling and all in pieces when I left but made more than real sense when I put the pieces together!!!! 8.5/10!!!

Have they never seen ""Ernest Scared Stupid""? I think that a lot of people say they didn't like it because they didn't like the style it was filmed in. It's not traditional film-making and the story does not unfold with a traditional beginning, middle and end. I also think that today's audiences are expecting Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger to swoop in at the end and take care of the monster.<br/><br/>Yes, the camera is shaky, but that is precisely the point!!!

"Zachman3001","8","1","5","21 January 2008"," Puts you in the driver's seat
","When I first went to see Cloverfield I was skeptical about the movie. A monster attacks Manhattan and tears off the Statue of Liberty's head, seemed like a normal monster movie plot. When I went to see it, however, I was thoroughly impressed. The movie is shot as from a hand-held camera, yet another part of the movie I was originally skeptical about, which ends up working out brilliantly. Usually when you see a bunch of people running through streets you still know what is going on, but with this style of filming you are actually in the street. You can't tell what is going on any more than the characters in the film.<br/><br/>The acting I thought was great. It seemed as if the actors were really into their roles. When Manhattan was first attacked, everyone's reaction was perfect. The fear that you could see in people's faces was very realistic.<br/><br/>The ending I did not like at first. It seemed that it just cut off and that was it. After I thought about it though, the ending worked out really well. It fit perfectly with the style this movie was trying to achieve.<br/><br/>The only complaints that I have about this movie are that some of it was predictable, like in the subway tunnels, and that sometimes they would leave the camera tilted one way, even if someone was still holding it. I felt that when they did this, people were focused more on trying to figure out what they were seeing rather than what was going on in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was really good and very entertaining. I would suggest to anyone that you see this movie in theater as that just adds to the fear that the characters go through."

","For what it is I really like the movie but there were lots of things that truly unbelievable.<br/><br/>1- Why would all the main characters survive a helicopter crash, which killed the pilot and copilot, and just get up and keep running? 2-The above can be applied to Rob's girlfriend whom had a metal object stuck on her torso only to run like a gazelle once she got back on the street? 3- At the end, how come the monster only saw , and attacked HUD when Rob and his girlfriend were a few steps in front of HUD. Also notice, that after HUD falls down, the monster takes one step and we see Rob and friend yelling to HUD to wake up or something like that. Obviously the monster is stil there yet somehow he ignored this 2.<br/><br/>If you can make sense of these plot holes then you can digest this movie.<br/><br/>I DID! :)"
"gallae","8","1","5","21 January 2008"," Clever reworking of Godzilla Theme
","First up, it's pretty clear from the trailer that this is a MONSTER flick. It's also clear from that trailer that part of the ""gimmick"" for this film is in not seeing that monster (or monsters) clearly. That being the case, I'm not going to reveal (even if I could) what it is here. Rather, I want to explain why I like the film.<br/><br/>First up, probably like everybody else, I've watched heaps of ""monster destroys lots of stuff and kills many people and is then put down"" films, like Godzilla, Gamera, Aliens vs Predator: Requiem and so on. I also have a history of playing games about this, like The Creature that ate Sheyboygan, Crush Crumble and Chomp!, and Crush! I get into the scenario.<br/><br/>Trouble is that most of these films are now largely clichés, repeating variations on set pieces from previous films. In fact that was one of problems with Aliens vs Predator - you could predict mostly who was going to survive (male lead, brother and good girl), and who was going to be a victim (flirty girl, bullies, etc). The director of that film followed pre established methods of establishing a scene and then dropping a monster in it - you could tell something was going to happen by the music alone.<br/><br/>You tend not to get either in this film. Who survives and who doesn't is unpredictable, just as who the main characters are shifts during the film. The fiction behind this is that the whole film is an amateur video recording done by someone who was originally going to document a wedding. That means several things:<br/><br/>(1) no background music other than what's playing in the scene (radio/tv), so no audio cues to oncoming events; <br/><br/>(2) constant camera movements, refocus, and deliberate bad exposure, which looks very realistic (as do any special effects); <br/><br/>(3) cuts from one scene to another come from switching that camera off and on, which means that scene change comes about because the camera person thought it'd be interesting; <br/><br/>(4) the ""cameraman"" (who changes from time to time) is also a character in the film, and narration tends to be their comments on events (and the the responses from their companions), thus we start to fully identify with the characters in the situation - they are all flawed, all human.<br/><br/>Even though I knew this was all technique, it was very compelling and felt immersed in the situation. This is not a film like the 1998 Godzilla remake - where the audience sees multiple viewpoints - in this we see a single viewpoint - that of the camera, and everything seems much more personal because of that.<br/><br/>So, I liked the film. It scared me a lot, though I suspect that unlike Alien, I would find this a hard film to watch twice.<br/><br/>Also, and this was an odd thing - for most of the film I was intrigued about whether or not the character Lily Ford was played by Charisma Carpenter. In fact she was played by Jessica Lucas, but the resemblance (especially the voice) is uncanny."

","Upon seeing the TV spot for Cloverfield, my first immediate thought was, damn, not another Godzilla movie. My friend dragged me to watch it, and i was pleased that he did. Cloverfield was intense and original, with the whole film shot in a first person view. Instead of the normal bombing of huge monsters, that we often see in other shows, Cloverfield gives us an offering of the feel of being IN the movie, experiencing the fear and excitement. The actors were all pretty decent too, and there wasn't a moment of boredom in the show, even before the appearance of the movie. Fantastically scripted and shot, the best movie I have personally watched these few months, and i very much hope there is a sequel.<br/><br/>9/10"
"DrStrangeFate","Null","1","5","20 January 2008"," Good... but not THAT good.
","After seeing Cloverfield, I have to wonder if this movie is popular because it is a really that good of a movie or because it's been a while since Hollywood has been able to produce a movie this creative and unique. I believe it is more the latter than the former. Besides the hand-held camera effect, I think the real appeal of this movie lies in it's ability to lull you into a state of vulnerability... meaning that there are these intense action sequences then nothing.. and the nothing goes on to the point where you know something is going to happen but are worn down so much by the time it finally does happen that you are genuinely startled. It's a neat trick and I think a lot of people like that sort of thing but as for me, I find it a bit irritating at times.<br/><br/>The acting was actually very good and the special effects were also very well done... pretty much what we expect from Hollywood these days. The story is very basic and ultimately in my opinion is pointless. I left the theater fairly entertained but had I not gone, I don't feel I would have really missed anything. I know there have been many comparisons to this and Blair Witch, many people saying this is a better movie and it probably is... today, however after all the Blair Witch hype was over you ended up with a so-so movie that tips the IMDb meter at a mere 6.1 today but when it came out, it was THE movie to see.. kinda like Cloverfield.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a good movie but for me it's a case of style over substance and a movie I will probably forget about by tomorrow morning."

","The question is posed: 'where to begin?' With the legendary film Cloverfield, there are more peas than can possibly fit in the pod, yet it is essential that the cat stay in the bag with regards to the electrifying, life-changing finale which is sure to leave the whole theatre standing in ovation and re-evaluating their purpose on this fragile home we call planet earth. The movie starts with bang- literally. The scene is set with a hilarious party scene, which is sooo funny that you will forget that you came to see a horror movie- reality check!! Before you know it, the movie is descending down a path so dark that you will not be able to see anything, except maybe a terrifying glimpse of the next great threat to national security (which may be lurking just outside in your terrible; mink-lined; 62 degree; heavily chlorinated, yet still algae infested above ground pool that you just had installed).<br/><br/>Fortunately, the movie is not derailed from the path to salvation in the depths of this murky abyss. ALL of the characters (particularly the luvable bumbler Hud, played by the dark horse actor Robert Lauzier) in the movie serve as shining beacons of hope, carrying the audience through a time of uncertainty in a tragic event that could very well strike our dear nation at any waking moment- or a sleeping one for that matter!!! There is no need to worry if you have no imagination, because the special effects were suspiciously realistic, leaving the shivering movie-goer wondering how Paramount could keep the metaphorical old man from his glasses for so long...<br/><br/>Through Beth and Rob's invincible, heterosexual relationship, the movie silently screams the subliminal message that straight love rules all!!! And subtly issues a staunch warning to all those so-called liberals who would force such atrocities as gay marriage and abortion upon us.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you should not see this movie. As a movie connoisseur, the proverbial bar has been raised to the gates of Heaven- and Jesus approves!!! So if you want to reserve your spot beside the big man himself, go see Cloverfield today!!!!"

I was on the edge of my seat the entire time while falling back at the funny parts and believe me there are lots of those. The audio was amazing the best i have ever heard, the visuals were the best i have ever seen even better then transformers, thru the whole movie i never once said ""oh thats so CGI"" and that is because it just looked so damn cool. On that note the monster was so bad a** i have never seen anything that cool before. And the ending was awesome, the more i think about it the better it gets. I wish IMDb could let you rate movies 100/10 because thats what this movie deserves.<br/><br/>The good well i will have to say that everything is excellent i wouldn't change a thing The bad this column is empty Overall this movie is the best i have ever seen and is so worth going out and watching.

"jgibbon08","8","1","5","20 January 2008"," Entertaining, tense thriller
","When I saw the first Cloverfield trailer during Transformers, I was in awe. It was unlike any trailer I had ever seen before, having no title, been shot with a hand-held digital camera, and having zero recognizable stars. I ran home after the movie to find out more about the film. For six months, me and millions of other moviegoers turned the internet upside down looking for answers, getting only random inexplicable photos on 1-18-08.com and fake additional trailers. And on January 18th, our prayers were answered, and we flocked to our nearest movie theater to end our guesses and speculation.<br/><br/>It's difficult to imagine anything being worth the wait. No film could have surpassed the excitement of a clip of a massive explosion in the middle of New York, and the statue of liberty's head being hurled at unsuspecting citizens. But if you can lower your expectations slightly and keep in mind that it will not change cinema, you will find that ""Cloverfield"" is quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>The first fifteen or so minutes of the film introduce our heroes, who are throwing a good-bye party for their friend Rob Hawkins, who is moving to Japan for a job. The subplot is set up at the party, conveniently all within earshot of the cameraman, who has been told to ""document"" the night. This opening is just short enough and has just enough humor to keep the viewer from shouting at the screen to demand that the monster appear.<br/><br/>And soon enough, the monster comes with full force. Like you all have seen in the trailer, it begins its tirade by setting off an explosion in downtown Manhattan and tearing off the head of the statue of liberty. To make matters worse, the larger monster is accompanied by smaller monsters, which are also hostile and deadly. For the next hour, our heroes travel through the streets and underground tunnels to find a missing friend and get to safety.<br/><br/>The characters of the film are not particularly deep, and there is hardly any development. But there's just enough to make the viewer care about them, and hope that they can all escape safely. The film is shot entirely by a hand-held camera, much like in ""The Blair Witch Project"", which at times can make the shots seem quite shaky. Though I did not experience this, a common complaint about ""Cloverfield"" is that you feel dizzy at times. But the cameraman manages to hold the camera steady for the parts that matter, especially those that are heavy on the special effects.<br/><br/>What is most remarkable about ""Cloverfield"" is the budget. For just $25 million, we get to see special effects that are comparable to those of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Godzilla"", both of which had budgets of at least 5 times that of ""Cloverfield"". The setting looks like New York, and the explosions look real. It would not have been surprising to hear the budget costing as much as $150 million. I guess it goes to show you that well-known actors and large production teams really can jack up the price.<br/><br/>The film runs quite short, a crisp 84 minutes. The viewer will most likely be left with a desire for more. But there's an old saying, and that's take what you can get, and what you get is a very entertaining show."
"LemonyShepard","10","1","5","20 January 2008"," A revolution in film making. Pure genius.
","I remember way back when, sitting in the third row from an enormous screen with all of my friends, about to watch the midnight showing of an epic movie called Transformers. I remember wanting to skip through all of the stupid and ridiculously pointless previews as to see my favorite Autobots duke it out with the vicious Decepticons in 3D. I also remember a trailer that became more infamous than Transformers itself: the highly mysterious 1-18-08 trailer.<br/><br/>Nobody knew anything about it. There was some teenager leaving town and the Statue of Liberty got decapitated bysomething. I remember everyone in my theatre gasping and whispering ""What was that?"" to each other when the trailer ended without a title.<br/><br/>So, while Bumblebee was battling Barricade in the all-out brawl of the century, I was pondering one thing: just what was 1-18-08? After only a few days of Transformers being in theatres, the buzz was everywhere of this strange, mysterious movie. What was it? Who was starring in it? Was it going to be all hand-held cameras? However, there was no doubt in everyone's minds: the trailer was brilliant.<br/><br/>As opening day for the newly-titled Cloverfield rapidly approached, everyone's thoughts were joined again with one simple question: can the movie live up to the trailer? The answer: No, it didn't live up to the trailer.<br/><br/>It surpassed it and never looked back.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is as real as it gets, folks. The very beginning of the movie shows a video tape menu of sorts, almost as if the tape was rewinding. Then it shows footage of our main character, Rob, and his girlfriend, Beth. However, the feel-good footage is soon recorded over with our main story, like it was a real video tape.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes are simply hilarious, simply because it's undeniably realistic. It's as if you're watching some real footage of a couple of college kids who recorded a party with their camera, only it's on a big screen. You really can't help but laugh.<br/><br/>However, the party is soon interrupted by a large earthquake caused by somethingsomething bad. And huge. And terrifying.<br/><br/>You never actually see the Cloverfield monster in full until a good twenty minutes into the movie, and even then it's somewhat blurry. That hardly matters, though, because the hand-held camera look makes each and every special effect in this movie look 100% real. So, seeing a large claw/foot/tail/etc is horrifying.<br/><br/>The footage (I can't bring myself to call this a movie; it's far too entertaining and real) is shocking, scary, and sometimes disturbingly realistic. You'll be on the edge of your seat so much, not because it's so action packed, but because you feel as if you're watching real people on the screen and you want to root for them.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good, the dialogue obviously phenomenal, making all of the lines seem incredibly modern-day ""what would this teenager say if the monster just killed his friend?"" sorta thing. That just adds to the intensity of the footage.<br/><br/>There are so many twists and turns in the movie, so many shocking moments, and so many different encounters with the monster. But what makes this movie stand out from other monster movies is that it focuses on a group of nobodies. It doesn't focus on the military or a nerdy scientist who can defeat the monster. No, it focuses on a group of teenagers who have no clue what's going on. It deals with the fear of the unknown and the chaos surrounding them. The best part of the film is that it doesn't go into any detail as to what the monster is or where it came from. Which is good, because the teens recording the tape wouldn't know anyway. You see what they see.<br/><br/>The footage is about 80 minutes (the standard length of an actually video camera cassette tape) and each and every second of it is breathtaking. The monster isn't what scary, it's the intensity of the realism that's scary. Think United 93 (phenomenal movie) with monsters instead of terrorists. That's the gist.<br/><br/>Revolutionizing. Not only to the monster genre, but to movies altogether."
"nebuzad","9","1","5","20 January 2008"," Great take on Monster Movies and really tugs at your memories.
","So, with the huge cloud of confusion flowing around the title Cloverfield, I will not try and dissipate the cloud by ruining anything.<br/><br/>Cloverfield isn't for everybody, I'll get that out of the way. The filming style is not for everybody and can make some people definitely sick. It didn't do so to me, I suppose I just don't get very motion sick. But if you are the type of guy that enjoys high budget, big name movie star, high production camera, movies then this may not be for you unless you can open your mind. If you stop thinking of the regular monster movie and start thinking this as an ""account"" of a monster attack, you will enjoy the movie greatly.<br/><br/>One thing that still sticks out in my mind right now is the fact that the entire thing had the eerie feeling of the 9/11 attacks. I had goosebumps for a majority of the film just due to the confusion of the party-goers.<br/><br/>And one thing that attributes to the chills is that of the fact there is no big name starts anywhere to be seen. Now, this can be seen from a negative standpoint as them being bad actors/actresses. But overall the performances were great and full of emotion. Ranging from Sadness, Laughter (the movie is quiet funny, but not goofy or a parody, which is nice.), anger, suspense, and utter horror.<br/><br/>Leave your definition of what a monster movie is at the door and you will have to keep picking your jaw off the ground.<br/><br/>Overall- 9/10"
"DemonDan","9","1","5","20 January 2008"," Fantastic, adrenalin-pumping, original - WOW!
","My mind & body were still buzzing 12 hours after seeing this film. Not since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has a movie taken me on such a wild ride!<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailer (and if you haven't, you're either dead or in jail) you know the premise: a small group of friends tries to survive when a giant monster attacks their city. The hand-held camera, lack of music, fantastic sound effects and sparse glimpses of the monster only add to the authenticity of the premise. ""Alien"" was the last great movie to successfully increase tension and fear by only briefly showing the creature. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, I also enjoyed the beginning of the film, which set the table for Rob's reasons for trying to save Beth, Hud's crush on Marlena, and Lily & Jason's relationship. I found Hud to be hilarious, and he provided some much needed comedic relief. <br/><br/>Critics who complain about the constantly shaking camera, lack of explanation for the monster, the overwhelming sense of chaos and the resolution, i.e. fate, of each character can't see the forest through the trees (pardon the cliché'). People, there is no better way to portray what the film's about! I compare it to disliking ""Titanic"" because it takes place entirely on a ship, or not liking ""The Sopranos"" because you don't like Italians. No matter how good it is, they won't like it, period. <br/><br/>For those who dislike the film for these reasons (and I heard a couple of dim-wits after the movie saying they hated it), check your calendar for the release date of ""Rambo."" That movie will appeal to movie-goers who like everything nicely explained, black or white and neatly wrapped up. Surely Rambo even kills someone! Go see it! And I'll stop calling you Shirley.<br/><br/>PS - Jessica Lucas, the actress who portrays Lily, is absolutely gorgeous!"
"worldpieceprod","10","1","5","20 January 2008"," Great experience!
","Lately I've been waiting for something different to crawl out of Hollywood for a change. Cloverfield did it. I have to admit that I went into this film rather skeptical, mostly because of its overblown media blitz. That's usually a sure sign of a stinker. It's much easier to make a good PR campaign than it is to make a good movie. This monster film has some notable similarities to The Blair Witch in its approach, but far surpasses that film in intensity and execution. What I liked about this movie is that it used all the usual Hollywood Blockbuster tricks such as CGI and explosive sound, but it remembered to be intense for the viewer and not just 90 minutes of eye candy. Too often these days films are so focused on the special effects that they seem to forget that people are trying to watch a story unfold instead of a series of CGI effects promos strung together like a bunch of Super Bowl commercials . The effects in Cloverfield take a back seat to the reactions of the characters in an apocalyptic scenario. The unknown actors were perfectly cast as over-privileged twenty-somethings, who've had the world handed to them, suddenly faced with a real survival situation. There is a large amount shaky-cam on screen, probably the most I've ever seen. I don't know how this film could have maintained the realism without it though. It was a necessary evil. Most Hollywood action films use the shaky-cam to make up for poor direction. Here it is forgivable because it adds to the atmosphere and realism. People don't typically run for their lives wearing steady cam rigs. Some have complained about the lack of an explanation for what happens in the plot. These monkeys have completely missed the point. Having your imagination fill in the many blanks is what makes this film work so well. For all of those people void of any imagination, I would suggest watching a turd like Gozlilla(1998). There you will have every little detail in the plot spoon fed to you like a 2nd grade geography class. Overall Cloverfield feels more like a terrifying nightmare than an actual movie. It was an incredibly engrossing and engaging experience for me from the opening shot to the final credits. When the last shot played out I realized that I forgot I was in a movie. I can't remember the last time that happened."
"jaddison383","7","1","5","20 January 2008"," An Intense Experience...
","Cloverfield is probably one of the greatest examples of a concept movie ever made. And by that I mean it is a great concept movie as well. It's the story of a giant monster attacking New York City seen through a hand-held camera. We follow a small group of 20-somethings as they try to escape from the horror that is unfolding around them, and we get pretty close to experiencing it with them.<br/><br/>Frenetic, intense scenes is the name of the game here. The hand-held camera is a clever twist that makes this visually exhausting film unique. Even at it's very short length, the film almost runs too long- you feel very tired by the time the credits roll.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams was clever in his use of little to unknown actors, and they all do a good job making it seem pretty natural. The best of these is Lizzy Caplan in a nice supporting turn. The special effects are all fantastic and extremely believable and SCARY, another plus to this film. Most of the plot works well, though a romantic side-plot for the lead character feels forced at times. If you want an intense viewing experience (and have a strong stomach), Cloverfield is definitely for you. 7/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"
"sthedgies1","9","1","5","20 January 2008"," An amazing monster movie, but not for everyone.
","I'm just going to start out by saying this, if you want this movie to answer all your questions then you're going to be disappointed. This movie was not meant to give you all the answers; it leaves you to ponder your own explanations, just like the people in the movie. I actually enjoyed the fact that they explained so little because I prefer to come up with and debate my own theories. I also like how the movie ended because I don't think any other ending would have worked. I can understand why others wouldn't like it though, as it is kind of abrupt.<br/><br/>People also complain that the camera was too shaky and that it even made them sick. If you do have a weaker stomach you'll just need to stay a little ways away from the screen and shut your eyes for a few seconds if it gets to erratic for you. I never had this problem and I felt the shakiness of the camera makes you feel more like your in the hectic situations. A steady camera wouldn't make sense if it's being carried by someone who's an amateur and caught in the quakes of the giant monster's steps, explosions, gun fire, or pounce of smaller monsters.<br/><br/>As many have said before the special effects are amazing and I wasn't disappointed in the monster design. I don't see why anyone else would be disappointed by this as you do get to see the monster despite what some have claimed.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie reacted to the crisis, for the most part, like anyone would. Some of their decisions may seem a little iffy, but who can think straight in a situation like that? Overwhelming panic makes most people stupid.<br/><br/>To me the characters talked like normal people, so I don't understand why so many have said the dialogue was crap. Hud especially reminded me of an annoying close friend of mine with his comments, so I found him fairly amusing.<br/><br/>Several people have also mentioned that their quest was stupid and unrealistic, but if someone I deeply cared about was left behind I would go back for them no matter if it seemed suicidal or not. Maybe that's just me though.<br/><br/>Anyway, to sum up go see this movie if you like incredible thrills and won't get upset if you have to think up your own answers for questions that may arise. Don't go into the movie wanting it to go your own way, and simply enjoy it for the crazy ride that it is. I usually don't even like monster movies, but thought this one was great."
"thehousemasta","10","1","5","20 January 2008"," ""What the heck is going on?""
","OK, first off I have some issues with people saying this is a disgrace to America by leeching the ""9/11"" events to this movie. This movie has nothing to do with the 9/11 events, except that a monster attacks Manhattan. J.J. Adams intent was to create an Americanized ""Godzilla"" and NOT to remind us of the events on September 11th. I believe he succeeded. <br/><br/>Yes, the movie isn't entirely perfect - there are some flaws I want to point out and no, not the motion sickness or the ending. I looked back at some of the previous reviews and I wanted to throw up more than at the movies. You probably should have done your research and found out that you needed Dramamine before entering the theater. I knew full well that this could have possibly been like a roller coaster ride, so I prepared by not eating an hour before or during the film.<br/><br/>Secondly, the people who think the ending is a disappointment honestly didn't understand the concept of the movie. The entire thing was a HOME VIDEO by an amateur. Sure, the scenes can be nauseating and sometimes not on the action, but that's the way it is in real life. By doing this, you crave to see what's going on and you feel like you're right there, at the base of the attacks.<br/><br/>OK, with that out of the way, here's my review of the ""soon-to-be-blockbuster"" Cloverfield.<br/><br/>First, the good aspects. The story-line is a very clear perception of what a going-away party would have been like for an average New Yorker. The character's personalities were laid out within the first 15 minutes or so, yet were more fully developed throughout the film. Rob and Beth didn't realize that they loved each other until the very end, but you knew that after Beth called him and he decided to go help her that they did. That is the definition of a true hero, yet they were merely pawns in the aspect of things. <br/><br/>The special effects were what really blew me away. Yes, I saw War of the Worlds and Transformers, where the computer effects were so realistic that you could swear it wasn't a movie; but with the camera work in this film, I have to give the special effects team extra praise. The quick cuts, blurry effects, nighttime scenes, and eventually the monster sightings were done very, very well.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about this film was how real it seemed. There was no ""soundtrack,"" other than the white noise of the surroundings. People were constantly frightened and there was as much swearing (as most of us would be doing) as there could be for PG-13. <br/><br/>OK, here's what I believe to be the negative aspects of the film. For one, I thought the monster was shown too much. The first major scene when you see the creature scream as the crew enters the tunnel should have been the only close-up of its face. But I'm sure there are a million of you who have seen the movie who would disagree and would say that you didn't see enough. Ohhhhh, I saw enough.<br/><br/>Also, how the heck did Beth survive when she had that rod pulled from her chest? The amount of blood she could have lost from that would have depleted her ability to stand, but in the film you see her running down Main Street with everyone else. Please. Marlena also seemed to have suffered more than Beth, but maybe the bite wound carried with it some kind of neuro-toxin, which would have put her into almost an LSD state where she couldn't feel pain.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't understand was why the spawnlings only went after people. The horse that was pulling the empty carriage got away without a scratch and in the subway the rats were not attacked. It was a little cliché that the spawnlings decided to attack once the night vision was on, so that was another thing that ticked me off.<br/><br/>Another thing was the monster attacking the chopper at the end. It just got toppled by missiles and fell to the Manhattan ground, then 10 seconds later jumps up and hits the helicopter. A bit cheesy, but whatever.<br/><br/>OK here's my set of questions which the film did not answer, (but it's fine considering we were shown amateur footage of one group's point of view) 1. Why did the monster decide to attack NYC? 2. What happened to Lily? Did she make it? 3. How did the spawnlings survive the trip and what was their purpose? Were they parasites to the creature or were they with him? *4. How did the footage get recovered? It was under a pile of rubble in the middle of Central Park after the beast was attacked. Who picked it up or even decided to look? The camera couldn't have survived because the filming was stopped and ended so that when you did playback, the Coney Island ending scene was shown.<br/><br/>And finally, the real question that I'm sure all 100% of us who have seen it are going to ask. And no, the question is not 'Did it Die?' but 'Will there be a Cloverfield 2 that shows another viewpoint, and perhaps some intel about where it came from and what eventually happened to it?'<br/><br/>Overall, if you love Monster Movies, have a great inner ear, and want to have your brain teased for an hour and half, then this movie is for you."
"shreder06","9","1","5","19 January 2008"," had the potential to be great but did not quite make it
","Personally i loved 98 minutes of the movie i just did not like the ending. The ending was'nt as good as i expected it to be it leaves you with absolutely no answers about how the monster got there or why is it here or did it even die? However the camera method used in this film was great (although it was a bit shaky) but i loved it, it made it look real. The monster was pretty creative and had its moments but there aren't that many clear shots of the monster. One thing i noticed was that they stole some ideas from Stephen King's The Mist (like the baby monsters) the baby monsters looked really similar to the creatures that attacked the people in The Mist. Overall i think this movie is definitely worth watching although it will leave you with a lot of questions. I think there is going to be a sequel but yet again J.J Abrams is a mysterious person so its going to be a while until someone might be able to tell us that for sure."
"countbrian","8","1","5","19 January 2008"," dizzy but above expectations
","i felt this movie was very good. The personal camera view of the movie gives the viewer a different perspective of the situation. The combination of all the different story lines of the movie coming together made it a very interesting and intriguing movie. I felt very dizzy at times because of the camera shaking, but i felt it made the experience realistic because of the view of what the people filming with an ordinary camera saw, felt, and experienced. all of the confusion surrounding the movie probably inspired interest in a lot of people who wondered about the movie. the mixing story lines between the situation of the characters and the personal lives of the characters made it a very well made movie. overall, an awesome movie that i cant wait to buy when it comes out!"
"r-brasher","10","1","5","19 January 2008"," I Was Not Disappointed
","Before seeing Cloverfield today, I read a few reviews on IMDb; not that that in any way would have influenced whether or not I would have gone to see it. (At the same time, I wish I had read the comments on ""Stinger"" before I plunked down 5 bucks at Blockbuster a few weeks ago-I totally agree with ""IMDb 3972""-getting a tooth pulled or an enema would be preferable, but I digress).<br/><br/>Anyway, for my money, (5.75 for the twilight matinée) Cloverfield is well worth the time. It's not fair to compare it with the overrated ""Blair Witch Project"" or ""Godzilla '98"". The concept of New York being attacked by monsters has been done to death since King Kong paved the way in 1933. Since then, we've seen the city wrecked by giant comets (Deep Impact & Armegeddon) blown up by aliens (Independence Day) briefly invaded by Rodan (Godzilla: Final Wars), and tragically attacked by real life monsters on 9/11-no doubt there are elements of that seen in this movie. The concept may not be original, but the way it was handled by J.J. Abrams is certainly groundbreaking. The whole film is made up from the footage of a hand held video camera found after the events of the film are over. There is no explanation of where the monster came from, the ending is very anti-climactic, which, in my opinion enhances the film.<br/><br/>The design of the monster was handled so well, it's almost impossible to describe-you just have to be there. I guarantee you haven't seen it anywhere else, not even in ""Stephen King's The Mist"".<br/><br/>The special effects are top notch. New York never looked more devastated. This is one bad-ass Kaiju.<br/><br/>It's what ""Godzilla '98"" should have been.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of *****"
"myspiderungoliant","9","1","5","19 January 2008"," The way monster movies were meant to be.
","I had been looking forward to this movie for months. I knew that it was being told from the perspective of a movie camera found after the fact, so I was prepared for a lot of crappy angles and jumpiness ala Blair Witch Project...but I was not expecting to be taken to the edge of my seat and held there for the remainder of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly basic: some friends are gathered at a farewell party for one of their buds who has been offered a high paying job in Japan. The guy gets into an argument with a girl he slept with a month ago and she leaves in a huff. All of a sudden there is a tremor and the power flickers off and on. What then follows is terror and insanity beyond anything that Hollywould has thrown at me for the last 5 years. These people are trying to escape from the city when the central character gets a call from his friend who was injured and he decides to go rescue her.<br/><br/>I will not make any attempt to describe what this creature looks like except this: if a mountain could be said to walk or stumble. It follows no body pattern that I can say belongs to one particular type of organism. Cthulhu of the Lovecraft mythos could not have been as huge, intense, or as insane as this beast. Absolutely NOTHING the army does to it seems to affect it in the slightest.<br/><br/>This film does not tie up any loose ends, and to me that is a good thing. As with the Blair Witch Project its what you Don't see that makes this film. Most (if not all) of the loose ends are not tied up. If you absolutely must know what this creature was or if it was finally stopped, sorry but you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>All in all this was an excellent film for what it is: a fast paced odyssey of pure destruction and chaos that, while it may not have great acting or much of a plot, will grab you and hold you in your seat...until it shakes the life out of you and swallows you whole that is."
"beckless1888","Null","1","5","19 January 2008"," It's a smash.
","I just saw this flick tonight. As we were exiting the theater, I looked around at some of the other audience members. Some looked thrilled, others were visibly shaken, some sea-sick, and a few unhappy. I have to say, I was all of those except the last one.<br/><br/>It was a great film. It's one of those movies that HAD to be made...and it was a darn good one too. Yes, if you haven't already heard, it is done by a handy-cam or a video camera. Personally, I think that type of filming is great and we need more of it in the movie biz. There is just something about a character being able to look at the camera and emote honestly what their feelings are. You can't get that type of acting on Desperate Housewives, folks. I will say, there are a few shows (dare I say sitcom/comedy) that have taken a chance on that ""one on one"" kind of acting/filming. The Office ""mockumentary""(whether you like it or not) has that down to earth, get to the chase, tell me what the heck is happening feel to it when someone sits down to speak their peace. JJ has done a wonderful job putting that same type of writing/acting/filming into Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Without giving away too much of the plot, I will say the beginning mirrors the end perfectly (also think about the times at the beginning and right before the end, where Rob turns the camera directly to his face...the times are chillingly brilliant and a nice touch to the story), right before the end. If you pay attention closely, you'll notice a few story lines carried all the way to the final shot, which is comforting, yet leaves that gnawing feeling in the pit of your stomach.<br/><br/>It is a love story. It is a thriller. It is a monster movie. Heck, it's definitely a drama. Plus, a comedy. It's so many things, it would be hard to classify. That's probably why we never got much out of the trailer before its release.<br/><br/>Speaking of the comedy- Yes, there are several laugh out loud moments. The cameraman, Hud, is a great narrator for this very dramatic and life-changing moment in time. He's witty, annoying, loud, and probably the best person you'd want to spend in a terrifying crisis like this. My favorite Hud moment? Definitely the flaming homeless people theory. He's right, after all.<br/><br/>I give it a 9, just because I walked out of the theater a little woozy and sea sick. Regardless, it was magnificent and I wish more writers, producers, directors, and studio execs would take a page from JJ Abrams and just think outside the box on occasion. It could turn out to be a smash, just like Cloverfield."
"DVLefferts","8","1","5","19 January 2008"," A destruction movie with the purest intentions
","There's been a lot of talk going around that Cloverfield is a creature feature that tries, and fails, to put a humanistic face on the experience of destruction. But Cloverfield, which is filmed entirely with a hand-held camera operated by several of the main actors, does not need to be a humanistic; it's just human. With its characters' almost total lack of information, its sensory limitations, and its shortness, Cloverfield presents a truly real view of destruction. We cannot see everything, can see almost nothing, and that is where the horrific truth lies. Its success lies in its ability to capture how weak humans are in the face of terror, how insignificant and cursory our sufferings.<br/><br/>No, the acting isn't terrific; no, the writing isn't even close to original; no, not all the plot points click together just so. But what is clear here, and what lasts and lingers and is remembered, is the producer's and director's deep affection for monstrosity, for fear, for buildings falling down and people being sucked up into abysmal misery. Cloverfield is all at once visceral and clever, shamelessly entertaining and uncompromisingly scary, emotionally sadistic and wisely comic. Maybe everyone, in the end, does die; but no recent movie has offered as much proof that blood is still pumping through American cinema's veins."

Yes it does once again! The monster is freakin cool, and looks brilliant when it walks past the camera. Its worth the wait.<br/><br/>Cloverfield blew me away, and i really enjoyed it.

"VincentBauer","10","1","5","19 January 2008"," Cloverfield: Exciting and Intense
","All right, I waited 6 months to see this god damn movie, and I finally have seen it. All I can say right now is that I liked it.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a message displaying that the video belongs to the U.S defense department (not like the one in the trailer), and saying that it was found in Central Park. Then we go to Beth's apartment where we see that her and Rob have just had what I'm going to call ""A great night"" for ironic terms. The day is April 20 something and they plan to go to Coney Island because Beth has never been there.All of a sudden it is cut and we go to Jason (Rob's brother) and his girlfriend Liz going to plan his going away party as Rob has just been accepted for a job in Japan (Great line if you only get the reference).<br/><br/>From there they give the camera to Hud (who serves as our comic relief) to film the events in this movie. The whole point of the movie is the characters trying to get to Beth so that they can save her (she's in her apartment bleeding and stuck).<br/><br/>As for the writing, I got to say that even though the lines are corny, they really feel like it's real. The actors are good enough that they almost seem to create themselves. The actors do such a great job that I'm convinced at points that most of it is improved.<br/><br/>I got to say that the movie is pretty intense. It's not SCARY but it's so intense it will have your heart beating.<br/><br/>Now for the part of the review everyone wants to hear. THE MONSTER. Well... yes we do get a look at the monster and it is interesting. I can't really describe it because its so intricate. I do however felt a sense of Deja Vu because I swear I've seen the monster before.<br/><br/>A lot of the people who went with me didn't like the movie however, and I can understand why. The hype was way to over. If you haven't seen the movie, and you do plan to see it, I suggest that you lower your expectations, because even my expectations made this movie half as good as it would have been had I just gone in with pessimism. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Cloverfield 10/10"
"Masmill7","6","1","5","19 January 2008"," Pretty Good and Very Original but Fails on many Levels
","I just saw Clover-field with six of my friends last night and I enjoyed it but I also thought it failed on many levels. Here I'll separate the good from the bad.<br/><br/>Good: The movie was a pure popcorn movie that kept you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The visual and sound effects were amazing for a movie with a very low budget of 35 million dollars, I mean the visual effects looked like they belonged to a movie that coast at least 100 million dollars! This was good and bad for the movie, the camcorder that the entire movie was shot on made it original, something you never saw before. The best part of the camcorder being the only thing that shoots the movie was interesting because all of the camera movements are something we usually do with a camcorders! Also I liked how the camcorder showed the monster only briefly, that made it more realistic. But it also had some negatives that I will explain in the bad. The movie also proved you don't need a amazing story to make a film a good one you just need to be original, and I admire what this film did.<br/><br/>Bad: As I said the camcorder did make the movie more interesting but it also brought the film down, I will explain how. The constant shaking and spinning of the camera made me nauseous and I'm not the only one who thinks that, I think half the country does! Some people even threw up! The thing that annoyed me the most about this movie was the ending, IT WAS PROBABLY THE WORST ENDING IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIES! I don't even get what happened at the end it was such a bad ending. The main characters died in the end and it was sad which made the ending worse. <br/><br/>So anyway this movie was good and bad on many levels but overall it was good and I think it will do very good in the box office."

","This film left me saying Oh My God close to 100 times. I literally was shaking in my seat watching the entire thing. I don't know if this is a spoiler or not but it does show the monster and it is incredible. I'm not going to give you too many details but i can say this: Cloverfield is the most intense movie i have ever seen in my entire life. I loved every minute of it, it's so action packed and thrilling at the same time. There is almost always something big happening in this movie and it is so believable. The only negative thing i can say about this movie is that it wasn't longer! It was literally the most thrilling experience i've ever had in a movie theater. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 because well, I LOVED IT! I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves thrills, chills, excitement, and even humor and romance! The film was so real that i felt like i was actually there, experiencing what the characters were. The camera work is terrible but you have to understand that JJ Abrams wanted to make this as real as possible, and he did it. This movie was unique, incredibly real, and unbelievably good for my tastes. The best movie i've seen since Transformers. See this movie!"
"pazu7","6","1","5","19 January 2008"," Big, fun, loud, adrenaline rush with 3 minor problems (spoilers)
","When I first saw the TV spots for this film I knew I was going to see it. I got the premise: Blair Witch meets Godzilla... or whatever the heck that was. Cool. It was worth staying up for the midnight showing and I had a good time. But I really had to work to get past a few strategic faults. Since this film requires the viewer engage their own imagination to be truly effective, any break in suspension of disbelief sort of kills the moment. I know this is Monday morning quarterbacking, but:<br/><br/>Problem 1. Character Context. Why not make the protags a news crew on assignment or some kids doing an amateur shoot in the street when they get caught up in the attack. It would have made more sense than the going away party scenario and the camera handlers dedication to catching the action would have been more logical. It would have also provided an excuse for more concise narration. They could have still kept the romantic back story, just put it in the context of a film crew. And speaking of back story:<br/><br/>Problem 2. Cumbersome Back Story. Like in Blair Witch this film requires the viewer to participate in the illusion and it can be much more engaging because of that. But when they have to keep developing the romantic back story it strains credulity. Their method was clever, the bits of erased tape etc... and in the conclusion of the film it provided an emotional note. But it was a bit overplayed, gave the protag a frantic Ahab tone, and some of the tension and illusion gets strained during their rescue mission and in it's IMO overplayed conclusion.<br/><br/>Problem 3 The Pay Off Shot. One of the big complaints about Blair Witch is that there was no pay off shot, you never saw whatever was killing everybody. I understand the appeal of the final visual, but IMO that is the mistake here. The monster in your imagination is always worse than the one you see. So the initial chaotic shots we saw of the monster and it's creepy off spring.... or whatever they were... were perfect. Established it's horrific majesty and maintained the illusion that this was actually happening. But then they give the pay off shot right at the end. Bad move IMO. It diminished the beast in my eye and ruined the illusion of reality.<br/><br/>But all that not withstanding, it was still a lot of fun. Major adrenaline. 8 for concept. 6 for execution. Make sure the theater has ample sub woofers for full effect."
"jake-179","7","1","5","19 January 2008"," Great monster movie
","Cloverfield is a good monster movie. That is what it is, and that is all it is. I loved the ""monster movie"" music over the end titles. That was great. Really good track. Obviously, this movie was done in the ""Blair Witch"" style, but with awesome 3D effects. I will mention that at the end of the movie, as the credits began to roll, the audience was definitely disappointed. But that does not reflect my assessment of the movie. I liked it, and it was strange for me to hear the groans of the other patrons. They seemed really angry. So I will say that if you are not a fan of the genre, or if you don't ""get"" what the movie is trying to do, then you will not like it.<br/><br/>But the movie is genuinely entertaining. It has a particularly scary part inside the subway tunnel with the night vision feature of the hand held camcorder. It reminded me of the terrifying sequence in a subway tunnel in ""28 Weeks Later."" I loved it, and I felt that the director did a great job with suspense and action.<br/><br/>The movie is scary, it has great effects, good acting, and a good story line. I think that most people are not going to appreciate the thrill ride like I did. I recommend the movie, but I recommend going into it with an open mind."
"drsterngreene","10","1","5","18 January 2008"," absolutely great! clever, exciting and a cut above the rest
","I thought Cloverfield was so far superior to any ""monster"" movie; American, korean or Japanese that has been made in the past 30 years, it isn't even comparable. Any reviewer that claims that ""the host"" is a better film should, in my opinion, put down his/her reviewing pen permanently.<br/><br/>Cloverfield was filmed brilliantly, edited seamlessly, and executed in a way that draws the viewer in and makes you forget you are watching ""scenes"". And dare I say the acting (for the little there actually was... i mean this isn't ""There will be blood""... ) was great.<br/><br/>I felt all the deliberate visual references to 9-11 were done cleverly and tastefully, and were done to bring home the suggested ""reality"" of the situation and not, as some reviewers said, to exploit our emotional connection to these images. <br/><br/>The characters are not too well drawn, i don't think they should nor needed to be. This is a story about survival in disaster and had he/she been further flushed out his/her relate- ability would have been compromised. The camera man was well drawn (quite quickly) as just quirky enough for his role, as self imposed documentarian, to be totally believable. <br/><br/>The action was fantastic, mind bending and disorienting... I loved every second of it. <br/><br/>I don't want to write any spoilers, so I will end this here, but do yourself a favor and buy into the hype, see Cloverfield. Citizen Kane it's not... but i promise it's a really fun ride!"
"jamhorner","10","1","5","18 January 2008"," Blows Godzilla Out of the Water
","I just want to state before I review this movie, I am a huge Cloverhead and I followed the viral marketing for a little more than half a year and was constantly tormented by Matt Reeves and J.J., however, this movie, with all the hype and intensity that was raved about, delivered one heck of a blow to the ""monster"" genre. In fact, I was so stunned and shocked about the movie and how vastly different it was then what I originally thought it would be. One would to describe this movie would be: WHOA!!!! It was better than Godzilla, better than Them and better than Beast from 10,000 Fathoms and it really lived up to the hype from the Internet. Heck, we all know how incredible and amazing the viral marketing was, so I will bore you with those details.<br/><br/>So lets get to it; first off is the acting, if it weren't for the performances and the emotions that where displayed in this movie, the film would have been really bad and just another cheap monster flick. The acting seemed so real and intense, there some times where you could feel for what the actors and actresses had to go through and there were points were you could cry and say ""Oh my god."" Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas and Michael Stahl-David were all amazing and they really did a fantastic job. Even Mike Vogal and T.J. Miller (Hud) all acted like real people. There were points were I thought I was watching a real account of real people struggling to survive. There performances gave me the chills, they were just really, really good acting.<br/><br/>This is a two-part paragraph highlighting the scares and suspense. For a PG-13, the scares were awesome. I will admit there were points where I jumped out of my seat or I would fly back into my chair, especially in the subway tunnel. The scares were not only creature features or mini-monster attacks, but also the jets the fly by out of nowhere, or the distant rumbles and the roar, the little things. But what makes the scares to prime is also the suspense that is in this movie. Because it is from the POV of a camcorder, held by Hud, you are literally right there when the army attacks the monster or when the monster walks by, you ARE right there and you can practically hear and feel it coming. The explosions, the running, the gunfire, the jets and helicopters are all right in your face it feels like you part of the movie. It was really intense both in a frightening way and in a super suspense way. The way they created NY to look like all heck broke loose was outstanding, the rubble on the floor and the smoke everywhere, however, this movie might get dogged for some scenes that looked really close to the 9/11 aftermath. However, J.J. said that the monster was a metaphor for what our country has faced much like how Godzilla was a metaphor for that Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks.<br/><br/>As for the little things in this movie, they were pretty great also. Hud adds great humor and personality to this film, just when things are starting to get bad and look horrid, he makes some great jokes and his personality is laughable. The whole ""handycam"" feel they went for worked, it was shaky, the iris did flux a bit, it opened up when pointed at a bright object, there were time and dates on some of the footage, there were random cut to the previous day and there were even some fuzziness to the picture. There was a great Spongebob reference in the movie that I loved, considering that the monster came from the ocean. It's little things like this that made the movie all worth watching too, I mean, the scares and the acting fill up the majority of this movie but the little things fill in the nook and crannies of the pie chart.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend that you see this in a theater because the noise, explosions and monster attacks just don't work on home entertainment, for those who are thinking about buying the DVD. Please, see it in the theater because it won't be disappointing, honest it won't. However, there are a few things that I want to add before you see it. STAY TILL THE VERY END OF THE MOVIE, when the credits are done rolling, you'll be amazed by what it heard and be prepared for a slight case of motion sickness. But this is one movie that will blow any other monster movie out of the water."
"blameitonthebeer","4","1","5","18 January 2008"," Very Good, but could have been Great!!!
","First off, I thought this movie was great up until the second it ended. I felt a part of their experience, felt the rush, the panic, the fear. The way it was filmed lent you into falling into idea that this was really happening. It was an awesome movie. But I must say, that ending left me feeling gypped. To avoid any misunderstanding, I didn't disliked the ending. I didn't! I actually thought it was a pretty cool ending. Instead, what I disliked was the fact that it ended so abruptly, with so many unanswered questions.<br/><br/>I mean I get it, they want the whole movie to begin and end with this one video recording. So they couldn't suddenly jump to regular movie style to wrap things up. I understand that. However, at the beginning of the movie it's obvious that the military had obtained the tape, and that it was now part of their evidence of the events. So I mean they had some wiggle room to address the unanswered question. Heck, even something as simple as a military personal speaking directly into the camera, documenting that this is evidence #blah blah blah, of the events that happened on such a time and date, that concluded with the .... whatever. That's just my lame idea of addressing the unanswered questions. I'm sure they could have come up with a creative way of addressing them. In any case, even my lame idea would have been appreciated by this movie goer.<br/><br/>We don't know if they killed the monster(s)? We don't know where it came from? How many were there? If the girl on the first helicopter lived or died? The details of what really happens to the bitten? So on and so forth. I get that we joined them on their journey and so ours ended when theirs ended. But as a movie goer, I want my movie to have an ending that properly concludes everything. This was like ending King Kong movie as he starts his climb of the Empire State Building.<br/><br/>I'm still giving it a 7 as it was a very enjoyable movie to watch. However, like the movie ""Next"", the ending leaves you with a feeling of being unsatisfied. Unlike the movie ""Next"", this movie was really good otherwise."

","I found the movie simply amazing and innovative. Okay, yes there is the basic notion and premise of a monster attacking new york. Been there done that. Now, take in the though process of someone who is there first hand. I think the major reason why i like this movie, is because i felt a part of it. Between the action scenes, the point of view, and most of all... being completely oblivious to why this is happening. I'll have to admit i didn't fancy the ending, but i enjoyed it. The downbeat ending reminds us that life isn't full of fairy tale endings, and average humans saving the day.<br/><br/>on a side note: in the last scene right before the credits, on the trip to Conney island, it shows something falling from the sky. This is probably meant to make the viewers believe this is an alien and NOT a government experiment.<br/><br/>Bottom line: an innovative movie and a definite must see."
"Elazul81","6","1","5","18 January 2008"," Its best quality I feel in the end is its own downfall
","Well as most people I was sucked into this one too see what was destroying NY city. The whole mysterious aspect of it before hand was great, even had a hour long discussion at work on if it was a new godzilla movie in disguise or another alien attack flick. Now if you don't like the kind of movies that are filmed on hand-held cameras like the blair witch project then this movie might not be for you. If you get motion sickness easily try to sit at the very back of the theater or you might vomit onto the back of some poor guys head.<br/><br/>The start of the movie was great I thought. Pay attention to the fact that it says the camera was recovered at what was once central park. This lets you know in advance: Everyone is either dead or run off! After this we get into the movie itself. Some might think it slow, but it was essential to get a grasp of everyone's relationship to one another and get some significant and meaningful connection between the viewer and the person in the movie. To make them feel like they are in the movie and part of the group so to speak. However, some might feel it boring, but don't worry soon enough the action starts.<br/><br/>Now I feel the monster was revealed a little early for my tastes, I wasn't expecting anything but tail and claw glimpses until the end of the movie and everything was revealed to us. Not that it was bad or anything the way they did it, but I was just expecting something different.<br/><br/>The mysterious quality of the movie is both its most strong point and its most disappointing aspect. You the viewing know absolutely nothing about the monsters attacking NY City. This does not change at all through the entire movie. Now, depending on how your personal preferences are you will either like this or hate it. I personally did not like that fact. I wanted more background on what was going on with the monsters and what their story is and what the heck was going on basically. More of a robust meaty storyline. I felt like I was cheated in a way. Now, this is good from a standpoint of you being just another person on the street trying to survive, but something after the credits end in the form of a news broadcast or something to give us some closure to what we had just watched would have saved a lot of people some frustration and agony trying to puzzle out the whole thing.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel it was a good movie. However, I could have done with more story and less camera shaking. If your looking for a momentary distraction with some thrills and lots of screaming and some unbelievable parts, such as ""Why has the camera not run out of batteries"" or ""How is she able to run around screaming after being impaled by a piece of rebar"" ""What about that bite caused that chick to explode?"" ""Why the heck would any normal person be concerned about filming when running for their lives?"" and ""So why didn't they nuke the monster?"". If you are able to suspend believability go for it. If your looking for a momentary distraction for the night go for it. If you are looking for a serious monster movie with a plot to back it up don't bother. Save your $10 and see it on DVD. 6/10"
"Equinox1772","6","1","5","18 January 2008"," must be a monster movie fan
","This movie was excellent if you like Godzilla and other old school monster movies. Like the remake of the Poseidon Adventure, new computer CGI is used to modernize the genre. With Poseidon, it was making a ship disaster flick look modern. With Cloverfield, it was likewise taking a monster movie flick and modernizing it. Cloverfield was in no way cheesy like Godzilla though.<br/><br/>You have to be able to tolerate the hand held camera shots for the entire film. I do not think it was very slick of the director to show a skyscraper in New York falling straight down and sending a huge plume of dust flying through the streets. It hit a little to close to home and residents of NY, if they didn't already have a complex, probably will after seeing that. Yes, I know its just a movie, and I'm probably overreacting over one single scene, but come on, we can see a monster ravish the city without being shown a nearly identical shot of WTC tower collapse.<br/><br/>I don't know exactly what I was expecting from this movie but I will say that whatever it was it succeeded and disappointed. Not very helpful I know. I guess I liked all the action and scary dark tunnel moments (I especially like the going from one tower that is fine to one that is perched precariously at an angle against the good one). On the other hand I wanted more explanation of the monster and to see a shot of the city when it was all over. All in all it was a good movie that I would recommend to disaster/monster/alien movie fans. However, I would probably rank War of the Worlds, Signs, and even The Mist ahead of this one.<br/><br/>Like during the last movie I reviewed (The Mist) I had ""America's most immature"" sitting in the row right behind me (just lucky I guess)...laughing when something serious is happening and TALKING during the movie. I'm seriously gonna start going to early afternoon shows or the midnight shows (you know, the ones where you're just about the only one in the theater). Please movie goers, when they say no talking before the movie they don't say it in French, German, or Chinese so it should be easy for the average English speaking person to understand. Okay, I'm off my soapbox now. Usually I'm a much more cheerful reviewer but that kind of stuff just bugs the crap out of me."
"CTracy182","10","1","5","18 January 2008"," a great movie, but lots of misguided reviews
","I've read most of these reviews and I have to say, I'm pretty sick of people giving this movie crap.<br/><br/>these people claim to have seen the movie, but then describe scenes and things that were NEVER in the movie.<br/><br/>people have said the movie was filmed on a cell phone, we didn't see the same movie because they only talk about a camcorder for the ENTIRE movie.<br/><br/>Here's the lowdown. This is a great movie. I don't watch Lost, and I never plan to, I knew almost nothing about this movie except for the teaser trailer, and that's the best thing going in. People read into these movies way too much, so of course they are only going to be let down.<br/><br/>Don't listen to what all these crazy people say, go see it if you want to see it, and don't if it doesn't interest you.<br/><br/>I thought it was incredibly original, and I think it's one of the best films ever made. The ""noname"" actors were top notch, and I see most of them having successful careers, besides, if Ben Affleck was cast as the lead, they would have never been able to keep the movie under a curtain.<br/><br/>I loved it."

","Shaky Cam.<br/><br/>While I just got done watching the hyped up movie ""Cloverfield"" and got to say it was really different. In this film they decided to let you watch through a video camera that shakes all the time, but I got to say that it gave my eyes a work out. I mean I was sitting where I would be able to see the whole screen right in front of me and only the screen. My eyes were just moving all over the place trying to stay with ""Hud"" the camera man. So yeah it sure was different.<br/><br/>It's the Godzilla for the US, while that's what it seems like. There is no story on what the hell the thing is, but Hud has some ideas of his own. So you will have to make up your own theories on what the thing is and how it came to be. I'm sure there is a lot of post's out there on the web that tell what it is or what they think. It's a big monster looking thing that spawns off little creature's, it kinda reminds me of a creature from Resident Evil or some game like that. NO.now that I think about it, it resembles something from Halo3. More like a big Infection Form & Carrier Form and probably Pure Forms too. I don't know the thing is weird looking. What is Cloverfield? Who knows what this thing is. Maybe it's from the deep sea, maybe it's from space and the beginning of a Halo Movie. Haha I don't know. Can you tell me what it is. <br/><br/>In the end it just ended with no ending and I was disappointed but in a way I am satisfied. It was a good film and I would watch the sequel if any, because they did kinda leave it incomplete.<br/><br/>Relax. I'd rather not p*ss this thing off.  The Master Chief<br/><br/>m33k"
"DJRumpy","7","1","5","18 January 2008"," Great Movie...but those prone to sea sickness beware!
","I really enjoyed this one. Although it's a short hour and 20 minutes, it's a fun ride. You'll feel like the party last forever before the action gets started, but it goes at a fairly good pace after that. The acting isn't academy worthy, but it is certainly good. I can't really fault any of the actors as they all did a great job considering they are all unknowns (you wouldn't know that from the quality job). The CGI is screen worthy. Very fast glimpses for the most part. The smaller budget shows a bit there. Action scenes are good and some of them have a good tension to them letting your mind try to figure out whats coming. I liked it for those points.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun movie. I should warn you that if you had problems with Blair Witch, you may want to skip this one. The vomit cam can be a bit much. One of the people in my group actually had to get up and go to the bathroom because it made him nauseous. It's can get pretty extreme in scenes.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch!<br/><br/>***Minor Spoilers Follow*** ' ' ' ' ' ' For those that are moaning about the magical battery in the camera and such..Hello, there is only 1 hour and 20 minutes on the camera, meaning it filmed for that long. It wasn't running all night. For those complaining that the subways were empty, don't forget that they had already evacuated most of the city by that point. These people were running towards the monster, not away from it. The area they were in was already deserted. I will agree that this camera with it's night vision was a bit much to believe. That's more of a military type hardware, not some Best Buy video camera ;) Last but not least, did anyone catch the quick shot of this monster falling into the water at the very end of the movie? I'm talking about the very end of the movie when it flashes the scene at Coney Island and if you look out at the water there's a ferry. Watch to the left of it and you'll see something fall from the sky and hit the water. It is not flaming like a meteor. It looks gray and round. I'm guessing this is how the monster actually makes it's appearance? No one else seemed to notice in the theater."
"vailsy","8","1","5","18 January 2008"," highly enjoyable, but could have been even better
","the whole first person effect for this film really makes it a lot more adrenalin thumping. i also really liked how the monster is out of view most of the time as it really added to the suspense feel and gave me a better feel about how immense the monster was <br/><br/>just a pity about the actual storyline parts. while it was believable that a single person would return for a loved one even under the most perilous of circumstances, the chances that a whole bunch of other people would overcome the instinct to preserve their own lives and tag along, for me stretched the believability somewhat. even a monster movie needs to be structured in a believable way<br/><br/>i also felt the edit at the end was not so good. a film like this needs to go out on a big bang rather than a soppy whimper. BIG SPOILER *and after our cameraman gets chomped* we have to then wonder if extra movie time is going to enhance the film or not. for me the end came at the wrong moment <br/><br/>overall though, the monster was great (not sure about the mini ones though) and i enjoyed the film a lot. it was far better than 'the host' for example, a very similar Korean movie which surely must have influenced Cloverfield<br/><br/>the sound and effects in the film are absolutely first rate. and somehow the space that the monster occupies/destroys seems very real. the sound system at the theatre where i watched it was poor but when the monster smashed things it still sounded very cool, and as well as the heavy thumps you could almost hear the dust grains settling afterwards<br/><br/>i wasn't aware of the various websites and blogs that support the movie until after, so i've been enjoying those. i recommend everyone takes a look as it really gives the movie a heightened level of believability and depth when you read about the Japanese corporation behind it all, Tagruato, Slusho and the hints that the monster was awoken and seemingly chased by the military before it made it to Manhattan<br/><br/>overall a really brilliant film that has stayed with me for some time after viewing it, but it could have been even better imo had the actions of some of the central characters been a little more believable, and if they'd left the smaller critters out of the picture!"
"Craig_McPherson","6","1","5","18 January 2008"," The Beast from Facestomp.com
","Early in J.J. Abrams/Matt Reeve's Cloverfield, long before the monster goes on its city destroying rampage, I found myself secretly hoping the beast would turn each and every one of the Emo/MySpace cast into an hors d'uvre, along with 90 percent of the seat-kicking, cell phone using mouth breathers that made up the viewing audience.<br/><br/>Never before have I so enjoyed a movie that contained so many ingredients that I absolutely loathed. Presented as found video footage retrieved from a camcorder in New York's Central Park, Cloverfield ""documents"" a gigantic beast's blitzkrieg rampage through the city from the point of view of one of the many thousands of fleeing masses typically shown as an afterthought in so many of the Godzilla movies.<br/><br/>I absolutely detest the shaky, jerky, hand-held style of camera work Hollywood wonks seem so enamored with these days, and Cloverfield ramps this up by a factor of 100, complete with out of focus, poorly framed and lit shots  exactly the sort of stuff one would expect to see recorded by some non-professional average Joe.<br/><br/>The movie also suffers from a cast of characters that are as unlikeable as they are unbelievably stupid in their motivations.<br/><br/>Moments before the attack begins, as our intrepid cameraman sets out to document a farewell party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), the movie's male lead who is about to embark on a new job in Japan, we are clued into a soap-opera sub-plot involving his unrequited love for a hottie named Beth with whom he shared a lone night of hot steamy passion mere weeks earlier. The way I see it, this babe must have rocked Rob's world far more than the number the monster pulls on NYC because throughout the film, Rob, accompanied by his faithful cameraman and two friends, set out to make their way across Manhattan, directly through the creature's path, to locate Beth who called him on his cell to tell him she was trapped in her apartment.<br/><br/>Along the way they are set upon by some nasty critters that have hitched a ride on the big brute, and which may or may not be offspring or parasites - nasty, spidery buggers who emit an unforgettably creepy sound.<br/><br/>Insofar as the main creature itself goes, it can best be described as a variation on that multi-legged mantis-like beast featured in the arena sequence of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and the decision to reveal it in glimpses, leading up to two final extended shots, is one of the best things about this movie. Throughout I was constantly leaning one way or another, craning my neck to look around buildings, or cursing the cameraman who elected to pan away to his buddies rather than at the creature ripping through the side of a skyscraper.<br/><br/>As movies go, Cloverfield's flaws are numerous (how is it that Rob's phone battery could die out early in the night yet the camcorder seems to never run out of juice? And how long a tape does the damn thing hold?), however what it accurately captures is not so much the rampage of a mysterious beast, but the incessant self-absorption, to the exclusion even of an otherworldly onslaught, of the MySpace crowd."
"rmm4","6","1","5","18 January 2008"," Nice Try
","Its like you took an original concept too far. I understand the first twenty minutes or so were needed to get us emotionally vested in these characters. I understand you need to set this movie apart from a Hollywood production 'feel' by having it told through the eyes of these characters and the shaking camera, great idea by the way. I even understand why the ending was the way it was. But it fails because you don't know when to let go of a great idea, the shaking camera, and show us a movie and entertain us! I don't need to see a tilted view for the majority of the movie to understand that this character is not a professional camera man. It's annoying. And because our attention span WOULD last more than an hour and twenty something minutes. When the movie was over, it just didn't have any kind of impact and feels empty."

","If you go to see this movie, I highly recommend you sit in the very back of the theater and dose up on Dramamine before you go. The camera work is SO jumpy and all over the place that by minute 40, I thought I was going to puke on the bald guy sitting in front of me. There were moments in the movie when I literally had to stare at the ceiling as if I was car sick to stop my head from spinning. My boyfriend felt the same way and we talking to the people sitting next to us after the movie, and they wanted to puke too...this is coming from someone who usually sits in the first five rows (we moved to the back but it wasn't much better) Aside from having my first movie experience every that actually made me physically ill, the movie was fine, but nothing spectacular. I thought it opened well, but over all, they never go into any detail as to what the monster is so there is none of the ""let's figure out what's happening to us and how we can beat the monster"" kind of stuff. The movie is literally 1. A hipster party 2. An attack on New York and 3. Running and running and running from a monster. To the eventual and unremarkable conclusion that I will not spoil for you."

But watching half the theater walk out before half the movie at a premiere was a sign of ""what were they thinking"". I do not believe this movie deserves to be number 1# this weekend if it comes to that because it would win that spot for being a GOOD movie.

Oh, its not ""horrible"", but call it a 6 out of 10 in the acting department.<br/><br/>-a mid-budget movie where most of the money has gone into the special effects. That is not necessarily a bad thing though.<br/><br/>-full of cliché' scare tactics: unnaturally long quiet then big booms or screams, sudden pans by the camera right into the monster(s), etc.<br/><br/>-full of plot holes. How did the army get tanks, thousands of troops, and isolation chambers into mid-town Manhattan in under 1 hour with everyone cramming the bridges?<br/><br/>-effective at re-creating powerful images still fresh from 9-11, i.e. paper floating down into the streets, buildings collapsing, moving clouds of dirt, etc.<br/><br/>-a good Americanized version of Godzilla for the 21st century crowd.<br/><br/>-very well promoted with the new tools of the trade; Viral tie-ins, strict control of movie details and images, internet buzz, and so forth.<br/><br/>Cloverfield IS NOT:<br/><br/>-going to become a ""pop-culture touchstone"" like Start Wars or EVEN the Blair Witch Project.

"LeaFanatic","8","1","5","18 January 2008"," Raw, austere and fantastic
","This was a cool movie.<br/><br/>The style was excellent, although don't watch it with buttered popcorn because it made me really nauseous. While annoying at times, the guy holding the camera for most of the movie had some really funny lines and the action was impeccable.<br/><br/>This movie's strength was that it had a lot of really awesome segments. I can think of at least half a dozen five-second moments that were utterly chaotic greatness. Particularly a gruesome situation with Marlena, for those who know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>There are a lot of lulls, especially at the beginning (although the first attack makes up for it entirely) so sometimes your attention can stray. Also, I felt like the movie doesn't play with your mind enough. The movie could have been more horrifying, it had a lot more room to be scary. Nonetheless, it was really neat.<br/><br/>As for the monster, I don't know how to feel. They could have kept it a mystery for a little longer and it could have been better, but it really wasn't that bad. It was a realistic monster, if that makes any sense -- it was believable. It didn't suffer from looking unreal as a lot of animated things do but it was far from perfect. Mostly because it wasn't scary by any means.<br/><br/>I know the ending will be hit and miss with people, but I really liked it. The ending ""clip"" was a really sublime note to leave on and taking the beginning into account, it really linked nicely because it explained a bit but left a lot open. I wouldn't have minded some more hints as to where the monster actually came from and its motivation, but that would have been hard to do well; people get really upset with narrowing details. The way the credits came in was fantastic too, perfectly trite and uncompromising.<br/><br/>You leave the theatre with one of those weird, unresolved feelings but retrospect really helped the movie out for me: it does a damned good job. I can see a lot of people saying it didn't live up to the hype, but I don't think the movie's advertisements misled anything. It's a complete extension of the ads in all facets, and everyone knows how intriguing the ads were.<br/><br/>Again, a cool movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

","What the hell, I'll give it TEN. Wow! I just got back to my hotel room from seeing it at 1PM and I just keep saying Wow. It was way better than I could have imagined, and my expectations were high after the trailers and hype. The first 10 minutes or so are pretty jerky with the camera, but by about 3 minutes before the action starts, I either was used to it or the toned it down a bit. The rest of the movie the jerky footage just made it more real. I have read a lot of reviews from jaded, burned out professional critics and as usual, the bad things they had to say did happen for me. I saw a couple Pros say that the monster was shown too much, the plot sucked, and the acting was horrible. I felt that they did a great job of hiding the monster through most of it. Even in several dead on shots of IT the thing was obscured by smoke from missile trails. The acting was great as they convinced me that I was really running for my life with REAL people. They were like my own group of friends and I really felt for them. The plot was as good as was needed when you are showing video from a group of people that were having a party and a monster that should only be real in Hollywood appears in their lives and tears the city apart. No one could ever know what it is or where it came from when it just starts happening. If this happened to you and your friends the same way, I suppose there wouldn't be much plot either. The plot is people are trying live and save friends that are across town. The creature -- I will not give any description to ruin it, but I will say it is the scariest, most inventive monster since Aliens, Pumpkinhead, and the first time I watched Jeepers Creepers. That thing and the sound it makes when it yells out may give me my first nightmare in 10 years tonight. The special effects are as real as being there. Well, I just wanted to place my vote on this being a very, very, very good movie. Excellent actually. And I plan on seeing it again tonight. Go see it and tell your friends!!! Oh, in case you are easily bothered by the jumpy camcorder stuff, plan ahead and sit midway back or in the back. I am the kind of guy who usually sits closer than midway, but this time I played it safe after reading the warnings about the jumpiness and it helped..-----9PM--Back from 2nd viewing----------------------- I can't believe it but it was better the 2nd time!!! And the evening viewing when the place was packed rather than maybe 20 people at my first one was even more fun. I got to witness a lot more audience response. The same thing happened at the end though. After the craziest scariest action-packed monster-movie ride they had been on in their life for the past hour, the immediate end and pitch black silence stayed that way for like a full minute. Everyone is completely still with open mouths. It's like you were riding a roller coaster, screaming your head off and in an instant it's silent and you realize you are sitting on your couch. You just have to take it all in and wonder what just happened. Then the murmurs start and little kids start talking to their friends about it and finally the adults start saying WOW and THAT WAS NUTS. I heard a guy behind me on the way out tell his friend it reminded him of the first time he saw aliens as a 8 year old in 1979. This truly is a groundbreaking movie. I think I will go again tomorrow. Each time I walk out I want it to keep going so badly that when I see the normal parking lot I wish it were the Devastated Manhattan in this movie just so I could see that horrible creepy monster one more time."

","Its 1-18-08. The virally advertised monster simply known as 'Clover' has finally been loosed upon the cinema screens. Good old fashioned monster stomping has joined the 21st century.<br/><br/>Suckered into taping testimonials, Hud (T.J. Miller) blinders his way around a party interviewing attendees of Rob's (Michael Stahl-David) farewell party before he leaves for his new Vice-President Job in Japan tomorrow. Just as the personal drama reaches its crescendo the fun begins. A loud boom shakes the Manhattan apartment like an earthquake. As people make their way to the streets and roofs they are witness to a building exploding barely in the distance. Debris rains down from the heavens and with more explosions and panic the shocked crowds see Lady Liberty's head skittering down the avenue. Through the smoke and haze, shaky hand-held camera and news reports we learn that out of the Atlantic has come a monster and those unlucky enough to to be caught on the island maybe in for a war the likes no ones has seen. <br/><br/>First up if the shaky camera-work of 'The Blair Witch Project' made you want to hurl than this one won't be for you. Once the monster action begins it gets really shaky and hectic at times. The characters of the film in the end are irrelevant I mean after all what we want is destruction right? But they do manage to create some decent characters in the first 25 minuted before the maelstrom. They even manage to generate sympathy for their plight, a key ingredient for a disaster flick. Script-wise you can't really say much. Due to its nature most of the dialogue was probably improvised and much the same can probably said for the direction. Told with a hand-held camera 'Cloverfield' adds the 'Blair Witch' element to a typical 'Godzilla' style romp. It works too. The final hour has plenty tension and suspense and quite a few excellent setpieces. The sound design is phenomenal. All the gunplay and bass grop you smack dab into the action. The creature {which I won't spoil for you) is nicely done and you wisely see only bits and pieces of it until the end. Let's just say that it doesn't stray too far from your typical city stomping monsters, ias a matter of fact fans of classic monster flicks like the Harryhausen films and 'Godzilla' will notice all sorts of familiar parts. The CGI worked well too.<br/><br/>In the end I had a grand old time. Monster movie fans should have a blast provided the camera work isn't a problem. It is definitely played for terror and an interesting discussion may be had in the post 9/11 world. You can debate it to dust but 10 years ago an Americanized 'Godzilla' put the smackdown on New York City and hardly was not half as effective. 4/5"

","I will cut straight to the point about this film - it was extremely entertaining. <br/><br/>From the opening scene until the closing of the movie, I was on the edge of my seat. The way the writing and directing weaved in characterization through the original tape was brilliantly done and very interesting to watch. Sure, the hand-held camera technique has been done before in movies such as the Blair Witch, but because of this technique I often found myself engulfed in what was happening on screen and forgetting that I was actually safe in a movie theater. I am a frequent moviegoer and for me to be on the edge of my seat for an entire movie is quite rare, but Cloverfield truly had my heart pounding the entire time.<br/><br/>Sure there are classical scare tactics used and there are obviously only a few ways the movie can end, but the journey through the unknown is what makes this movie enjoyable. You don't go to these types of movies expecting an award winning film, but the acting was top- notch, the effects were great and the terror cast upon theater goers was truly amazing.<br/><br/>The previews actually did not excite me much and I, like many others, went into the theater thinking Cloverfield was over-hyped. However, this is not a movie you should wait to rent; the huge screen and the deafening speakers of the theater will surely leave you feeling vulnerable. A must see in theaters! 9/10"
"dslade08","9","1","5","18 January 2008"," Think H.P. Lovecraft meets Godzilla flick and you got this crazy & intense monster movie
","Okay, let me just start out by saying that if you're expecting some kinda cheesy premise equating to the old school 'guy in a rubber suit knocking down a model of a city flick' then you have no idea what you're about to see.<br/><br/>While yes, its true that there is a giant terrible thing destroying Manhattan this is way different than anything you've seen before. As I was watching this at the midnight showing last night at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin I felt very much pulled into what was going on. First off, the way the entire film is shot is through the perspective of someone that was filming goodbye greetings at a party and then madness ensues and he keeps on filming. So, the cinematography has a'Blair Witch' kind of jumpiness but there is much more going on than just trees and whatnot in the background so the effect comes off as cool and realistic and not nauseating.<br/><br/>Also, there is never an explanation as to what's going on or why this is happening or where this thing came from or why its so freaking angry. Which is awesome. It just adds to the realism, well, it goes miles I should say in making you believe that the horrible things going on might actually happen. So, what's going on and why is a mystery and is never revealed throughout the course of the flick.<br/><br/>Now, for the best part, the monster, or monsters. You won't see a giant lizard or gorilla here. Think more along the lines of the H.P. Lovecraft tomes where horrible, massive, ancient, demon god-things awake from an timeless evil slumber and set about inflicting their wretched, savage and merciless brutality on an unsuspecting world. That's what I interpreted this thing to be. Several times throughout the flick I saw glimpses of other things besides the main flailing, howling nightmare beast of destruction. Brief glimpses of massive tentacles with fleshy fin-claws and other things huge and unimaginable. So, even though we're only shown 1 nightmare thing I think that there were more but the guy filming only captured this one.<br/><br/>Online movie gurus might debate me on this but I know what I saw, you should check it out and see for yourself. But, in a nutshell, this was one helluva a kick ass movie. Never seen anything like it and the whole approach to making it was awesome You gotta check this out."

He's filming the morning after, including a planned trip to Coney Island  a New York native and she's never been? I'll buy it. They were cute together and there was some good chemistry going on.<br/><br/>But SOMEONE forgets to replace the tape in the camera, and the movie jumps forward a month. Rob has just accepted a job as Vice President of something or other (it's never mentioned) in Japan, and there's a surprise party. This is a fairly decent round-robin style introduction to most of the other major players in the game  unwilling cameraman Hud (TJ Miller, who I still find hilarious in the well meaning ""Carpoolers"")  Rob's brother, Jason, Rob's brother's girlfriend, Lily, and Marlena, played with sarcastic perfection by Lizzy Caplan  the biggest name in the film having starred along side Lindsey Lohan in Mean Girls and a starring role opposite Jason Ritter in 2006's ""The Class."" You get a good feel for the characters  Rob included  until Beth shows up with her new boyfriend. Apparently after they did the nasty and spent the day at Coney Island, Rob flaked  he was scared that his new job in Japan would drive her away, so he did all the driving away. He never called, never returned her calls, and just tried to avoid her.<br/><br/>Succinctly, as Jason puts it, he was a ""jerk"".<br/><br/>But enough with the people, am I right? Wrong. It's a good thing this movie establishes the characters because you're spending the next hour with them as they run, scream, die, fight, flirt, crack jokes  the monster never, ever becomes a main character. Which is odd, considering this is, in fact, a monster movie.<br/><br/>After the problems hits the fan and we're all treated to eerie 9/11 flashbacks, the movie picks up. Rob and Beth had a huge falling out at the party. During the evacuation of the city, Rob gets a call. Beth is stuck. The Brooklyn Bridge falls, and Rob realizes what is it worth going through something like this if you can't have the person you love beside you? Does the movie ever degenerate into a love fest? No. I'm glad to say it doesn't. But the love theme does drive the central characters to do some crazy stupid things, be it moving through the street while Clovington III trounces military soldiers, or through subway tunnels in pitch darkness, the motivation to not die alone is the fuel that feeds the fire.<br/><br/>Hud is fine following Rob, his ""main dude"", because that's who he needs. Marlena, you get the impression early on as she stares longingly at her phone, doesn't really have a whole lot of other people. Lily, the one she's supposed to be with, bites it fairly early on. They're all attached to each other and the hope that finding Beth will some how make things right, make things easier for them.<br/><br/>Of course, the Gods will never let this be. They're given obstacles to overcome, tinier monsters to fight, brief arguments amongst themselves, never losing site of the goal. If Rob can find Beth in this time of horror, if he can find his light, can't we all? You're never given a clean shot of the monster until about 1/3 of the way through and then, surprisingly, I found the monster to be overused. The most effective moments in the movie were contained in the same stretch  the subway tunnel crawl and station holdup  that didn't feature the monster at all. It was mere feet away, above ground, and the constant rumbling helped set the mood, but the idea of the monster was somewhat scarier than the monster itself.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, snippets of the Coney Island trip are played as Hud (ironic as in First Person Shooter games HUD means heads-up-display) turns the camera off and on. It gives a nice juxtaposition to a nicer time when large inverted starfish like beings weren't leveling Manhattan. Remember those days? Those were the salad days.<br/><br/>Connection is the big name of the game. Trying to find someone you can reach out to and hold on to, through thick and thin, while your city is crumbling around you.<br/><br/>If you're expecting to learn about the monster from this film  screw off, it's JJ Abrams. Have things ever been that simple? Be prepared to crawl through video clips, photos, and web journals to piece together where the monster came from.<br/><br/>But enough about that. Did the movie live up to the hype? If you can totally immerse yourself in the twenty something, One Tree Clover or Dawson's Field aura of the movie, yes. Most of the dialog flows naturally, considering the people speaking, and I was amused to find that a good portion of it was improvised.<br/><br/>The camera in the middle of the action puts your right there, in the moment. Once the movie started, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen on the goings-on.<br/><br/>Highly impressive at most, slightly moving at the least."

","To be honest, the movie didn't live up to the hype it has been gathering. But it did offer something different compared to all the other monster movies its going to be compared with including Godzilla. Moviegoers should go in without their thinking caps on and just enjoy the movie. And what turns out as a sluggish and draggy start will turn into pandemonium. Survive the initial quarter or so and you'll be in for action thereafter. Some might get dizzy or confused by the way the film was filmed, but this element was intended to inject more realism into the scene like what was done in The Blair Witch Project. But those hoping to see much of the monster entity will be unhappy for most of the movie. Only glimpses of the creature will be visible and the director leaves the rest to your imagination. But certain scenes in the latter stages of the film offer views of what this behemoth is all about. Lastly, being a much anticipated movie and a hope for a good start to 2008, it was a bit too short. But then again, how long can the batteries for a hand held video recorder last?"

","For quite a while I've wanted to see his movie, and man am I glad I saw it. After watching the trailer and not knowing what on earth the monster is just makes you want to see it. I also loved how it was filmed in a first-person view, it adds a nice change of things. I went to the midnight showing of this, and I couldn't wait a second longer. This movie literally scared the s*** out of me more than any horror movie imaginable, the suspense and thrills were endless. By the time I walked out of that theater I was still shaking from the intensity of it. One word that would summarize this movie would be simply amazing, nothing more nothing less. For the fact that they also never really reveal anything about the monster except for what it looks like and how much damage it could actually cause makes it that much better, it was more of a need-to-know basis. This movie was definitely worth my time and money and I'd suggest anyone who likes a thrill to go see this movie asap. And for those who don't like this movie, consider it this way: opinions are like assh***s, everyone's got one. And for those who already comment on a movie that they haven't even seen yet, just stop wasting your time and everyone else's. All you do is just try and ruin it for other people, giving them a second thought that maybe this movie really isn't worth it. Well for those who are wondering whether to see it or not, definitely go see it. I promise you it's worth it."

","First off, most of the crowd boo'd at the ending and I laughed quietly to myself. I don't know if I'm going to throw in spoilers, I hope I don't, but here it goes.<br/><br/>I know the previous comment on here stated that there's nothing to the film, and he's right! However, he must be an untrained eye to what has begun. Indeed there was no true story line, in the traditional sense. Most people look to follow a chain of events to portray the story line, things occurring to the characters to draw you in to who they are. That's not JJ.<br/><br/>I believe it was at ComiCon where JJ stated that he was jealous of the Godzilla franchise. What does that mean to you? To myself, it means only one thing. He's not done. JJ is a brilliant man who knows how to grab someone's attention with something tragic. Take for example Lost. The first episode gave you nothing about the tragic event that occurred, just information. The following episodes gave you a little more, then a little more, then answered a question or two and then gave you eight more. He's given us information here. Pay attention to the film from the beginning. You can see where I'm going if you remember.<br/><br/>He gave us a monster, a beauty at that if I might say. From my stand point, the story wasn't about the people, it was about the monster. We don't need to know about them. Focus on the monster people! It's not the last time we'll see him/her/it.<br/><br/>I hope I didn't spoil anything for you. Trust me, it's a need to see if you know how the man works his magic."

","I remember sitting in the theaters for Transformers when I first saw the trailer for this. Ever since then the hype has been huge. Does it live up to it? In my opinion yes. While some may argue the story line isn't very original, I was thrilled at the unique approach to the genre which I have never seen pulled off so well. The hand-held camera style really pulled me in, and I also thought the actors did a wonderfully convincing job. Definitely worth the money to go see in my opinion not only if you are a monster movie fan, but also if you just want a style that dares to venture off the beaten path. I just hope that we don't see 100 movies come out in the next few years trying to copycat it."

In the movie, no one really knows what it is, though you get ample opportunities to see its face and body shape. It can be safety assumed (my opinion) that it's an alien of some sort - definitely NOT Godzilla, Voltron, or a Cthulu... so jokes on you for those who thought so. All the pictures I've seen on the Internet are wrong too.<br/><br/>It has a face, front claws, and tail like Mewtwo (the Pokémon), and the body of a praying mantis (because of the extra legs). It's gray, and UGLY AS HELL~! In the earlier part of the movie, it looked like a brontosaurus until I get to see the face... It moves pretty quick for its size. The other creatures reminded me of those aliens from Starship Troopers, and from what I can tell: there are two sets of them. (1) a smaller version of the monster (possibly offspring), and (2) spider creatures what cause your body to explode after you're bitten.<br/><br/>I hope this helps.<br/><br/>-Jes'"

They went with realism and to give you that we cant know the ending because it wasn't filmed. This movie takes place in the ""now"".

","Marketing played a large part in CLOVERFIELD's commercial success . It was very enigmatic and no shots of the monster appeared in the trailers and TV spots .In fact the marketing made more that it was produced by JJ Abrahams creator of ALIA and LOST than the plot itself . With hindsight this was very slick marketing as a tagline of "" Blair Witch Meets Godzilla "" would turn of a prospective cinema audience . I know it would in my case which is why I didn't bother about it until it appeared on TV <br/><br/>Make no mistake BLAIR WITCH meets GODZILLA is the perfect description of this movie though it also makes several other references in the horror sci-fi genre . Rats running around the New York subway is a nod to 28 DAYS LATER , along with its sequel etc . In fact watching this film would make a good drinking - you gulp down a shot of booze evreytime you're reminded of another movie but the downside of that is you'd be dead of alcohol poisoning tho thirds of the way through<br/><br/>This doesn't necessarily make CLOVERFIELD a bad film and it's not a bad film but is a very unoriginal one , a fact reflected in the marketing . It does suffer from being a "" fly on the wall documentary "" realist style movie though . For example almost the first third of the running time is taken up with character filming party . You can understand the director trying to make these characters empathetic to the audience but for the most part you don't really feel strongly about them one way or the other . The style also means the alien remains enigmatic and mostly unseen through out the film when I would have preferred to have seen scientists running around a lab feverishly trying to find a solution to the menace than having the characters running down yet another dark street"

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","1","6","14 February 2008"," Excellent from start to finish
","I haven't followed the hype-campaign for this, so I can't really say if it's good to watch this if you have done so or not. I was interested in this from when I first saw the teaser trailer. Yes, this does evoke images of 9/11. Yes, the entire film is presented as something that was taped on a camcorder. And yes, this camcorder does have rather impressive zooming capabilities, and a battery the durability of which is remarkable. But this is an awesome film. It's a thrill-ride, intense throughout, once it starts to be(and I wasn't bored with what was going on before that). It is incredibly well-paced, it never gets to be overwhelming, but it never lets you relax all the way, either. For about an hour and a half, you will feel the sense of not really being safe. J.J. doesn't disappoint. The masterful story-telling, the marvelous concept(which is a very interesting new angle on a very familiar type of movie/story... this is like The Blair Witch Project, only, you know, quality stuff), which was executed exceptionally well, the rich characters(which are developed and introduced subtly and skillfully), the dialog(it's ""real"", clever/expertly written, or both)... all the way, the traits of his productions and his talent are there(here's hoping Lost doesn't suffer). The acting is flawless. I found the amount of exposure of the creature to be about perfect, I'm not sure I would have gone with neither more nor less. There's enough that you won't wonder what it looked like, and yet it's in such sparse amounts that it never loses its effectiveness, it never ceases to be scary to us. The way the film is presented is a reasonably simple idea, but the way it's used and what it does is great. I don't remember when I was last this into a movie, or had such a fun time at the cinema(in fact, on that last one, this may be the first time for that). The film is perhaps not entirely without clichés, but they are quite rare, almost non-existent. It pulled the rug out from under me again and again, as J.J. has before shown a knack for being able to. The special effects are amazing, and never really feel like such. Watch this for the ride, for the well-told story within a monster flick told from an original perspective, and/or for, well, the J.J. Any fan of his may love this, if not necessarily as much as I did, and for anyone who isn't, well, this may very well have made a fan out of my dad... and he's usually into realistic and authentic films, more than ""spectacle"" ones. I recommend this to anyone who feels they would enjoy it. Keep working, J.J., I'm definitely behind you. 10/10"
"antony-1","9","1","6","2 February 2008"," A shot in the arm of cinema; an amazing achievement
","Wow. That's largely how I can sum up this movie. Wow.<br/><br/>I was worried about spoilers and, whipped up into the viral marketing frenzy, trotted off to see this movie as soon as was out. Funnily enough there's not a lot be spoilt about. The trailer showed you the Statue of Liberty's head being smashed off as something attacks New York, and that is pretty much it. What it at excels at though, and what could not really be spoiled by spoilers, is the way the film is executed.<br/><br/>The story is slightly slow in the setup because you sit there thinking ""get exploding!"" but then it grabs hold of your hand and yanks you from scene to scene. Never letting up. I have not been that on the edge of my seat in ages. Goose bumps were on my arms as the film progressed, and as it brought you into the characters' lives so expertly that you start to forget that it's a film.<br/><br/>Well maybe that's a bit of hyperbole, to forget that it's a film, but it's so nice to have such a raw film that doesn't have the trappings of normal big movies. No music, no familiar faces... it really did allow one to be swept up in. And it's only when I watch this that I realise how much stuff is added to the average movie that breaks the suspension of disbelief. It's as if Cloverfield stripped away all the tricks of a normal film, and took you to the raw story. It almost makes me annoyed at all the other false, packaged movies out there! Even (I realise this is a weird example, but I feel it sums it up well) they walk through some doors and they are covered in fingerprints. In any movie they'd be polished to the hilt, to ensure they look perfect on screen and to ensure everything looks 'right'. But this is about realism, that someone truly has just grabbed a camera, and it adds to that feeling of reality. It's so nice to have none of the normal trappings of star names, orchestral scores and poncy director camera work.<br/><br/>Sadly not everyone gets this. I notice some reviewers criticising the movie for not saying where the monster came from etc. That's a typical response created by movies as they are. They must be flawless, and structured, and answer things. People want them to lead them from A to B to C and tell them that Mr Bad did it, and Mr Bad dies when Mr Good kills him. Films must be able to do what we can't do as humans... go to places quickly in the next frame, invade people's lives like a fly on the wall. Whereas Cloverfield does away with all that. It treats you as if you were there, and you will get NO special treatment because you're watching a movie. It's what makes the movie.<br/><br/>Being swept into caring about the characters is quite gradual too. I didn't realise it was even happening, but as it goes on you do increasingly care for them. Their shock and horror is felt by you. And by the other audience members too, I could hear gasps and shouts in the audience as they like me got swept along.<br/><br/>It continues this great pace and involvement right up to the end. I was worried about how it would end, but much like the rest of the movie it was done superbly. The ending was sublime, so well done, and a great end to a great cinema experience.<br/><br/>My final comment is to watch this in the cinema. If you watch it at home, in your comfortable home, with lights on, and you pause it to get a drink etc. you'll ruin the atmosphere. Watching it at the cinema thrusts you in it. The pace is set, and you can't stop it. And there was something about the tone of the film that really suited watching it with strangers all around me. So please, watch it in the cinema and be prepared for one of the most thrilling films to grace our screens."
"miketigas25","10","1","6","30 January 2008"," Simply amazing
","As a kid, I used to love watching monster movies. That's right! Watching a 15-minute introduction of characters, trying to guess who's gonna die next and how it's gonna happen and ultimately trying to out-guess friends on how the characters will manage to kill the ""monster"" were all part of the good old days.<br/><br/>So when I heard about ""Cloverfield"", I got so excited. Of course, I had my doubts at first. I mean, I saw the trailers and really got a liiiittle disappointed upon learning that the movie was to be viewed through a video camera (I hate Blairwitch). I also hated the thought of speculating whether the guy/girl holding the camera would have the guts or sanity to keep ""filming"" while running away for their lives (because that's just stupid). Still, upon succeeding in convincing myself not to watch Aliens vs. Predators 2 (it's ALIENS vs. PREDATORS - why the heck are there people in it?!?!?! *roar*), I went on to watch the much-hyped monster movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I think the movie succeeded in many ways. One is that it made me (or you) feel like it's NOT a movie. Yes. It sorta felt like the real thing. Why? Because of the camera. Another reason is that you actually feel like you're part of the group. It was an amazing experience. If only the guy holding the camera stopped talking, I would've really imagined myself to be the one looking in a first-person view.<br/><br/>Of course, not every movie is perfect. Clearly, there were times when the guy holding the camera would've NATURALLY stopped filming. And some of the scenes were obviously UNNATURAL for a camera-holder's point of view.<br/><br/>All in all, however, it was really an amazing work. Never before have I been pushed towards the edge of my seat when watching movies (let's see.. 10-year old me watching Godzilla?). Compared to the last three movies I've watched over the weekend (I am Legend, Sweeney. I resisted watching the ""others""), this movie is the probably the one that will last me for weeks. I do hope they make a part 2. I also hope that they'd include more ""stuff"" upon it's DVD release.<br/><br/>Last note: don't mind what other people say or think about this movie. If you have the IMAGINATION, watch it. It will give you something to talk about for weeks."

"terren8556","9","1","6","28 January 2008"," Stunning and Groundbreaking
","There are only three other movies that I have seen that have evoked such intense empathy on my part as did ""Cloverfield""""Open Water,"" ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and ""Wolf Creek."" All of them shared, to a varying degree, features that I consider extremely effective: a cast of unknowns, minimal to no musical score, a minimal to nonexistent use of sets, and dialogue that one must think was improvised or so ingeniously written that the viewer is convinced that the people on the screen are not actors, but are real, and ordinary people that are being eavesdropped upon. A large part of making that work is that films such as these take their time in getting the viewer to the crisis/disaster, and convince you of the fact that the people on screen don't just exist for the sake of the movie, but existed, and have lives and concerns and issues that began, long before we are introduced to them on the screen.<br/><br/>Thus, when they experience the horrors that they eventually do, one feels right there with them, and feels that what is on the screen is really happening to them.<br/><br/>There are no opening credits; the opening scene of the movie is of one of the twentysomething male characters in a rather posh upper Manhattan apartment, clowning around with his camera, and then rousing his sleeping girlfriend. They tease each other about what they are going to do with the day. In the background, out the window, are Central Park, the forest of buildings and the streets far below, teeming with traffic. The dialogue is completely mundane and real. The view of the city, on the eve of what is to happen, is majestic, and spectacular. That is clearly for a reason.<br/><br/>Eventually, we see the preparations for a party, one of the characters arguing and bantering with his other friends, shopping at a corner grocery store, one of the women getting off a line that causes the cashier to laugh.<br/><br/>Then the party at a midtown Manhattan walk up apartmentagain, all captured by the hand-held camera that changes hands and is there for posteritya send off gift to one of the principal characters who is off to Japan for a big-time job.<br/><br/>The movie spends a lot of time at the party, one attended almost exclusively by other twentysomethings gossiping, dancing, goofing off, drinking, making fools of themselves, and flirting. Again, I got the sense that it wasn't a movie, but a documentary or reality TV show of a real party. It, and the participants were in and of themselves so believable and interesting that I and some of the other people in the audience chuckled at what was going on.<br/><br/>Disaster, and the end of life as was known, begins without warning, and in the blink of an eye. The amount of time that the movie has spent showing us the characters, and the city, during normal and ordinary life renders what unfolds for the rest of the movie all the more wrenching. Life, and reality, for the characters, and for New York City, is turned upside down, and irrevocably, in an instant.<br/><br/>Unlike any previous such disaster/monster film that I know of ""Cloverfield,"" shows in graphic and realistic horror (with the viewer in the middle of it) what the people on the ground would experience were such a thing to really happen. <br/><br/>In reading some of the reviews online or in the papers, I've noted that people have talked of, or criticized, the movie's implied allegories to 9/11. I think that's overly simplistic. The source of the chaos and death is almost irrelevant. The human condition/reaction under such circumstances would be the same whether one substituted any sudden real world calamity--a mass terrorist attack, an earthquake, a bombing raid, or tsunami. The horror would not only stem from the source of the destruction, but the suddenness of the event, the complete lack of knowledge (at least initially) of what is happening, and the utter helplessness. In communicating this, ""Cloverfield,"" was unsparing in depicting what it would probably be like to be at that age, to begin an evening, at a party, with a vast future seemingly assured and taken for granted, and then, by wee hours of the following morning, to suddenly have the rug pulled from under you, and to suddenly be in the middle of a war zone, fighting for your life, clawing for survival, seeing the city you live in crumble, and seeing people--including people very close to you--dying en masse and violently, before your eyes. <br/><br/>The special effects were all the more potent in that the advent of the attack begins at night, amid a sea of light and explosions. The depiction of the collapsing of the buildings was not merely effectiveit looked as if it were really happening. Initially all that we, and the characters know is that a vast and destructive force has been unleashed, and is completely out of control. The creature, when finally revealed, is all the more terrifying in that it is totally malevolent, destructive in the extreme, and in that no one we encounter in the film, from the military people to the newscasters, seems to have a clue as to what it is, where it came from, or how to stop it.<br/><br/>An especially effective, and heart sinking scene is when the soldier confides in one the characters and his companion, the true magnitude of what is happening, and that if they're to try to find one of their friends, they have little time and need to get out of the city as soon as possible. It is all but confirmed to the viewer that there will be no eleventh hour triumph, or happy ending.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" is a first of its kind meld of drama and science fiction that I think is destined to be a classic."

The monster was shockingly different than what i thought it was going to be.<br/><br/>What amazed me the most was the acting. All the actors were no names and that made me think that they were real people. And I'm tired of hearing about the camera being bad. They did that on purpose, sit back and enjoy the ride. And for the people who need every little detail explained...shut up...there's nothing wrong with a lil mystery."
"zamsmash","7","1","6","19 January 2008"," Lives up to Expectations
","Everything people had dreaded did not occur! The monster was hidden enough so that you only see most of the monster. You will not be disappointed! The acting at times can be a little low key at times, but overall the cast carries through the film, becoming characters the audience can empathize with. Rob especially delivers an emotional performance.<br/><br/>The cinematography captures the events through the point-of-view of a camcorder, allowing the audience to feel like they're a part of the experience. The chaos of the attack and the army's attempts to stop the monster is perfect for the sometimes disorienting camera angles and movement.<br/><br/>The monster is nothing like any fan imagined and fulfills all expectations and hopes. It truly is the perfect destructor.<br/><br/>The scares are provided at a fast enough pace to give you time to recompose yourself. They go beyond the typical jump scene and provide the viewer with a fresh meaning to on-screen scares, with realistic details giving it the realistic edge of people's reactions to the terrifying wrath of the creature.<br/><br/>Overall, Cloverfield fulfills most hopes and is dripping with Abram's genius and suspense, with the originality and thrills of Lost and Alias. This is surely one movie that any cinema goer, frequent or not, cannot pass up"

","If one word could describe this film, it is...intense. I looked around me as literally the entire theater was riveted to the screen and at moments you could see the horror in the faces of the characters reflected in the audiences faces. What an excellently done film. As far as the monster genre is concerned, I cannot think of a better made film. I was very skeptical if the monster was revealed and seen in plain sight, that it would lessen the impact and turn the film into another cheesy sci-fi work. I could not have been more wrong. This monster was truly horrific and only created more suspense and terror for the audience. An absolutely must see movie."
"jason-1649","9","1","6","19 January 2008"," To all Giant Monsters: Come to Manhatten, it's the new Tokyo!
","Honestly going into Cloverfield I had my doubts. There was no big named stars, shaky independent/Blair Witchish..ish..ish... camera work (along with a similar feeling ad campaign), and a lovely unrealistic concept. Thankfully, much like it did to Manhatten, Cloverfield crushed my doubts, then bombed the crap out of them, ate a few of my doubts friends, and in an unrelated twist made my doubts dress up as a clown and give up its self dignity to try and sell used cars. Cloverfield was indeed a wonderful movie. So lets go into how destroyed such doubts.<br/><br/>First is the big named stars. OK I know big stars don't make a movie great, as a matter of fact they can make some movies seem worse because you feel they just cast them to have them and the part does not fit (""Minority thug from Harlem who's killed so many he's become emotionally cold? I'm thinking Rowan Atkinson."")This isn't the case here. I would not know any of these stars if I saw them on the street, outside of the fact a couple look like people I've seen drunk at college parties. This was actually a boost for this movie, as the actors did great and the fact I couldn't identify them in a line up of celebrities, or for that matter the people that live down the road, lead to making the concept more real in the idea your watching someones home video of the event at hand, that really added to this movie. I mean that too, if one of them robbed me at gun point and I had to pick them out of a lineup I would probably get it wrong, sorry again Frank you just looked seedy... Anyway.<br/><br/>Camera work/ Blair Witch ad campaign thingy. I have to say shaky camera work is one of my biggest qualms about independent film (it's called a tripod people, I know you don't have a big budget but my grandmother even has a tripod, GET ONE!). This was no exception to the shaky thing, but in the context of the movie setting, anything else would have been suspect, and still even with the all over camcorder work, it isn't nauseatingly shaky like so many Indy films which were shot by some cameraman I can only suspect suffers from Parkinson's (TRIPOD!! Seriously look it up), and it added to the sense of really being there. I also thought there would be no good shots of the monster because of this, but there were, unbelievably so. As for the Ad campaign, it was actually quite genius, and I have to qualms with it, I was just saying so was the Blair Witch ad campaign and I could have eaten a roll of film and produced a better movie in my bathroom about 24 hours later than that thing. It just scared me to think I may have to suffer through that again ya know.<br/><br/>Finally concept. Yes it is a giant monster attacking a city movie, but before you start conjuring images of a guy in a foam rubber outfit stomping Tokyo (which there is some subtle hints to that in the early movie, not the foam rubber part just the whole Godzilla thing), or worse yet start thinking of the remake of it which gave me an aneurysm, this movie is a far cry from those. This feels entirely different, and not in that walking through a yard barefoot and stepping in something that isn't dirt way, no it's in a good way. Plus with the reported budget this movie had, they must have called in some favors or black mailed someone to get this thing, it was quite spectacular.<br/><br/>Don't take my word for it though and I know you won't, lord knows I tried to warn you of Epic Movie but you went anyway, see it for yourself."

"bigfuzzymonster","Null","1","6","19 January 2008"," If you get motion sick, beware (and maybe bring the Dramamine)
","I enjoyed Cloverfield. At least, what I saw of it. The problem is, I got motion sick, and had to close my eyes for about half of the movie.<br/><br/>I used to not have this problem, and I would play first person shooter video games all the time. But somewhere along the line, I developed it. I don't get seasick. But jolty, fast, sudden movement seems to do it for me. I guess this is technically simulation sickness.<br/><br/>So the reason I'm saying this is that I hope someone will read this and think ""Hey, I get motion sick sometimes, so maybe I should grab the Dramamine on the way out the door."" I wouldn't say to avoid the movie, but when your options are Dramamine or keeping your eyes closed, it probably loses some of its appeal.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, I liked what I did see (the first hour or so). It was interesting to see a first person, civilian account of what happened. The character interactions were realistic and sometimes humorous. I would say it more or less lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>I'm not going to give it a rating, out of the hopes that more people will mark this useful so maybe somebody will read about the motion sickness and have a better time because of it."
"bobo165","6","1","6","19 January 2008"," Not the worst movie I've ever seen.
","OK, yeah. I had problems with this movie. I also really enjoyed parts of it. Ever since seeing the trailer before ""Transformers"" last summer, I've been looking forward to opening night. My roommates and I went to the last showing of the night at our local theater, and ended up having to sit in the front row because the theater was that full.<br/><br/>Despite getting off to a rather slow start, once the action begins, it is non-stop. The camera work is completely different from anything I had ever seen before...""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't even measure up. I'm not saying the camera shots were wonderful, but they definitely put the viewer in the middle of the action. There were times I felt like running away too...but those times were because I felt sick from all the shaking around.<br/><br/>The ending was rather unsatisfying to quite a few people in the theater I was at, but compared to a typical movie ending, I enjoyed how it happened. All in all, the entire movie was an experience I won't soon forget. Whether that is good or bad, I'm not sure yet. All I know is that I've seen far worse, and far better, movies. If you're looking for something with an interesting take on a monster attack, this is your movie. If you're looking for a well-structured, easy to follow movie that deals with the destruction of New York City, I'd suggest you move along and rent King Kong."

The camera perspective combined with the situational realism was amazing. The real ""what if"" feel provided by the style of this movie was really refreshing. I was impressed with most of the acting and the great cg, but the military special effects and sounds were totally fantastic! I don't think there will be another movie like Cloverfield. I am totally re-evaluating movies of similar genres. I highly recommend it. I don't like watching the same movie more than once or twice, and seldom within a short period of time, but I'll be going to see this movie again before it leaves the theaters, and I'm taking my friends with me.

Those people who rated this movie bad should never rate another movie, or at least leave their own personal opinions out of judging a movie. The director did a great job on this movie. Everything was incredible. He intended for this movie to feel realistic... and that is what he achieved. The camera work was magnificent. It would have been really hard filming an entire movie this way. Think about it... trying to get the shot you are looking for, while fumbling around with the camera. And he got those shots... without making it look staged. Oh and his creature was original... wow. He could not have done a better job on the creature... who are we to say what creatures are to look like... so how are you to judge the appearance of the creature. I judged it on originality and he succeeded in that. Yeah, the movie was short and the ending was not what everyone was looking for... but since when did everything always end the right way. He wanted it to seem realistic and that is probably what would have really happened. The movie was perfect and executed with great care and precision. I thank you for a great movie... oh and thanks for the humor.

"husks","8","1","7","30 January 2008"," Cloverfield is audacious.
","this review contains spoilers!!!!! - That's a word I certainly didn't think I would be using in conjunction with a movie that I have been sort of dreading, a movie wrapped in a nonsense blanket of mystery marketing. Here's the answer to the mystery: Cloverfield is about a big monster who attacks New York City and the group of annoying, pretty yuppies who have to deal with it while filming it all. That's it. There's no Slusho, no conspiracy, no deeper meaning. There isn't even a reveal of the monster's origins, and it never gets a name. It's actually surprisingly straightforward.<br/><br/>That's one of the two big things that writer Drew Goddard and director Matt Reeves got right; the other is the monster mayhem, which is impressive in scale and presentation (if not always logical - the monster's path through Manhattan makes no sense unless he is specifically pursuing our hapless and hated heroes). The monster is revealed in full, but the movie takes its time getting there, which is appreciated - especially since I wasn't completely over the moon about the final shots of the beast, which are pretty much full frontal. The monster works incredibly well in bits and pieces, especially because its anatomy is so strange; trying to figure out how these disparate body parts fit together is kind of much of the fun. And the flashes of the beast - especially its first face shot during a pitched battle with the National Guard - only add to the nightmarish surreality of the film.<br/><br/>Sadly, Reeves and Goddard messes other things up. There's not a single character in this film to root for, and it's not because they're meant to be difficult characters to enjoy. They're shallow, vapid, beautiful yuppies, the kind of people who, when they start showing up at your favorite dive bar, signal the end of that establishment as you knew it. The main character, Rob, has a huge apartment on the Lower East Side that boggles the mind; we're talking about a space that costs millions in today's market, or even a couple of years ago, if we're assuming Rob bought it while the neighborhood was still 'up and coming'*. None of this would be that big of a problem - after all, I could just revel in seeing these people in terror and pain - except for the fact the movie is structured in a way that indicates we're supposed to care about these people and their relationships.<br/><br/>What pushes the film's narrative forward is the fact that Rob desperately wants to find Beth, a girl he loves but has treated poorly, to save her from the chaos visited on the city. The main characters skip an opportunity to leave Manhattan with the army** to go with Rob on an insane mission to find this girl in a city being torn apart by a massive beast that has risen from the sea and that has little monsters falling off of it, eating people. Watching the movie I found this outrageous - how stupid could these people be? - but talking this point over with Nick I came to a weird realization: I had once done the same thing. On the day that the Twin Towers fell I was home, having overslept. My office was three blocks from the Towers, and my best friend was there - she had actually gone into the city when she saw the first plane hit the Towers because her father worked there. My first reaction was to run as fast as I could to the Brooklyn Bridge to get into Manhattan to try and find my friend. This was a stupid reaction, and a futile reaction, but it was the first one I had, and it was primal and happened without thought. And yet I couldn't buy Rob doing essentially a heightened version of the same thing, and I especially couldn't buy his friends going with him. To me it's a reflection of how little these characters resonated with me - even a reaction that I could identify with from experience feels alien coming from this phony person.<br/><br/>I could go on nitpicking Cloverfield, but this is a positive review. The movie is flawed, deeply, but it works while you're sitting there in the theater, and with a movie like this, that's the main goal. I don't know if Cloverfield will hold up to repeat viewings or not but that first time is a blast. The action propels you along fast enough that you barely have time to raise the logical questions while you're watching, and the set pieces are done with style and verve. The movie has no music until the end credits, which have a bombastic, monster movie theme by Michael Giacchino called 'Roar!'; that theme belongs to the bigger picture movie that tells the full story of what happened in New York City that night, but I'm glad that Cloverfield focused on the small moments (well, as small as they get when the monster seems to be specifically chasing the characters in the film). In a lot of ways Cloverfield reminded me of the seminal graphic novel Marvels, which told the history of the Marvel superhero universe through the eyes of the man on the street. That perspective makes a moribund genre like the monster movie suddenly come roaring to life."
"dlnumich","9","1","7","28 January 2008"," Unique New York
","The movie is creative from the start with an interesting intro that doesn't force you to sit through 30 minutes of pointless character intros. It gets into the action rather quickly and from that point on it is a first person thrill ride. Anyone looking for a unique movie experience should see this movie in the theaters immediately. As for getting motion sickness, just look off screen for a few seconds and most people should be fine. This movie is great and it would be a travesty to not see it on the big screen. The characters are perfect because they aren't big stars and seem like real people, and the writing, including comedic relief is excellent.<br/><br/>Highly recommend to anyone looking for a gripping movie that will leave you pumped after wards. I don't recommend it for anyone that is going to come into it without an open mind. I can only hope that this genre grows."
"ngojlife","7","1","7","19 January 2008"," Cloverfield, first good movie of 2008
","Let's take the movie for what it's worth. It's a monster movie with the touch from the Blair Witch Project. What makes this movie good is the bringing something everyone is familiar with and having a twist, which is the hand-held camera. With the destruction that is happening in Manhattan during Cloverfield, you have to be kind of amazed that the special effects actually look great. Another thing that makes this movie good is that we saw small bits of the monster, never the whole time. That's actually builds up more suspense for the monster, making him more terrifying than if we were to see a good close up of the thing every 5 minutes or so. There are faults with this film, I mean, the acting is mediocre at best. And why does everyone look like they just came out of a magazine shoot? The dialogue is somewhat dumb-witted but when you think about it, if you are being chased by a monster, what the heck are you really going to talk about? I tell you what though, there is small laughter to be had with some of the dialogue which made it quite interesting. The introduction of the characters took 15 minutes too long but once the action comes, it comes hard. It keeps up the suspense, your heart pumping and feel as if you're there with them. I understand that the camera will be problems for people and if you can't stomach it out, I do feel sorry for you because you will be missing a pretty good monster movie."

There are some very funny lines in the movie too which lightened it up a bit. it was very intense and it really gets you into it.<br/><br/>Cons: the monster(s) seems to know every important landmark in New York which is a little ridiculous but i'm thinking Godzilla tipped him off."

"drasiur-nai","10","1","8","21 January 2008"," Cloverfield is a work of art.
","Cloverfield is more a work of art than a feature length film. The way this movie was filmed led me to think that this was an actual home video filmed by an average man at a party, which greatly added to the tone of this film. At no part in this movie was I disappointed. During the movie, I never actually sat back in my seat and thought to myself that this was a ""hollywood"" movie. Cloverfield is revolutionary. Fact: if you do not like Cloverfield because of the way it was filmed, you do not deserve to watch another film that comes to your theater due to your lack of artistic appreciation.<br/><br/>Another point to consider is how this movie was advertised. The one thing that peaked my interest was how mysterious all the trailers were for this movie. It added to the movie, in the sense that I had no idea what I was in for. If you are in for a movie that is like nothing you have ever witnessed in a theater before, watch Cloverfield. So far, Cloverfield is the best movie of the year, and will march on in to 2009 as being the best movie of 2008.<br/><br/>Myth: Cloverfield was weak. Fact: Cloverfield was not weak."

","Now some people have wondered how the title connects to the movie well to tell you I didn't know at first I thought it had to do with the comment at the beginning but I soon found out (careful if you feel like its a spoiler) that in the title it tells you the camera was found in what was central park and I learned that there is an area of central park called cloverfield and that is where the movie ends at. After learning this I thought it was perfect it wasn't one of those titles just given to a movie cause it needs one it's a title taken from the movie which I think is a smart idea. I recommend this movie for people who enjoy movies that keep you guessing and you have no idea what's going to be around the next corner."

","It's on the list with Frankenstein, King Kong, and Alien. Cloverfield is one of the best monster films ever made. What a unique angle to tell the story through the lens of a party goers camera. I hated the Blair Witch Project because all the characters were annoying and the movie went absolutely no where. A 180 with Cloverfield. It uses the same giggling camera style, but delivers on intensity, and substance. You actually feel like you're there. Too many times studios trick us with internet chat hype so that we'll buy a ticket to a piece of crap. This time they teased us with internet hype, and delivered with an even better movie that blows the hype out of the theater. There's no way you won't be pleased. It delivers on every level."

Being a person who suffers from arachnophobia I got goosebumps when the spistrosities (spider/monstrosity) appeared.<br/><br/>The entire movie is filmed in the 'hand-camera' fashion, which few other movies have attempted. I felt it fit the movie good, and I liked the fact that we didn't see any Brad Pitts or Ben Afflecks or Jessica Albas in this film. The 'quiet' actors that were in this film made the movie.

"Winds_of_Destination","8","1","8","21 January 2008"," Awesome...well kind of
","I would love to say that this movie is awesome...but I can't. It's without a doubt very good but the film still has some killer downfalls.<br/><br/>Seen through a hand-held camera from start to finish, a group of teenagers are throwing a going-away party for their buddy Rob. But the party is crashed after a monster devastates Manhattan and gives it one rude awakening.<br/><br/>Many people had problems with the camera, but I have to say, I think most of the people are wimps. The camera can do a good deal of shaking, especially when the characters are running, but the fact that a whole bunch of people have thrown up is completely ridiculous and just means that they are sensitive to even the slightest movement. I liked the camera work a lot; it gave a great sense of realism and had me interested the whole way through, even in the boring 15 minutes that the movie opens with. My only complaint with the camera is that it occasionally cuts a couple of minutes ahead at times where Hudson is forced to put the camera down, so you may miss some of the action.<br/><br/>The horror element is pulled off really well; the camera work makes it really scary because it seems very real. Some of the images are very shocking, but not the monster. You never really see the monster up close and personal until the end, in which its not very intimidating. But it does a great deal of damage to the city and its most terrifying when you can't see it entirely.<br/><br/>The characters are done almost entire realistically. Their mission through out the movie isn't entirely convincing when you think about it, but their behavior, facial expressions, reactions, and emotions all seem entirely human, which a lot of movies cannot convey for the story's sake. But with this movie it's done really well.<br/><br/>So far I've given my props as to why I think its awesome, and I make it sound awesome, but it isn't. The first fifteen minutes are technically boring, but the camera immerses you. The ending is also very disappointing; its extremely abrupt and there is no resolution at all. This leaves you wanting more, wanting closure, wanting to know how the story ends. I'm really hoping for a sequel because there is so much more to know in the movie, and without resolution, the whole movie itself seems kind of pointless.<br/><br/>One last positive note: I really liked the humor in this movie. The movie doesn't try to be funny, the humor is just like real-life humor, and it can provide good laughs.<br/><br/>While there is much to give praise to in this movie, there is no ending to it and the fact that the camera makes you miss some of the action and suspense really hurts the movie. It had all the potential to be great if there were some kind of resolution, but it just doesn't happen. I do recommend it, although most folks won't like the ending of the movie. 7.5/10"

","I've seen a fair amount of comments that this is ""Blair Witch meets Godzilla"", a rather shallow comparison made by people who haven't seen the movie.<br/><br/>The only similarity, in my opinion, is that both lack a sound track and that both are told from the PoV of those experiencing the events through a hand held camera. ( Note - if TBWP made you motion sick, take something before seeing this ).<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the most recent recent movie this reminded me of was The Forty Year Old Virgin - none of the characters in Cloverfield fell into the horror movie cliché camp, no 'annoying jerk white guy', no 'dumb bimbo who gets it for having sex', the characters come across as people we all know. Likable people. And I think that's Cloverfield's key to it's horror. I didn't particularly care for any of the characters in TBWP, but I did care about the ones in Cloverfield.<br/><br/>I'd heartily advise seeing this on as big a screen as possible.<br/><br/>IMO, it's truly a return to the roots of the Kaiju movies, the original Gojira/Godzilla was meant to be horrific, not a fun fest of a guy in rubber suit stomping models, and Cloverfield returns to that root. Well done Mr. Abrams, well done.<br/><br/>*SPOILERISH BIT* As for the ""cool thing"" at the end of the credits, I'd advise Googling it, and saving yourself the run time of the credits."

","Cloverfield is by far the most unique movie of 2008. And it's definitely the most shocking. <br/><br/>If you've been waiting to see this movie, go see it. It may not suit everyone, but its bound to scare a lot of people. <br/><br/>It's always in your face, with every moment seeming so real thanks to the camera perspective. It's by this lone element that makes Cloverfield scary. And yes you are guaranteed to jump out of your seat at least once.

","This movie is totally worth the money even if it last only 80 minutes. The first 15-20 minutes is kind of slow but it blows you out of your seat for the last 60 minutes. The shaky jittering camera is annoying during the slow part of the movie but you will not even think about it once Godzilla on steroids makes it's appearance in Manhatten. The camera man of the movie does a remarkable job considering the fact he is in the worst possible nightmare scenario any one could ever dream. I especially loved his dedication to the video until he could not video anymore b/c of Godzilla's wrath. That was one close encounter even Will Smith could not crack a joke about! WOW! If you liked Sign with Mel Gibson, Blair Witch Project, Independence Day, War of the Worlds, and you did not personally witness 911, then you will love this movie.

"DuDeInThEmOoN42","10","1","8","19 January 2008"," I love this movie!
","What can I say, I'm really glad this is the first movie I will be rating! Cloverfield is incredible. I'm not going to reveal anything about the plot, but I think (despite what others say) it has a deep, intriguing plot that leaves you wanting more by the end of the movie. The emotions of the characters is superb; I (and several of my friends can attest to this as well) get drawn into the action and feel the senses the characters get, even from the beginning. You really feel like you're in that movie, and not to mention Hud adds great commentary. Additionally, this is one of those movies that can make someone feel loss or even potentially cry when the characters die. Seriously, it wasn't just when the characters died that made me sad, it was the way the others reacted. It was so...real. The way the camera was shot adds to the effect of being in the movie. The amateur angles and shakiness (unless you get motion sickness) are excellent, and make the movie all the more enjoyable. I've seen this movie twice now, and I'm bound to see it again. Excellent job by JJ and the cast/crew. Excellent directing, excellent acting (Lizzy Caplan :), intense action, and overall a very classic, memorable movie. Definitely a buy when it's on DVD. Now go out and see it!"
"Anyanwu","8","1","8","19 January 2008"," Monsters Return, Yes!
","Let's start out with this. This is an 8 out of 10 film. And yes, I will see it again. It's really great to see the standard monster come back to horror. Outside of The Host we have missed the creation of a really good monster movie and this is it. Like The Host, somewhat, the concentration of the film is from ordinary people, who are a few in millions being attacked. It does not take the stance of ""the authorities"" and follow where the monster came from and how it can be killed. See Godzilla. But the key to the film is the camera. As has been talked about much about Cloverfield, the Blair Witch perspective does much to lend a sense of claustrophobia and hence extreme tenseness to watch the film. Blair Witch & Cloverfield really concentrate your attention to the fact that you do not have peripheral vision. The camera acts as your eyes. Your normal eye sight allows you to have peripheral vision. Now the camera, in Blair Witch & Cloverfield, having replaced your eyes allows you to see like your real eyes but with the peripheral sight taken away. Your overall vision reduced, makes you very tense and uncertain of even what's right next to you. That's what you feel in Cloverfield. Get some horse blinders and walk around for a day and see how uncertain you feel. That's the visceral response that you get. The camera is greatly used also in the reveal of the monster. You never really get a good look, much like the first Alien film. That also heightens the tension. The dialogue is just enough to keep the pace going. Without the dialogue, the urgency in the voice, the pace of the film would be slower. Just the action alone would make it more difficult to maintain the frantic pace needed. Of course my only knocks on the film are the traditional. Women crying and emotional. Do all women cry and get emotional in the face of danger? Naw. See 28 Days. The sappy parts do slow down the film even if it's just a little bit. Looking into your lover's eyes can wait. Death is near and it could be a painful, ugly one. Get out! Why don't people run like hell when they can obviously see that what is coming is bigger and badder than they could ever comprehend? People run!! This is something terrible. Go See Cloverfield!"
"kirkintha26","9","1","8","19 January 2008"," A movie to ""experience""
","Nay sayers of ""Cloverfield"" will point to the inevitable: it is herky-jerky, kind of plot less, and a tad two-dimensional with a dash of too many beautiful people.<br/><br/>Well, opinions are like... y'know.<br/><br/>Cloverfield takes a tired genre of disaster films and horror melange and brings it into a class that unfortunately has to be compared to ""The Blair Witch Project"" and a few other choice first person horror narratives. However, Cloverfield takes the ""less is more"" genre, from where ""Blair Witch"" left it off and truly brings it to another level. It follows with an unflinching lens (a handicam none-the-less) a group of friends, lovers and relatives in a seemingly mundane day that turns into a classic life and death struggle, and the heroic efforts of the cast as the mysterious events unfold - something (a very big something) is attacking NYC.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is the ""B"" film spirit with an ""A"" cast/crew, and I think that's the point. It takes the cheesy ""Godzilla vs. insert whatever here"" and completely re-invents the way that it is portrayed. I did find the plot a little scattered, other than the story of a group of people on a quixotic quest - but I think that the ""crazy"" viewpoint of the videotape (it's from the viewpoint of someone watching a videotape, not just holding the camera) and people making decisions under pressure is what captivated me the most. That and the fact that you are being given just enough: in the character development, the one camera viewpoint, the special effects, the reveals - that I really wanted to ""experience"" more and more. And how many movies can you say that about? For most of the action, I felt like I was as close as I needed to be. I liked being part of it, but detached at the same time. Cloverfield is thrilling, and I don't get that from many movies anymore.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that challenges you. It leads you along and spoon feeds you, but only because revealing everything at once would have made this a tired story line of city officials spouting BS melodramatic lines about saving the city and the token child and dog routine, everyone running away as the hero saves the day. That's just old.<br/><br/>There are no easy scenes here, not a lot of explanation, no scoring (save for a soundtrack of organic sounds), there are no Hollywood super stars mucking it all up and I know it's not real life - but it feels as authentic as any sci-fi/horror/action movie is going to get. I think the obvious correlations to terrorism etc are contemporary for our time, and to be honest I am good with that: Real and imagined Monsters loom in the deep and can attack at any time.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is not for streamlined movie goers - this is for people who like to feel like they can suspend their disbelief and put themselves into the other persons shoes. Somehow this movie struck a chord with me that's been missing for sometime. It's a shame that a movie like this can come along only every so often. If it did, it would feel like an overused gimmick. Thankfully it runs just long enough to not overstay its welcome."
"Solid_Snake13","10","1","8","19 January 2008"," An Unforgettable Roller-coaster Ride
","Okay first of all, THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. I have to say that this will without a doubt be the best movie this year. Everything about this was good! The suspense was awesome, the monster itself you see a lot of and while it's on the screen you are scared silly! Even it's tiny little monsters freaky as hell, we'll get more into this later in the review.<br/><br/>So now to break this up into parts, the sets were awesome and reminisces you into the events of 9/11 as Godzilla did with Hiroshima. The destruction props and all these other things that happen are just amazing! At times you have to rethink to yourself: ""Is this real?"" The movie looks as if it would actually happen and is like putting yourself in the moment.<br/><br/>The Actors are great, it has very high emotions of sadness, fear, even a little joy. The characters are lovable from the moment you see and hear them, that's what makes the movie so great! These are characters you feel that you know, they could be you, they could be your friends, they could be that guy or girl down the street from your house, but you really know these characters, how they feel and how they react, it really is amazing.<br/><br/>The suspense in this film is some of the best I've ever seen. A particular subway scene will come to mind. It made a lot of people in my theatre scream and cover their faces, it was that intense! Every moment you see the monster you will get tensed up, you'll be like ""HURRY UP RUN!!!"" The real suspense is that you really don't have a clue of what will happen to our characters, will they live? Will they die? And once it happens it's like BAM! and you are shocked.<br/><br/>Okies so now the Monster. A few months ago I came across a fan sketch of the monster and I got excited, it looked scary and ""Monstrous"" and I was very excited to see the movie. Then a couple of weeks ago I found another sketch on my horror movie news site Bloody Disgusting and found out that sketch was real. I was disappointed to be honest, that new monster didn't look too menacing and boy was I wrong. The monster is SCARY and the mere sight of it on the screen is enough to send chills up your spine. The ""Mini-Me"" Monster parasites are well done as well. They resemble crabs and the monster is in fact supposed to be like a whale, and s you may or may not know, Whales carries tiny parasites on their backs that drop off them at times into the ocean. The monster here is no different and these little things are fast and scary.<br/><br/>Now to the main point of the movie...the camera. The entire movie is shot through the lens of a video camera. It's very Blair Witch Project-esquire and warning to the weary, it may cause motion sickness. It didn't bother me much, but whatever, you guys may want to take some pills or something, but that shouldn't stop you from seeing this amazing movie. Now I've heard this from places, but I think they are right, if I had to compare to how BIG this movie is, it's gotta be Jurassic Park. It's the Jurassic Park of the new generation, something we'll still be talking about 15-20 years later, it's a classic. The camera gives that emotional feel the movie needs and it delivers! This concludes my Cloverfield review,SEE THIS MOVIE IN THEATRES!!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! It's an unforgettable roller-coaster ride you'll want to ride millions of times and never get tired of it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"dpo-6","9","1","8","19 January 2008"," Excellent Monster Movie
","Aside from the very drab first twenty minutes or so (though they bear a striking resemblance to most home videos you would see coming from twenty-somethings...) this movie was very, very well done. The suspense level once things get rolling (literally, the Statue of Liberty's head comes flying down the street) is top notch. I found myself white-knuckled for long periods of time, wanting to see the monster, but not wanting to at the same time because I knew what it was capable of. As for the monster, it was very cool, great design, and HUGE! The special effects for such a smaller budgeted film are awesome and Phil Tippet's studio did a great job on the big monster, along with the mites or whatever they were, that were attached to it. The acting is spotty, but for an unknown cast, pretty well done. The best part about the movie though, is unlike the Blair Witch crap, you actually feel like you are running with the characters and it makes the experience that much more intense. Great movie, great CGI and a fun theater experience. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see America's Godzilla (which by the way, Cloverfield's beast would destroy Godzilla if they ever had to fight!). 9/10 for doing what it was supposed to do: create a fun movie experience."

","Filmed on a hand-held camera by a 'drunk Joe Cocker having a seizure' who runs a LOT, this movie is not for those who get motion sickness.<br/><br/>Just as I suspected, this movie is rated by most people as > 7 or < 4. It is definitely a movie you will either love or hate. The shaky cam is over-used, but when you think about it, they ARE being chased by a big *something*.<br/><br/>As for the commenters talking about everyone in the movie being ""self-absorbed""....uh, hello? What do you expect? They are a bunch of yuppies in NY running for their lives...I might be a little self-absorbed, too.<br/><br/>Excellent action. Excellent effects. I happen to appreciate the open-endedness of the movie; I think it adds to the realism. And anyone who goes to see a movie you can't tell much about from the trailers and doesn't check out the directing/producing style of the creators is asking to be disappointed anyway. This movie has J. J. Abrams written all over it.<br/><br/>I would love to see this in the theater again...and hopefully sitting back further than the 3rd row next time to ease the motion sickness effect.

Those little spider bastards were bloody well done too. The acting all felt really authentic, like we really were just watching these people reacting to the situation. So that was cool. There were definitely some little things that irked me, some people surviving at certain points in the film, a thousand questions that I want some answers for, and the really cheesy ending...but for the most part it was badass. Surprisingly pretty great. The direction was top-notch."

","""Cloverfield"" will no doubt live in the history of horror films as the first to retell the classic giant monster tale from the perspective of the first person.<br/><br/>Well done at just about every level, J.J.

By suspending the mystery throughout, we constantly strain to see what we can, hear what we can, and discover along with the characters just what has happened to New York this fateful night.<br/><br/>There will be a faction of movie audiences too reliant on the template, mold version of storytelling today who cannot enjoy this film experience for what it is. That's too bad. ""Cloverfield"", while not entirely original in it's approach, is definitely original in it's concept for this particular genre of horror film."
"kohaku_san16","10","1","9","20 January 2008"," Just awesome.
","I just went to see this film with two friends of mine, and LOVED IT. When it first started with the party I admit that I was getting bored and wondering ""what in the world am I still doing sitting here?"". But as soon as the creature attacked my whole view of the movie changed. I was hooked. I was crying with the characters, I was screaming with them, it had me totally involved from the first attack to the start of the credits. There is no way I could possibly recommend this movie enough. Go watch it! The monster is amazing, and the emotional roller coaster is one of the best rides I've ever been on. And the way they handled the camera work was brilliant--having it all be on camcorder instead of a professional camera made all the difference. The jostling and static really made me feel like I was there, like I was the one with the camera. And the party made me care for the characters a lot. I felt like they were my friends too after a while.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is one of the best I have ever seen and you need to go watch it right now! You have to see it in the theater, otherwise you will miss a lot of the experience!"
"fifthstreetman","8","1","9","19 January 2008"," Godzilla Meets The Blair Witch
","Godzilla meets The Blair Witch. That pretty much sums the film up. I was reflecting on this flick today and was thinking... ""when was the last time you saw a MONSTER flick that was actually scary?"" Modern film audiences are so jaded that it's really difficult to creep people out anymore with a creature/monster. This flick actually had me believing maybe this could happen! I actually found myself getting pulled into the story, thinking: What the hell are those things??<br/><br/>There are many very effective scary moments in this movie, and one particular sequence that actually had viewers in my screening jumping out of their seats. Sure, there's moments that don't quite work, the actors are a mixed bag - but overall a very original take on Japansese Kaiju flicks. ALSO: Thumbs up to actress Odette Yustman, who I felt really stood out amongst the cast. Very sexy. Believe performance. Wish they would of shown more nudity though!! Come on, it's a horror film after all!!"
"t_hoffman","9","1","9","19 January 2008"," Not bad.

People either really like it or hate it with every fiber of their being. I believe that most of the people who have strong feelings against this movie probably feel the way they do because of how the movie was shot. It can get annoying when the people aren't pointing the camera where you want them to but that makes it a little more realistic.<br/><br/>I thought thought the movie was very well done.

"Drumski89","9","1","9","19 January 2008"," I've never been scared by a movie in my life... until Cloverfield.
","This movie was very, very good. Yet many people seem to hate it. Let me explain why. This movie is not a corny Godzilla rip-off, with a crappy looking monster and an all star cast. No. Cloverfield is an intense, realistic, serious movie. The beginning lulls you into a feeling of false security, then when the monster inevitably attacks, it gets extremely intense, almost instantly. However, the beauty is in its immersion. Through the whole thing, you feel like you're there, and you may actually fear for your life at some parts. The camera work is brilliantly done, and it feels completely natural. Some say there is some allusion to 9/11 in this movie, and it offends them. But don't be fooled by those people. This movie's realism naturally leads parts of it to be similar to 9/11, but it's not a bad thing. Realism has been sorely lacking in movies lately, and it was refreshing to see, to be honest. Some critics dislike the characters and feel they're stupid, but they simply acted how any normal person would in the situation they were in. Perhaps you can forgive them for not being experts in monster-studies, and instead being scared and irrational. Indeed, if you aren't a monster scientist either, it's likely you'll be just as scared as they are. I know I was. In closing, Cloverfield is very realistic, raw, intense, dramatic, and exciting. I was gripping my seat for dear life during much of it, and I couldn't let go for several minutes after it ended. See this movie. No ifs, ands, or buts. See it. Just don't expect it to be corny and boring."
"bhiggins-7","9","1","9","19 January 2008"," Cloverfield is an awesome ride, but not for the weak of stomach
","Well, the trailers give you a good idea of what to expect. More or less, you have the typical 'Godzilla-esque' monster ripping New York City and new one, but the entire film is shot through a single home video camera ala 'The Blair Witch Project.' What you don't expect is how well the entire thing works together. Anyone could have made this an amazing epic with background music, dramatic angles, seamless scene transitions, etc. But J.J. Abrahms blends the home camera work into the movie without all this and gives the audience the feeling that they are actually a part of this intense experience in a way that such dramatic frivolities can't.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, you see things through the eyes of the characters. But this does have its drawbacks. At least twice, I spotted folks getting up to head to the lobby, unable to put up with the motion sickness caused by the spinning camera. I suppose that is the only reason I didn't give this a full ten out of ten.<br/><br/>Basically, if you love giant monster films, you'll get a great trip out of Cloverfield. But, if you're prone to motion sickness or anything like that, you might be better off finding something else to watch, or bringing a few of those motion sickness patches along to the theater."
"johnnymacbest","9","1","9","19 January 2008"," Unconventional.
","Having seen the preview of this movie last year, I thought it was going to be ""cookie-cutter material"". But when I actually seen it, it was clear to me that this film is not like any sci-fi film I've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>It gets slow at first but once things kick into high gear the whole shebang sets in and to be frank, its an exhilarating and frantic experience as the players in this piece become entangled into a nightmarish scenario with scenes that hearkens back to 911. It's almost and allegory, in its depiction. Almost. Fear sets in. What is out there? What's going on? What is happening? Is it a terrorist attack, natural disaster? Or is it something else? Something ominous, deadly, mysterious, and ultimately terrifying? <br/><br/>Visually the film is top-notch with its hand-held filming technique and wicked special effects coupled with tension and despair amongst a metropolitan landscape. What makes this film so effective in its storytelling is that its verisimilitude mirrors ours in such spectacular ways. Sure films like Children of Men used some aspects of the techniques described earlier, but to film it entirely in this format is something unheard of before. You actually feel like you're a part of the show. The monsters are hideous and innovative in design and concept. In my opinion, kudos should be given for such impressive displays.<br/><br/>The only nitpick I have with this film is vague info about the creature itself. It would have been great if its origin was coherently more fleshed out. But in a way, it works. Keeping the monsters obscure is more effective. Still, the ending left me with a bunch of questions and that's a good thing. A really good thing. The film is unconventional and that's what sets it apart from the cookie-cutter norm that Hollywood is so known for."

There were also rumors that the movie was going to be poor quality with lack luster effects. This was not true at all. Although the camera's shakiness was disorienting, usually adding to the terror and suspense, the movie was aesthetically exciting and pleasing. The dramatic scenes are gut-wrenching and without the constant witty and sometimes hilarious comments by the camera man, you would lose it. You truly feel as if you are right with them in the action. The one downside to the movie is that it leaves so many things unanswered that it gets a bit frustrating. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Also stay to the end of the credits."

"filipemanuelneto","7","0","1","3 May 2020"," A good ""found footage"" film where New York is, again, devastated in the cinema.
","This film is based on the appearance of a gigantic and monstrous creature in the middle of New York. It is not a horror film in the strict sense of the term, it is more within Sci Fi and thriller. Directed by Matt Reeves, who ensures an effective and interesting direction, the film works very well.<br/><br/>There is much in this film that is not evident. The film plays on it a lot to create more atmosphere and dramatic tension. The creature's origins are never revealed, its real appearance is only shown in very specific moments and the whole film is essentially a race in a besieged city and in great life peril.<br/><br/>Filmed using the odious technique of ""found footage"", it works incredibly well, in spite of the shaky image, cinematography knew how to give perspective in the first person and transport us, to the place and to the action. The actors are complete strangers, and this allows us to better identify with the characters and view the film as a true ""found footage"". Personally, I would highlight the good work of Jessica Lucas, Mike Vogel and Michael Stahl-David. The problem is that the characters are so poor that they could be any anonymous face in that crowd, who we really don't care about. The sets and costumes are also very good, especially in the tough task of reconstructing the destruction caused by the monster. Finally, a word of great merit for the special, visual and sound effects, as well as for the effective CGI that was used in the film."

"ethanbresnett","5","0","2","28 March 2020"," Such a waste of a cool idea
","This film could have been so much better. I'm very disappointed truth be told.<br/><br/>First and foremost I cannot stress enough how boring and uninteresting the first 20 minutes of the film were (considering this film is not long over an hour that's really not ideal). I didn't watch Cloverfield for relationship drama I came for the giant monster. If you are going to spend 25% of your movie before the monster even arrives at least make the human interactions interesting.<br/><br/>This leads to a second key criticism which is the whole plot of the movie. The initial set up established this potential relationship between Rob and Beth, therefore he was determined to go and find her. I just found this to be so frustrating and ridiculous. It beggars belief why directors and screenwriters are under the impression that audiences revel in characters making stupid and frustrating decisions. Bad writing and plot points aren't the only way to put characters in tense and dangerous situations. The film would have played out much better if they were simply trying to escape rather than rescue somebody. Especially Marlena - why didn't she just bounce - she said at the start she barely knew Rob and didn't remember Hud, so why not just get the hell out of dodge.<br/><br/>Some of this could have been excusable if the characters or dialogue were decent - but both were awful. Rob was an annoying character, Hud was wisecracking as if New York wasn't falling apart. There were so many lines where I couldn't help but facepalm.<br/><br/>In terms of the found footage style I'm not a fan myself, and it just didn't work in this context. There is just absolutely no reason why somebody would continue to hold a camera throughout this.<br/><br/>What I will praise Cloverfield on is the underlying concept. I loved how they didn't try to explain the origin of the creature - it just appeared and started wreaking havoc. Too many films get bogged down in attempting to inject some 'science' into these types of films. Cloverfield fortunately didn't fall into that bracket. The monster design was pretty cool, and props to the sound department for generating some chilling monster screams.<br/><br/>Despite all of the above, Cloverfield isn't awful - there are redeeming features and for the most part it is entertaining.

Other than moderately irrational behavior by the protagonist, the other actions are real in context (btw, there's no way this could have happened in LA because everyone would be giving the monster a shoulder shrug and a kumbaya and, besides, the monster would have been stuck on the 405 FOR HOURS ON END).

","20 January 2008. Warning: Spoilers. Except for the very last shot, Cloverfield is a rip off of The Blair Witch Project (1999) of the worst kind. It attempts to take a hand-held video cam and add a more complex plot along with special effects and expect to actually re-create the magic of the original attempt. Unfortunately, from a personal perspective, this was one of the worst movies I've experienced in a while. There is something to be said about the appropriate media format for the theatrical experience. It was the very idea of this was a video tape that distanced me from the action, I didn't feel that I was part of it, I was watching a filtered version, buffered by time and distance. Most of the movie was boring, like watching a home film movie without any editing. The interesting part is that the attempt to imply property of the U.S. Government, as a document, it would have been more believable and effective if the movie had been based on a collection of edited videotapes of the same event. The beginning segment, pre-monster scenes are too manipulative, the exaggerated attempt to make amateur mistakes in filming the scenes became too clique and made the movie feel unreal and fake. The first obvious technical flaw in the movie occurred with the relative quickness of the live televised news report that was recorded by the apparent video cam. The news report came so suddenly right after the strange pounding, vibration that it added to the manipulative unreality. There was a underground scene where the light from the video cam is used to light a path, except what we mostly see are the lighted backs of people that deflect the light so the people shouldn't be able to see where they are going. There is also a scene where an injured woman is haphazardly taken care of, unlike what would occur in real life and then another women is pealed off a metal rod that would most likely of killed her (as the rod itself was likely sealing broken arteries). We have a helicopter that of course gets too close to the monster, we have only the main character's surviving the crash and not the crew. A more effective movie was Brainstorm (1983) that took virtual reality to a new level more almost a quarter of a century ago when it was released, bringing the audience into the movie not pushing them away. The restrictive nature of the single hand-held camera perspective omits so much more film scenes such as the man who falls to his death off a bridge. There is so much that is missed, so much continuity lost, so much choppy editing that there flow of the movie is overly disturbed. Hopefully, film makers will make movies not this return to live reality movie making unless their prepared to really work to make it more authentic, audience involving, and emotionally interesting.

As long as the characters aren't vicious or completely stupid or annoying, I can still enjoy the film. 2. Speaking of ANNOYING characters, the guy who ended up ""narrating"" much of the film, Hud, is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen. Hud may be the MOST ANNOYING character ever, who was above the age of 14 & not constantly screaming. 1. The level of idiocy of the guy going up to ?Central Park South? to rescue his ""girlfriend"" is hard to comprehend. His odds? Zilch. His payoff. Nada.

"charliebrownlee","7","0","1","24 June 2016"," An actually good ""found footage"" movie.
","The monster movie genre died, and Cloverfield was it's last breath. While it didn't bring the genre back, the ""Clover Monster"" is know as recognizable as Godzilla or King Kong to most movie fans. And it's easy to see why. <br/><br/>The movie is quite simple, it follows 5 friends - Rob, Lilly, Marlena, Jason, and Hud, as they flee from Rob's going away party to rescue their friend Beth while a 200 ft-tall monster unleashes hell on New York City.<br/><br/>Except for T.J. Miller, I knew most no one in the film and the acting is actually really good. It's writing is good too, everything is scripted to seem like real life, and it does a good job of it. It has a simple subplot and thank gosh the movie doesn't have the Clover Monster as the main character.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely the best modern-day monster movie. We don't see a lot, and most are bad. Pacific Rim (2013) wasn't bad, but Godzilla (2014) wanted to have a subplot like Cloverfield, and failed, and King Kong (2005) tried to make the large ape a character to relate to, yet that obviously is impossible.<br/><br/>My only complaints would be just a tad bit more screen time for the Clover Monster, and also a good backstory for the beast. I had to look it up, but it makes sense and also ties in with the subplot and main character in an ironic and kind of funny way. I won't say it because it may count as a spoiler. But I think I can live wit these problems.<br/><br/>At the sound of it, Cloverfield sounds like an unbearable movie to watch, and it's not The Shawshank Redemption (1994) or The Dark Knight (2008) but it's good. It's a solid action/horror film that deserves another look and a higher rating from critics and moviegoers.<br/><br/>Now excuse me, I have to go watch 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) because I want to know just what the heck happened at the end there. Seriously, what happened right before the movie ended? Does anyone know?"
"citruspanda","7","0","1","22 June 2016"," A Standard Thriller With Redeeming Qualities
","I saw Cloverfield for the first time quite a while ago, and at the time I felt that the found footage trend was at its inevitable end. Not because of Cloverfield, but because of all the other sub-par found footage movies that go straight to DVD. That is, unfortunately, the undoing of this genre for me. However, I do still thoroughly enjoy a select few, Cloverfield being one of them. I do still like this movie a decent amount, and I think it is just a good movie in general.<br/><br/>Despite that, I do have some problems with Cloverfield. First of which, the time is not managed very wisely at all. With a run time of only 84 minutes, there has to be some haste in which the story progresses. For the first, maybe, 20 minutes or so, the only eventful happenings are rather dull, and only loosely connected with the main flow and story of the movie. This would be forgivable if the movie lasted about two hours or so, or maybe even 1 hour and 40 minutes, but 20 minutes is still 25% of the movie. But regardless, though, the movie is still mostly entertaining. Monster movies have taken a rise in quality recently, in the past 8 years or so, and I can surely call Clovefield one of them. Take movies such as Pacific Rim, Godzilla, and others of the sort, and you find that a serious budget and lots of time are put forth to make them, and it is the same deal with Cloverfield, even though it might not look like it what with the shaky camera and short running time.<br/><br/>But let me talk about the good things with Cloverfield. First of all, the special effects are superb. They are very well done, for sure. The design of the entire movie is just first rate. The creature look just amazing, at the times you actually see it that is. And that is another thing where the movie takes a tumble a small bit. Even though you do see the creature many different times, each of those times lasts only a bit, maybe 5 seconds max, except for one part, but you will see that if you ever watch the movie. This gets very annoying after a while, and you just start to wish the camera would focus a bit more. Although, you can't really ask for much more when a giant monster is chasing you down and smashing stuff all around you. But movies don't have to be realistic, right? Anyway, there are still other good parts about the movie other than the effects. The acting, writing, and everything else, really, is good. There are no boring parts, really. But that's possibly because of the short run time.<br/><br/>The only reason I give Cloverfield a 7/10 is because it doesn't really deliver that KO punch that is rare for a movie. It is a very good movie, and I have pretty much no problems with it at all, save for a few minor things here and there. Nothing comes forth during the movie's run that just blows your mind. Thus, a solid 7/10 for Cloverfield."
"KineticSeoul","7","0","1","16 June 2016"," First high quality found footage movie I saw when it came out
","This is probably the first high budget found footage movie I have seen. it's a giant monster movie that shows it from the normal civilians point of view with a simple story. The simplistic direction for the most part works for a movie such as this as a whole. Cause I don't see how making the whole thing more complex would make this film any better. It's sort of outdated when it comes to today's standards when it comes to movies. But then again there is multiple ""Paranormal Activity"" movies that is just there to rake in the cash. Without giving much away, just think of a Godzilla movie except it goes in a found footage direction where just about everything is in first person view mode. And at it's core, it's a love story about a guy and his friends going the distance. I think this is the movie that started the high quality found footage movie trend. Overall, it was actually something new when I saw it in theaters in 2008. And it's still a watchable movie today.<br/><br/>7.4/10"

"StevePulaski","9","0","1","10 March 2016"," Post-9/11 reaction/response intimately examined through the lens of a raucous creature feature
","Matt Reeves' Cloverfield would be a significant film if it was only noteworthy for being the film that resurrected the found footage genre. With a minimalist marketing campaign of MySpace pages and trailers that emphasized the film's theatrical release date and nothing more, plus a whirlwind of positive buzz that hyped the film for much of the start of the 2008 year, Cloverfield was destined to be a history-making hit when it finally hit the scenes. However, as an encapsulation of post-9/11/""War on Terror"" fear, the film is an unequivocal cultural staple of such simply by showing senseless disaster unfold and showcasing lives that we, the audience, otherwise wouldn't care about had they not been the focal point of this particular film. Few other films about this little find themselves saying so much.<br/><br/>The film opens with a disclaimer by the United States Department of Defense that the film contained on the camcorder herein was seized as a piece of evidence that was found at a location by the name of ""Cloverfield,"" ""formerly known as Central Park."" The tape largely includes footage from a going-away party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David), who will be traveling to Japan to become the vice president for a new company, only on occasion cutting away to a video shot after both Rob and his friend Beth (Odette Yustman) have sex, indicating the film being taped over. During his going-away party, thrown by his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and filmed by his buddy Hudson Platt (T.J. Miller), who is traversing the entire loft to get video testimonies to congratulate his pal, not only does Rob's secret of sleeping with Beth come out, but so does a gigantic monster that begins destroying New York City in every conceivable way.<br/><br/>At first, a thunderous shakeup and a brief power outage suggest an abruptly violent earthquake, but when buildings begin to explode and skyscrapers start crumbling, we can see that a bigger, more unexplainable force is behind these bouts of chaos. Through short glimpses captured by Hudson's camera, we can see that a strange, gray beast of about thirty stories resembling the most deformed monster that Godzilla would fight, is practically walking all over New York City, to the point where it is killing innocent lives and making everything a horrifying mess for everyone within the vicinity. The plan for the group of friends, which also includes Lily (Jessica Lucas), Jason's girlfriend, is to evacuate New York as quickly as possible, but that changes when Rob's call to Beth reveals nothing more than a distressed, blood-curdling scream that suggests she is pinned underneath the rubble of a building. The gang winds up deviating the course instructed by the U.S. Army in order to try and rescue Beth and dodge the towering monster.<br/><br/>Cloverfield takes a Jaws-like approach to profiling the monster in the picture (or ""monsters,"" as I'd like to keep open as a possibility for myself) in that it shows the creature largely in small, blink-and-you-miss-it glimpses. This has become common practice for found footage films, but Cloverfield employs the tactic with a bit of grace and buildup. Rather than acting like a metaphorical ""dollar on a live fishing reel,"" director Matt Reeves makes sure to conjure up adequate suspense before he even thinks about showing us the monster at hand. After that, every small sip we get of the monster makes us fear that we'll eventually get a longer ""gulp"" of the monster that we could choke on if we're not ready.<br/><br/>Reeves keeps us on edge most of the film, and the chaos portrayed in this film is anything but controlled. The videography has the aesthetic grace of an unedited video in a warzone, the sound editing and mixing occasionally feels like it was sent through a blender, and the film, as a work of cinema and the respective found footage genre, is a sensory annihilation. As frustrating as this can be, this process, much like Reaves' directorial conservatism of showing us just small features of the monster and his destructive actions throughout the course of the seventy-three minute film, manages to reveal some truly beautiful and telling moments. Consider the scene when the group of partygoers, and the remainder of New York City for that matter, witness the monster throw the head of the Statue of Liberty over a mile in length before it crashes before them on a busy street. The gaggle of people stand in awe, some frozen in fear, some quick to snap a picture, and some sprinting to safety.<br/><br/>The location of this film and the confusing circumstances are not coincidental; Cloverfield is, in some big ways, a reference to the mass hysteria and uncertainty that the 9/11 terrorist attacks brought on the United States. Actions that we were used to hearing about occurring overseas were suddenly in our metaphorical, and some literal, backyards, and the casualties, the incalculable destruction, and the disregard for life were something we could not ignore. Cloverfield attempts to replicate that feeling right down to its marketing campaign, which tells us little and leaves us with limited expectations. What we witness, however, is something that will leave a mark on many of us, or at least remind us of a similar time in America.<br/><br/>Starring: Michael Stahl-David, T.J. Miller, Odette Yustman, Mike Vogel, and Jessica Lucas. Directed by: Matt Reeves."

","Directed by Matt Reeves and produced by J.J Abrams, this found-footage sci-fi thriller follows a group of friends who vacation to New York City for a going-away party for their friend Rob who is moving to Japan. The party is suddenly interrupted when the city becomes under attack by a giant monster, who destroys the Statue of Liberty and wrecks havoc to the city. When one of the friends' lover is trapped inside a building, they must sprawl across town in attempt to save her while surviving the massive monster mayhem that devastated the city. Featuring the cast of Michael-Stahl David, Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J Miller, Jason Vogel, and Odette Annable, this Godzilla and Blair Witch Project mix packs a punch of brilliant special effects and immense scares and thrills, but is executed with shaky camera-work that can get frustrating at times.<br/><br/>This film was met with critical attraction before its release with its poster showing the dismembered Statue of Liberty, which was also shown in the trailer. This film does succeed on living up to its hype. Director Matt Reeves succeeds on keeping this film moving and giving the script a vision. From the point when the monsters began attacking, the film showers with fantastic special effects and CGI with building collapsing and numerous explosions that leave the city devastated with massive debris, hencing a highly intense atmosphere with plenty of action that resemble the Godzilla movies to polish it. The audience awarded with some incredible thrills and edge-of-your-seat scares, as well as some occasional blood and gore that borders on the R rating. There are, however, some flaws that are worthy pointing, the shaky camera-work in particular. As this is found- footage film, the camera-work gets really shaky and often quite nauseating. It can be especially pesky for the action scenes, making it somewhat difficult to tell what is going on. Overall, it didn't take away from its eerie atmosphere too much.<br/><br/>Cloverfield may not the best found-footage film, but certainly is one of them. However, I do not recommend this film to those who have grown despised of shaky camera-work. Otherwise, this film would make a good pick."

","I would like to preface my review by first saying that I refused to go see this film when it first came out, why? Because I hate Hollywood hype, all the chatter about ground breaking, innovative etc. Well it's all true, I watched the film for the first time at home alone and I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw, if the film was scripted or not I couldn't tell, but what I saw was a portrayal of people caught up in an unprecedented situation and being documented with a hand held camera. The reactions of the ensemble cast to the danger at hand was in my opinion 100% authentic, and what was also great about this film was no typical monster movie clichés, e.g., the scientists talking about the creatures origins; the military leaders planning an attack strategy, so on and so forth. There was non of that stuff, just people trying to deal with the situation the best way they can. The SFX are world class and believable featuring some great action sequences, and I can see how this film set a new precedent for many in this genre to follow,"" Chronicle"" is just one example, so yes after 7 years it was worth the wait."

","Cloverfield (2008): Dir: Matt Reeves / Cast: Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan, Mike Vogel: Creative monster disaster film, which should include a warning of the dizziness of shaky camcorder style filming that can easily cause motion sickness or trigger migraines. It regards a happening occurring within the celebration of a graduate about to journey to Japan. Outside people scatter in fear as explosions electrify the horizon and building are shoved aside to a loud roar. Great idea but structure consists of a lot of people running for their lives and attacked by small spider-like creatures. Director Matt Reeves goes for reality TV appeal, which works for marketing. Victims include Michael Stahl-David who is celebrating his departure to Japan. His girlfriend is played by Odette Yustman who shares a romantic time until the tragedy hits. He struggles frantically to get to her as she is trapped in her apartment. Lizzy Caplan is bitten by a spider like creature and eventually dies. T.J. Miller is attacked by the creature in a helicopter. Then we have hordes of other cardboard characters who barely survive or barely die or both all at once. This doesn't end so well for many of them but the creature is an effective creation when it is eventually seen. The film regards what we don't understand, but what many won't understand is the reason behind the style of filming. Score: 6 / 10"

"Hey_Sweden","7","0","1","10 May 2014"," A good thrill ride.
","Basically a melding of ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"", this high-concept movie is a better than usual example of what has come to be known as the ""found footage"" genre. Whatever it may lack in character development or storytelling skill is made up for by a nonstop sense of excitement. It just thrusts characters and the audience alike into a horrifying situation that nobody can explain and seemingly with little to no chance for escape. It starts out mildly and then around the 18 minute mark it abruptly shifts gears. It's genuinely spooky at times and features a monster that is frightening in its capacity for violence, not to mention its immense *size*. Director Matt Reeves and company, working from Drew Goddards' script, follow conventional wisdom in showing this thing just a bit at a time, gearing up for the big reveal.<br/><br/>The story starts out as a group of friends in Manhattan have a farewell party for one of their number, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who's moving on to a job in Japan. But things go seriously awry when this monster shows up and creates chaos and panic. While the military works feverishly to try to take the monster down and evacuate the citizens, Rob and his friends embark on a mission to locate and rescue Beth (Odette Annable); all the while, the character of ""Hud"" (T.J. Miller), who was given a video camera to record testimonials at this party, insists on documenting the unfolding events.<br/><br/>One good thing is that, at least from this viewers' perspective, the six main characters are basically likable even as they attempt something that looks foolish and suicidal. Once the action starts, it achieves a respectable intensity level, although there are quieter moments when our protagonists desperately try to take a breather. The special effects are generally decent (the image of the Statue of Liberty's head in a street is a memorable one), and the monster itself is amusingly designed and completely bad ass.<br/><br/>If one can stomach the overactive camera work (a bone of contention for many who've seen it), ""Cloverfield"" does manage to be a solidly enjoyable thriller.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","'Cloverfield' has to be one of my favourite movies ever. It's scary, clever and ever so enjoyable. The plot follows a group of party goers that have to fight for survival when a giant alien monster attacks New York. Even though sometimes I think ""haven't I heard this before?"", I was seriously pleased with my movie find. Just to warn people, this is a found footage movie, meaning that it was taken entirely from a cameras point of view, but you don't feel sick watching it, unlike some other movies. The alien itself in the movie is incredibly animated and seriously provides a sense of terror and dread throughout the movie. The whole cast deliver extremely realistic performances and I' surprised that some of them hadn't had much work since this movie was released. The script is realistic, the special effects are great, the actors are completely and utterly convincing- what can I say? In my eyes, this movie is the next 'Godzilla'."

","Cloverfield is definitely something new and interesting. It is a lot like Children of Men in that it completely immerses you in the world the director creates. The camcorder is an interesting lens through which to view New York City and the main characters.<br/><br/>The characters were all realistic and varied, and the whole thing was very believable. The acting was very good, and the special effects were flawless, especially considering the format.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is that there is no real story, and there is no real exposition about the monster that attacks the city. The movie is immersing, and at times pretty scary, but by the time the movie ends, you will be left with no more information about the monster than you had at the beginning. Altogether, it is a good viewing experience but an inadequate film overall."
"NowhereMan64","8","0","1","3 August 2013"," A movie that needed to be made
","Cloverfield is a movie that needed to be made for a variety of reasons. With the recent onslaught of summer blockbusters, with each getting bigger in scale than the next, it's easy to forget about what implications such destruction would have in the real world. Some movies address this issue by either working around it, which is what Pacific Rim did by clearly showing cities being evacuated prior to the action, or actually using it as a conflict that must be overcome in addition to beating the antagonist. Part of the objective in the climax of The Avengers was to contain the alien invasion as well as to get citizens off the streets.<br/><br/>Other movies just completely gloss over this issue like the Man of Steel. Fanboys of which will say it was meant to show what such destruction would entail in the real world. This is clearly not the case, as Metropolis is completely rebuilt a day later without any mention of the casualties. The action in that movie was meant to outdo the Avengers, but completely missed the point in the process.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is as close to what would really happen than anything we will ever get. Imagine, for a moment, being one of the people in any of those movies. Except, like the real world, there would be no giant mechas or superheroes to save the day. A film which such ambition hasn't arguably been made since the original Godzilla in 1954. And Cloverfield does just that.<br/><br/>You get to feel for these characters and imagine yourself in their position. When someone is injured or dies you understand the immensity of that loss in a way other large-scale films are unable to accomplish. And towards the end, most of the main cast die. Still, the film isn't completely nihilistic because at its core it is about spending the last few hours of your life wisely and with the ones you love. The events in the film are a microcosm of the apocalypse and it can be summed up in one scene towards the beginning of the movie, in which Rob's brother explains to him that ""you needs to forget the world and hold on to the people you love most"" before he's interrupted by the arrival of the monster. Truly the creative team knew what was most important above all else. <br/><br/>To further hammer home the point, it's also important to note the objective of the main characters. Again reflecting real life, such an event would be out of the hands of everyday ordinary people like you and I. There comes a point where you can't win the fight. Instead, the heroes in our story only hope to accomplish one thing: to find and stick with the people they love most and ensure their safety for as long as they can. It's a truly heartwarming story amidst the violence and destruction.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, if you come into this movie for the spectacle and giant monster alone the chances are you will be disappointed. I think this is where all the complaints about the lack of monster and too much time spent on the characters come from. But if you want to see an optimistic story about humanity during its 11th hour, where the inherent goodness of people comes out in full force during what can only be described as the end of the world, then you will be left with a film that leaves you moved and stays with you for a long time."

","Cloverfield is a found footage film about a monster attack on the city of New York. While it's not a bad film, it's a bit overrated for a couple of reasons, but is okay overall.<br/><br/>The first 30 or 40 minutes or so are good, but after that it starts to get old (with a few exceptions). It ultimately turns into people running around the city with a lot of shaky camera. On the other hand, the FX are good and there are a couple of surprises here and there.

","I'm sorry for such a low [3/10] rating, but for me this movie failed at the most basic level---I was not able to care about characters. I really, really wanted to like this movie. I love giant alien movies in general--like Aliens, Predator, or even The Mist. I was always aware that I was watching a movie that was trying {and not very successfully] to be a home made documentary about an alien attack. Not once in the movie did I achieve the ""suspension of belief"" needed to draw me in. The special effects were great--it would have been a much better movie if they had picked up guns and started fighting the aliens rather than pursuing an insane and very implausible search for the main character's girlfriend. They would have been better off filling the movie with special effects and battle scenes. I also couldn't suspend belief about the basic premise of the film, videotaping an alien attack on New York-- -no way would I have kept a video cam walking through a dark tunnel with alien spiders chasing me, climbing into a crumbling high rise apartment, climbing into a helicopter, etc. You get the picture. I can't recall I movie I've liked less. I was actually glad it ended. I hope someone re- makes the movie someday. It is a great premise, but poorly done by this film maker."

","The Cloverfield was a very cool and successful experiment that I thought did exceedingly well. It not only kept my attention and stayed interesting throughout the whole thing, it began a new era of film. Actually, I thought that that movie is related with Twins Tower, but I was truly surprised at the end of movie. I thought for one it could have been a bit longer. It only being like one hour and 10 minutes was kinda a let down.Also, I know it was like home videoed but there was a little too much zooming in and out and shaking of the camera. It didn't have the best angles either. It also was hard to see I feel like. The only time you can watch it is if your in a dark area because in a lot of the parts the glare makes it hard to see the screen and whats going on. So this movie is a pretty good movie with a good plot line and amazing special effects. I highly recommend you see it."

","OK, I know, people are getting tired of the mockumentry hand shaken, but not stirred films, but I can't resist a giant monster movie, especially one as good as this! A giant monster with deadly offspring attacks New York City. We don't know where it came from, what it is, other than it can topple over 50 story buildings & is multiplying quickly with fast moving/growing offspring whose bites bring on a deadly infection to whomever is bitten. It is impervious to non-nuclear military attacks, & is wreaking havoc on to the city.<br/><br/>Sounds like your typical Japanese giant monster film, right? Yes, if that was what all this film was about, but it isn't. That's where the hand-held POV camera comes in & tells the story of mass hysteria, & the horror of an unknown terror. Of how a group of young New Yorkers try to survive the onslaught of not just the monster, but the military trying to destroy the monster, & a city collapsing around them. It delves into these characters psyches as they confront certain death, time & time again. How they band together for the good of all & the good of one. There is no fairy tale endings here to make the audience feel better. There is no sparing of heart rendering scenes. This is mayhem, wicked, brutal, & heart breaking. This is what it would be like if this scenario was to ever happen. Real people with deep emotions & attachments losing their loved ones & their lives.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" is a clever heart pulsing thrill ride. It smartly never lets you get to many good glimpses of the monster. Most of the time a shot of the head, the body, the extremities, which make the beast all the more threatening.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" knows how to get your attention! A particularly great scene is one of the head of the Statue of Liberty flying of it's shoulders & landing blocks into the city, rolling to a stop in the middle of a street. A great parable to 9/11. A great parable of pure unadulterated horror of something so incomprehensible happening, that it overwhelms the logical mind. A true demonstration of just how naked & vulnerable we truly are as a species, whether it be against our own kind, or nature.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Cloverfield"" is an allegory to a path that many fear the most & expect the least. A path that has been traveled down time & time again in the real world, but we never would think it would happen to us, until it does."

Including the military in the movie makes me like it even more as well as the very non Hollywood story line (Though the helicopter crashing was predictable) I also love the last clip you see with Rob and Beth on the Ferris wheel and in the distance you can see a black object falling from the sky into the ocean as well as the audio at the end of the credits saying ""help us"" but played backwards it says ""it's still alive"" which makes the movie have a more in depth storyline as well as the DVD Easter eggs which makes it even more awesome. This is the first time I've reviewed a movie so excuse me if its format seems odd. I would also like to say to the people who poorly reviewed this is that if you knew the movie was a shaky camera style film, then rant on how it's nauseating makes me really annoyed because its like being upset at the fact that a flat screen TV is too flat! Poor reviewers also bug me because a lot of them insist that that the story line is bad. Well, what do you expect?

After about twenty minutes the party is disturbed by what appears to be an earthquake. Wanting to see what has happened they all head to the roof and learn it certainly wasn't an Earthquake; they see buildings collapsing and what appears to be flaming meteorites crashing down into the city. Realising the danger they rush downstairs into the street and are stunning when part of a very familiar monument crashes into the ground in front of them! With the danger clearly extreme they head for the Brooklyn Bridge but it is destroyed as they try to cross. When Rob gets a call from the girl he loves saying she is unable to move in her apartment he decides that he must help save her; his friends go with him and along the way they encounter further dangers.<br/><br/>Having managed to avoid major spoilers I was intrigued to see this film as I remembered all the hype in the run up to its release. The most obvious feature of this film is the way the camera is constantly moving around; this does serve to make it look as if it was really filmed by somebody caught up in the events but it is quietly to cause a degree of motion sickness if watched on a larger screen. The feeling of realism is increased by the use of an unknown, at least to me, cast. The cast did a good job, meaning that for the duration of the film I could believe they were caught up in this terrible situation. The special effects were also pretty good; it helped that we didn't see too much of the creatures till near then end. The DVD case quoted a review that said it was 'truly terrifying' but despite enjoying it as a gripping thriller I didn't find it particularly scary; I certainly didn't find it anywhere near as frightening as that other found footage film 'The Blair Witch Project'. At seventy minutes, excluding credits, this film is very short but this can be justified by the fact that it is meant to be recorded on a single tape this idea is reinforced by occasional gaps in the filming where we see what was on the tape before. Overall I wouldn't call this a much see film but it is worth watching if it is on TV or picking up if you see the DVD in the bargain bin."

Cloverfield's ferocious alien invasion started off on a perfectly wonderful note with the creature literally knocking the Statue of Liberty's block off.<br/><br/>Yeah. I couldn't have thought of a better way to get the ball rolling in this surprisingly well-done Sci-Fi/Horror film. I must say that seeing that treasured national monument irreparably damaged was a really nice touch.<br/><br/>Kudos to director Matt Reeves on that one.<br/><br/>Since I already knew in advance that this film was yet another shaky, hand-held camera production, I was all prepared to hate it as much as I ultimately hated the likes of Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>But, alas, I am pleased to admit that I was quite entertained and pleasantly satisfied with what Cloverfield had to offer me as its final product. I mean, this was clearly no low-budget production.<br/><br/>Yes - Cloverfield certainly had its share of terrible moments (like the pure asininity of Rob Hawkins' rescue mission of Beth). But, with that stuff aside, the level of panic and mayhem generated in the story was nothing short of excellent. And, that, coupled with some superb, ass-kicking visual effects had Cloverfield bending over backwards to deliver a considerable sized wallop in the essential categories of thrills and chills.<br/><br/>In conclusion - As it was at the beginning of the alien attack with the decapitation of the Statue of Liberty, I thought that it was a very nice final touch that the entire cast of characters were all dead at the end of the film. I mean, considering what I had to endure from that bunch of cell-phone clinging, yuppie puppies at the beginning of the story during Rob's ""going away"" party, they all so rightly deserved to be annihilated, one and all.<br/><br/>Bravo to director Matt Reeves for a job well done."

","I'll start off by saying my expectations for this film weren't entirely high. Normally, I hate POV-camera movies. 'The Blair Witch Project' was really disappointing, and 'Paranormal Activity' was just boring. But 'Cloverfield' did what these films didn't. You will honestly stop thinking that professionals made this; after not long you start to honestly think you are there with the characters, seeing what they see. The photography captures everything; the camera-work feels deep, and in one scene, even, in which our heroes are atop a very high ledge, we could swear we are scared of the height too. The film is alive.<br/><br/>The writing is very clever and the characterisation is very rich. Every time we lose a hero, we feel it hit home hard. Whatever the characters feel, we also feel. It's very connected.<br/><br/>There are some very good tricks in there, too. The style in which the aliens are photographed makes the film all too more exciting and scary. The film feels exhilarating, and I was certainly very pleased.<br/><br/>Another point of greatness is the short clips of the other film on the supposed tape. This is a very clever device used by the film-makers to make us want to see more, to identify with the characters, and it works incredibly well.<br/><br/>'Cloverfield' was a much better film than I had hoped, and I do recommend it. It's possibly the most effective POV-found-footage film ever made.<br/><br/>9.6/10"

","CLOVERFIELD Actually, I had heard this movie before my teacher suggested us. Because in that time, there are some heated discussions about the topic of the movie. According to some people's view, Cloverfield is continuation of 'series of Lost'. In this movie, a group of young people have a party on the highest floor at block of flats. The party which seems to be enjoyable and humorous is dropped out with an explosion like an earthquake and the electricity is cut. After the first big and unpleasant surprise, they start to escape from there in fear. But suddenly, they meet New York streets which are on fire, blaming and in wreckage. While I was watching this movie, I was so frightened and excited. For example, the scene of monster is showed in a few period but totally realistic. It made me really thrilled. But, on the other hand, the movie is shot with a man's handy camera. Therefore, it is a bit amateur. Yet, this situation gives a widespread confusion for the atmosphere. You may live that scene like a real event. I watched all the movie in order to see and not to miss the scene of the monster. Finally, it is a wonderful science fiction. My point is 8/10. I will advise everybody to watch!"
"cgsoldier22","8","0","1","5 January 2012"," Recognize what Abrams goal was in this movie
","People are complaining that this movie was shaky and bad effects and story did not tell you much. That was Abram's goal! There have been hundreds of monster movies out there, but they are all showed like a real movie with usually a happy ending. But we have never really seen a monster movie from the point of a view of one group of people. That is what makes this movie original. Most monster movies show you the heroes and army fighting the monster, but what about all the civilians who are trying to stay alive while these events unfold? That is what we got with Cloverfield.<br/><br/>What would you have done if you were in the situation? If you call the characters stupid, then you put yourself in the situation and try and say that again. They were scared and shocked, its not everyday your city gets attacked by a giant monster and the Statue of Liberty's head flies onto your street.<br/><br/>And for all of you who are complaining of not getting answers...that is what makes the movie more exciting and scary. The feeling of not knowing is even scarier. Abrams could have made some cliché explanation like it was an alien or something buried underground, but he did not. He left that for us to figure out, and I doubt everybody in that city was getting an explanation of what it was. They were too busy surviving. The point of this movie was to put you in the situation of an attack on the city. Also watch the ending and see something fall into the ocean. Love the mysterious feel of the movie. Great Marketing campaign, exciting, thrilling, and original. Recommend it for a fun movie to watch with your friends."
"Kratos666","7","0","1","2 January 2012"," Monsters in Manhattan? Who would've thought..?
","""I had a good day."" <br/><br/>I remember when I saw the teaser trailer for 'Cloverfield' at the cinema. Having Lady Liberty's head thrown to the streets of Manhattan. Wow. At the same time, advertisements of 'Cloverfield' started to take over the web. Little did they tell about the movie but I guess it worked cuz the audience found the movie.<br/><br/>I basically knew nothing of Matt Reeves, the director, but I guess everyone knows who J.J Abrams is. The man behind 'Lost' and the amazing 'Star Trek' reboot and 'Super 8' as his latest film. All you need is one talented name in the production and the interest level goes way up.<br/><br/>'Cloverfield's' 15-20 first minutes focuses mainly on the main characters. Character development shown thru flashbacks found on the camera recorder and the ""live"" development going on at the party and voila. There you got the assembled characters for things to come. I consider these first minutes prior to the main event important, cuz if you'd have like no interest in the persons, the film would not work at all. Some may look at this as something very dull and useless but they don't know sh*t...<br/><br/>After the Statue of Liberty scene, the viewer is put straight to the core of the action. The viewer knows and sees just as much as the characters. Answers like ""what, why and how"" aren't answered. You have to experience them yourself. Things aren't explained at any point, not even during or after the credits. The film starts as an evidence clip found on the site ""formerly known as Manhattan"". This leaves a good ""aftertaste"" when the film has ended.<br/><br/>The richness of 'Cloverfield' lies in its technical execution. Some may feel the shaky hand-held camera as annoying or whatever but I think that this is the stronger parts of 'Cloverfield'. This documentary like feeling works nicely and I couldn't think of any other way on how the filmmakers would have shot the film.<br/><br/>Use of the lesser known performers is also a good thing. It makes 'Cloverfield' look more ""realistic"". I really wouldn't wanna see any of the Baldwin brothers or any other B class has-been screaming in panic on the screen. The performers do a good job but then again it's mostly just panic like fear and screams displayed on screen. But I have to mention once more that it all seems so realistic.<br/><br/>'Cloverfield' isn't the most profound movie out there but it does have some fine, intensive and exciting scenes. It does have some illogical things here and there but as a 80 minute thrillride it works perfectly."

","Cloverfield, a movie about the invasion of various kinds of creatures. To be honest when i first watched the trailer it exactly took my attention and i really was eager to watch it. Being recorded with a hand camera, it couldn't be more exciting. While watching it, it was like i was one of these guys who were running around, screaming, trying to escape. I am not sure if people still find this kind of movies interesting but in my opinion, the reality the movie had was amazing. Specially the parts when the guys were going through a tunnel and the bravery the girl had was worthy seeing. Another thing is that i noticed some similarities related with other movies like Descent. While they were going through the tunnel he was like 'activate the night vision'. The moment i heard that i remembered the movie Descent. Honestly, the things i saw when they activated the night vision freaked me, the movies would be better without these similarities. This was one of the things i paid attention to and while seeing the other comments previously made, it seems there are a lot of more similarities related with other movies. Compared to the other science fiction movies, the Cloverfield is quite different than the others. Advice watching it to lovers of science fiction. 7/10."

","I thought it was fantastic. Very entertaining, and even works on the small screen. I thought the beginning of the attack was well done and the panic was very believable. Had a bit of a trawl through the thread and yes, a person picking up a camera time after time is weird, but as argued, there would be no movie if they didn't. If you didn't like it, the alternative would be watching 5 minutes of people's feet before the camera was smashed.I actually enjoyed the start, thought it did a good job of identifying the characters and also delaying the attack. It wouldn't have been half as effective if you didn't have some semblance of reality to relate to, some idea of how people were affected, when the mashing monster took over. Lizzi Caplan was probably the best in this, and her injuries and death were very unnerving, as was the whole tunnel scene.Some faults but not overly significant - the actors were quite good but I get the feeling Yustman was there for her looks, as frankly her waking up from unconsciousness after a horrific injury was quite bad. More like she had just woken up from a light sleep. 10 minutes after her metal-rod-through-the-shoulder accident, she was bombing it down the street. I suppose that was necessary though."

","Oh, my. My, my. Here I was, expecting an interestingly modern monster movie. What I got was...I don't quite know. I only know I kept leaving the sofa to do something else, saying out loud, ""Oh, come ON, already."" And I have to say, after the first 5 minutes of the opening party scene, I was already cheering for whatever monster was coming. I was rather hoping he'd hurry, too. To be fair, people truly are that tiresome and annoying. They do act like their romances are life-and-death. But this does not especially make me want to see if they can survive hell. What else? Little things. Like, the band of 'heroes' apparently walks from Spring St. to 59th Street through the tunnels? Three miles, one subway tunnel, and the critters, too? Hot damn. Or that no one is insistent that the girl literally ripped apart by the bug get medical attention when they astoundingly walk into a makeshift hospital, because the hero has to explain about his trapped GF first? Or that, traumatized or not, the surviving hero and GF seem to forget that the city's about to be nuked? Or that Hud, the cameraman, is the most severely irritating idiot ever? Or that, as noted elsewhere, the U.S, military is on the scene in full force minutes after the first attack, which ties into why lots of people would think it smart to traverse a bridge when buildings are flying? Ultimately, though, it all comes down to: you just care nothing at all for these people, and the pitiful rescue-the-beloved angle only makes it worse. PS Manhattan, nuked? I'm OK with that."
"robotbling","8","0","1","12 December 2011"," Probably the best ""Giant Monster"" movie
","(www.plasticpals.com) Back when Cloverfield was about to hit theaters, there was so much hype surrounding its imminent release that I was taken aback. I find that if I jump onto the hype train, all too often the destination is underwhelming. Disappointments are things to avoid, so I generally stay away from movies that are touted as the next big thing. It's been awhile since Cloverfield arrived on DVD and I finally gave it a shot.<br/><br/>By now the cat's out of the bag, so I don't feel like I'm spoiling anything by laying out the premise for the film. A giant monster of unknown origins begins attacking New York, and a group of friends manages to handycam their experiences during the event. Though the film is shot in the frenetic style of The Blair Witch Project, and theaters warned moviegoers of potential motion sickness (which I usually experience), I didn't find Cloverfield to be nauseating at all. The film is short – just long enough, really – and manages to catch its breath every now and then, which also helps.<br/><br/>The genre has certainly had its ups and downs over the years. From classics like Jurassic Park to downers like Godzilla, monster movies are hit and miss, and more often misses – but Cloverfield is damn good. The script pays respect to the genre's Japanese heritage with the main character of the film soon leaving for a job opportunity in the land of the rising sun, but this trounces Japanese canon, and virtually every other giant monster movie ever made.<br/><br/>The characters manage to draw you in, and you'll find yourself really rooting for them. The action set pieces are all fantastic despite being fairly stock, mostly due to the incredible visual effects. I can only imagine the horror of a visual effects artist trying to matchmove the jittery camera-work in every scene – or spending weeks creating buildings that get destroyed on screen for less than 5 seconds. The hand-to-hand combat that takes place in the film matches the human prey against their cg predators convincingly, too. Monster movies are about spectacle, and this one certainly makes good on its promise. And despite the insane premise, manages to suspend your disbelief by presenting the adventure in very realistic fashion.<br/><br/>I can only imagine how well this film must have been received in Japan. Cloverfield is the ultimate monster movie, and I would definitely recommend you check it out if you haven't already."

","Don't really want to give too much away of the storyline about this phenomenal film, so I won't, but just about everything was excellent. The opening scenes were arguably very boring and mediocre, but I found they really set the scene and gave the film a sense of normality: that was to change however. Things then started to get shuddery, and not just the camera. As the entire movie was filmed upon a hand-held video camera, some people may have found that a spoiler, but unless you suffer from motion- sickness, I for one found that to be a good idea.<br/><br/>All in all, in my eyes of course, I personally found the film to be filled with the tremendous thrills and exhilarating excitement.

","I do not like these kind of films. Firstly, the monster was not realistic. If it was like a real monster, it could be very good. But, there are a lot of things that I liked. For example ; it was like real in terms of video-taping, the sound system, actor' and actress' feelings. I felt it while I was watching it. And, I also liked their friendships. When people saved their own life, they helped each other. For example ; when Rob's girlfriend was injured, Rob's friends helped for her. In real life, this can't be. It turned romantic film into a horror film. I thought that he would a murder whose name is Hud. Because, his sound was so scary. He could be like a monster. And then, I saw a monster. I was wrong. There were a lot of things that I did not guess. If it was a classical movie, I could not continue to watch it. When Rob's brother and their friends died, I felt what they felt.

","Done in the same style as breakout 90's hit, ""The Blair Witch Project"" and directed by the creator of ""Lost"", Cloverfield may seem like a risky proposition. But you can be assured that this one is worth any time or money you invest in it.<br/><br/>I'm not such a big fan of the mockumentary style, that is quickly becoming common-place in the horror genre, but no film before has handled the style like Cloverfield. The camera style is not only used to create a more realistic feeling, but is also strategically used to build up tension and scares.<br/><br/>The characters and special effects are top-notch and the non-existent storyline only makes things scarier. We never truly discovered the truth of what that ""thing"" was and personally I hope we never do.<br/><br/>My motto for horror is, ""The less you know, or the less sense it makes, the scarier it is.""

","This is my review on Cloverfield. Now let me first say that this in no way is a perfect movie but I do not think it deserves all the trash talk that it gets from people. I think the acting from most of the cast was great and it deserves a watch.<br/><br/>This movie is about a group of friends that live in New York city (big surprise I know) So during a going away party they are throwing the city is attacked by something. They strive together to try and survive the turmoil making their way through the city.<br/><br/>Now I have heard many complaints about this movie. First off being thats it shot from the handi-cam type of view. So in that light there is little back story on the characters and very little information on the monster. Though I find it much better that way personally. It feels as if you are in the movie. Think about it if we were attacked we would not have any information on the monster so I think it feels right. It is way better then any other sci-fi flick with some cheezy back story.<br/><br/>Another common complaint is that the monster looks ridiculous. In my opinion thats the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Who knows what kind of creatures lie in the great vastness of space. Not me not you not anyone. The monster could literally be anything.<br/><br/>Bottom line this movie is not perfect there is little story line and even less character development. Even though those movies are not usually for me this one had its perks. I thought it was a fun ride and if you are looking a brainless thriller you can just sit and enjoy then this is for you."
"curio-jogger","10","0","1","8 July 2011"," I have to write a review.
","I loved the trailer of this movie. And i had so high expectations when i finally started to watch the full movie. For my surprise - Cloverfield was much better than i could imagine the best movie ever to be.<br/><br/>Not because of the story, there pretty much wasn't any, and not because of special effects, tough they were great. Here is why:<br/><br/>The movie was so realistic. For real. I wouldn't even call it a movie, it is a future documentary. Because if something like that should happen someday, what you see in the movie, would be exactly how i imagine it would go down. <br/><br/>The cast and acting. Actors and actresses were all perfect, not because of their looks or anything like that. They acted exactly like human would in a situation like that. Furthermore. Every last person in the movie acted the way i believe they would act, it wasn't just endless terror and panic, people weren't headless sheep, running allover, at least most of them managed to stay clearheaded, and i believe that is how we would act to a situation like that one.<br/><br/>The alien. I believe the monster was a alien, there were many things to support that, but that is only my opinion, so don't worry, i didn't spoil anything :) <br/><br/>I usually don't like monster type aliens, i prefer human like ones. But have to say, however weird it was, i am sure it did hes job, he wasn't supposed to be intelligent, he had to be scary. <br/><br/>Here comes things that may be considered as SPOILERS!! So don't read this until you have seen the movie.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the scene, where for the first time military strike back with infantry and tanks, it was SOO real. I felt like i was in the middle of the battle. Some reviews complained, that how come the tanks got there so fast? To them i say: I was so into the scene that i didn't even wonder that, but if you want to know, then here is how i think it is possible:<br/><br/>i don't live in USA, but i believe that US army keeps some tanks near NY, it is the biggest city in America. <br/><br/>Do you really believe that US army couldn't spot that HUGE monster before, maybe hour before, the drunk party guests?? To me the timing seemed perfect, and i loved that the bombers showed after what might have been like hour-two.<br/><br/>I loved how the military gave some of their spots on helicopters to some strangers, and took the hummers. Facing pretty much certain death.<br/><br/>I loved how even tough you knew that something will attack in this movie, it still got you off guard. It came on a moment you would not expect.<br/><br/>Loved the alien missiles/thrones... were very alien-like.<br/><br/>Loved how people started to take pictures of statue of liberty-s head.<br/><br/>AND THE MOST IMPORTANT.<br/><br/>With a movie like cloverfield you have to think about movie named Skyline. They are similar, with the difference that skyline is the worst movie ever created, and Cloverfield might be the best.<br/><br/>And another thing i read from other reviews: People asked that how come the camera survived the nuclear attack? Or the impulss should have erased the tape. <br/><br/>I Ask!! Why in the hell you think it was a nuclear attack??? WHY? No one said that. I actually don't think that the covernment would give a go for a nuclear attack on NY just because one bombing and couple of tanks weren't able to kill it. <br/><br/>Loved the ending. If you found some things unbelievable in the movie, then ending was not one of them. Great ending makes the movie for me.<br/><br/>I am sure there were many-many great things i am forgetting to mention, but i have to end this review someday.<br/><br/>In conclusion... THIS WAS THE GREATEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN, i believe, SINCE EVER."
"EdgarST","9","0","1","7 July 2011"," Very good
","A slight problem with films like ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"", whose stories we see through the eyes of someone behind a camera, is that it is improbable that in situations of such a stressful nature anyone would keep on registering the events, even in fantasies like this one, which are ruled by parameters far from the realistic. And, as in ""Titanic"", most of the events would probably happen in darkness... It is obvious that nobody would like to watch a dark screen while people shout, but just imagine the real events of the Titanic tragedy, deep in the dark, and in a chilling ocean... This is hard to convey cinematically. This said, ""Cloverfield"" is one very good motion picture, dark, pessimistic, terrifying. You may think I am pushing things too far, but for me this is a most telling metaphor of American people's fears, (the more so with the action taking place in New York), just as the Godzillas, Mothras and Rodans were projections of the Japanese panic after the atomic bomb experience. The film has a by-the-book script with plot points where film industry lawyers unwittingly want them to be, a love story that (not surprisingly) is the raison d'etre of the whole enterprise, adequate rhythm, little music, and it is short as it has to be, before a know-it-all starts making ""Cartesian"" demands."

","From the second I saw the trailer at Transformers I was hooked. I wanted to see the trailer again more than I wanted to see Transformers. I immediately was sucked into the hype (which was executed perfectly).<br/><br/>Rarely have I ever wanted to see a movie more, and rarely has that movie met my expectations so thoroughly. The trailers were awesome, and people trying to decipher them helped build the hype. From ""It's a lion"" to the people deconstructing a half second glimpse of the monster as it went out of frame. Loved the hype.<br/><br/>Now, the movie itself. Basically handles a huge monster invasion of New York as if it were totally realistic. People running, people looting, people not knowing what the hell is going on, etc. I love disaster movies that try to be as absolutely realistic as possible and I thought this movie did that very very well.<br/><br/>The monster(s) : I'm still not convinced that there weren't 2 monsters. I know the primary thought is that there was just the 1, but the one which ate Hud at the end seemed smaller, and when they bombed at the very end it seemed like the bombs were hitting far away, when the monster that ate Hud was close. Very well done in my opinion. Large, scary looking, with the little parasites falling off it that made it extra scary and cool. I almost like the parasites more than the big one. Of course the best scenes are the ones where you can see the monster walking among the buildings and wrecking stuff. I would have liked maybe 10 minutes more of these scenes, but I can live without them.<br/><br/>The people : OK, Hud is a bit annoying, but it's realistic to me. There's always an annoying douche. And some of his comments are funny and timely. I don't get the hate for him. I thought there was just enough of the background party scene to establish the people and a little bit of their motivations. People bang on those scenes, but they aren't bad. I love the scene where Hud's gonna talk to Marlena and loses his courage.<br/><br/>I would definitely like to see more obviously. I'd like to know how they killed the monster (if they did) and what happened during the naval battle shown in the pictures on the website, and what happened at the drilling station shown in the viral videos where the Japanese guys are escaping and get annihilated.<br/><br/>I'm pretty upset at Abrams for not making a sequel. The movie made lots of money and I want a sequel.<br/><br/>Best monster movie of my lifetime easily."
"DEATHSukka4","7","0","1","27 June 2011"," Fresh, intense, and exciting all around.... but does ""Clovi"" dethrone Godzilla?
","I never got the chance to review this movie, but now that JJ Abrams has released yet another monster movie blockbuster (Super 8, 2011), I thought maybe people would be turned on to Cloverfield. Perhaps this review might offer some insight on the film, but probably not...<br/><br/>In a time of remakes and Sex in the City, Cloverfield was exactly what Hollywood and cinema all over the world needed and it was refreshing to see an all but forgotten genre revisited.<br/><br/>With the perfect marketing strategy, JJ Abrams and his production company Bad Robot had interested movie-goers on pins and needles as clues revealed more of what Cloverfield was about. An extensive viral marketing campaign, some of which is still up today, brought amazing depth into this movie. Although very little of the viral marketing is referenced in the film, those who watched carefully the prior year of the film's release were treated to a spectacle nonetheless. And even after all this hype, Cloverfield excellently delivered.<br/><br/>The whole style in which the film was shot is important, because I believe it's a realistic reaction of today's society. In a metropolis like New York City, homw to millions, there is bound to be thousands or even tens of thousands of video cameras in operation at any given moment - web-cams, cell phone cams, handhelds... You know it kind of reminds me of the ""tornado"" event that swept through New York City last year (2010). The following day, there were hundreds of videos uploaded to Youtube documenting all the different perspectives from different areas of the city. Of course this is also reminiscent of 9/11. Nothing brings more closure to a situation than seeing it from eyewitness points of view, where the intensity of the event is not just seen but more-so experienced. A lot of people docked Cloverfield for the shaky, awkward hand-held camera style but it just wouldn't have worked any other way.<br/><br/>While I think it was a pretty genius idea it also presents an awkward point to build a sequel from too. Should it also be shot in hand-held? If it were, than would it really be worth seeing in theaters again? It was an intense effect, but I don't think it would be as marketable a second time.<br/><br/>The actors are decent but definitely no Oscar winning roles here. While they do provide enough of a emotional connection to the audience to really bring them into the movie, the only real flaws are the inconsistencies in behaviors and really forced dialogue. It didn't help JJ Abrams to keep the movie so secret that not even the cast had a full understanding of what was happening and sometimes it shows as the dialogue and reactions seem random at times and ""no-sells"" certain effects or even a whole scene. For example, there is no dialogue about the monster or the event itself - most of the dialogue revolves around Rob's lost girlfriend, who they set out to rescue instead of saving themselves. In fact I don't think they ever mention the monster or the parasites that drop from it. It's pretty awkward that the only real dialogue about what's going on is mainly gathered from newscasts or military jargon happening in the background. The actors do simply a satisfactory job with what they had to work with - which is saying a lot because they had nothing to work with in the first place.<br/><br/>The real star of the show is of course Clovi (the monster), of who JJ Abrams reveals bits and pieces of throughout the movie. He doesn't seem to have any particular superpower but even though his lungs are located outside of his body Clovi is impervious to explosions and all kinds of different military ammunition. His mannerisms on camera seem animalistic but otherwise he seems to have some sort of political agenda when not in the frame of Hud's hand-held. In the production diary on the DVD, he's described as a confused baby that's maybe defending itself in an unknown alien world, but ripping off the statue of liberty's head and tossing it across the city directly in front of Hud could earn him some votes in Iran, Russia, or North Korea. Now Clovi seems to get around despite the fact we don't see him move too much in the scenes he's in. Mostly he's roaring at the camera while the military frantically fires away, doing as much damage to the city as the monster (see War on Iraq). But he seems to be heading to the same part of town as our band of heroes because wouldn't you know it - they just keep bumping into each other! <br/><br/>Well... JJ Abrams claimed that he wanted America to have its own monster and to have its own franchise comparable to Godzilla in Japan, in which apparently there are entire stores devoted to the King of Monsters. <br/><br/>The reason why Cloverfield doesn't live up to Godzilla is because it would had to have been released at that time in Cinema when monster movies were the big thing, way back in the 1950's and 1960's. Hell, they could've had a competitive run back in the 1980's even... but for today's audience a monster movie is more of a cliché, corny spectacle rather than a truly scary experience. There was a time that Hollywood was over-saturated with the same old monster movie, remade time and time again. So right of the bat, the timing of Cloverfield is way off - by two decades at least. But then again, it was refreshing."

","My only regret is that I didn't see this in the theater. My first view of this was on DVD. I'm sure it looked great on the big screen. That aside, I just love this movie. It's the best monster movie I've seen in a long while. The set up in the beginning, which introduces the characters, isn't too long and drawn out. You learn pretty quickly what the people's relationships are and what they're all doing there. It doesn't take long to get into the action. Once that action gets going, it's nearly continuous. All the actors did a fine job in their respective rolls and I liked the hand held camera. I realize that not everyone likes the look of hand held camera filming. It can be distracting for some people or even dizzying. I like it though. It draws you right into the action and the emotions of the characters. It makes me feel a part of the movie almost. My emotions took a ride right along with the characters'. There was never a chance to be bored. Also, I don't mind not having all the answers. I'm fine with just not knowing how it all started. I knew as much as the characters did. I found the ending fitting. I was quite satisfied at the end of it. The driving force of this movie is the dialog and the characters. I would recommend this movie even though I know people who say negative things (without seeing it). I say, let yourself get swept away and become part of the struggle for survival."
"Eternality","8","0","2","31 May 2011"," Cloverfield is a sensation, a movie event that's ought to be experienced.
","The first major film of 2008 happens to be the most debatable. You either like it or loathe it. Few will choose to sit on the fence. Yes, I give it an 8/10, pretty high by my strict standards, but nevertheless very justified. As a critic points out, Cloverfield is to monster movies what The Blair Witch Project is to horror. Possibly only the second film to emulate the marketing and filming techniques of The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield's success in drawing mass appeal from everywhere lies from the word-of-mouth rather than relying wholesale on creative posters or spectacular trailers. <br/><br/>The 'camcorder' technique or what I term as the 'camera on a trampoline (COAT)' technique has been used sparsely in many films, even as recent as The Bourne Ultimatum. Apart from The Blair Witch Project, it has never been used to compose a full feature-length film before. Forget about Godzilla, or The Host, or a whole bunch of monster flicks you can find at your nearest DVD rental store, Cloverfield is probably the most uniquely assembled film of that genre ever. It kicks you in the butt, and pulls you by the neck, dragging you into an experience that cinema rarely offers - witnessing a monster attack in New York through the lens of a video cam. <br/><br/>How I must emphasize that Cloverfield fulfills that precisely. There's no introduction, no ending, no clear explanation on the monster's origin or its demise, and there's bad scripting, editing, and directing - all the characteristics of a tape from a camcorder. What the heck is Cloverfield? Is it even a movie? Why should I put up with something that makes me feel dizzy for ninety minutes? If you did ask such questions, then you weren't mentally prepared for the picture. <br/><br/>I have to admit though there are a couple of major flaws. If it's a tape recording, then why is the sound and sound editing (which should be nominated for Oscars) so clear and undistorted? And why is there no dust or soot smearing some part of the lens? Ignoring these flaws mean that Cloverfield is not as realistic as it should have been. But it's a compromise which most viewers will agree. After all, a movie has to be of a certain respectable quality. <br/><br/>Cloverfield is a sensation, a movie event that's ought to be experienced (regardless of how it affects the viewer). Yes, it's risky business. The filmmakers dare to try something unorthodox even if it means theater walkouts, viewers' condemnations, and even possible box-office failure. Cloverfield is an important film because it's deviative rather than derivative. To some of us, it's a gem. For the rest, it's an unforgiving, I-feel-like-puking exercise in visual disorientation. <br/><br/>GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."

","""Cloverfield"" isn't by any means a solid Horror movie and it doesn't even ranks high amongst ""monster flicks"".<br/><br/>Sure, the ""Blair Witch Project"" camera angles work very good because of the plot. Having some mad aliens terrorizing New York was an original and likable idea.<br/><br/>The romantic plot between the main characters makes you care about them. So, through their eyes, we are able to witness the horrors caused by the invasion. <br/><br/>There are some tense moments, great f/x, good score, and perfect pace. Not my cup of tea because in terms of intensity, ""Cloverfield"" should be more adequate for a younger audience.<br/><br/>P.S. The chicks in this flick were really hot!

","When this movie came out, I knew it was a disaster movie but I had no idea what the disaster was - then my friends told me it is some monster. I thought, OK that sounds original.<br/><br/>While you could compare it to something such as godzilla or other monster films, this is quite an intriguing film because the first twenty minutes or so everything seems so normal that you get drawn more into the narrative and then you get the unexpected shaking with an earthquake and a whole lot of other events that are never explained to us the reason for its cause, so the characters are just as confused as us.<br/><br/>This is taken with the effect of the shaky cam corder capturing the events, much like the Blair Witch Project and it is highly effective in this case. It has the effect of not being too predictable, you don't know what is going to happen and the atmosphere feels fearful due to this.<br/><br/>To explain the plot in the beginning is kind of irrelevant as it is simply just a celebration for a farewell party for a guy who is going to work in Japan. After that, you almost forget the beginning scenes once all the mayhem comes in.<br/><br/>As for the monster, the good thing is that they only show bits of it now and then and it isn't until later that you see the full image of it. This is one of those movies where you work things out for yourself and nothing is really explained properly but this is an added bonus to the cam corder approach to film as it feels more authentic as though this could have been something that happened to you, and you simply documented it and have no idea what the hell is going on around you.<br/><br/>I guess you can say this has been done before with the cam corder technique, and the characters are simply one dimensional, but this is a survival story so it really isn't necessary.<br/><br/>I had a great time with this though it does make me think of something: if you were in these terrible situations, wouldn't you just be inclined to run and let go of your cam corder? I would be more concerned for my personal safety rather than trying to record everything. But I guess you would want to show someone one day what you went through, so I guess it makes sense."
"Carpy27","7","0","1","11 March 2011"," Should be seen as intended nothing more
","Many disclaim the film for it's lack of depth or story veracity but they try to see more than what it actually is: ~90 minutes of rapidly evolving action centered around a small group of characters. Personally i enjoyed the movie and here's some of the main aspects.<br/><br/>IMHO best thing was the idea of the camera over-taping over an older tape of the 2 ""main-lovers"" in the story. Not going to comment on how well they constructed around the idea but i found it very innovative from an artistic point of view as throughout the movie you see fragments of the old tape AND helps build-up this awesome ending to the movie.<br/><br/>Characters. The story doesn't evolve much around them and you don't really get attached to any and i'm sure that may annoy some of the viewers but in order to create a realistic background to this fast-paced action there wasn't any possible way to give the characters a chance to play-out their role any more. Also i found their acting (as little as it was) a bit off. Girl in the ending scene from under the bridge wasn't convincing at all. The ""narator"" ..guy who carries the camera... is something else, his lines are so unbelievably annoying that i was glad when he died in the end, although retarded as he was, it did humanize him a lot more..even more-so than the guy who risks his life for the chick who's probably dead. Another minus was the vague content of some scenes like the running up and back down some stairs. I'm sure they could have made the guy trip the camera go out and come back a few moments later when they needed the flashlight from the camera and instead work a little on other moments like the ""fortunate"" exit from a subway tunnel right into a military hospital built right there (srsly?). The nauseating camera work was really convincing. People that cry about this shouldn't be watching the movie in the first place. Overall the movie is worth seeing if not for the context then at least for the good special effects."

"FilmFanatic03","8","0","2","17 October 2010"," Surprisingly brilliant!
","I understand why people may be sceptical of this film as it is shot entirely in hand held camera format. But i think it is this style of filmmaking that made this film special. ""Cloverfield"" is full of suspense, action, emotion and cool CGI effects. I think the hand held camera format was very unique to the film as it made the characters more authentic and real. When they cried, or laughed, or ran for their lives you could connect to them as the format made it feel like it was a documentation of a real life event and not fictionalised by the conventional shots used for an action film. It felt like watching a home movie of something that happened so you could connect with the characters. That's what i love about this film. You go on a journey with the characters as they try to save their friend back in the city. I loved the ending as well as it really fitted with the format of the film. You see rubble fall on the surviving characters and the screen to blacked out by the rubble but then the film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date before the disaster saying they are having a great day, this is a great sense of irony. Unfortunely there were few uses of blasphemy and bad language which tainted the film for me. Overall a very different and interesting film."

","This was an amazing thriller that brought back the B-movie genre in my opinion. Though I gotta say this probably beats the B movies back then. This one doesn't show the monster as much, making the suspense all the more terrifying. Then when you do see the monster, you'll see that it's an amazingly creative design, and not a typical Godzilla design.<br/><br/>Note: (the whole movie is shot in a first-person perspective). During a going away party, a group of friends encounter a giant monster attacking New York City, in which they evacuate the place, and try to get out of New York, doing what they can to stay alive.<br/><br/>I say this is better than most B horror films because of the unique way it's shot. The film is filmed by a guy going with the party, and you feel warped into the environment with so much commotion going on, it's uncanny. The film's ending also isn't what you expect, (you'll see). The film doesn't get slow, as there's always something going on, and the main characters are always on their feet. It begins in suspense, and it slowly but surely shows more and more of the monster, getting more and more intense. It's scary because it's huge, so how can you miss it, yet not seeing all of it just makes the environment feel all that more real. Growing attached to the characters makes it more terrifying when they die one by one.<br/><br/>This film gave the B movie genre some balls, and I appreciate it for that. Nothing is cheesy, nothing is bad, everything is thrilling to the bone. Very decent film"

","Cloverfield in a nutshell is a movie about a monster attacking Manhattan all seen through the eyes of 20-some-things hand-held camera. Cloverfield is probably the most intense monster film I've seen and keeps you right at the edge of you seats with several HOLY CRAP moments. The film is filmed entirely using shaky cam (much like blair witch project and indeed paranormal activity). The camera itself becomes a huge part of the film (kinda like a character) and boosts the authenticity and shock value you get while watching the film. Turning towards acting and it isn't the best acting you will see but it isn't supposed to be. It's supposed to come through as people who are filming each other while a big scary monster is attacking them and so maybe the acting is brilliant in a sense that it isn't supposed to be professional at all but more amateurish (home-made). The film is presented brilliantly throughout with no music/soundtrack to support it (i think the only piece of music you do hear is at the party right at the beginning). You never actually see the monster full-on but only from different angles which is the same thing the characters in the film are seeing which makes you feel like part of the film and as if you are actually there as well. Critics compare the film to Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla but for me it was much much more then that. Obviously looks it's best if seen on a big screen with surround sound and I would recommend anyone to see it again even if they have already done so just to enjoy the ride again. Cloverfield is an excellent film with some very complex special effect engineering but the acting isn't the best and maybe it spends too much time setting the scene at the start. There are also quite a few clichés but nevertheless it doesn't take away the fact that it is a brilliant brilliant watch...7/10"

"MBunge","6","0","1","13 August 2010"," The most fun I've had almost vomiting
","This movie almost made be vomit. So before I get into this movie, there's something I'd like to convey to any and all current and future filmmakers who might, by odd happenstance, read this review.<br/><br/>ENOUGH WITH THE DAMN SHAKY-CAM!!! <br/><br/>When the whole sliding, shifting, wandering camera shot first came into common use well over a decade ago, it was a neat innovation. It gave a documentary air of authenticity to fictional tales. It helped audiences think they were seeing something different than the stories they've seen before. However, shaky-cam doesn't do any of that any more. It is now just another cliché.<br/><br/>You've probably heard Cloverfield described as ""The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla"". It seems somewhat belittling to label a truly clever idea like that, but it is accurate. This is the story of a group of 20somethings with a video camera who are stuck in the middle when a giant monster invades New York City and the most important thing to know about the movie is that, outside of a few times when the camera calms down to give the audience a clear look at the special effects, Cloverfield is filmed like a drunk guy with a hand held video camera trying to shoot a wedding reception in the middle of a war.<br/><br/>The image on the screen spins and shakes and tilts and weaves and it goes on and on and on. In the theater, I only lasted about 30 minutes before I had to walk out. If I hadn't left, I absolutely would have vomited on the person in front of me. I made it through the entire thing, watching the DVD at home, but I had an upset stomach and headache by the end. If you get at all motion sick, avoid Coverfield because it is worse than Blair Witch or any other film shot in this style.<br/><br/>If you've got a stronger constitution, though, Cloverfield's a decent film. Beyond the basic concept, it's an utterly pedestrian monster moviebut the concept is strong enough to carry you through the entire 84 minutes. Yeah, it is pretty short but it fits with the pure roller coaster idea of the film. No one really wants to ride a 20 minute long roller coaster. It just becomes too much and I'm not sure Cloverfield would have been improved if they'd spent another 20 or 30 minutes trying to make the story better and the characters more interesting. Ironically, the more engaging the story was and the more you cared about the characters, the more you'd probably get annoyed and angered at the hand held video stuff getting in between you and the story.<br/><br/>I do think the filmmakers missed the point of the giant monster genre, however. Giant monster movies are supposed to be fun, but this film embraces a post-9/11 understanding of urban catastrophe that is everything but fun. Watching a giant monster destroy a skyscraper is enjoyable as a mindless spectacle. Watching the traumatized survivors wander about in the rubble afterwards is not that pleasant. Cloverfield also doesn't seem to understand the significance of the giant movie monster. It's such a ridiculous concept that you need to ground it with some real world analogy, the nuclear bomb origins of Godzilla being the most well known, but even the King Kong films can be seen as metaphors for the folly of Man thinking he can control and master the natural world. The Cloverfield monster doesn't have any significance. It's the destructive aftermath of the colossal beast movie in which the movie is interested.<br/><br/>The monster itself, when you finally see it, is kind of goofy. However, you sort of have to give the filmmakers a pass on that. By now, it's become incredibly difficult to create any sort of creature that doesn't look like something seen in a previous movie or TV show and anything 350 feet tall starts to look a little silly.<br/><br/>Does Cloverfield live up to the hype? No. It doesn't set some bold, new standard for the monster movie, but it is a well-executed, clever idea. That definitely makes this a movie worth seeing, unless you're a easy puker."
"cannonballsimp","6","0","1","20 July 2010"," Partially successful attempt to fuse a style and a genre
","For its first twenty-five minutes, this film is excellent. It succeeds in setting a relaxed atmosphere, and lulls the viewer into a state of comfort, and provides just enough light emotional interest that the sudden twist really does come as an unwelcome intrusion. After this, however, the trump card has been played, and from then onwards, the film's point of distinction becomes the unwelcome intrusion, for reasons which I will discuss.<br/><br/>The mixed fortunes of this film are not surprising, given its layered structure. There are precisely two important layers to the film. On the one hand, an attempt is made to obscure the fact that the film is an illusion, by presenting it as if it were real footage. On the other hand, the subject matter is unmistakably derived from the history of film, and consists of a familiar set of problems and 'surprises,' illusions which are famous as such. Let us refer to these layers as style and genre respectively. The problem is that the style and the genre frequently work against one another. Presumably, the film-makers' intention was to reinvigorate a classic genre with a technical conceit. However, the genre depends on the surface of the illusion not being disturbed; the viewer must forget that he/she is in a cinema, or the ludicrous conventions of the genre will appear to him/her. The style undermines this requirement, by making itself a feature. By asking to be noticed, it prevents the audience from entering into the world of the film. <br/><br/>The film asks us to be savvy and credulous at once; and ultimately, in my opinion, fails because of this.<br/><br/>6/10"

","""IT'S A LION! IT'S HUGE!""<br/><br/>OK, that's not a real quote from the movie. But that meme (and its endless derivations) are a testament to how excellent the viral campaign for Cloverfield was. The initial trailer for the movie was one of the best I've ever seen, and it had me and countless others scouring the trailer and the Internet for any clue to what this movie was going to be about.<br/><br/>Once it finally arrived, I have to say that it mostly lived up to all the hype and anticipation. It's basically a monster movie about a group of people who get caught in Manhattan as a huge, powerful creature lays waste to the city. They have to venture across the island to find and rescue a friend of theirs, before attempting to make their escape. It goes without saying that they encounter a lot of danger along the way, including some smaller creatures that seem to fall from the larger beast. <br/><br/>The entire movie is filmed from the viewpoint of a camcorder (which apparently caused motion sickness for some viewers), and as a result it's about as realistic as this kind of a movie can be. (I'd also trek across a war zone to get to someone who looks like Odette Yustman, so that's pretty realistic, as well.) <br/><br/>The special effects were solid, there's a lot of genuine tension, and all the actors and actresses were authentic enough to pull of the realism that the movie was shooting for (the guy playing Hud was incredibly annoying, though). The monster is seen only in half- glimpses for the majority of the movie (smart), destroyed NY looks amazing, and it's not hard to suspend your sense of disbelief and get drawn into what's happening to the characters. It does strain credibility that this particular group of people encounters the monster so many times, but that's a small niggle. As is the fact that it doesn't hold up quote as well after multiple viewings. If you don't like this movie, this genre just doesn't appeal to you. I just hope you're not susceptible to motion sickness."

The special effects are excellent and the suspense and tension derived from not knowing quite what is going on applies to both the characters in the movie and the audience.<br/><br/>What I liked best about the movie was the fact that there was no escape from the monster.

","I never went to see this in the cinema but after watching it i really have to say, It's alright in some respects and fair enough it isn't based on any truth anyway (lol). However it is chock full of corny acting by mid 20 model types, so anyway the start of the film introduces our heroes and how big a douche, they all are and at one point three friends are talking, two of the three ask the third for secrets about someone- she says no but after about 3 seconds of persuasion she gives in. Five to ten Min's into it the havoc soon ensues people panicking, eventually realising what kind of threat they're under the group of friends -the film's based around- head for safety looking for a way out of Manhattan (following a comfortable maze which ranges from subways to mall stores). In my opinion the group seem a little too confident on their ability to survive, another irritating aspect has to be the guy with the camera (conveniently named HUDD) no matter how close to dying they are THIS guy never seems to lose grip of his camcorder and his constant yammering surprisingly doesn't cause anyone to flip out and strangle him. He and his camcorder are in heaven now.A large chunk of the film involves a man desperate to find his gf before he can leave. Now with all this said it is just a film, and the rest of the films plot does retain a scary aspect and certain scenes make you want to question just what it is that's terrorising them and where it really came from.

","My Take: An exciting modern take on the old-fashioned monster movie.<br/><br/>Take a worn-out premise, give it a modern spin and make it just as scary and exciting for today's audiences. That's exactly what producer J.J. Abrams (ALIAS) and director Matt Reeves does and the premise being the old-fashioned ""attack-of-the-giant-monster"". The result was CLOVERFIELD, an exciting and frightening modern monster movie. I almost never get scared in scary movies nowadays, but this BLAIR WITCH meets GODZILLA does the trick. Here's a movie that begs to be seen on the big screen, where the loud sound system could take advantage of your senses. But seeing the movie on the small screen, with maybe a few lights dimmed and a bag of popcorn at hand, the movie is nonetheless effective.<br/><br/>The premise is simple: A giant unseen monster attacks good ol' New York, as seen from the perspective of someone with a digital camera. The movie opens with a surprise farewell party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David) who's leaving New York for a new job in Japan. Documenting the event is Hud (T.J. Miller) was asked to interview Rob's friends during the entire party, including Rob's girlfriend Beth (Jessica Lucas) who expresses her reluctance for leaving. But once Hud films an explosion and a decapitated Statue of Liberty in the distance, the movie gets going. The disembodied head of the Statue flies across the street and the giant unseen behemoth proceeds to rip apart the Big Apple, and the movie gives us that uneasy feeling of being there as mayhem arises. The characters aren't exactly authentic, but here's an instance where they don't need to be. By the end of the film, you couldn't care less if Rob would choose the job in Japan or stay with his girlfriend; you just want them to get the hell out of there alive. That's what makes them effective.<br/><br/>After 9/11, it's hard not to think that the mayhem in CLOVERFIELD echoes the events of that tragic event. This is probably the most accurate metaphoric view of the 9/11 since Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS. But above all, CLOVERFIELD is a great monster movie. It takes this usually worn-put genre and makes it just as scary and as exciting as such classics as KING KONG, THEM! and THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS used to be. CLOVERFIELD is bound to join other luminaries in the genre as one of the best monster movies of all time, and if that sounds like a faint praise, it isn't.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

","I actually liked this even the 2nd time around..Watched it at the movies when it first came out and was blown away by it and definitely needed to be seen on the big screen to experience the devastation and the disaster that they portray..Some really intense scenes, including the one in the tunnel..Sure, we've seen some this in other movies, but this is hyper-realistic, right down to the choice of the shaky-cam (or whatever it is you wanna call it). Personally, I prefer this type of cinematography for this movie as it fits well and adds to the chaos surrounding the characters.<br/><br/>So, overall, I liked that you didn't know a lot. Imagine yourself in that scenario and think how you would react and behave? You would know squat, you'd run and if you had a loved one, all rationality would go out through the door and you would try to get to them. Obviously, Clovervield is not trying to be hyper-realistic, so take it as it it is and enjoy the movie as it it's trim, taut and terrific 81 minutes will have you holding your breath and ducking for cover at the destruction taking place on screen. ***1/2 out of *****"

","I never thought a digital shaky camera amateur approach horror movie could have been so great. I was in total awe and could not take my eyes off the screen all 80 minutes of this excellent suspense work. JJ Abrams is a decent filmmaker and he did a great job here, this Monster is so terribly ferocious and so scary that I was deeply shocked and terrified that could not sleep well. The film is well done, and the fast tempo never gets you feel bored. it sucks you into its plot and makes you totally immersed. The poor main heroes die and you feel a sad, deep, pulsating anguish. They fight so bravely and try to survive that it is a real, real pity they die. The huge monster is so horrible, so scary, so huge that I felt a real pain and real panic it was on the screen. The only bad part - all heroes die, and a deep sorrow lingers."

","This movie makes you feel like you are there when everything is happening. It makes it seem more realistic. It was a great storyline, but by the end of the movie, my eyes were hurting, and I had a headache, because of the camera shaking. Maybe it was because I was dumb enough to sit too close to the screen. Here's some advice: sit far back away from the screen. The monster was very creepy. There was a scene where the main characters are in a helicopter, and you see the monster being attacked and falling down, then there's huge smoke where you can't see it. Everyone thinks it's dead, then all of the sudden, the monster jumps up and attacks the helicopter, and it feels like it coming right at you. If you love thrillers, you'll love CLOVERFIELD!!!"
"dwpollar","7","0","2","9 August 2009"," Scary and uniquely filmed story...
","1st watched 7/18/2009 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-Matt Reeves): Scary and uniquely filmed story about a group of friends and their perspective of an attack on New York City from what appears to be an alien. The movie is shown from the perspective of a hand-held camera owned by the main character in the story and guided most of the time by his friend(who he gave the job to at his going away party). The story is really about a group of friends and what they go through to stay alive and together thru this attack. The whole movie is a government-supported film that was found in the aftermath of the incident and starts with a couple enjoying their day then we're sent to the going away party and the calamity starts. We never really see what the creature attacking the city looks like til halfway thru the movie and not close-up til the very end. What we see instead is the destruction that's caused which makes for a very different movie of this type and adds to the interest. The ending is also very unique in that we don't really know what happens to the main characters or the creature. Although this isn't popular film-making it adds to the intrigue. If you like ""Blair Witch Project"", you'll like this one – it's really kind of a monster movie version of that one-of-a-kind film. But again, it's not for all tastes similar to the previously mentioned movie."

The movie itself is a video recorded from a camera of one of the characters, so it seems like the movie is made of one take.

","More than anything, this film at least proves that showmanship is still alive. The major drawback is that it shows Abrams up to be little more than a modern William Castle, in that, in the light of the viral marketing campaign that preceded the film's release, there is a definite sense of ""design the poster first, make the movie second"". Case in point; with the promotion of Lost, he placed heavy emphasis on the fact that the plot and structure had been carefully mapped out beforehand, with a pile of seemingly random events leading up to a solution that would ultimately make sense. It later emerged that network executives had to pressure the production company into actually retrofitting a structure to it, since there never was one to begin with. In this case, Cloverfield was promoted with a massive viral marketing campaign where dark hints and bizarre clues provided by various websites connected with the movie suggested something far deeper than the film actually delivers. Fans across the internet were filled with wild speculation and they proposed ideas far more interesting than those contained in the finished product. One is ultimately left with the sense that the film makers were fishing for ideas whilst making the film up as they went along. There was anticipation that Godzilla, something out of Lovecraft and a whole menagerie of mythical, biblical and literary entities would be responsible for the devastation of New York. The Slusho website in particular gave fruit to ideas not contained in the finished product and the viewer can't help but feel slightly let down. Having levelled this criticism, one should probably leave all that in the past and review the film on its own. While using the already tired victim-of-disaster-with-a-camcorder technique that went out of fashion ten minutes into the Blair Witch project, the film actually gets away with it for the most part by emulating the Naudet brother's footage from 9/11. This does however get a little daft at times, since one does get the impression that an ordinary citizen wouldn't keep the camera rolling the whole time. This this a especially true during the rather hazardous scene where the main characters are crossing over from the roof of one high-rise building to another that is in a state of partial collapse. However, it works splendidly during many of the action sequences (particularly during a running street battle between the monster and army and a creepy scene in an abandoned subway tunnel) and also allows for the use of a truly unique cinematic gimmick, whereby we are given flashes of the footage originally on the tape being used to capture the attack. Although these brief glimpses feature nothing more than what appears to a trip to Coney Island, they ultimately pay off by giving us clear evidence of the origin of the invader and allow for an ironic twist, in that the victims of the attack had the answers in their hands all the time, but never noticed. Although the film does give you a decent knocking about for two hours and feels like a real roller coaster ride, the human action is vaguely stilted. If we are supposed to care about these characters, there is not much evidence for it. The reason for this is that early attempts at character development during the opening going-away party are so obvious as to be flawed. Also, since a title card establishes that fact that the footage was found in the area where central park used to be, it's pretty obvious from the beginning that our heroes aren't going to make it out alive so one has a natural propensity for keeping them at an (emotional) arm's length. But this is a monster movie so we're not really concerned with the humans, are we? So does the film deliver on its main protagonist? Well, yes and no. On the plus side, early glimpses are too weird and obscure to give us too much information but odd enough to be scary. The downside is that after craning our heads, squinting our eyes and wondering, ""is that a squid? Was that a foot or a head? Could it be a giant vole... etc."" the movie breaks the cardinal rule and shows its Thing full on and in the cold light of day and by God, is it disappointing. It's not the creature design itself (even though it mixes so much contrasting biology as to not really work visually) but the fact that our imaginations were doing so much better when we just caught the odd glimpse. Seen full on, it's far to anthropomorphic to excite chills. It's got two arms, two legs and a tail. Worst still it has eyes, nose and mouth. In other words, its disappointingly recognisable and nowhere near as weird as it should be. I might got so far as to say that it looks a bit silly. I REALLY wanted something big and lumbering and aquatic. What we get is an anorexic man with polio wearing a bat-mask rendered in so-so CGI. This is one of those times when speculative internet fan art is infinitely better than the real thing. So, is Cloverfield any good? Well, actually, yes. Ish. There are some fantastic ideas on display (the parasites the monster carries are far worse than the big guy himself; people keep stopping to take pictures of the latest round of devastation with their iPhones) and there's a lovely, almost cheeky touch where the overture over the end credits pays blatant homage to the Japanese monster movie scores of Akira Ifukube (particularly the Godzilla theme) and one does feel that our heroes have a valid emotional reason for staying in the city while all hell is breaking loose but for all the hype, one feels that it could have been so much more. Basically, it's well worth seeing for the ride but it is a one trick pony and you won't need to see it twice."

","First of all, why ""Cloverfield""? Second; what is that monster, where did it come from and why and how did it end up in New York City? What are the little offspring? Are they somehow poisonous? Is there a reason for all of this happening? <br/><br/>And by asking these questions I believe I have struck the nerve of why this isn't a good movie!<br/><br/>Cloverfield leans upon (at least) two different types of movies; the classic monster movies and ""the Blair Witch""/horror-suspense genre. But what we normally expect from those genres are explanations. They take the time needed to build a myth or tell the story and background, with answers to most of the questions I asked above. Sometimes these answers are highly imaginative if not far-fetched but that is partly to be expected in this genre and we often accept them. Cloverfield however does not offer any explanations, does not build a myth, does not really tell a story or give us a background for us to engage our imaginations in and does not answer our questions. This reduces the movie to a mere action-without-a-real-plot movie and leaves me pretty unaffected by the story that has just been told!<br/><br/>I can imagine that this would have been a pretty effective game for Playstation or other platforms, but even then I would have liked a little more background story!"

","Having failed to see this film at an Odeon theatre in London (my girlfriend became violently sea-sick), I thought the promising beginning of it could be a precursor to how the film would end up. A cool monster-flick, yeay! I was wrong. All in all, the film is almost worse than Spielberg's take on ""War Of The World"". A group of people form in New York, USA, to say good-bye to a friend who's going away to work in Tokyo, Japan. Everything that is seen is filmed by a participant of the party, who is quite uninteresting as a person, hence in my eyes numbing the film a little. Anyway, as a few of the characters squander to intrigue over who's hooking up with who, something detonates. People find something otherworldly is tearing up NY. Woo! Sadly, this was the promising bit. Hereafter all is running - with no suspense á la ""Alien"" whatsoever - or trying to avoid dying, which is boring. I felt little or no sympathy for the characters, and the script felt very thin. All in all, nice special effects but a very dumb film which feels bad, as I think it could have become good with a bit more thought and intelligence."
"enthymeme","4","0","1","16 May 2009"," Couldn't suspend disbelief
","The main gimmick of the film is that it is told through a video camera being carried by one of the characters.<br/><br/>I didn't believe it.<br/><br/>Most of the time the film felt as though it were just a perfectly normal action movie. The only times it seemed, even vaguely, like it was actually being filmed by a character in the movie was in the shots where they simulated bad cinematography. Even then the 'amateur cameraman' shots were very obviously highly skilled cameraman deliberately pretending to make mistakes.<br/><br/>The entire time I was watching the movie, I couldn't help but think ""Would he really stick a camera in his friends' face when they're grieving or panicking? What a jerk. Shouldn't he switch the camera off and talk to his friends privately, or try to get more footage of the disaster going on?"" Obviously that's not what I should have been thinking about if I'd been able to maintain any suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>They tried too hard to make Blair Witch Project into a mainstream movie and in doing so managed to lose the sense that this was actually a character inside the fictitious world filming the events.<br/><br/>Next time, if you want to make a film like this, make the character filming a professional cameraman for the TV news trapped with his entire crew within the disaster area, struggling to escape and bring his footage back to the station. Then you'll have an excuse for perfectly steady hand-held shots, someone who films tons of footage that's none of his business and a good reason why they would film when any sane person would switch the camera off and run for their lives."
"eL_Segador","3","0","1","23 April 2009"," Over-rated disaster! Over-rated disaster!
","Personally, I think that Cloverfield was a disaster. When the movie started, I thought the camera was part of the beginning, something that would go off in 1 minute or so, but no. Soon, the constant moving and shaking of the video camera began to get frustrating and stupid. It was also very unrealistic. So the city you live in gets attacked by aliens, are you really going to run around holding a video camera for around 50 minutes? Not really. Another thing was the poor acting and lack of decent action scenes. How many decent action scenes were there? I counted only one, when the soldiers and the tank begin shooting at the 'alien'. You couldn't even get a good look at the invaders. Actually, throughout the entire movie, you do not get a decent look at what the invading alien thing looks like.<br/><br/>As far as the technical information goes, I'm no expert, but I can easily tell that this movie was filmed wrong (in terms of style - video camera), had bad scripts with bad actors, and was just stupid and pointless all the way through. I was really disappointed, because the cover looked quite interesting, but the film failed to live up to it.<br/><br/>Not being harsh, just realistic.... 3 out of 10"

","Recently saw a film called Quarantine at a movie house and the same technique used in that film as this one; hand held camera used to give more realism to the picture. Perhaps because it was on a wide screen the hand held formula worked in the afore named film, not in this one, and perhaps also because I viewed this one on the television. Indeed both films have similar story lines and similar endings; in essence a group of people trapped trying to escape monsters.Indeed I will be corrected but is not Blair Witch more or less the same?<br/><br/>And also the same type of plot etc ? A lot of copying going on and not much originality, eh! So hence to repeat what is annoying about this movie is the way it is filmed; though despite that there are some good special effects and monsters but unfortunately none of the characters in the movie are particularly likable and indeed quite the opposite. Therefore a generous: 5/10."
"MVictorPjinsiste","8","0","1","21 March 2009"," It Worked For Me
","Cloverfield is the most memorable movie I saw lately. There are many comments here about the hand-held camera, so I will lay that aspect to rest, if only to underline that no regular hand-held camera can have such audio pickups. The movie is a treat on the ears, as one can hear the monster blundering around and trumpeting eerily all over the town.<br/><br/>So this is not your everyday rampaging-giant-monster-attacking-the-town. In these types of movies, you always see the thing from above, after being lectured about the ""folly of man"". You feel omniscient, and safe. Well not here. Here, and up to the movie's very end, the spectator knows nothing about the thing, the harbinger of the End. Another interesting twist in the recording that was on the tape used to make the movie (and that we get to see when the new recording stops), images of unmarred happiness that contrast sharply with the apocalypse going on on the new recording. These moment are not only emotional and nostalgic, but it might also inadvertly reveal some clues. <br/><br/>""Clover"" itself is a freakish work of art, and it takes some time before the spectator can figure it out; A cross between a bat, a squid and a dinosaur, it also sheds deadly, fearsome parasites that can take on the characters on a more personal basis. This is a great idea. <br/><br/>The new coming actors were great, and performing just in the right tone, no more, no less. The women in particular are insanely beautiful, but I believed them all the same. There were quite tough, too, and I seriously doubt that people could walk like that after a helicopter crash, for one, but it wasn't too distracting. <br/><br/>The party scene at the start was a bit long, thought, but it did make for an almost unexpected attacks as I finally lend an interest to the little personal story that was developed there. <br/><br/>I am pretty sure it isn't the last time we see ""Clover"" or its ilk; Clearly, the plot is a lot larger than what this microscopic outlook presented. There is a lot of the story we still haven't see. <br/><br/>The musical score, which only takes place during the credits, is more fitting for a classical Japanese movie of this genre, but in its own right, it is also a classic. <br/><br/>In conclusion, here is a movie worth talking about."

The plot is surprising, as for the first 15 minutes I was pretty sure that the guy at the DVD rental tried to palm off some college romance as a monster movie to me. But it's a good endeavour to usher the audience into a warm and somehow misleading mood before the 'sh' hits the fan.<br/><br/>On the other hand, despite not having Will Smith pounding an alien in a more or less cowboy-style, scornful manner, the characters are lacking a more in-depth attitude towards the so called 'unknown'. They rather tend to act like in a catastrophic movie, where the circumstances are dramatic, yet within the boundaries of human insight.<br/><br/>Nonetheless with every next minute I enjoyed the movie more and more, maybe because at the very first glance it seemed a low-budget horror to me with a pretty unknown cast.

I can't give the overall film a 10, because there were those occasional out-of-place lines and shaky acting. But the style is nearly perfect; the film feels like a low-budget film because that is what it is supposed to feel like. Not to mention, I was truly terrified in many parts of this film.<br/><br/>I loved how intricate this film feels, like there's an entire backstory to the events that unfolded in the film; I am not only speaking of the origins of Cloverfield, which we get a little tease about right at the end on the Ferris Wheel, but also the backstory behind Robert and Elizabeth. The brief flashbacks were generally effective, although I think maybe they had one or two too many of them; one little detail I loved that wasn't really a flashback, but did reach back to the beginning of the film and bookend it wonderfully, was the use of the time 6:42A.M.. Wonderful little detail.<br/><br/>Also, my favorite moment by far was the moment Rob tells his mother that Jason is dead; you never, ever hear the reaction his mother gives; instead, this film lets the audience member use their imagination as to what her reaction sounds like. There are various moments in the film where the director easily could have fed the audience every little detail, but instead decides to allow the audience to think for themselves, and this film is ultimately all the more brilliant for it.<br/><br/>Cloverfield - 8/10, I appreciated and enjoyed it very much, and it will probably end up in my top 10 of this year."

","A lot of things get smashed, destroyed, and brokenheck, most of Manhattan, for that matterin ""Cloverfield,"" but the film never really breaks through the surface of getting us to care much about it. The most high-profile film of 2008's ""found footage"" fad is rife with spectacle in its attempt to postmodernize the drive-in flicks of the 1950s, where some Inexplicable Thing (irradiated bugs, hostile aliens, or plain'ol monsters) bears down on our resourcefulbut all too humanprotagonists. Yet ""Cloverfield"" falls shortthe ultimate result has scattered moments of palpable fear, but never really finds a suitable emotional pitch until it's almost over, and by then the plot machinations render any real sympathy a moot point. The film is problematically populated by narcissistic young-professional types residing in NYC, who are at Ground Zero the night some Inexplicable Thing attacks Manhattan; instead of fleeing, our young heroes instead set out to find the girlfriend of the main protagonist, trapped in her apartment complex. ""Cloverfield"" takes elements from ""Godzilla"" films, Gap ads (the no-name cast is certainly model-caliber, if nothing else), and even ""Shaun of the Dead"" (down-and-out guy trying to win his girl back in the midst of extenuating circumstances), filtering the unraveling spectacle through a first-person perspective; this gimmick, surprisingly, doesn't work as well here as it did in ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Quarantine""instead of heightening visceral experience, it paradoxically draws too much attention to itself ( having the camera guy constantly mentioning his need to ""document"" everything doesn't help matters), while at times wanting to draw attention away from a lot of obvious CGI. And it's hard to be pulled into a survival situation when even the extras look like they've been done up by professional make-up artists. The blatant references to 9/11 don't resonate on a level any deeper than their blaring-neon obviousness, and come across as simplistic attempts to lend the film a social significance it doesn't deserve; and the glossy slickness of the film's look overall actively works against its chances of delivering a terrifying, in-the-moment experience. As with most experiments, ""Cloverfield"" is conceptually impressive, but a maddening disappointment overall."

","Make no mistake, Cloverfield is an animated film. The majority of what we see is CGI, a gimmick that has in recent years dominated a medium rather than enhance it. Instead of the smooth almost creamy give away aspect of computer generated images, Cloverfield uses the technology brilliantly and the special effects it's artists create are mind boggling. Explosions look totally real. Cityscapes are dizzying in their accuracy. J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves set out to make a distinctly American monster movie and where else to do that but New York City? Our minds are still fresh from the memories of 9/11 and Abrams taps into this without insulting or exploiting the tragedy. The fact that the thing comes from the South of Manhattan is not a coincidence. The beginning of the film is a party of exuberant youth, a MTV reality show of 20 somethings bidding farewell to a friend who is (again, not coincidentally) relocating to Japan, home of that ""other"" monster who's never mentioned. Why mention ""him""? We have a big ol' baddie of our own now. Once the crisis begins, complete with an iconic symbol of collective America being destroyed and literally thrown in our faces, it's everyone for themselves. Strangely, the city empties out too quickly, the evacuation immediate. This was one of the issues that nagged at me through most of the film. At one point our tiny little band of survivors venture into the subway. The vast series of tunnels and stations are totally abandoned when logistics would tell you thousands of people would have taken refuge there. There aren't even trains to hamper their approximately 60 block progress. Above ground there are no traffic jams, no throngs of panicked citizens screaming from the windows of buildings. There's also some iffy geography going on. Big Ugly seems to have a fondness for Midtown, hanging around it for hours. Placing it in convenient places for action makes the viewer wonder if there are more than one. Our band of heroes travel very long distances in a very short period of time and you almost get the feeling the monster is after THEM. The military could use a little target practice in this, buildings get hit more than the target. But I forgave all this, despite the problems, this is thrilling stuff. As if a big gray ugly thing wasn't bad enough, it sheds some of the creepiest nastiest little critters we've ever seen like ticks off of a dog. This was a brilliant idea, it would be pretty easy to get away from a big lumbering slow monster, but these things, they're right there, they move fast and they BITE. The biggest shock of the film happens suddenly and pretty much off screen. I guess that explains where so many people have gone, but you would expect streets awash with gore (which, by the way, there's amazingly little of). I'm always fascinated by actors who's performance depends on their ability to react to nothing. Here it's realistic and terrifying. The military aspect, usually depicted as willing to coldly sacrifice anyone and anything is given a nice humanity. This military cares and tries it's best. It has very little choice and we understand. The creators of the monster have stated that they chose to think of ""it"" as a baby, scared and threatened. This is the irony, no military is going to try to soothe and calm such a thing. The shaky camera, used to death lately is acceptable because it's the way it would be although the batteries must be state of the art. The film leaves very few questions answered. What is this creature? Why is it here? It doesn't really matter. This thing could be any number of threats. The filmmakers have chosen to spin our paranoia as a huge, unstoppable monster and it works. Japan's got nothing on us, in your face Godzilla. Usually there would be a huge marketing blitz for a monster movie, but kids aren't going to be playing with this ugly thing as toys hidden in McDonald's meals, no model moving crabby parrot monstrosities. The harsh aspects of these creatures prevents this. This is not a happy film, but what could be happy about it? Nonetheless, it's entertainment at it's best. I will never pooh pooh CGI again."

","In this day and age of reality TV and reality TV style shaky camera work, here's another film that just says ""me too"" all over it.

But this film not only uses it, it takes it to the extreme. I understand this film tries to add realism by using this technique but aren't there other ways to to this? Ways that don't cause migraines?<br/><br/>Anyway, despite the occasional headaches, this film is pretty good. I'm especially impressed by the visual effects.

I was hoping we'd get a good look at it so I could run out and get some t-shirts of it or maybe some action figures.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is brilliant. The effects and camera angles are outstanding. The dialogue is what murders this movie. I mean the dialogue is like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre of dialogue in a monster movie. The plotting falls apart as the characters don't act anything like real people. I was hoping Freddy Kruger or Jason Voorhees were going to show up and guest star in this to make it interesting. Had this just been people running for their lives instead of the sub plot nonsense it would have been a masterpiece. The characters were boring and lifeless and I'd have rather the monster gotten hold of a steady cam and run amok with it, us getting his viewpoint of the action.<br/><br/>Monster with a camera, great concept, you read it here first.<br/><br/>There've been some great monsters over the past 100 years in film.

Cloverfield, I missed why the movie was named this, I'll figure it out when I read more, this monster was cool, sadistic, sense of irony, powerful but no personality. Maybe there'll be a sequel or something that does what a movie is supposed to do, tell us a story.<br/><br/>So again, had awesome potential, great technical skill, bad acting, bad dialogue.<br/><br/>You want some monster movie dialogue watch the 1950's classic ""Them!"".<br/><br/>Now THAT'S a monster movie worth mentioning!"

"dongward","5","0","1","24 October 2008"," Deconstructivist??? Not quite so clever
","I would, and as an architect i'm taking no huge gamble here, presume that as the previous review concluded, a deconstructivist approach requires a plethora of construction before it can be 'taken apart' or 'reassembled in a different way or form. Cloverfield is not so clever as to do this, so I must strongly disagree with that opinion. However I want to make it clear that I have not managed to watch all of this film - yet this in itself says something - so I am giving it the slightly friendly 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>OK, so the good - it's not all horrific - the camera work is effective. True, the Blair witch was terrifying and this style of docu-filming is pretty well based in commercial films, many of which not under the horror genre - take the Bourne trilogy for instance, where hand cams convey tightness of space or action scenes - reminiscent of NYPD Blue - conveying third person looking in, gritty and involving, not so slick, real.<br/><br/>Unlike many films in this block-horror genre, we do start to care for one or two of the characters - the splicing of romantic outings as the main story develops allows us for a moment to empathise with two characters.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this film doesn't really know what it wants to be - shock CGI horror or docu-style awakening. There is contradiction - which is an intelligent thing to have in a film - yet it doesn't create a friction which is translated intelligibly, i.e, If this film attempts to span both genres, it fails in much the same way as third person pornography does - however it still gets people off, perhaps in this way the story is skin deep and highly fantasy. This is due to the CGI which, and here's the problem, contradicts the gritty realism of DVD-cam filming; it just doesn't sit right and seems too gratuitous in contrast to such a modest medium. Secondly, the thin-ness of the supporting cast are so shoddily typified that you couldn't care less whether they died or not and in most cases you wish they simply would to spare anymore annoying dialogue.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of films such as 'Host' - for its cinematography and rolling shots combined with CGI as much as 'the thing' which relied completely on animatronics, then the psychological suggestive nature of 'Blair Witch', yet all these films create a cult of their own because they're unique - they manage to tap into a 'feeling' that involves you and offers up a new exciting dish to explore. Cloverfield is much the same as any other large Hollywood horror, aliens or no.<br/><br/>It is entertainment, no to be confused than anything more than that, lets not mince words here or dish out fancy labels. If you love CGI and dig the blockbuster horror/sci-fi genre then go rent it - you'll love it. If you're a bit old school and want to think a bit about whats going on, go rent the Japanese (original) Ring 1 and 2 films and you'll never look at your TV in the same gratuitous manner.<br/><br/>Donnie"

The storyline is random with no real structure or explanation to the viewer. The film is very short and the ending comes and goes shockingly fast, again with no explanation.<br/><br/>So basically, you can't really see or understand what is going on, but everyone has their own opinion so maybe you like this kind of film."

","The marketing techniques that were used to promote the new low-budget American monster movie ""Cloverfield"" were used so well that the movie was destined to attract hordes of people to the theater just to answer their questions. An enormous amount of hype and eager anticipation was created as a result of the clever promotion efforts. But was the movie worth the wait and the hype? Not really.<br/><br/>I will not expose the plot of the movie in a complex manner, because there's really no complexity to the plot at all. A monster of unexplained origin attacks New York City and a few survivors document the attack via a hand-held camcorder and thus, the entire movie is shown through this in a ""Blair Witch Project"" (1999) style. There is no music score to adhere to the documentary-like style.<br/><br/>This could have been a good movie. This could have been a wonderful movie. But it isn't. Some people, such as my parents, disliked the film enormously for the reason that it is shot in the ""shaky camera"" fashion where the camera goes out of focus, jiggles around nonstop, and so forth. I personally am not fond of the shaky camera, but that's not the reason I didn't like the film.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" is tediously slow, boring, highly uninteresting, features a few moments of well-done thrills and it does a good job and creating an illusion that all that is happening on the screen was real, but it fails to scare us, surprise us, and even really generally entertain us. This is a movie that was advertised really well, but amazingly the marketing was better than the product itself. ""Cloverfield"" is only about eighty-four minutes long and even then, its mercilessly long due to the fact that nothing really happens in it. The first half hour is pure nonstop dreck-style talking and yammering about pointless nonsense from these mostly annoying characters and then even when the monster attack finally arrives, ""Cloverfield"" has caused us to lose interest. Soon enough, the monster becomes uninteresting as well.<br/><br/>To me, ""Cloverfield"" was just like cheesy low-budget science-fiction monster flicks that you will always find on the Sci-Fi channel. Examples including ""Python"" (2000), ""Boa vs. Python"" (2004), and ""100 Million B.C. (2008). The only difference is, it has better special effects and better acting. But in terms of plot execution, characters, and just general entertainment value, it's exactly the same."

A big monster that does the Godzilla through Manhattan. The good thing about this banal ripoff is that it is never explained. If you're waiting for the obligatory ""radiation"" or ""extra-terrestrial"" origin, it won't come.<br/><br/>The monster goes ""RAAAARRRGH!"", buildings get broke, people get dead. The End.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" is the code name given to the patch of East Coast that has to be nuked to eradicate the monster threat. And on the DVD, we see that the film-makers affectionately referred to the funny-looking, twenty-storey monster as ""Clover."" How cute.<br/><br/>Movie opens with a bunch of New York college kids in a hi-rise apartment, throwing a surprise party for one of their own who has scored a VP job overseas, leaving shortly. Was it too clever-clever foreshadowy that he was going to JAPAN? ... You know, city of GODZILLA?<br/><br/>The opening party scene is on a hand-held digital camera, operated by one of the douchebags at the party. So it's choppy, shaky, amateurish and - here's the teeth-grinding part - supposedly unscripted. Scenes of people interacting, giving ""impromptu"" testimonials, camera walking in on scenes in progress; reminds us of the grand opening wedding sequence in THE GODFATHER - only crap.<br/><br/>I kept thinking, ""If this hand-held gimmick goes on for very much longer, I'm gonna start peeling my skin off."" It's not that the kids are BAD actors - they're just bad ""natural"" actors. The irony in this age of YouTube and teens-filming-teen-bashings is that these kids can't act like they're NOT on camera! Just as Brando raged onto the scene with The Method, overshadowing the ""theatrical"" actors of his day, now we have a new wave of ""reality acting"" insinuating itself into our culture, not necessarily ""overshadowing"" The Method, but carving a place for itself in certain types of media.<br/><br/>On film, unless you do it really well (Gary Oldman's NIL BY MOUTH, Paul Greengrass's UNITED 93), stick to The Method. These kids look like they're ACTING.<br/><br/>And it screams inauthentic.<br/><br/>Michael Stahl-David is the young VP, who, amongst the decimation, goes in search of his hot girlfriend despite her skyscraper leaning against another one; Jessica Lucas and Lizzy Caplan tag along; T.J. Miller is the douchebag who won't stop filming even when his life depends on it - literally - and Odette Yustman is the hot gf.<br/><br/>Written by Dave Goddard, the hand-held format is ingenious in one way, as it provides exposition creatively, and only focuses on the action from he P.O.V. of these few kids, but all the little things start to bother: battery life - the batteries never run out; audio - everyone who we NEED to hear, we hear; the date stamp on screen - it appears whenever necessary, being absent when it threatens to annoy with its intrusion on the action...<br/><br/>...and it is not implausible that he should continue to film through all the adversity - we're in the generation that does that, unmindful of consequences - but it's implausible WHAT he films. For instance, when a screaming 20-storey monster is rampaging one block away, in clear view, with soldiers firing on it, what sort of a retard would focus on his friends across the street, hiding? See, for the movie's purposes, the camera has to take in as much of the story as possible, whereas if a partying douchebag WAS doing the filming, there is little doubt he'd be transfixed for all of this cam's unlimited battery life by the skyscraper-sized terror right in front of him.<br/><br/>There is the iconic image of the decapitated Statue of Liberty - used in all the trailers. Question is: unless this thing came out of the water near Ellis Island, why would it make the tourist trip TO Ellis just to knock the head off that lady in the harbor? Now the giant monster effects are beyond realistic, and its original design was reasonably cool - but then it started dropping off insectoid creatures for the sake of the special effects techs who find it so easy to generate these things now (STARSHIP TROOPERS, KING KONG 2005, LOST IN SPACE). These little crab-like things were a continual annoyance. The movie was on its downslide at this point.<br/><br/>Then it REALLY lost me - when it did that thing that all these teen movies do eventually - make unintelligence a favorable trait. The camera guy says, ""Maybe the monster came from a crevasse,"" and one of the girls gives him a look like he's talking PLUTONIAN, whereupon this gutless dweeb immediately changes his wording: ""I mean - a crevice."" Nice going, tool! Systematically driving down not only the intelligence level of the country, but the DESIRE to possess intelligence. How come no one ever retorts with, ""I'm not using any words that aren't in the English dictionary. What's your problem, dweeb?!"" Immediately on the heels of this stupidity, the chick who gave him the look criticizes him for being stupid! This whole plot device of a guy going after his girl is wearing thin with me. After all the mundanity of a monster knocking over buildings, they dial it down to the level of boring chick-rescue movie, then dial it down further with the deplorable acting when we find the gf with a REBAR beam through her shoulder and in the next scenes, she is raising her arms as if there isn't a gaping wound through her torso. Oh, and that shoddy hand-held camera-work? - the whole nauseous movie! (I need a skin graft...) Then the film-makers pretend like they're blasting out on the edge of originality when they have all our stars die at the end. By that point, I was kinda glad.<br/><br/>Oh, did I ruin it for you?"

","The camcorder angle photography is so shaky that it literally causes a headache. it's like home video jerky recording, maybe it it saved money since they didn't have to concentrate on the details of the devastation or any other special effect part, as all was cut out to be like a reality camcorder movie so no $$$money on special effects. Innovative no doubt but, the camcorder thing could have been for say 20 -30 min of movie and he proper 70mm movie style picturing.overall no great movie, should be a on television and not theaters. i think may be the (lost) producer should stick to television and not try his hand at things that are stupid."

And he is not good enough to carry a short story on film off.It fails at virtually every level.I was checking my watch every 10 minutes or so, a good indicator of how poorly the film engages with its audience.<br/><br/>A film I will NEVER watch again.

His friends weren't too much better. i don't know if its the acting or there persona's. the acting just seemed like acting, so maybe that just means there bad actors. and before anyone says anything, yes i do realize that the movie is supposed to be set up like a documentary meaning all these people are supposed to be n00bs and what not, but thats not it, it something more then that. maybe its the production thats bad as well. There is a pretty good scene at the end of the movie when the military forces try and take out one of these Aliens, i wont tell you what happens, but i will say that it was filmed pretty well. probably one of the (*Thinking*) 3 or 4 good scenes in entire movie. I know the main selling point of this movie was the fact that the camera angle through-out the movie was that some guy is filming the events while they are happening.... but i think this movie would have been better off if they just filmed it with out that selling point. but those are just my thoughts. i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone whom i like or am friends with."

","Without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The story might have had a chance if it wasn't for the extremely poor directing and the one camera point-of-view angle. The reason I say worst movie ever is because, did these people (director, producers, writers, etc.) not learn anything from ""The Blair Witch Project"" fiasco? I am a big fan of Abrams (co-producer) from the Lost TV show. We love that show because it is done so well. But this thing was a huge disappointment. I'm glad those characters from the movie are dead; that means there will be no sequel. And what the heck does the title ""Cloverfield"" have to do with anything? Is that the monster's name? Is that the part of the city they are in? What does it mean? Now if you will excuse me, I have to write the producers and directors a letter asking for my money back."
"Dillypogo","8","0","1","19 August 2008"," Cloverfield: Shaky but suspenseful
","Why do movie monsters always seem to go for cities like New York with huge skyscrapers? King Kong, Godzilla and now the monster from Cloverfield. The plot revolves around four people at a going-away party who witness a huge explosion in the distance. They soon find out that a monster is rampaging through the city, destroying everything in its path.<br/><br/>The film is shot entirely on a camcorder and poses as actual footage filmed by one of the main characters, just like The Blair Witch Project. Cloverfield does this very effectively, although I found myself thinking ""why the bloody hell is he still filming"" many times. Of course this way of filming leads to the camera shaking A LOT which sounds annoying but it actually helps with the suspense and sometimes hides the monster, adding to the mystery.<br/><br/>The special effects in Cloverfield are fantastic and look realistic. When I first heard about this I didn't think they would be that great due to the way it was filmed but when I saw it I was pretty damn satisfied. The film does a good job of hiding the creature from clear view and I would have preferred it if it stayed that way, but there is a scene near the end where you get a very detailed and close up view of it which kind of took away its mysteriousness.<br/><br/>The cast give very convincing performances which help with the realism of the movie. With the way it was filmed, strong performances were necessary and this cast certainly doesn't disappoint. The main character, Hud, (T.J. Miller) who holds the camera for most of the film, provides a lot of humour throughout.<br/><br/>I found myself getting slightly impatient for things to kick off for the first twenty minutes during which the party is held. I think it just took too long for something interesting to happen such as the monster appearing. Maybe it's just me but I didn't enjoy watching footage in which someone goes around a room filming people. Also, if someone was to walk into that party they would have thought it was a party for the world's top models. Is everyone really that good looking in America? Anyway, Cloverfield is very exciting and the special effects are fantastic. I give it 8/10."

","Best monster movie ever? This was quite different from the norm as it had the shaky cam perspective...but it was actually done well for once. This view not only made you feel like you were part of the movie, but heightened the suspense quite a bit. I...(read more) loved how they hid the monster for the majority of the movie. Anyhow, after the first excruciatingly boring 20 minutes of drama between some rich kids, this film really takes off and never lets go. The effects are first rate (the crowd shots are amazing...especially the bridge scene...the monster is terrifying). The acting was believable, but the characters could've been written more plausibly...a lot of the decisions they made were totally illogical...but they grow on you and aren't as dumb as most horror movie characters. Overall, this film gets high marks for its no nonsense attempt at the monster genre within a context that felt chillingly real. A must watch!"

","This movie was junk! Skip it if you can.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is an garbage Hollywood hyped movie. You can EASILY Fast-Forward the 1st boring 20mins of the movie as the characters/acting have no real appeal to waste my time caring about them or there lives - due to bad acting + bad scripts.<br/><br/>The shaky camera perspective is annoying throughout the film, followed by the bad acting and dumb thinking characters. The story starts out with guy and girl in the NY apartment (oh I love u blah blah = fast-forward) then the bunch of yuppies are setting up for a COOOL NEW YEAR PARRRTY DUDUES (waste of time watching this), but then finally 20mins into the moves the ground shakes and the explosions hit. <br/><br/>Then you see everyone scramble to the street to see ""what's up dude"" building crumble about them. They take cover but then look on with amazement. Still not running home or getting the hell out of there. Then they see some big odd creature destroying everything (looks cool but not enough of the creature in the movie & why its there). The guy in the beginning gets a call from his girl and now wants to head into the middle of the creature's disaster zone to save her. His 2 friends a guy(his brother) and a girl try to stop him, BUT decide to come along to help (HOW UNREAL) and risk there lives too! ""if it was my bro I'd say good luck to ya or she's probably dead by now"" They head into the creatures domain and see something dropping from him, ah little creature babies. They look spider like, reminds me of the alien creatures in Starship Troopers. So they avoid everything risk getting into the building that's crumbling to find his girl alive. They leave and head to safer ground, the army finds them and copters them away from he site. BUT they guy/girl and camera bro's copter gets hit by the creature and they hit the ground. WOW still alive, how fake again. So they all get up (i guess the pilot is dead?) and start to run away as the cam-bro turns around and gets a FP-view of the creature + inside his gums ""yuck humans"" and the guy/girl run under a bridge for cover as they say bye byes and my name is blah and i can't act, if you find this tape you'll probably know how retarded us dudes are and know more about this cool creature. Then they get killed, the bridge falls on them etc. They then show a clip of them having a fun day they day before...wee ""But thank god they died, just wish it happened earlier before all the traded comments"" <br/><br/>So Cloverfield is a weak and boring movie and the first person view really makes you feel like you are in the middle of bad soap opera that u can' avoid. I could barely keep my hand off the FF button, it took about 30mins to watch this bad flick. Nevertheless the movie still isn't worth your time buying or renting, since the script & acting are way out there ""DUDE NO"". I could say much more about this movie, but it isn't worth my time!

","This was definitely an experience to say the least. The premise was in the beginning overdone. Large monster wrecks city lots of screaming lots of military firepower. But there was a twist that changed the whole thing keep the story on one person or group let the story be told in First person something rarely done without narrative. In this case it was done expertly. That twist led into a deeper story one of romance. I have to say when this movie came together with all its elements i was reborn. I never once saw myself as movie savvy or even a movie goer but the impact this movie had on me and my friends was like wow movies are more than a time burner. I am sure it will hit most viewers the same way. For the first time in 17+ years I was on the edge of my seat inhaling when the windows blew in holding my breath as the dust settled twitching my leg as the distance between point A and B was being covered. Me and friends still talk about if it was us in the sub tunnel running for our lives how we would not hesitate to turn back for the others. This may be me romanticizing the movie but it hit a note in the heart of 3 boys and 4 girls that night. ""Anything for love"" has never been such a real statement till then.

"conmech","9","0","1","11 July 2008"," A First of its Kind Â– Believe it or Not
","I had always thought about a movie where they use Blair Witch handy-cam style shooting combined with high quality CGI. I dreamed of it, they made it. First of all, I love the idea that it was shot over a tape which was shot previously, so we can see from time to time what was in the tape previously. Secondly, it's a great way of shooting a Godzilla-type movie, cause you can see the panic and the chaos from every angle. From the normal people having party, all the way to seeing it above from the helicopter. It really made me feel I'm in that chaotic place and gave me the terror from the first hand. I still can't figure out how they managed to add CGI effects to a moving, zooming and auto-focusing camera. It must have been so hard for them. The only strange part was we never got to see the camera and it was shooting in standard movie quality without a filter. But that must be for the visual quality's sake. It would look so crappy if they used a real camcorder or something. I also like the movies like this one where they set up the place and act in it in a single long shoot, like the masterpiece ""Children of Men"".<br/><br/>Something else I wanna say about this movie is, it's a radical one. So you either love it or hate it. Of course some people are going to hate it cause they don't like the style. But they don't have the right to say it's a bad movie just because they don't understand it. It's like someone who doesn't like rap saying Eminem sucks."
"MonacoF430","6","0","1","9 July 2008"," Fun, but not scary (contains spoiler
","Despite using the camera style from the 'Blair Witch Project', which I have never seen, though I'm told is very frightening, this movie is not scary. I believe this to be the case because of the heavy use of CGI, which just doesn't look real, and the fact that the writers have neglected to use some obvious 'jump' moments, e.g. when the crew are wandering through the tunnels, and instead of the bugs jumping at the camera, which would have looked way better than what they did, the camera switches to night vision, and we see the bugs climbing up walls, not scary.<br/><br/>Despite this, the first half of this movie is tremendous fun, especially the fights between the monster and soldiers.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would say that people expecting this to be a horror will be disappointed, but it remains a good bit of 'popcorn' cinema instead."
"commandercool88","8","0","2","8 July 2008"," Very intense, very disturbing.
","After months of anticipation, speculation, and internet hype... 'Cloverfield' has landed. The big question is: does it live up to the hype? The answer may surprise you, as it definitely surprised me. But the answer is yes, yes it does. It chills like few films of its kind, and puts nearly every other monster flick to absolute shame. A morbidly and disturbingly realistic portrait of a city - and its people - under attack, it stirs up many powerful and gut-wrenching emotions that haven't been felt since that one fateful day in September. It's truly haunting. Truly unforgettable. And I don't know if I could ever watch it again.<br/><br/>The hand-held camera approach only allows one point of view, from the eyes of the victims themselves. There's no backstory, no explanation, and we only get a good look at the monster at the very end. We're along for the thrilling and haunting adventure, knowing nothing more or less than the characters whose shoes we inhabit. It's a difficult movie, because it feels so damn real. If you go to the movies for entertainment and escapism, you may want to look elsewhere. 'Cloverfield' is raw, unadulterated terror that will chill you to the bone. The explosive suspense is at times nail-biting as you wait for the next strike to level more of the Big Apple, or more importantly, your spirits. It's when 'Cloverfield' is most effective, simply because we have no comprehension of what this creature is. By the film's end, we have a much clearer idea of this terrifying monster. It's understandable to put a face to the destruction, but the film is at its best when the mystery and anticipation is still high.<br/><br/>You won't find any manufactured thrills here, and the film understands there is no easy way out. Everything is as realistic as you could hope for, and at times, it's a little too much. The initial strike launches us into the same confusion, desperation, and disorientation that 9/11 did to us, and it's a film like this that proves how fresh those terrible memories still are. That's why I find it difficult to say that I enjoyed this movie, because it brought me back to a place and time that I'd rather forget. But 'Cloverfield' all too effectively creates the same dark atmosphere, and it's difficult to resist the chills during the experience. The head of the Statue of Liberty landing on the streets, the daunting escape through the Subway tunnels, the complete and utter destruction. It's important not to give much away, but you must experience 'Cloverfield' for yourself.<br/><br/>Casting unknowns in the lead roles was a pitch-perfect move, as the film highlights the unpredictability of the world we live in. At any given moment, everything we've come to know can be turned upside down completely, and it can affect you or me or everyone we know. 'Cloverfield' runs off of raw human emotion, and there's no way to escape the horror. It hits hard, and it packs a lasting and ferocious punch. If you want to cut straight to the point, 'Cloverfield' is an effective movie. No question about it. It's a gripping, emotional, and disturbing ride that quickly becomes so much more than your typical monster flick. It's what 'Godzilla' failed so miserably at nearly ten years ago on the big screen, but who could have predicted the devastating true-life events that would unfold only a few short years later. And if you thought for a moment September 11th wouldn't affect your viewing of 'Cloverfield', think again. This is all too real, and you won't soon forget it.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

But if you think that, you are dead wrong.<br/><br/>The one big thing different about Cloverfield, is that the monster's origins or motives of attacking isn't explained, and is probably not destroyed in the end either, though that is one of the many things left in the open.<br/><br/>This is a very good thing because it's much more fun to have questions about what's happening, and to come up with your own conclusions.<br/><br/>Not only that, but there are some great special effects and thrills in the movie which make it more effective.<br/><br/>I will definitely be giving Cloverfield repeat viewings, I may possibly see things I didn't pick up before.

","I have to thank J.J. Abrams for coming up with an original monster movie because there hasn't been one for a long time. It's nice to see a brand new monster especially from America because this is technically our very first monster.<br/><br/>Now for the movie, the plot is actually quite entertaining and besides the first boring 20 minutes that show the characters, it is actually a solid, intense film with many dramatic and thrilling scenes. In my opinion, I enjoyed the camera option because for me it felt like I was actually in the film. (Besides getting over the fact that there could never be something like this happen.) But sometimes the camera would shake way too much and it would become nauseating at points to watch which detracts from the experience. Thankfully, it doesn't happen often but for those who are motion-sickness, this is not the film for you. The actors, even though they are not entirely famous, they actually do a pretty good job at portraying their character and they exceed my expectations for them because I thought they wouldn't that good of a job. The only real complaint I had with this film is the ending. The ending is disappointing because it finishes with something totally unrelated to the story, unless you notice something small during the shot. Most likely though, you're not going to spot it because I know I didn't when I saw this for my first time. Somebody told me about it and then I realized what is was. Overall, Cloverfield is an intense film with great dialog, great characters, but an unsatisfying end to the tale. I recommend you to see it if you haven't already.<br/><br/>I give Cloverfield: <br/><br/>4/5 or 8/10"

Not everything is happy though. He and Beth, who seemed to have a relationship going, have a fight and Beth leaves (with another guy). Shortly thereafter the entire building shakes and the lights go out. People go out on the streets fearing an earthquake. But soon buildings seem to collapse randomly and people realize that this is not the forces of nature at play. They are under attack.<br/><br/>Comments: Filmed entirely in the way of a home recording so the first word that comes to mind is: Different. It's shaky and of poor quality. Some odd cuts and also some material of a previous recordings acting as flashbacks. I can see how this can be annoying but it didn't disturb me. I think it worked fine.<br/><br/>What did disturb me was Hud. Hud is the guy holding the camera most of the time and has one heck of a problem keeping his mouth shut. He also is something quite stupid. Yes, I know, Hud is experiencing some extreme events and some people react that way. But hey, I'm watching a movie about alien monsters attacking New York, so can we keep the annoying but realistic people out of the movie? It's not like it is really an documentary, even if that is some of the point with the camera. I found myself rooting for the monsters trying to kill Hud...<br/><br/>The there is the ending. I like open endings most of the times. Leaves something for the viewers to think for themselves. Something different than most movies. And I respect the writers/directors choice to do it this way. But I myself would have gone with a traditional Hollywood-ending were the good guys clearly win. Not as realistic maybe, but leaves you with a lot more feel-good, and you leave the movie a lot more content. Now I got the feeling that it was cut short and I was missing a lot, especially since the movie is just 80 minutes.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I did like it. Good effects and I liked the way the monsters were slowly introduced, and never really explained. It got me curious. I really wanted to see the next scene, see what more was revealed, what happened. So I quickly got engaged in the movie, and whenever that happens a lot is won. Therefore it is unfortunate about the abrupt ending. I felt left out. But well, it worked really well for an evening, and I got rid of Hud. Kudos to the monsters! 6/10"

","It has been noted that the one thing people are really interested in is people. The whole history of culture and art stands in testament to this fact. So it beggars belief why anyone would decide that the one perspective we have really been missing all this time is a bullet's. Watching a film from a bullet's perspective is like viewing the first world war from the perspective of the ground where Archduke Ferdinand was shot. Sure it has a necessary role to play and even a small share of the action, but it's completely beside the point.<br/><br/>It is therefore somewhat refreshing to see a new perspective come this time not in the form of a munition but a video-camera. OK, a video-camera doesn't whiz round the screen or allow you to bend time in an ever so nifty way, but it does do one incredible thing. It forces you to make a film about people. This mainly boils down to the fact that a video-camera is limited to being picked up by one person and recording another from roughly the direction of the first. The result, a film with not one slick bullet-tracking shot to be seen; which we can agree is a good thing.<br/><br/>Which is why I find myself drawn to the inescapable conclusion that Cloverfield is like a hydrogen airship; it is a really neat idea that is unfortunately also a total disaster. As it turns out, when it was noted that ""the one thing that people are really interested in is people"", what was meant was ""the one thing people are interested in is people more interesting than themselves"", and it is in this respect that Cloverfield fails with gusto.<br/><br/>This is because Cloverfield coats itself in the banality of an authentic home-movie like a seal coats itself in the Arctic Ocean. It immerses itself in it, rolls in it and playfully flaps a flipper just to see what will happen. For the first half-an-hour of the film very little does happen. Where it's not happening is New York, in a party - which is like one of those New York parties you've heard about filled with exciting intelligent people who have interesting, insightful things to say, except that it's not. It's a party filled with people who don't have anything interesting to say at all.<br/><br/>So when the party is interrupted by a multi-storey alien who insists on eating the guests it's a welcome change. This is a feeling that will no doubt be familiar to anyone who has been to a party in New York. And with this the focus changes to the toing and froing of the party's survivors pursued by the hungry, hungry aliens. At least I assume they're being pursued because the aliens are hungry; quite what they are up to remains somewhat of a mystery.<br/><br/>And so it ends, and I find myself thinking again about bullets and how perhaps they're not so bad after all, and I find myself wishing that film-makers would just exert some self control, and thinking wouldn't it be nice if for once they thought not ""can I do it?"" but ""should I do it?"""

","I'm beginning to think some critics are completely out to lunch. Take a completely improbable premise like -- New York City is being attacked by some strange monster -- and run with it. I'd say the chances of coming up with anything even half as entertaining as 'Cloverfield' is about nil. What amazed me most, besides the wonderful way these filmmakers found to visualize this crazy event, is the almost perfect pitch of the young actors in it. They've done a completely convincing job of putting themselves in this fantasy, and that can't have been easy. I'd say several of them have a long career in front of them, though you will probably be annoyed by the comments of the character, Hud, who's holding the camera. That was clearly overdone, but no matter, it doesn't really spoil the party.<br/><br/>I see some are comparing this to the 'Blair Witch' movie because of the digital camera thing. To me it's more reminiscent of the classic 'The Blob', one of Steve McQueen's earliest films, only about 100 times more impressive. I'm looking forward to Bad Robot's next offering."
"malmroes","7","0","2","4 July 2008"," Has a lot of potential, but does not quite make it through.
","I had not heard that much about Cloverfield when I first saw a trailer on the internet, but it did look good. The idea of narrating a story through the lens of a camera had been seen before, but the idea of making a disaster movie this way still appealed to me, though I was not expecting much, but still hoped to get that wow effect which is very much in demand these days. The movie and the ideas behind it really had potential and succeeds at some points to capture and engage the audience because you feel like you are in the middle of the crisis. Unfortunately some issues relating to physics etc. is able to spoil the movie if one thinks very logically. The movie has for instance been criticized for lacking realistic physics relating to the cameraman. A point which can also be seen as a let down for the audience and more or less destroying the reality factor, is the quality of the video, which is quite good. This is of course to make the movie as good in quality as any other cinematic movies, but some might still think that this is a flaw and makes the movie lose a bit of its supposed atmosphere. At points the animation of the monsters look a bit misplaced and it is clear that they are animated creatures. It is hard to criticize this because the perception of the human is much harder to convince in this age of technology than ever before, so it is difficult to make animated characters that look genuine, especially the fictional ones. There is no musical score, obviously, but the sound effects are very good and when you sit in the cinema while gun bullets hiss and military tanks works it way through the streets, the sound really makes it all come to life. Again the sound is in a bit of an over quality state for a normal handy-cam, but it does not spoil the film too much. The acting part is overall okay, but not perfect. They are able to make the movie experience endurable, but again, they do not add up to the wow factor that they could have.<br/><br/>To sum up Cloverfield is a justifiable movie and easy to watch as the story is not that complex. It also tries to show the audience the innermost urges and instincts that follow with trying to survive and it both delivers and fails at doing so. The idea of narrating the story through the lens of a camera has got some real potential, but the top of the peak has not yet been reached. It is all a matter of time before a big breakthrough is made and meanwhile one must just wait and see. See through the lens of progression."
"Medacakathareal","7","0","2","4 July 2008"," Solid Monster Movie
","I waited until several months after the release of the DVD to see the film mainly because I wanted every last bit of the hype/complaints to wash off so I could see this movie unhindered. And here's what I saw: The movie starts off slow and fairly boring, main characters are introduced and its basically a home movie documenting Rob's going away party. The movie takes a turn for the awesome when the attack begins, at first as an Earthquake and then the monster begins blowing stuff up... The main issue I have is that too much of the monster is revealed too early in the film, for a movie able to keep the monster fairly under-wraps before its release it sure does give stuff away quickly...<br/><br/>The monster's originality, however, makes up for it, it doesn't resemble any monster I've seen, it looks like a mix between a bat, spider, and a squid to my eyes, especially since (and this is also very cool) it drops smaller creatures off its back like a mother spider... The smaller creatures, at least to me, seemed reminiscent of the Ant-Lions from Half-Life 2 but they were original, don't get me wrong...<br/><br/>The dialog is a bit obnoxious at times but it fits the characters through whose eyes we've seen, since they're kids in their mid-twenties they spend a lot of time going ""Oh sh*t! Did you see that!"" which is what you would do in the event of a monster attack anyway... The hand-held view can get annoying because there isn't always something to look at on screen, we see lots of the floor and our camera-man's feet but for those crucial moments where we see the monsters the camera is still enough to get a good look at them...<br/><br/>Another plus is that this is a short movie, it doesn't waste your time and it leaves you wondering where the monster came from, they never tell you! You're left to come up with your own theories, but I'm hoping for a non-hand-held sequel where the origins of the monster are explained at least in part... There is a bit too much time spent on the characters, who we really don't care much about at first but by the end I found myself rooting for Rob because, after all, he's just like us no matter how successful he becomes...<br/><br/>It leaves you hanging, its a solid movie, not without its issues but at the same time its an exciting adrenaline filled romp through the monster movie genre..."

","It's reprehensible that pieces of cow puckey like this can be praised as ""excellent."" But then I realize that most of the people responsible for these laudatory comments are about 12 and get confused between knowing this movie from the proverbial shinola.<br/><br/>I have read many of the other posted comments, and I agree with what most people are saying: Who really cares about the characters? It is established in the first 5 minutes that every one of them is superficial, vain, and very, very stupid. I can only hope that any corporation that would make the decision to promote one of these dilettantes to an overseas position would be filing chapter 11 quite soon.<br/><br/>All that aside though, what really got to me about this movie is that it makes the destruction of NYC into ""entertainment."" I was in NYC on a certain Tuesday in September, and believe me there was nothing entertaining about it. For those of you who were pretty young in 2001 should look up some archival material and consider how cool it was when 3,000 people died, and no CGI. Even in a movie like ""I Am Legend"" the vision was apocalyptic, and treated reverently; not as a backdrop for a bunch of self absorbed idiots.<br/><br/>Oh, and as a New Yorker, I have to make this observation -- why try for the Brooklyn Bridge when that would put you on Long Island, where people would still have to be airlifted or shipped out?

The action and all that suspense flows naturally, and the characters are really doing what people would surely do in real life (with exception of ""saving the camera above all of things""). J.J.

What brought me to ""Cloverfield"" was the most compelling TV trailer I'd seen since ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" over 40 years ago.<br/><br/>While watching ""Cloverfield,"" I thought, ""While always clever, the first 20 minutes are almost tedious; and what follows is not particularly suspenseful or scary."" I needn't share these thoughts with my wife, as she hated ""Cloverfield,"" without my help. THEN I had the first movie-induced nightmare I'd experienced in 50 years. I now understand the real power of ""Cloverfield"". Part ""Blair Witch,"" part ""Spielberg's War of the Worlds,"" part ""X-files,"" part generic teen movie, ""Cloverfield"" is also a whole lot more. ""Cloverfield"" is the closest replication of a nightmare I've ever experienced. Time and spatial elements are cleverly distorted. Sound effects elements are muffled. While the gore is convincingly explicit, it's not exploited, and much of the violence is suggested. The emotions I experienced must be a lot like those radio listeners felt while listening to the infamous Mercury Theater ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast. It was the spatial anomalies, however, that disturbed me the most. While the creature was impossibly enormous, it was also unbelievably flexible, apparently capable of extending itself several times its actual size. Aren't fears, at first, suggested, then ""in your face,"" the stuff of nightmares? Aren't darkness and confusion, ""the stuff,"" as well? ""Cloverfield"" has all of these. Further, the monster's progeny, spider-like creatures the size of hogs, create the more immediate threat, and the fear of ""What's moving on the ceiling of my bedroom?"" Kudos to the entire cast for making such ""ordinary"" characters memorable. Even more kudos to the production team of ""Cloverfield"" for doing what I always thought was impossible, i.e. the perfect recreation of the nightmare experience.<br/><br/>I caution anyone who either directly experienced or lost loved ones on 911 that this movie could induce unbearable post traumatic stress. Certainly, ""Cloverfield"" and its resultant nightmare will haunt me for many years to come. I can state, without a doubt, ""Cloverfield"" is the most provocative science fiction film since ""The Matrix"" and may well be the best science fiction / fantasy film ever made. It's also likely to be one of the ten best genre films of the decade. I give ""Cloverfield"" a ""10""."

What would have been tense by the use of fixed camera positions was even made more so because instead they used a shaky cam (or...a camera very much like you'd buy at the store). It was made even more original by making it supposedly a video recovered after the incident, though what makes me give this movie a 9 star rating was only because of the unrealistic of it. The camera was put through so much crap that I was completely surprised that the video file was fully intact upon finding.<br/><br/>They even added more mystery to it by not revealing of what the movie is about, other than the near complete devastation of New York City, which as we all know that if a movie involves complete devastation it is a must see. Even more so, there was only 20 minutes worth of the boring crap, and the rest was pure action! What also adds to the suspense and mystery is that they do not disclose too much information about the monster, in fact, there is only one really clear shot of the monster.

Very often, our vision is not steady. It's shaky, very often it spurts. Despite news articles about CLOVERFIELD's audience-members becoming dizzy while subjected to all the big shaky screen camera-work, I found the shaky-cam gimmick very restrained, paying more attention to the monster and the frightened humans in it's path, rather than saying ""Ohhh, lookie at the cool camera angles!"".

Seriously, if you're scared and think you're about to die are you really going to carry around a camera? Even in a scene where creepy monsters descend with lightning speed, the cameraman doesn't feel inclined to drop the camera and kick the crap out of the monsters. He even somehow retains his grip on the camera when something...really bad happens (I won't say what).<br/><br/>And you'll yell at me for being picky, but the movie's physics are completely unrealistic. For example: How much would the monster need to weigh in order to cause an earthquake throughout all of Manhattan with each step? A lot! But somehow the monster leaves no footprints in the asphalt, or even in the soft dirt of central park. Pretty lame omission, I think! And don't get me started on how the monster is able to whack a bridge in two with it's tail without causing a massive explosion at the contact site...anyone within a radius of 500 yards would be immediately killed by the shrapnel.<br/><br/>But in the end it was a fun movie, and I actually grabbed my teddy bear a few times.

","There are event movies which are big by their nature and there are event movies that whip up hysteria and become big. Quite often, event movies don't live up to their hype. ""Cloverfield"" is one of the biggest examples of an event movie that only has itself to blame if it fails to live up to its expectations as it created its own hysteria. Fortunately, for the filmmakers as much as anyone else, this is magnificent, popcorn-entertainment which is cinema spectacle at its very best.<br/><br/>Having whipped up a burden of expectation with one of the most intriguing, effective and inventive marketing campaigns for many years, ""Cloverfield"" then does more to build up the tension by starting off with some of the most annoying characters for many years. They are tedious, basically because they have perfectly normal, boring problems (all of which are encapsulated in an opening party sequence that sets up the camcorder gimmick as well) and they talk like so: ""Dude, he's, like, your main dude and, I love you man, but you blew her off, and man, you're going to Japan and she's crazy about you bro, like, right now"". So, after twenty minutes of this you're more than happy for the violence and gratuitous destruction to begin. And when it begins, it's clear: this was worth the wait.<br/><br/>Like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"", this film destroys big landmarks like there's no tomorrow. From the destruction of the Statue of Liberty to the complete end of Manhattan, director Matt Reeves pulls no punches. There are explosions, violent deaths, all of your usual disaster movie bread and butter moments, but with a twist. For large portions of the film you see very little. This is the first use of ambiguity in a film that gorges on uncertainty and it works superbly. The near misses and the small glimpses grip you and terrify you. This is due to the camcorder style cinematography which, whilst it has apparently caused motion, is particularly well done. Not quite being able to see what you would normally be given freely is enticing. It is excellent and effective film-making, at once bombastic by nature of the plot but restrained by nature of the direction. Imagine how dull this would have been if it had been directed by Michael Bay.<br/><br/>There is more than simple big wham-bam-thank-you-ma'm moments. There is a claustrophobic sequence in a tunnel, which provides thrills and chills. The characters' suffering makes them easy to follow and, whilst you don't love them, you do care for them. The demise of one character behind a screen is bleak and has devastating punch.<br/><br/>But the major strength of this film is simple. It is its ambiguity. We never have a scientist (probably called P.L. O'Texplanation) turning up telling us what the monster is or where it came from or the answers to any of the film's many other questions. We do get the inevitable payoff, but it gives us precisely zero answers. We don't, on the other hand, ever really find out the fate of most of our characters. It all builds up a web of questions, and few, if any, answers.<br/><br/>Which means you go away wanting more, wondering and with you imagination running wild. This is not a great film, just a terrific, thrilling and terrifying experience that will last long after you leave the cinema."

OK maybe the acting of some of the characters wasn't outstanding, but that is not that crucial in a movie like this, just like the fact that they go all the way through Manhatten to get a girl while there is something extremely dangerous alive isn't really believable, but I have been thrilled the whole movie and thats what counts.<br/><br/>Go and see it!!!!"

","This monster movie tries hard to be ""Godzilla"" for Generation Y, but it doesn't quite make it. <br/><br/>It's a terrific looking film and it's capably acted -- when you watch the special features on the DVD and realize that most of the time actors were interacting with nothing but green screens, it makes both the acting and the effects that much more impressive. But it's one of those gimmick movies that's pinned down by the very element that makes it unique (I use the word ""unique"" loosely, since ""The Blair Witch Project"" has already covered this ground, to an extent). The hook in this film is that the destruction of New York and the attempts of a small band of twenty-somethings to stay alive is captured on a camcorder by one of the kids. But the technical necessities required to pull off this stunt result in too many logical flaws, not the least of which is how long would it take someone running for his life from a giant monster ravaging downtown Manhattan to ditch the camera? <br/><br/>But of all the holes the screenplay creates, the one most perplexing was this: how the hell do all of these young kids afford spacious apartments in Manhattan? <br/><br/>Grade: B"

","Obviously, I had absolutely nothing better to do....<br/><br/>Get 4 or 5 friends together, grab a deck of cards and pop in the Cloverfield DVD.<br/><br/>SETUP: The only cards you'll need are the Ace, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of clubs (or ""clovers""). Each card is designated to a character. Say Rob = Ace, Hud = 2, Beth = 3, Marlena = 4, Lily = 5. Shuffle the cards face down, then let each player choose one. Finally, before starting the movie, select a timing interval for re-shuffling and re-picking the cards. Anywhere from 7-10 minutes should work nicely.<br/><br/>RULES: Once everyone's got their cards, start the movie. Every time anyone in the film says the name your card is designated to, you drink. It's that simple. Then, when the film hits the 7-minute-mark (or whatever time interval you chose for your game), quickly re-shuffle and pick again.<br/><br/>Sound easy? Sound boring?

","Let me put this as simple as I can:<br/><br/>I just saw the movie, spent enjoyable 1 1/2 hours (or so), it was good. The special effects are really AWESOME, I have no idea how they did it, but they look better here (with difficult lightning situations and LoFi-material!!) than, say, Iron Man!<br/><br/>In fact the first half hour is extremely well done and balanced, it's a pity the whole film isn't like this<br/><br/>BECAUSE: Why these actors! Sure, they look good, are young and ""unknown faces"" but they have absolutely no sense of drama. A giant monster is attacking New York, and they not once scream or curse or freak out or do something REAL! Also, the public sequences with dozens of people ""jogging"" away from the monster, partly with laughs on their faces, feel strange.<br/><br/>Then, where is the blood? Okay, this doesn't have to be Hostel, and I understand the producers desire to make it PG, but then JJ Abrahms said he wanted to make a thrilling, exciting monster-movie. I'm not talking torn-apart limbs here, but a little more blood would have served the purpose.<br/><br/>Also, if you are making a disaster movie in NY, its logical people see parallels to 9/11. And IMHO the filmmakers should have addressed that (see how brilliant Spielberg did it in War of the Worlds), one or two sentences about ""Terrorists?"" would have been enough.<br/><br/>The camera operator aka ""nerdy guy"" was nerve-wracking (in a bad way). Without this unnecessary, nerdy humor the whole movie have worked better (see 28 Days Later). Have the guts to make it bleak, goddammmit!<br/><br/>And please, if you're making a film in a Documentary-style, stay away from product placement.<br/><br/>ALL IN ALL: A great film that could have been a MASTERPIECE if not for the above mentioned things. But still, watch it if you can!"
"Buddy-51","7","0","1","10 May 2008"," stunning visuals overcome narrative weaknesses
","You sure gotta' give those New Yorkers props for resilience. If they aren't doing battle with space aliens, a bio-engineered plague, or a global warming-inspired ice age, they're fending off a nondescript creature that's come out of nowhere to lay waste to large sections of Lower and Midtown Manhattan. And indeed, after ""War of the Worlds,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" and now ""Cloverfield,"" one wonders just how much abuse one little island should be expected to take before finally crying uncle.<br/><br/>Blending the content of ""Godzilla"" with the style of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" the makers of ""Cloverfield"" relate their story entirely through the use of a hand-held camera, as a group of twenty-something friends have their cocktail party rudely interrupted by the sudden appearance of a monster capable of tipping over skyscrapers and squashing cars as if they were bugs. The movie follows a remnant of partygoers as they wend their way through the smoky chaos of the ruined city, with one of them recording the horrors and devastation on a camcorder as he goes.<br/><br/>Despite having a relatively low budget for a film of this type, ""Cloverfield"" does a remarkable job in blending CGI graphics with home video technology. It may be true that the inky blackness of the nighttime setting helps to cover a multitude of special effects sins (some viewers may be frustrated by the murky indistinctiveness of the monster itself), but, on the whole, director Matt Reeves, cinematographer Michael Bonvillain, editor Kevin Stitt, and a team of highly talented FX and production artists are to be commended for achieving so much with so little.<br/><br/>The advantage of the you-are-there approach that the filmmakers have adopted is that it makes the audience feel more a part of the actual event than if the story were given a slicker, more conventional presentation. Suffice it to say there's no Will Smith here slapping on a flight suit and zooming off into the wild blue yonder to duke it out mano-a-mano with the creature and singlehandedly save the world. These are ordinary, average people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and it's no coincidence that much of the imagery is clearly intended to evoke memories of 9/11. After all, a world where post-apocalyptic paranoia runs rampant is no place for conventional action heroes. Therefore, the verisimilitude of the piece is greatly enhanced by the use of relatively unknown players in the key roles (Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan, Odette Yustman, Mike Vogel).<br/><br/>The disadvantage of this 1st person-restricted approach is that it occasionally leads to repetitiveness in the storytelling, with even the gimmick itself threatening to wear out its welcome quicker than the monster himself does. The narrow focus is also liable to drive some viewers crazy by not providing any kind of resolution or explanation to neatly wrap things up at the end (to me, this is a strength rather than a weakness).<br/><br/>Finally, theatergoers who were rendered nauseated by the nonstop bobbing-and-weaving camera-work on the big screen should know that the effect is much less pronounced when viewed on TV.<br/><br/>The characters and their relationships may be no more than mere window dressing placed at the service of the story, but that really doesn't matter, for in the case of ""Cloverfield,"" the film-making itself is the star."
"jagoroth","8","0","1","10 May 2008"," Refreshing perspective
","I didn't have any desire to see the movie initially, thinking it to be over-hyped.<br/><br/>However, I borrowed the film from a very insistent friend and watched it. I found it to be very entertaining, for both dramatic effect as well as action. While there was a part of me that expected more action, I think in retrospect that the personal story aspect of the movie is the most important. Rather than telling a tale of pure destruction in an omniscient point of view, the viewer is taken right down there among the characters of the film. What results is not us watching a movie, but *experiencing* the movie.<br/><br/>I liked the visual and audio effects very much, and the jarring of the camera (and resulting visual errors) was a nice touch. The chaos of the film contrasts very distinctly from most Hollywood monster movies, giving it a rather refreshing feel. I felt as though the characters were normal people, and not heroes; that helps the film, I think, to refrain from being predictable. I was pleasantly surprised pretty much the whole time and now regret not having seen it in theaters!"
"Fever","7","0","1","9 May 2008"," Freakish and terrifying
","I was a big fan of ""The Blair Witch Project"". The idea behind it was great and it was spooky as hell. This is very much along the same lines. In documentary-style filming, a group of 20-somethings live out a monster attack on Manhattan through the eyes of the camera holder. Trust me, it's freaky and made me sick to my stomach (pop some Dramamine before you watch this one). There was very little gore, but the effects and camera action make you feel like you're racing down the streets for your life. Though there's lots of unanswered questions like -what was it? -why did it attack? -did anyone survive? -what exactly happened to Marlena? blah blah blah, it was a very effective movie in basically scaring the crap out of you. The last scene is especially moving as you hear the infamous ""thud"" of the camera, just like you do in ""Blair Witch"". This is a wild one."
"The_Orenda","5","0","1","8 May 2008"," Monstrous Ingenuity.
","Be it as it may, there was tremendous ingenuity in putting together a Blair Witch Project-type camcorder and making it a Godzilla experience. Cloverfield is a brilliant experiment and the lack of monster movies in this day and age only added to my interest in seeing this film. The end result is a mixed feeling, mind you. Poor Hud can't film worth squat and many scenes have you scratching your head, wondering what's going on. On top of that, the story is a little too flaky. After getting a single call from your lady friend, you decide to go to the main battleground of where the monster is to get her? She doesn't even send texts to keep in touch! Nevermind that a couple of the characters are mere acquaintances that don't have a heck of a lot in common with the main characters.<br/><br/>But Cloverfield is an interesting movie. Seeing the perspective of the monster and the little bugs it shakes out that attack and bite people, is a truly terrifying experience which makes Cloverfield more closer in line with the horror genre than other giant monster movies like King Kong or Godzilla. In Cloverfield, no one really has a happy ending, which could include you if you're not prepared for shaky camcorder antics again, but the film holds its own well enough to enjoy the end of New York as we know it."
"rlange-3","9","0","1","8 May 2008"," Really Great and Scary Entertainment
","Not Alien but it is a very scary movie, very well done. It's surprising to me that so many reviewers panned it. If you really can't stand the Blair Witchy hand held camera stuff, perhaps this isn't your movie.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes are slow and marginally entertaining at best, but they lay the groundwork for the nonstop action for the rest of the film. There are several simply spectacular events and a handful of very spooky ones. The characters are not necessarily ones you like as individuals, but they are well acted and seem very real. By the end of the movie I thought they had all showed some unexpected sterling qualities. The only thing that annoyed me slightly was the lead female running around in heels or at times barefoot with broken glass everywhere -- I think she would have swapped them for something more functional. But that's a minor point.<br/><br/>The dialog was not a high point of the movie, but it added some significant depth to the main characters. What some are complaining about as bad lines are pretty much what you would expect from a guy like ""Hud"" in my opinion. In fact it was nice to see ordinary people facing an extraordinary situation without superheroics.<br/><br/>Both monster types were genuinely scary, and I am rarely scared even though I want to be. Marletta's wound was especially well done, as were the final scenes of her agony.<br/><br/>It was also great to see a movie in which the military was portrayed as the military, with no evil plotting general or totally incompetent or uncaring individuals. And while there is an overlay of a defense project gone amiss, this is not a movie in which we are lectured by the antimilitary crowd -- a major improvement.<br/><br/>If you liked the movie (I saw it on DVD), check out the special features, especially the documentary on the CGI work. Very well done.<br/><br/>In summary, unless you strongly dislike hand held cams, this is great entertainment. Highly recommended."

"23skidoo-4","8","0","1","23 April 2008"," A well done film, but slow to start
","Although I never bought into the whole Blair Witch phenomena, I still enjoy unusual ""point of view"" films, whether they be simulated newscasts like Special Bulletin and Without Warning, or films like Cloverfield that let you make-believe that you're in some awful alternate universe watching actual documentary footage of an apocalypse.<br/><br/>I never saw Cloverfield in the theatre, just on DVD, but I get the feeling the film plays a lot better on the small screen. After all, it is built around home-video footage and that's not the type of stuff really intended for the big screen. As such, it's quite an absorbing ride. I've heard people complain about plot holes, and things being unexplained, etc. I just read one professional review that says the film should have broken away from the first-person occasionally. These types of complaints obviously miss the entire point of the film. The characters never got any answers, so why should we? (At least, not until the sequel!)<br/><br/>I do have to complain a little about the first 15 minutes or so. I really dislike the ""character building"" prologues that seem to be obligatory in so many disaster films. I've seen some movies (Towering Inferno comes to mind) that go damn near an hour before the actual main event happens. So often these scene-setters are pretty dull, and Cloverfield's is no exception, save for a couple of funny moments and the introduction of Marlena. Especially with a movie like this, I think a quicker ""cut to the chase"" would have been a better idea, and any character building could have been handled either by the characters as they progressed through the crisis (a good example of one such moment in the film is Marlena joking with Hud about Superman and Garfield), or by simply expanding on the plot point that once in awhile we see an earlier section of tape recorded about a month earlier. <br/><br/>The cast do the best they can with what is, by its very nature, very limiting material. Lizzy Caplan's Marlena is a standout character who I wish was given more to do (the actress reminds me very much if Moira Kelly in a few scenes, too), and Michael Stahl-David does a great job as Rob Hawkins (I wonder if it's intentional or a coincidence that the character has the same name as Rob Hawkins in another end-of-the-world production, Jericho?). And TJ Miller as Hud, despite spending most of the time behind the camera, manages to be both ""documenter"" and comic relief in some pretty dire circumstances.<br/><br/>Incidentally they missed a bet with the DVD; instead of keeping the film in its theatrical ""filmized"" look, I was hoping it would revert back to the original video look, which would have made things look even more realistic. Oh well.<br/><br/>According to the DVD, JJ Abrams was inspired by Gojira. He was also obviously inspired by 9/11 (the scene where the heroes take refuge in a store from an advancing wall of collapsed- building dust is almost beat-for-neat identical to footage I remember of a similar take-cover situation on 9/11. Will Cloverfield be remembered as a document responding to a traumatic event, the way Gojira/Godzilla was a direct response to Hiroshima and Nagasaki? There's no way to tell right now. It will be remembered as one heck of a monster movie, and a noble (if not always 100% successful) experiment in film-making."

","I'll always remember what I ate in the theater watching Cloverfield: a bag of smuggled Tootsie Rolls. That's because this is a very memorable film. It's Godzilla with a handicam, following a group of tame but horny (it's PG-13) teenagers as they journey through New York as a raging monster from outer space attacks the city. Their story is less important that that of their camera, which has been on their shoulders during the course of the film. Indeed, they believe that future generations will want to know what went down on that horrible day. ""Cloverfield"" is actually very frightening. A surprising attack by the monster on a helicopter, a chick exploding into blood, and that shaky, shaky camera add to the deep realism of the situation. I wouldn't call this film a masterpiece.

The blair witch project seemed like they were real, but not as real as in cloverfield. The things the people said, and the things they did, made it seem realistic. It made it feel like it was actually happening and like you were right there. Overall, I believe it to be the best film this year, and believe me, I've seen some pretty poor films this year."

This film had a full blown crew and actors so it had the potential to be filmed Hollywood style but instead the film makers went with a newer and different style from the medium. There was absolutely no plot to this movie. I mean yes and no but mainly this is a monster movie. I found myself laughing almost the whole movie. And it's not that I thought this film was bad. I liked it because I am open-minded and have a film background. But I can already see customers at Blockbuster bring this film back and want there money back. Customers did that with Sweeny Todd because it's a musical. That's so lame. If you don't like a film because of your close-minded attitude don't watch that film.

By choosing relatively unknown people you didn't feel like you were watching a bunch of actors running from a monster, you felt like you were watching a bunch of people running from a monster. That made it really easy to get sucked in. Also, the choice of actor for Hud was great. He had a very distinct voice so you could always tell when he was talking which was good since he wasn't visible through most of the movie. The creature design was excellent, truly other-worldly, like nothing I've seen before. All in all I'd say this was a very successful and watchable monster movie."

","Even though I didn't watch the movie in the cinema, where it is at it's best, it blew me away. The style of filming with the hand held camera might take some getting used to at first but it adds so much to the experience. The special effects are mind blowing and the film fortunately doesn't destroy itself by using typical clichés like we have seen in so many other comparable movies. You have no idea what's going to happen, it just happens. <br/><br/>The beautiful thing about the movie is that you feel the excitement that the characters feel. It's almost as if you are in there with them. You are just as insecure every step of the way as they are. No additional information, nothing. You know what the characters know and you see what they see. Something that has never been done in the capturing way Cloverfield does it. <br/><br/>The fact that the film has no music only adds to the excitement. It amplifies that you are there with the characters and not in the theater or at home watching a movie. <br/><br/>The film however does have a downside. It's short! I wanted to see more! Why don't they make hand held camera's that work longer then 74 minutes!?<br/><br/>This is one of the very few movies in it's genre that I would recommend to anyone. Even if you are not fond of the genre there is simply to much to like. The movie tells a capturing story and keeps you on the tip of your seat from beginning to end.

","Cloverfield is a monster movie with a difference. I really liked the idea that the whole movie is from the viewpoint of Hud who is recording the entire monster-episode on his video cam. This gives the entire movie a very realistic appeal. Also, for most part of the movie, the viewer is hooked to the screen and feels very much a part of the entire episode. Maintains a good grip throughout. However, my only grudge against movies like Cloverfield and The Mist is the crappy ending. I was very disappointed withe the climax of Cloverfield - i mean after 90 mins didn't want to see the entire true-love and rescue operation go off in vain. Also no explanation is given for the monster- its left to the viewers imagination - whether its natural or caused by a military experiment etc. Performances are very realistic. Overall a good movie with a disappointing ending !!"

","I almost didn't get past the first fifteen minutes of this film. The opening scenes are so hokey and badly acted I almost gave up. The director seemed intent on doing every stupid cliché about people filming themselves. But once the action starts you can ignore the acting, and the dialog, and the movie starts to become fun. It's a clever idea the first person view of a monster attacking the city. <br/><br/>However, I guess they figure with a monster movie suspension of disbelief is not high up on the list of requirements, they kept doing really stupid things like when a girl gets an iron bar through her chest but can still run like an Olympic athlete after wards.<br/><br/>It just goes to show Hollywood would have been dead and buried long ago if they had to rely on good scripts or directing. Digital effects are the only thing that keep that place going."

The monster itself is actually not seen in its entirety only being viewed from different angles for the audience to piece it together as the survivors themselves are, you pretty much know as much as they do about everything going on making you actually feel like you're there. My suggestion to the director,if they had a better ending to it, it would have been definitely a big hitter. And if they can go for a quick sequel of this movie, as cloverfield 2, then am sure people will like it.

The movie was great, and it had two trailers that greatly intrigued me. The first was I Am Legend (The Last man on Earth is not Alone), scared me. Definitely intrigued. I also saw the trailer for Cloverfield. Didn't know what was happening, just that there was a massive explosion, and then the head of the statue of Liberty came flying into the street, someone was screaming OMG, then, that was it. All we knew was that it was from J.J. Abrams, and that it would be coming out on 1/18/08. that was enough to get me intrigued. I couldn't stop thinking about it, and as the month's passed i got more and more excited for the 18th of January, 2008. When the day finally came, i saw it right after school. Never have i been more satisfied with a movie. It was laugh out loud funny at the right parts, had great characters, and was just as thrilling and scary and captivating as i had expected it to be. I have never been under more adrenaline in a movie theater in my life. I was even flexing my muscles during scenes without even realizing it. The movie was incredible in that it was actually able to live up to one of the biggest amounts of hype ever. I would see it five time in theaters. By the fourth and fifth time however, i was starting to get bored. understandably. That's the one problem with Cloverfield. I have realized that since it relied so much on suspense and shock, instead of eye candy, that after the first couple of times, you don't really get as much pleasure out of the movie. I know its kind of hard to judge based on my four consecutive seeings, but i think that even with DVD it still could be boring, although i haven't bought it yet. It's still fun to watch, because its so good, but i think the reason it wasn't the super blockbuster it could have been was because it didn't show enough scenes of buildings being demolished, or helicopters exploding. Still, the Cloverfield Monster was incredible, and you can't help but feel awed by it. The movie is good because it isn't scary primarily because of the little parasites, but because of the skyscraper sized carnivore. It is actually able to make something so fantastic, impossible, and big, scary, and an abandoned New York is the slaughter range. After seeing that thing, it is actually a little scary to walk at night, for fear it might appear. Because Cloverfield could capture that crucial and classic aspect of the monster movie genre, it is, i think, one of, if not the, greatest monster movies of all time. Go see the movie, and feel the might of the Cloverfield Monster.<br/><br/>*I am going to go see the sequel. Cloverfield, 2009!"

The footage that comprises the rest of the film is shot under the context of a personal hand-held camera used by various characters throughout the film's events.<br/><br/>Even if the story is about a monster it deals with so many other things. It is about being young and in love, about friendship and how people can come together, how we react in different situations and it is great, it is something new in cinema."

The less you know, the better. But I'll say that the ending was pretty fitting, specially for a movie like this.<br/><br/>This movie has chaos all written over it, but we get so involved with the characters that we feel that we're with them in that situation, and you can't help but understand the character's actions, even if they seem irrational at times.<br/><br/>I really loved Cloverfield.

","New York, present day. A group of friends in their twenties is throwing a going away party one evening when their apartment is shaken by what appears to be an earthquake. They rush outside and find the Statue of Liberty's head has been blown off and is hurtling towards them. The city is under attack.<br/><br/>CLOVERFIELD is told entirely by a video camera carried by one of the characters. The opening scenes are unbearable: constantly moving, badly framed, hand-held camera work sure to make many cinema goers motion sick. The party scene is rather routine: we've seen these characters and situations many times before.<br/><br/>But when the attack begins, the film really takes off and we're thrown into the chaos. We travel through the dust-covered streets, a setting with which we're all too familiar after September 11. We travel through a subway tunnel, through a military hospital set up in a department store and to a high-rise building that is collapsing onto the building nearby - something I haven't seen in a film before.<br/><br/>The journey has a real authenticity and I don't think it would have worked any other way than as this verite-style mockumentary. You really feel the panic and are willing to believe - most of - the incredible situations. But as the film progresses and we witness one narrow escape after the next it becomes harder to want to believe. And I'm not convinced the character with the camera would continue shooting footage for as long as he does. Perhaps this would work better if the character were a seasoned documentary maker.<br/><br/>There are flashbacks, achieved when the video tape is stopped at certain points in the film. We see brief moments of what was recorded on the tape earlier in happier times and this contrast serves the story well.<br/><br/>Comparisons to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and 28 DAYS LATER are inevitable. Like these films, CLOVERFIELD is very effective at creating a sense of dread by immersing the audience in the character's world."

","I absolutely loved Cloverfield, everything about it was amazing. The monster was awesome, and the special effects were amazing for a budget of only 25 million, and Cloverfield also had some really effective moments that were genuinely emotional and gripping scenes. Cloverfield did however have a couple of flaws. The shaking of the camera was insane, it made me sick, I could barley even drink my giant orange Fanta without feeling queasy, but that defiantly is how it would be if a regular guy was recording a monster attack with his personal video camera, and the movement also made the cheap special effects look like they cost 300 million dollars to produce, so since the movement was there for a reason, I can forgive it for making me sick. Another flaw with the film was that it probably doesn't hold up to a modern audience, I'm probably a little more open minded with movies than the average 14 year old so to you guys this movie might just seem like a viral video that goes on to long. To me one great thing that makes up for the flaws is the characters, the character of Hud was a great choice to put behind the camera and Marlena was also a great character, also In the end of the movie there is a really awesome shot of the monster, and after all that you have heard about it I guarantee it's look will blow your mind.

"fygall","9","0","1","25 March 2008"," A unique take on the mocumentary-esquire. Very enjoyable.
","There have been a few movies made over the last few years that have tried (and failed) to take the title off Blair Witch for a documentary style thriller/horror etc... This one might just nab it and take the crown. Blair Witch Project was so successful because it was new, unique and bloody scary. Others that followed (The Last Broadcast, Amercian Crime, etc) have failed because they haven't given anything new to what we've already seen, apart from a different storyline and worse acting. What Cloverfield does is take this genre and mix it with big Hollywood effects, and when you watch these big expensive effects through the lens of an ordinary home cam-corder it looks bloody real. Throw in some talented unknowns to the cast and make sure the plot-line never goes without a thrill for the duration and you got yourself a winner. I literally had to come up for air when it ended. I like J.J. Abrams, he tries to give us something we haven't seen before and keeps the suspense along with the thrills. Take ""Lost"" for instance, it might get you tearing your hair out for an answer but you keep watching! Cracking movie!!"
"Chris Knipp","8","0","1","20 March 2008"," ""Are you still filming? People will want to know how it all went down""
","'Cloverfield' is an astonishing piece of vérité. Carried to an impossible extreme, as vérité can be sometimes, this movie pretending to be shot with a cheap video camera takes us right into a New York City Armageddon where giant serpents or trolls start out by duplicating the feel of 9/11, only all over midtown, with buildings collapsing or bursting into flames and people rushing around madly in extremis.<br/><br/>But it doesn't happen right away, because it's vérité--it really happened, you see--so a guy just happened to have a video camera in his hand while he was at a goodbye party in a downtown loft for a young corporate yuppie man who got a cool assignment to Japan. It's the clever conceit of this movie that a good twenty minutes go by before the Godzilla stuff happens, just long enough so you're actually getting vaguely interested in how it's coming out that something is going on between the party boy Rob( Michael Stahl-David), and his girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman), or something, and you've relaxed and almost forgotten what you were waiting for to happen, when it does. Wham! And then everything is collapsing and somehow the strong survive all the way down to the bottom of the building--this is where 9/11 really echoes in your mind--and out onto the street, with cars and cops and people every which way and pieces of buildings falling into themselves and lights all red and orange, and the camera always a-tilt and running.because somebody has handed it to Hud (T.J. Miller), Rob's not-too-smart but faithful and determined best buddy, at the start of the party with instructions to record people, which he went around doing, till now. And Beth is up on the West Side, and Rob has the crazy notion that they've got to get up there to save her.<br/><br/>This being the post-modern media world, it's all a movie-within-a-movie-within-a movie. We are watching a film retrieved by the government from ""the area formerly known as Central Park"" after an ""incident"" code-named ""Cloverfield,"" so this is the government's archival film now, and every so often it glitches back to an earlier film Rob shot, where he's on a first date on Coney Island falling in love with Beth. So you've got the halcyon past, the beyond-hellish present, and the unknown future all right there--in 74 minutes. This is another beauty of a movie that has not garnered enormous critical praise (though Edelstein of New York Magazine likes it and so did the witty Nathan Lee--let's just say it plays well in Manhattan) but has the beauty and extraordinary cachet of being as intense as any horror sci-fi monster movie you will ever see, and in a form utterly concise. And utterly true to Manhattan. The locations are quite vivid and specific and real, and these are 73 New York minutes, full of energy and speed and in-your-face.<br/><br/>And there is a monster--of the kind that's gigantic and terrifying but also so Japanese Fifties looking even though in color I tried to look away, because it broke the spell--which gives rise to or sloughs off more human-sized giant spider things that make a deliciously creepy crackling sound, like a giant crunchy rattlesnake, clattering and sliding around in people's faces and if it bites, watch out! You'll have a big bloody wound and after a while you won't feel too good at all.<br/><br/>Even though '28 Weeks Later' took us down into a Tube station in similar circumstances, the stay down there in the Spring Street station with Rob and Hud & Co. stays with me. So does the first chaos on the street when they make it down from Rob's loft. This is a moderately high-budget grunge picture; it has the best of both worlds. It has tons of extras and special effects, but it doesn't dazzle you with their glitz, because you're just sort of glimpsing them through the terrified shaky hand of the, well, hand-held camera.<br/><br/>But I really can't remember much of it because, well, I was there, man. It all happened too fast. In fact many of the incidents that occur have been seen in other disaster movies, but still, this is what Nabokov meant when he spoke of transcending the tradition in one's own way. Reeves--and bless him, he's already planning a sequel--is a director who makes it all look and sound different, constant, non-stop, and intense. You couldn't take more than 73 minutes; it would be unbearable. And even before that the novelty wears off, and again and again you realize that Hud's still having the camera in his grip and working is wholly implausible. But the style, the look, and the feel of it are compulsive and hypnotic. This may be a bad movie. It is not a movie to take seriously. But it is a good bad movie, a very good one. It will fill you up. And like Chinese food, it will leave you feeling empty two hours later. But it will have been worth it.<br/><br/>You don't care about these people. They're shallow, emptily up-to-date, going nowhere. But that makes this all the more vérité. There are no heroes. No (human) villains. No human interest, really. Just stuff happening. Drew Goddard's screenplay deserves credit for that. And kudos to Michael Bonvillain's cinematography with its endlessly chittering video effects and the FX flow, aided by Kevin Stitt's lively cutting, which keeps things moving in and out, in and out, like a dying heart."

","A giant monster attacks New York and a group of friends must cross the city to rescue one of their own.<br/><br/>Had it been filmed the way I just described then it might have been a good movie and it might have been well worth watching. Depending on who directed it, what the special effects were like and who the cast was. I can hazard a guess like that because we've all seen movies that loosely fit that description. You know the ones I mean where a group of friends band together to escape something. They survive a few close calls and - inevitably - one of them dies and the levels of tension are ramped up before the all-action finale, after which the hero gets the girl.<br/><br/>So, Cloverfield could have been another one of those movies.<br/><br/>But it's not. Because instead of showing us everything that is happening, the film only shows us what is seen by a camcorder being carried by the group on their trek. This means, of course, that there is a lot the filmmakers can't show us. But that doesn't matter. Partly because this is the sort of stuff we get to see in other similar movies anyway and partly because their choice of storytelling technique allows them to show us stuff we normally don't get to see. And that's the stuff that makes this a film worth seeing.<br/><br/>Some of the decisions are inspired (for instance the tape used to record this was also used to record something else, and sometimes we get to see that as well) and the movie is a thrill ride from star to finish.<br/><br/>I'm giving this an ""A+"" because I can't give higher/more.<br/><br/>http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/"

Just when you think that Hollywood is getting monotonous with blockbusters and losing its audiences with the rise of lame independent films. They go and pull a fat, obese, artery clotting rabbit out its tiny, minute, mouse sized hat. There really isn't much more I can say, other than its ingenious. Not only did they take risks in shooting the film, but the film stars a bunch of unknown, young, newcomers. Although the film is shot in an irregular, home video, amateur-ish, documentary type of style; the director was very methodical in giving the audience what it needed and wanted at the precise times throughout the entire film. The characters and their stories, although realistic, were the only weak points in the film.<br/><br/>I will warn you though. If you've seen 'The Blair Witch Project' or have seen documentaries involving camcorders and constant movement while filming, and while viewing you've felt nausea, or some type of sickness arising, than you probably shouldn't watch this film."

"MrGKB","6","0","2","11 March 2008"," An ambitious monster movie that can't crawl out from under its vapid script...
","...""Cloverfield"" represents a triumph of what is known as ""viral marketing"" (mainly lots of teasers scattered about the Internet), which secured it a powerhouse opening weekend and more than enough butts in the seats over its theatrical run to guarantee a sequel, but in terms of storytelling left an awful lot to desire. As Shakespeare would have described it, the film amounts to ""a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" I caught this one second-run, and am glad I economized.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Drew ""Lost"" Goddard is unable to transfer his success in television to the big screen, primarily by failing to get the audience to identify with his characters, despite spending the bulk of ""Cloverfield""'s first act introducing them. By the time they start dying, I didn't really care one way or the other; I had no emotional investment in them. Now, perhaps that's because I'm no longer a 20-something. But, my kids are, and I think that's the key; these 20-somethings didn't remind me of my kids, or any of their friends. They had no real identity, or real personality. Rob (Michael ""The Black Donnellys"" Stahl-David) is a VP of something-or-other heading for Japan to do who-knows-what. His brother, Jason (Mike ""Poseidon"" Vogel), has thrown a surprise bon voyage party for him, and among the attendees are Jason's girlfriend, Lily (Jessica ""The Covenant"" Lucas), Rob's best buddy, Hud (T.J. ""Carpoolers"" Miller), who ends up as the film's cinematic POV, Lily's friend, Marlena (Lizzy ""The Class"" Caplan), and Rob's ex-lover, Beth (Odette ""South Beach"" Yustman), who leaves the party early and provides the supposed motivation for the rest of the cast's trek across a monster-mashed NYC. Some might say she's little more than the film's MacGuffin, and they wouldn't be far wrong. Beth and the rest of the main characters have nothing in the script to latch onto to flesh themselves out, and seem virtually interchangeable. They're barely more than the impersonal statistics they'd have become otherwise had the camera not been there to record them.<br/><br/>Then again, it's just a big ol' monster movie, right? And it's the rare monster movie that provides us with characters we care about. ""King Kong"" (both versions) springs to mind, as does ""Jurassic Park"" and a few others. Even ""Gwoemul/The Host"" does a better job of eliciting our empathy than ""Cloverfield,"" despite the cultural dissonance of the former. The acting is nowhere near as bad as some critics have complained, but Goddard's script just doesn't give them enough to wrap their chops around. More's the shame, because Matt ""Felicity"" Reeves does a remarkably good job for not having directed a feature film since the forgettable ""The Pallbearer"" over a decade ago, and the production values are outstanding, including the herky-jerky digital cinematography by Michael ""Lost"" Bonvillain, and superb SFX work by the likes of Tippett Studio (""Robocop"") and Double Negative (""Pitch Black"").<br/><br/>It's all in the plotting, and ""Cloverfield""'s story is a simple one: boy has girl, boy loses girl, boy meets monster, boy rescues girl, boy and girl end up unhappy ever after. The film has its share of ""oh, c'mons,"" mostly ones involving the dubiously-motivated actions of its leads, but the audience's visceral thrill at being in the center of things somewhat overcomes that. Still, this viewer was left with the feeling that Goddard should stick with scripting television; small wonder that ""Cloverfield"" clocks in at barely 80 minutes.<br/><br/>I'll watch ""Cloverfield"" again when it's released on DVD, but I'm not sure it'll find a place in my collection unless it has a ton of extras. Despite the stylistic similarities to the much more engaging ""The Blair Witch Project,"" this marketing monster just doesn't have the same legs.<br/><br/>10.21.08 edit: Having finally caught up to the DVD (thank you, public library!), I stand by my comments above. My viewing companion mostly agreed with me, but did note, interestingly enough, that she was reminded of ""Friends,"" and suspects that the story was subconsciously written with that show in mind. Rob is Ross, Beth is Rachel, Jason and Lily are Chandler and Monica, Marlena is Phoebe, and Hud is Joey. Makes sense to me, and gives the characters more than enough back story to make them more engaging. The DVD includes a number of featurettes, a director commentary, deleted scenes, two vaguely ""alternate"" endings, and a few previews. The transfer is excellent, really showcasing the technical achievements of the film. Too bad it really wasn't a long episode of ""Friends""; now that would have been memorable!"

I want my first ever trip there later this year to be as big a surprise as possible and I don't want to see all the best bits in the films before I go, thank you very much.<br/><br/>There, now I've got that little rant off my chest lets get onto the actual film itself. It's one of those weird, high concept films that's been doing pretty well mainly down to word of mouth and will now probably get a cult status as a result. And I'm happy to say, it does really deserve it.<br/><br/>Spinning off from the style of The Blair Witch Project, with it's use of a hand-held camera recording the words and actions of unknown actors in the face of absolute terror, the film creates an impressive mood of claustrophobia and bewilderment, with some genuinely terrifying jump moments to move it along. A big budget must have been required for the monster effects and special effects through-out but the film is shot all the way through in camcorder footage, which some have struggled to adapt to, but in these post 9/11 (which was first caught on camera) days is actually all the more terrifying, even if at times you want to laugh out loud at how ludicrous and far fetched the story actually is, as well as the absurdity of someone filming it all at a time when they must be quavering for their lives.<br/><br/>Kong was taken to NY against his will. The Cloverfield monster wants to be there. And you want to see him. ****"

","To start first, this movie is great! It's not original because it's actually just a type of crossover of Godzilla and The Blair Witch Project and I thought that because of the motion-sickness it would be a flop.<br/><br/>But the movie blew my mined! It was really worth to spend my money on. The mystery-key is really there, like: where does the monster came from, is it still dead or alive, how many of them are there and the most interesting question WHAT is the monster?<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet go and watch it, it's a good date movie!"
"loganx-2","8","0","2","29 February 2008"," The Beast Returns
","One of the most enjoyable movie going experiences I've had in a long while. There is an inordinate amount of references from critics to this films 9/11 visual allusions, which I think are more projected than anything. There is an essay called ""The Imagination Of Disaster"" by Susan Sontag, which can really be applied to this film in a lot of ways. One thing Sontag notes is the depiction of the scientific/military/industrial complex in monster/disaster films; the heroic scientist, The UN security councils, the hard ass general, the plucky journalist, the madman's daughter, etc, all of which distract us from the people being killed in the exploding buildings. Cloverfield, doesn't give us a tour through aesthetic destruction, nor does it re-enforce the political models of the salvation through military force, it confines itself in the most literal sense to showing people caught in a terrifying and surreal experience. The last Godzilla film with Mathew Broderick showed New York being destroyed, but this didn't point to 9/11, so much as it points to our obsession with New York as the center symbol of modern American life and achievement, it's buildings are the great symbols of modern urban life, something terrorists and science fiction writers understand as they knock them down. The first thing that happens in this film action wise is the statue of liberty having it's head knocked off, does this mean liberty is dead, the country is without a liberated mind, or is it just a reference to the poster for ""Escape From New York(""another NY disaster flick), or is it all of the above? These aren't really appropriate questions for Cloverfield, which is a film without answers, but a clever one that subverts a lot of the cliché's of the monster movie genre, without any pretensions(save its advertising campaign). What I liked about this movie so much was that it was just the camera, a few people, and some monsters, and it was gripping stuff. A fifty foot monster is much scarier if it's too big to capture on camera, only seen at a glance surrounded by screams and debris, something I cant think another film doing. The shabbiness of the camera at first made me a little dizzy, but it improves as the film goes on. I actually think this kind of film making has a much bigger future than people think, another film this year ""The Diving Bell and The Butterfly"" used a very similar technique of withholding camera perspective to very different and very successful effect. All and all, I thought it was really good, scary even at times, and much better than any modern monster movie I can think of, maybe not ""The Host"", but then again...Anyway If there is any art to making monster movies, Cloverfield is it's new watermark, and is going to be the one to beat in the future. It ends and begins on Conney Island a day spent reliving old thrills from the past in ends there as well, as we relive our great Godzilla fantasies and fears."

","This was the film I was far more excited about seeing that any other until May. With a great trailer and a weakness for finding out what the bloody thing is actually about I entered the cinema with great anticipation and a sick bag. I was not disappointed (threw the sick bag away, wasn't needed).<br/><br/>So, the movie for the first 20 odd minutes is basically some character development and a basic plot beginning. Girl, Guy, Best Friend, Best Friend's Boyfriend, The Comedy Act, The Comedy Act's Love Interest. Fair enough, it worked. By the time Mr Monster came I was fearing for the characters lives. The acting isn't spectacular, neither is the script, it doesn't need to be, it's a monster attacking New York City, of course there's gonna be a lot of ""Oh My God""'s, and ""AHHHHHHHH""'s. It worked to create the realism that much greater.<br/><br/>The thing that worked with this movie so well was the hand-held camera style, it created a weird sense of reality and I really felt thrown in to the happenings. The best bits are where the camera supposedly gets turned off and we get previous months footage of the Girl & Guy. Showing, they didn't just use it as a simple thing to add the USP, they really focused hard on making it more realistic.<br/><br/>Another point that worked well was the fact that you never got a clear analysis or full body shot of the beastie itself, snippets of footage and partial body shots really kept you on your seat as there was no ""we know what it is, it's human inside"". It was literally a big monster, run for your freaking life.<br/><br/>The best scene in the film is definitely the tunnel scene, the fear of unknown theme being used to masterful effect here. The moment the camera switched to night vision you immediately gasp with horror and your heart races, a thing Cloverfield never ceases to do.<br/><br/>With a pretty decent ending and no sugar coated plot lines, Cloverfield doesn't hold back; blood is splattered; characters do die and most importantly of all it doesn't fail to include the army not being the almighty great and shows the monster effectively cleverer and stronger than any man made force. The best about that is, we don't know why it is, same as we don't know where it came from making that realism oh so much stronger.<br/><br/>To sum Cloverfield up in a sentence, I'd say it is pretty much being tied to a heart defibrillator for 1hr and a half. It really is an enjoyable, well made, original piece of cinema that I will never forget."

","I like a movie to be unpredictable and as unique as possible. (which is very hard for any writer or director to do these days) For me, this movie really does set a new standard, it was about as unconventional as your gonna get. Superb sound design, considering a movie's soundtrack usually produces a high percentage of the drama. I did think at times the acting could have been better and in some parts it became a little unbelievable, also I thought the character introductions were far to long-winded!? (around 20 minutes). It was almost like a Tarantino scene only filmed on a digi cam! <br/><br/>I really like how the film ended, very clean, quick, un-Hollywood like and unexpected, similar to I Am Legand.

","This movie helps put Diary of the Dead into perspective - it's got the same eat-the-yuppie-scum-before-they-breed subtext, but it's more felt, less metaphorical. Also rather emptier; also way tenser. And what it lacks in auteurist readability it makes up for in the roller-coaster excitement that Romero has consciously forsaken. The lapses in logic have all been well-catalogued, although I'll warrant that the National Guard is so accommodating they could be from Sweden, and that the final long money shot of the M-O-N-S-T-E-R makes me nostalgic for Val Lewton. But the set pieces are classic, and the found-tape structural logic is more convincing than Romero's, too. And for all their generic, stupid hatefulness, the characters are more felt and more dimensional."

","Imagine you are playing SimCity and have just hit the random monster attack option. Up pops the Godzilla like monster, then suddenly you are thrown into the PC world with a video camera in your hand. Voila!

"filmbuff20","7","0","2","24 February 2008"," Not worth the hype, but entertaining all the same.
","It's obvious that Cloverfield had a bout of over-hyping, mainly due to the innovative ad campaign which basically equates to the idea that anything hinted at in a trailer sends internet fanboys in a flurry of excitement and speculation. The downside is that all the anticipation can result in a resounding thud (Star Wars, but hopefully not the upcoming Indy flick). Thankfully, this film geek chose to acknowledge yet ignore all the internet madness and wait for the flick to be released. That means none of the meticulous freeze framing of the trailer to get a gander at the antagonistic 'thing' that decapitated the statue of liberty and the like.<br/><br/>So, was Cloverfield worth all the brouhaha? Well, yes and no. The fact is, the premise is not revolutionary and nor is the style, it's most obvious comparison being The Blair Witch Project which debuted 9 years ago to a similar fanfare (we had the poster in our common room before we even knew what it was). The main pull here is the use of character and perspective as we follow a group of New Yorkers desperately trying to survive in the wake of a monster attack. Despite reviews to the contrary, these characters are pretty well realised compared to conventional fare such as Godzilla in which we are given a linear and straightforward introduction to them, whereas here, we are treated to fragmented pieces of overlapping footage to tell the story so far.<br/><br/>The way the film has been shot, as if on DV camcorder, feels authentically like a home movie, which at the beginning is to the film's detriment, but it becomes obvious why the first act needed to be as it was once disaster hits. It may take a little getting used to, but it's worth it. The CG is integrated almost perfectly, glimpses here and there and feels more real than any of the robots or web slingers of last year that Hollywood offered us. In fact, the weakest point of the film is seeing the creature in full, whereas the aforementioned flicks would have thrived on that very thing.<br/><br/>So the point is not inherently in the idea, but the execution which is pretty effective. At one point I found myself holding my breath when dust engulfed the characters and gripping the seat when several memorable shocks presented themselves, the most notable instances involving a tunnel and later a helicopter. At the end of the day, whether you care about the characters or not is irrelevant because director Matt Reeves and exec producer JJ Abrams don't care whether you do or not. Each is expendable, however painstakingly they are established and it's this anti-Hollywood, anti-cliché attitude towards a very Hollywood idea that gives Cloverfield it's uniqueness and entertainment value. If all this seems like tosh to you, that's all very well, we can't agree on everything, but you can't deny that Cloverfield, if nothing else, is a fun night at the movies and isn't that what we missed in the summer of threequels?"
"fionnualaminto","8","0","2","24 February 2008"," Innovative and intelligent direction lifts Cloverfield
","Rarely have I seen a movie that has divided opinion as much as Cloverfield. I can't claim to have read all 1500 posts on this thread but those I have read have ranged from ""brilliant"" to ""terrible"". There seems to be little middle ground, you either love it or hate it. I have to say that I belong to the former group having found it extraordinarily innovative and exciting.<br/><br/>As the movie opened later here, I only got to see it last week. I had a vague idea of what it was about and knew about the hand held camera work and went into it hoping that it was not going to be as annoying as Blair Witch. I needn't have worried. After a few minutes the camera work stopped being obtrusive and just became another element in the whole exciting movie experience. Some have claimed that it caused motion sickness or was distracting. Well I can't say I found that to be the case. For me the hand held camera made me feel like I was right there in the middle of the action, being just as disorientated and on edge as the people on the screen. After a while I forgot that the movie was shot differently to the norm as I was so immersed in the chaos and terror of what was happening.<br/><br/>I loved the fact that there was no exposition or unnecessary explanation. Everything was immediate and surprising. It was also good to see a relatively unknown cast performing with skill. Its not easy to make things appear spontaneous and unrehearsed and they did this brilliantly, even down to making Hud, the cameraman, at times sympathetic and at times extremely annoying. At no time were we distracted by having a big star strutting around saving the day. It gave you the feeling that anyone could be killed at any time, no one was safe.<br/><br/>The direction was clever throughout, not least in keeping the monster hidden until almost the end. All we see are glimpses of a leg here, a tail there, a mouth... It works to heighten the dread. What you can't see is often more terrifying than whats in front of your face. The tunnel scene was nail bitingly scary, knowing that they were being followed by something in the dark, (think ""Alien"" in the ventilation ducts). It was also a pleasant surprise to not have a happy ending. Here in Europe there is often a lot of criticism doled out to American movies for frequently treating their audiences as if they are stupid. That is to say that everything has to be explained and then neatly wrapped up at the end with invariably a happy ending tacked on, no matter how incongruous that may be. It is great when the director of a blockbuster like this, bucks the trend and leaves us hanging. He treats us as intelligent people who are capable of making up our own minds. Kudos to Mr Abrams."
"acrosleuth","9","0","1","23 February 2008"," Very well done.
","A great by-product of Cloverfield is that it reveals just how intellectually lazy people have become in our culture. Just read these negative reviews on this site alone and the reasons they give. Now I don't mind if people don't like the movie, but the reasons they give are truly ridiculous and embarrassing. For example, people are whining that ""No one was there to tell me where the monster came from!!! And I didn't like that!!!"" It just goes to show you just how dumbed down movies have to be to please the general public. Take note filmmakers, remember to spoon feed everything to your audience. God forbid they have to use their imagination or be forced to think in any way.<br/><br/>Another complaint is that it was shot with a hand held camcorder and it was ""too shaky"" for them. Oh, you poor, poor dear. Next time stick to Disney films, you knew exactly what you were getting into with this one. It was done strictly to be consistent with the overall theme that it was government confiscated footage from a civilian AND it also enhances the overall effect of CGI graphics. It's a great combination and the effect was very compelling.<br/><br/>People also seem to have issues with the camcorder's battery apparently lasting a bit too long for their ultra ""logical brains."" Somehow a battery lasting around 70 minutes is a little too hard for them to believe. ""How can the filmmakers have made such a huge mistake! Why didn't they show Hud replacing the battery sometime in the movie so that we can feel better?"" You guys crack me up.<br/><br/>People are also complaining that they couldn't ""empathize"" with the characters. I empathized with them very easily. Why? Because I don't need to be spoon fed and told when I'm supposed to relate to characters. I thought the acting was superb and quite believable. I wonder why so many people need someone to hold their hand and walk them through minute by minute of a movie? <br/><br/>The Love Story. People are having a hard time suspending belief that the two main characters were in love after only sleeping together once, yet have no problem believing characters in other movies could fall in love without sleeping with each other at all. I think I'm going to call this ""IMDb Logic."" They also are having a hard time believing that the main characters friends wanted to come with him to help him find his girl trapped in her apartment. Is it really so hard to believe that friends tend to help each other? Jesus, I wonder what kind of friends some of you have that leads to your world view of friendship.<br/><br/>Oh, let's not forget the complaint that there wasn't any music in the film to help guide your emotions. Because everyone knows that when you make home videos on a camcorder they all automatically come with an accompanying soundtrack. (Uh, remember that this is supposed to be government confiscated amateur footage.) Oh, the girl they rescued in the leaning high rise tower with the rod through her shoulder. I had no problem with that, I was willing to suspend belief for the sake of the love story. And I'm sure people have survived worse injuries than that.<br/><br/>Anyway, I just find all this whining over the movie hilarious. People are complaining that they were ""cheated"" out of their hard earned (I'm sure) $9.00. And I find it fascinating. I really enjoyed the film. I was on edge for the whole movie. I thought it was very well done and perfectly executed, including the monster. I never cared that it wasn't explained where it came from. Who cares? I thought it was cool not having that information. It actually (are you ready for this IMDb critics?) *cough* sparks your imagination! Oh my god! What a concept! So to summarize, if you're the type of intellectual lightweight who has to be spoon fed everything and has to have someone hold your hand as you walk through life, you're going to hate this movie. If you've got an open mind and appreciate different approaches to film and do not require a movie to tell you what you're supposed to be thinking, then you'll probably like the film."

"Tom-91","8","0","1","23 February 2008"," An interesting approach
","**Spoilers, of course, below**<br/><br/>While I would be the first to admit that a great many points in this film were hardly original, I have to say that I have never seen them all used in such a way.<br/><br/>Certainly, if you were looking for the standard Godzilla or King Kong fare, you were disappointed. This film isn't about monsters. It was simply made a lot more interesting by including one. This film could have been made about an earthquake, a nuclear attack; just about any disaster, and most of it could have been done with little change. The points wasn't the monster, the point was what it would be like if you had to be on the run for your survival.<br/><br/>I would guess that this is something relatively new for Americans and Western Europeans to contemplate. Unless you've been in a major earthquake or some such, running for your life on this scale is not something we have ever had to do. Certainly not in an urban setting. In many parts of the world, running from an army, militia, or some such is sadly a part of regular life. That is my take on the film: putting you in a nearly non-stop run-for-your-life scenario in a very real setting (and a very unreal cause).<br/><br/>The first person perspective was great, and extremely important. Too many times, films ""take you there"", but you aren't there. A lot of people were reminded of ""Blair Witch"" but I was more reminded of ""Private Ryan"". This use of hand held video forces the audience to leave the safety of the theater and enter the world of disaster. Has it been done before? Sure. But it has really not been done in this kind of a film before.<br/><br/>In closing, I have to wonder what people were thinking when they claim this somehow reminiscent of 9-11. I didn't see it. Were buildings knocked over? Yes. Were there people running for their life? Yes. But, that is standard in any disaster film. Have we reached the point that filming on any disaster film can't take place in any urban setting because ""that's too much like 9-11."" I hope not!"
"bartholomewrichards","5","0","1","23 February 2008"," I'll Clover Your Field...In Bed
","So I walked down to a free preview screening of Cloverfield last night. I predicted a few weeks ago that it would be a disappointment both critically and financially, but I was wrong on both accounts. The reviews at Rotten Tomatoes are quite enthusiastic, although there are more than a few detractors, and the preview screening last night had a rush line that would have filled a theatre and a half on its own, meaning it will probably be huge. In comparison, the screening for Lions For Lambs was only three quarters full, even though it was free. While there are many things to praise about this movie, I can't give it a recommendation. Beyond the gimmick of being told entirely in point of view of one of the characters camcorders, there is not much in this move that would be different from conventional monster movie, and there-in lies its faults.<br/><br/>The movie covers the travails of a group of 20-somethings after a Godzilla-like monster attacks Manhattan. The logical improbability of our camera-man, ""Hud""(T.J. Miller) carrying around a camera for the entire night is surprisingly not as intrusive as it could be. Thankfully, the footage is regular film quality, despite the fact that it would really look more like a home video. At a few points, the other characters tell him to stop being an idiot and to put the camera down. Fortunately, he never does, or we wouldn't have a movie. This gimmick brings a sense of urgency to the film that greatly helps the proceedings. In particular, there is one scene where our heroes are stuck in the middle of an army attack that is absolutely harrowing. The gimmick also allows for a neat visual trick whilst our heroes are traveling in the pitch black of a subway tunnel and they learn how to use the night vision feature. Unfortunately, the human elements of the film don't work nearly as well as the visual.<br/><br/>The film begins at a party full of impossibly good-looking 20-somethings who are there to surprise, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who is going to Japan for a job. ""Hud"" is put in charge of getting testimonials with the camera, and he is possibly the worst camera man of all time, barely able to get anyones face on the camera. The film begins with a little self-conscious John Hughesian drama between Rob and Beth (Odette Yustman), a good friend whom he slept with about a month earlier (footage of ""the morning after"" from that particular event is spliced in throughout the film). Also, our cameraman has a little crush on Marlena (Lizzy Caplan, who has more than a little resemblance to Zooey Deschanel) and starts embarrassing himself as he keeps drinking. I know that this wasn't a great treatise on human nature, but it was executed with humour and the leads were suitably bland in a way that we didn't feel bad laughing at them.<br/><br/>Once the monster attacks the city, however, the humour feels forced as does the drama. ""Hud"" is the token annoying fat guy used as comic relief. He's not very funny, it's kinda like if Hurley from ""Lost"" was filming everything on a camcorder, if Hurley was just a little bit skinnier. When Rob decides to go back into the city to save Beth, which is the prime motivation of the plot, it just feels stupid, not heroic. It might have worked better in a conventional film, but by emulating reality, the filmmakers should have known not to try this. It immediately reveals how scripted the whole situation is. I would have liked the film better if it had just focused on the characters escape from Manhattan. It doesn't help the situation that these characters are so thinly developed that they can all be described in one sentence.<br/><br/>The film does have a lot of good conceptual ideas, however, including the little monsters that fall off the big guy. It never reveals where the monster came from, although ""Hud"" does his share of conspirasizing. Another high point of the film is when one character gets bit by one of the little monsters, it has some very interesting results. The monster, once shown, is suitably impressive, but I still wish they had shown less of it, a la Jaws.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams is capable of making good entertainment, but I think he does better in a television setting. I know he's not the director, but I think he probably had a good deal of input on the film. My expectations for the new Star Trek are tempered after this and Mission Impossible: III. Mr. Abrams also seems to have a fetish for lean brunettes...with stubble. Michael Stahl-David could easily be a younger version of Michael Vartan from ""Alias"" or Matthew Fox from ""Lost"". He is also just as bland as either of them.<br/><br/>Still, if you're hankering for a good action movie, Cloverfield is better than most. It's only 80-odd minutes long and contains more than enough excitement for the average action-fiend. ""Hud"" is remarkably good at editing, often in the middle of running away from gunfire. He keeps things interesting in that away, and thankfully, the camera battery doesn't run out either.<br/><br/>bartholomewrichards.blogspot.com"

","Cloverfield is one of the best movies of all time. I say this with my hand on my heart. I have seen plenty of movies, both in cinemas and on television and I can, without thinking twice, maintain that this ""monster-of-a-movie"" was phenomenal in every aspect. Before this movie, I did not have a horror/monster movie on my top 5 list (which by the way includes film such as ""The Godfather Trilogy, Dollar Trilogy, One Flew over The Cuckoo's Nest and Scarface). After watching Cloverfield, however, I must admit that this movie is among my top 5 films. Cloverfield stunned me; it was something new, something that none of us have seen before. This, together with the outstanding performance of the actors involved, makes this movie a real roller-coaster, filled with thrills, goose bumps, emotions and excitement.<br/><br/>Conclusively, I must admit that its various dimensions make it a excellent movie in nearly all corners due to the perfect choice of characters, setting and plot.<br/><br/>>> WARNING. Some people may see this as a minor SPOILER. <<<br/><br/>One very pleasing thing about this movie is that the ""monster"" is rather ""anonymous"". Why? Well, first of all, we have already seen films where an ""experiment has gone wrong"" or some kind of ""mutation"" has affected the creation or development of a creature. Cloverfield breaks this trend by not telling us anything specific about the monster. Secondly, we can ask ourselves what WE do if we were placed in the same situation as the characters in the movie? We would certainly not do any kind of research to find out how the monster was put on this planet. We would run and try to save our asses. These things make the movie even better.<br/><br/>>> END OF SPOILER <<"

","At one point in this film a single shot tells us all we need to know about what its all about. As the decapitated head of the statue of liberty lies in a street we see someone calmly walk up and take a photo on their mobile phone. Ignore the monster, the characters and the fake mystery of its promotion, this is a film about the hand-held video camera and the mobile phone video. If there is such a thing as the youtube generation this is their film.<br/><br/>The prevalence of hand-held video and photographic technology has made the grainy, and out of focus mobile phone video a part of our daily lives. Its also allowed news organisations to replace eyewitness accounts by shaken and upset individuals with videos of the actual events themselves without losing the human element of their story. In this way the film recalls the amateur videos and photos that appeared in the days after both the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington and the 7/7 attacks in London. This is not done in an allegorical manner but merely in a visual recall of how all major events will now be recorded.<br/><br/>The film begins with a going away party which serves a dual purpose, in introduces the characters briefly and also serves to ground the film in a reality. This is not an alternate version of New York when monsters attack on a regular basis, this is the plain old ordinary New York you've seen a thousand times before and these are ordinary people with their ordinary lives, no heroes here. This segment lasts long enough to make the initial arrival of the monster genuinely surprising whilst being kept short enough to get dull. Its at this point that the use of generally unknown actors really comes to the fore. You honestly believe that any of the people at the party could be the stars of the film and not only that but they can die or be separated from the group at any time. A point only emphasised further as the film progresses.<br/><br/>The film sets its stall out for the rest of the running time as the cast cower in fear in a convenience store as the monster apparently walks past, shaking the ground and blowing out windows. We know what role we are to play in this story, the cannon fodder. This is the disaster movie re-imagined from the perspective of those in danger, on the ground, and in need of rescue. The characters spend the film looking after themselves and hoping that someone else can solve crisis whilst they're still alive. Focussing on these people allows the film to stay clear of clunky exposition and fake science. We don't know where it came from and we don't care we just want to survive it.<br/><br/>All the while the director Matt Reeves assaults our senses with a perfectly paced series of breathless action sequences and momentary rests where our characters recuperate and count the cost the ordeal is having on them and their city. As with any good action film its the rest moments that define how attached we are to the characters and there is one genuinely heart breaking scene in a subway station that shows just how connected you have become without realising it.<br/><br/>The action sequences combine tension and action brilliantly and all showcase different aspects of the monsters' abilities well to keep the threat evolving and consistently scary. This also helps prevent the scream-and-wave-the-camera-around style of action sequence become to prevalent as would normally be a threat with a film shot in this manner. In all the only weak point in the action sequences is one supposedly roof top scene that looks far too much like a sound stage. Apart from that the feel of authenticity is kept ever present throughout these sequences.<br/><br/>Special mention has to made of how the film balances the need for believable hand held camera work with the need for proper cinematography. The film could easily have fallen into the same pitfall as other hand-held camera films, such as The Blair Witch Project, where shots can lack composition and framing to such an extent as to negate the film as a visual experience.<br/><br/>The film has generally been criticised for the almost traditional monster and disaster movie failings of a lack of plot and poor characterisation. While it is to an extent true that the film lacks a coherent plot and characterisation its also true that it benefits from its lack of both. The plot makes the audience feel as the characters do that we are being thrown around New York by forces far beyond our control and that we are constantly waiting for the next intervention from either the monster or the military to throw us off course again. Also the characters act believably in the sense that when a disaster of this scale occurs all people become pretty much equal, no one wants to be seen as a coward, every one wants to make sure those they care about are safe and no one wants to be alone. These are all the motivating factors the band of characters we follow are likely to have in such moments of extreme stress.<br/><br/>This is a massively entertaining, thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride that seeps innovation and free thinking from its every pore. One of those rare cinema event movies that make you feel you're a part of the film and a part of its events without ever forgetting to entertain. Cloverfield is a film I genuinely wanted to dislike due to the manner of its promotion and my dislike for monster films generally but it is an undeniable piece of cinematic brilliance and the first film I've seen in some time that feels genuinely new."

","I would compare this movie with such classics as Gone With The Wind. It puts a true story like Schindlers List to shame. I laughed, and I cried. I also urinated about a tablespoon from laughing. If I were to make a sequel to this classic, I would title it ""Cloverfield 2: Secret of the Oze."" This movie has inspired me to go out and purchase an Evil Kanevil action figure. What really surprises me is the movie is based on a true story. It touched my heart like ""Passion of the Christ."" If Jesus was resurrected they would crucify him in this movie. Words cannot describe the natural Euphoria this movie makes me feel when I sit down to view it. Can a story get any better? Can humankind continue to create such beautiful things? Movies like this channel the human spirit onto the big screen. This movie should be dubbed as a national treasure so future generations can view the bountyful story of a tale of 2 men, who are at odds with one another, until they learn that they were meant for each other."
"z3ph","8","0","2","21 February 2008"," Try to understand what you're watching, or you won't have a good time.
","It's a shame that some people weren't aware that the entire film was from the perspective of an SD card from a handy-cam. Too many found themselves hating the film for this reason, and then decidedly getting angry at every other aspect as a result.<br/><br/>Firstly, I must make the point that this is a film for theatres. If you wanna watch it online, I'm guessing it won't be as good. The home video aspect of this film doesn't detract from the big screen experience whatsoever, but hand-in-hand with youtube quality? I foresee a bad time.<br/><br/>People have been slating characters' decisions. Why follow a crazy man on his plight to rescue his true love? Well, there's Lily, who just lost her true love, so I can understand her will to help save the true love of her true love's brother! Marlena is really only tagging along for Lily. That's barely excusable, but considering her option to either help people she knows, or try to evacuate with strangers, it's a pretty honourable thing to do. Hud is Rob's best friend, so it's pretty much the same excuse as Marlena, whom he has the hots for (plus, no cameraman = no film).<br/><br/>You can take what you like from this, but I'm still driving the fact that 2 of the 4 had undeniable reason to go, and the other two were best friends of the first two, with understandable alternatives.<br/><br/>Some people have said it's an alien attack. It isn't. And if it is, it certainly didn't land in New York (see the tagruato sonar images of the monster approaching the city). It came by sea. That's Godzilla's excuse, so points deducted on unoriginality. And in regards to people mocking the monster for the fact that it'll never make as good a toy as the G-Beast, I'd like to put forth my idea that it was never intended to be. Where Godzilla has dinosaur-esquire coolness and a penchant for defending Japan, this creature is a vile Monstrosity. There's as much plush selling power here as a Cthulhu. Then again, I have seen a plush Cthulhu on sale. I'd assume this was more of a cult-classic thing than a something-Junior-will-cuddle-in-bed thing.<br/><br/>Marlena's extraction from the scene due to the bite... No, she's not shot by the military; she explodes. It's horrible, I know, but that's what happens. I feel sorry not only for Hud, but also for the guys in the radiation suits that pulled her behind the shower curtain.<br/><br/>The evident echoes of the 9/11 attacks are as present as the shout outs to Godzilla, but should not be something to dislike the film for. If anything, the realistic shooting of Cloverfield enabled audience empathy for those involved. I consider this film to have moved me more in such a way than if it were to be Emmerich's Godzilla 2. Here's where I admit that I enjoy Emmerich's Godzilla as the family-fun romp it is. It's the Home Alone of monster movies! Back to Cloverfield.<br/><br/>It's not 9/11, it's not Godzilla, and it isn't Blair Witch. It has echoes of the first two, but that's part of the film's overall target effect. To say it's like Blair Witch would be like to say Kevin Smith's Clerks is like Casablanca because they're both filmed in Black and White.<br/><br/>I can see the resemblance between the critters in Cloverfield and creatures from Starship Troopers; another point is lost on unoriginality. And the weird voices they made detracted from the scariness of the situation in the subway. I usually stay for the end of the credits for a film I like. A commenter before me made the point that 75% of the audience around him stayed for the credits, and suggested it was the most negative reaction to a movie ever, for which I'm slightly disappointed. But there must have been people like me in that 75% who stayed because they enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Said commenter then ended by saying that fans of this film such as myself are deluded and ""will have spent the last year or more pumping this movie for JJ Abrams and will be unable to admit to themselves or you that it is simply not good."" I retort that I didn't 'pump' this movie, and found it a very good experience, even with my usual spitefully analytical view of films that try new things. Mr Abrams won me over with this film , even though it had me on the verge of motion sickness.<br/><br/>How Beth survived the impaling rod, and then a helicopter-crash, I will never know.<br/><br/>Finally, the party drama that kicked the film off: It was a worthy attempt at introducing and developing characters, and was a friendly introduction to the filming style. Were we instantly thrown into the shaking action, we'd be annoyed at the lack of heads-up! Speaking of which, I loved naming of Hud (heads-up display. Ha.) We don't need to know what Rob's new Job entails. We don't really need to know that he's becoming Vice President, either, except that that shows it as being a job worthy to leave NY for Japan. Hud's attempts to talk with Marlena are amusing, mainly because our introduction to him doesn't exactly present the most attractive of guys, and his insistence on filming her so much shows an infantile fascination for her. It's pathetic and amusing, but also sweet, and brilliantly acted.<br/><br/>I have many more points that I'd love to comment on, but I feel that I've outstayed my welcome.<br/><br/>In conclusion, please see this movie if you're interested in film, and are aware that it's 84 minutes of what you saw in the trailer. It's incredibly well done, and includes top-tier acting, spectacularly edited visuals, comedy, tragedy, and a beautiful love story (albeit recorded over).<br/><br/>...And please don't make a sequel."
"Raymond-Safadi","8","0","2","21 February 2008"," They missed the point.
","It really saddens me that so many people have missed the whole point of this movie. It is in no way perfect but people keep complaining about the movie not being explained. How the characters are crappy actors. The whole point of this film is that things are happening as we watch them. It's a video clip from an attack that took place and the video was found. That is what we watch. We are watching a bunch of people not actors, going through terror. Nothing is explained because it's like real live where you can't explain things and just see it as it happens.<br/><br/>First of, yes they are actors technically but they are playing themselves as normal human beings and as humans we do stupid decisions sometimes and curiosity always gets the best out of us, which explains some of their dumb decisions in the 'movie'.<br/><br/>I was really impressed by what the producer and director did here with so little money compared to crap big budget movies that break the bank for crap effects and story lines. A lot of people might argue that there isn't anything unique or different in Cloverfield compared to other movies alike but then again no idea is original and it's how you do it and not how many times it has been done. In that way Cloverfield surpasses that and gives us a unique look at a story that has been done before but not like this.<br/><br/>The movie isn't just about what attacks the city but it's also a message regarding the fears we live in in todays terror world. You can see a lot of resemblance to 9/11 and it sends chills down the spine, specially the first 10 minutes of the attack. The fact that it is filmed in a realistic manner makes it all so believable, more powerful and definitely a fresh way of looking at filming.<br/><br/>Sure there is a love story thrown in there but that in no way takes away from the movie and just gives it a bit of heart and hope, something people always see in times of terror and sadness."
"ExpendableMan","9","0","2","21 February 2008"," J.J. Abrams does the monster mash
","There have been a lot of questions hovering over this movie ever since the first title-free teaser trailer appeared in cinemas last summer. What's it going to be called? What's the monster? Is it a reinvigorated version of the Godzilla franchise? Just what the hell is Cloverfield anyway? You have to hand it to J.J. Abrams really, he knows how to tantalise the Internet like no other, but all that aside there is still one question that was never properly addressed: will the casual film-goer get as much out of it as the obsessive cinema fan who has been following the hype since day one? The answer is a resounding yes as Cloverfield is unlike any film you're likely to have seen since the late nineties when three documentary students went in search of the Blair Witch and promptly disappeared. It's also a pulse-pounding ride through a devastated cityscape as seen through the eyes of the principal cast and while the introduction is a tad slow, once things kick off, they don't let up until the finale.<br/><br/>Shot entirely on a camcorder that is passed around a small group of characters, Cloverfield follows the same 'found footage' scenario of The Blair Witch. This is no low budget amateur film though, this is a big money depiction of a single terrifying night when New York city comes under attack from an unstoppable unknown creature and it's smaller, but equally vicious offspring. So far so very Godzilla, but by filming the entire thing with a hand held, Abrams takes the audience right down into the thick of it. This may be a big budget production with a preposterously good-looking cast, but it still feels like a small and personal film. When they run, we run with them. When they hide, we hide with them and on a level that no other film has ever achieved. Furthermore, there isn't a disaster movie-stereotype to be had, each of them is a genuine human being and their fear, confusion and desperation is only too real in this post-9/11 world.<br/><br/>Then there's the monster itself. To put paid to any still-lingering rumours, no it isn't Cthulu or any other theory you might have, it's an entirely new creation. The initial glimpses of a hind leg as it darts behind a skyscraper can only tantalise so far but when fully revealed, it's truly terrifying. Cynics may roll their eyes at the idea of a monster-movie nowadays but this is no fifties throwback, it's a wholly modern fear that carves a swathe of indiscriminate destruction through Manhattan and resists all attempts to destroy it. Plus, when it opens it's mouth and screams, you can almost feel your blood running cold.<br/><br/>Admittedly, not everyone is going to like this film. Given that the entire premise centres on a frantic battle to live through one apocalyptic night, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Yes, you do see the monster, but you never find out what it is and are left with nothing but theories. Neither do you ever get to see the morning after and discover what has become of the world in the wake of its rampage which is bound to frustrate a few folks. However, if you're willing to accept that not every thing will be neatly categorised then the somewhat abrupt ending might be a lot easier to tolerate. I for one thought it was an incredibly fitting way to end the movie, but walking out the cinema there was more than one voice complaining.<br/><br/>Cloverfield then is a film that captures the mood of the times in a disturbingly accurate way. We might not have giant monsters crawling out of the sea to decimate the landscape, but if they did it's hard not to see lines of people gathering with camera-phones at the ready recording a snapshot of the destruction to post on youtube. Abrams has pulled off a remarkable feat with Cloverfield; he has not only made the monster-movie fresh, exciting and action packed again, but he's also made it relevant for the first time since the first Godzilla movie riffed on Japan's post-nuclear anxiety. Given that the last time he teased us with a mystery monster it turned out to be a little cloud of black smoke, it's all the more remarkable."

","First of all, let me just say that I love Lost. It's probably my favourite t.v show, and because it was created by J.J. Abrams, I knew I had to see Cloverfield ever since I saw the teaser trailer months ago.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of people say how they didn't like the style of the camera-work, but personally, I thought it added to the film immensely. The footage of the scenes was surprisingly good, and the whole POV thing really helped me get into the film. In fact, the way the film was portrayed and the way the scenes were shown was VERY realistic, like the opening, the ending, the lack of soundtrack etc.<br/><br/>To be honest, the fact that there were numerous times that the group clearly should've died, I didn't really think it detracted from the film very much at all, because the scenes that followed were just brilliant.<br/><br/>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it and it's now one of my favourite films."

","Excellent movie though it also have it's weaknesses, first it's pretty short ... it's not really a bad point considering how fast and action-packed it is, but 20 or even 30 minutes more (that good) would have been a real pleasure. <br/><br/>The second and real bad point is that all the characters seem to have escaped a dumb ""real-TV"" show, the acting is not always top notch but it's good enough to keep the realistic aspect of the movie going, unfortunately I guess everybody won't feel close to the bunch of ""rich teenage winners"" involved in the action. Except for that it's a damn good movie, mysterious, intense, fast, nice, etc... and whether the (almost unseen) creature his Cthulhu or not should not be a big deal for any Lovecraft fan out there, 'cuz it's ""lovecraftic"" anyway. <br/><br/>Madness and horror surrounds this strange beast from the depths, no one can tell what it looks like, what it is, it's an unspeakable horror going on a furious rampage on the city and if you're a Lovecraft fan, I'm sure it'll sound familiar and exciting for you."
"horrorforpresident","7","0","1","20 February 2008"," Too much hype to live up to
","As many of us know, Cloverfeild was supposed to be the next great monster movie, an instant classic. Well, it did fall a little bit short. The trailer was much better than the movie. In the trailer, we see NYC as a killing ground for some kind of a huge creature, and the group of characters is seeing the battle against the creature while trying to leave NYC. We see what they see via video camera. Now don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the use of video cameras in movies, I love The Blair Witch Project, and i think that the idea is a cool way to film a movie. Yes, it can get a little annoying, but the angles in The Blair Witch Project were much worse. Also, too much hype to live up too. And with as much hype that this film got, i don't think any film could ever even come close to living up to it.<br/><br/>I liked most of the movie, and thought that the lines were really believable, and the acting decent. But again, too much hype, especially for a monster movie of this nature.<br/><br/>The main point of the film was that there was a party going on in NYC, and a friend of the person the party was being thrown for was filming a video, and thus we have the video camera. Once the monster hits and everyone realizes what is going on, the ""awesome"" party turns into an extreme race to get out of the city, and save a friend.<br/><br/>A good film, but the hype can really kill it. Let's just say it would have gotten 8.5 stars instead of 7. If you like basically any monster movie, or you loved The Blair Witch Project, you should enjoy yourself. Overall, an almost great monster movie that could not live up to it's own hype."

I was at the edge of my seat and was saying ""oh man"" under my breath every 20 seconds.<br/><br/>However (MAJOR SPOILER LOCATED HERE) When the camera man died and on, the movie died in my arms.

"stephenmcgowan","9","0","1","18 February 2008"," More realism than all the rest
","The movie was dubbed Blair Witch meets 9/11. Well thats not far off. The cameraman draws you in as you strive to visualise what the camera sees. Like War of the Worlds, the movie works because you only ever get to see the monster from a first person perspective and you only get a limited sight of it to. This creates tension like the Alien movies did and the horror is limited so the viewer is not subjected to a gore-fest like some of the other Hollywood horrors. There are also questions of the monsters presence. Where did it come from? What type of animal is it? Can it be killed? Is it alien? The length of the movie cannot answer these for us and again it adds to the realism of the movie. Because such a disaster has never taken place on our planet in our history, you cannot make it a glossy blockbuster like a war movie. You have to make this as realistic as possible. Filming it in hand-held camera works a treat especially with a back story and humour. I think they have done well with this movie, so much so you have to see it in a cinema to experience the best of it. I for one will be going to see it again."
"EijnarAmadeus","8","0","1","18 February 2008"," Raw terror in New York
","CLOVERFIELD is first of all something unique; it twists a well-known genre and creates something new - and it with 85 minutes of hand-held camera-work from a buddy named Hud as he, his main-dude Rob and two beautiful girls becomes the closest thing we'll get to heroes here. The movie had an enormous amount of hype throughout its marketing, the minimally teaser trailer kept people barely waiting for what's to come; surprisingly it's not about the big secret that makes Cloverfield such an exciting and vital experience, it's the simple and smartly pulled-off invention of it. Never before has a monster-movie been so frightening; terror and chaos isn't filmed by professionals all the time, in this day of age it's just as likely captured by a DV-camera or a phone-camera - and this creates a unsettling realism into the whole experience. Just as the main characters, we in the audience know nothing about why this monster attacks us and why nothing can stop it - the only thing to do is to save your life.<br/><br/>Receiving mixed reviews because of its visuals by always shaking, rolling, running, tumbling and jumping camera-work many reviewers left Cloverfield nauseas. And the political subtexts may be many; but the main thing about Cloverfield is that it's so unique and so incredibly thrilling - a must-see for any cinema fan."

","Actually, what I particularly liked with the movie, was that you never knew what the Alien really was, from where it came and why it attacked NY. I'm so tired of the regular SciFi movies where every single part is investigated and the attack has always some kind of purpose. This movie really feels very close to how you would act and feel if something like this happened. The true panic, and the lack of knowledge of what's really happening. I really loved this movie, and it was exactly as if all this really happened and someone found the tape. The fact that you were left with a lot of questions after watching it only made the movie better."
"holly_the_munchkin","7","0","1","17 February 2008"," Disappointed...I think - *******Spoilers*******
","I was so excited about seeing this movie from the minute I heard about it months ago. And from the moment I saw the trailer with the statue of liberty's head! Sadly, after seeing the movie yesterday, I think I feel disappointed. Problem is, I am not sure. In fact, Cloverfield wasn't rubbish, nor was it good. You will have probably read about 20 comments by now so I will just list what I think is good, and what is bad.<br/><br/>Good: It is tense (especially the scene in the subway) It is quite scary (girl who get's bitten) Special effects are awesome (Brooklyn Bridge getting smashed up) Acting is pretty good <br/><br/>Bad: The characters are lifeless and boring. The lead guy was a poorman's Matthew Fox (and he wasn't even as good looking). He was literally trying to be Matthew Fox. When they died, I really didn't care. Nor did I care that Rob was going to Japan and I didn't care about Beth either. Jason was also boring and when he dies, probably one of the best scenes. Huds (the guy behind camera), had about funny line. Funny works in LOST, but it didn't work in this movie. <br/><br/>You have NO idea what the monster is, where it comes from, it doesn't even roar or anything if I remember correctly. I wanted to see the military say, ""we believe it to be this"" or at least offer something more than, ""We need to nuke the city"".<br/><br/>The hand-held camera is pretty cool but you do feel as though you are missing part of the action. Maybe this is deliberate and you will see more in the sequel but, I kept thinking, ""Lift the camera up"" I didn;t get motion sickness but just annoyed by the fact that I couldn't see stuff getting blown up and the monster on the rampage!<br/><br/>The little creepy crawlie things that attack that mean girl in the subway look stupid. They could've at least been slimy or something but they looked daft! And, what are they!? What was their purpose? To lay their eggs apparently but what else?<br/><br/>The fact that they walk up the stairs to fetch Beth, find her with something sticking out of her shoulder, grab her, and walk back out on to the street. Not only is she miraculously pain-free but she manages to climb into a helicopter! And, as someone else on here pointed out, why do we have to see them going up the stairs, and then coming down. It's just pointless<br/><br/>There is no beginning, middle and end. I like movies that follow this format, you know the way it goes. Hero is introduced, monster arrives, monster destroyed and hero saves the day. This does not happen! And I wish it had!<br/><br/>You do not see enough destruction, I wanted to see explosions like in the Day after Tomorrow and even Transformers but everything you see is too far away! It's not that I don't like New York but if you are going to destroy a city, at least do it well.<br/><br/>And finally, I just expected a LOT more. JJ Abrams is no doubt a talented guy and I love LOST. A total fanatic actually but honestly, the director is at fault here because from the marketing campaign I was lead to believe I was getting a monster version of Transformers/Godzilla and Blair Witch all at once. Instead, I just felt disappointed. Let's hope the sequel gives us more!"

"davedee4","8","0","2","14 February 2008"," One of the most 'cinema only' films of all time, so if you're thinking of seeing it, make your mind up quickly.
","Cloverfield was a very enjoyable film, thrilling, exciting, loud. It had a good story, good effects, and it was everything it should've been. It was a good film to start my 2008 cinema-going, and although it's unlikely to be my favourite, it will stay in my mind for a while. The film, despite being very enjoyable is cursed with a few unavoidable plot holes based on the premise, which have been addressed many times already. Although the film's premise is easily compared, and probably heavily influenced by The Blair Witch Project, there's a major difference between them, Blair Witch; despite being fairly original was a fairly unentertaining film where the only thing it has to offer is people shouting at each other, and being frightened by darkness and noises, Cloverfield was interesting and I could barely take my eyes off it. Cloverfield is a hugely successful film at the moment, but don't wait for it out to be out on DVD, see it now! I, obviously haven't seen it on DVD, but I don't think there's any possible way it will be half as thrilling as it is on the big screen. It is possibly the most 'cinema only' film I've ever seen, but if the extra features are any good, hey, I just might buy it. I give it a secure 8/10."

","I had first heard of this movie from one of my friends who had seen the teaser trailer on Transformers. Later i saw this trailer and my immediate reaction to it was ""oh this movie is gonna be as bad as the American Godzilla"". I however am a monster movie buff and did want to remain objective to this movie and so i paid no attention to the ""hype"" it was getting. After watching it I concluded that this movie was in fact one of the best monster movies i have ever watched.<br/><br/>further i would like to address some of the complaints i have heard from many people about this movie: First: People state that the camera work was horrible at best because it was shaky.... I would like to say to them, it was designed that way, if you were in that situation filming and running for your life wouldn't you be shaky as well? Second: the lack of big name actors... again this was designed for realism, it is supposed to be average people living average lives who are going through this horrible event.<br/><br/>thank you for your time and i hope you understand my opinion of Cloverfield"

","After reading with much delight the bitter criticism of this movie I felt the urge to try to set the doubters straight.<br/><br/>This film was a cinematic experience not felt since Jurassic Park, and you actually believe it's authenticity throughout. For a monster movie - a tired cliché, yes - it somehow was pretty gosh darn believable. Like those dinosaurs were back in '93.<br/><br/>People have slammed Cloverfield for being vague and leaving them in a confused and/or unsatisfied state. Well, those easily entertained may as well go and watch something unoriginal like an episode of Scooby Doo to have all those loose-ends tied up so that it all makes sense in the end. 'In the end' sums all that up, as with this movie there is no obvious linear format. Folks with a blinkered view that you should never sway from the typical, tired conventions of a story or film will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Generally the detail is breathtaking and is presented simply as a moment in time and opts for the point-of-view, naturalistic approach which frankly many directors haven't had the guts to attempt in modern mainstream Cinema.<br/><br/>Yes it may be a cliché that New York is the subject, but what a place for a monster to roam given the bustling population of the City. If you can imagine a 'thing' the size of those buildings and something that can nonchalantly topple them to wreak huge danger to civilian lives; that is a pretty scary prospect if you are witnessing this live, which is why you are placed in the middle as a viewer for the devastating effect. There are some parallels of the 9/11 attacks and are even touched on in the film when they question if the monster was created as part of a government conspiracy - like 9/11 was rumored to be.<br/><br/>The editing is very-well done, complete with all those pointless, terribly-framed and 'amateurish' scenes you get when pressing 'record' and 'stop' on a home camera. These fill the gaps between the cuts and action to add further verisimilitude and plausibility.<br/><br/>It's also what you don't see for much of the film that intrigues as the camera-guy constantly tries to get a shot of the monster as he knows this is an unprecedented situation. The realism is spot-on and you DO NOT need a 'hot Hollywood star' like, I don't know, Jake Gyllenhaal limping around for an Oscar as the good-natured protagonist who single-handedly destroys this evil monster, gets the girl, and everyone can happily breathe again as they kiss, laugh and hold hands whilst walking through Central Park unscathed and undaunted. For those who say the script was terrible, was there really a complete script? If it was so obviously scripted, then instantly, the realism would dramatically wane. Would JJ Abrams really want cheesy Spielberg-type dialogue and one that gives us a complete insight into all the characters since birth??<br/><br/>Cloverfield would have been another awful flop had it been YET another obvious, beginning-middle-end, good-prevails, moralistic, everybody's happy, action blockbuster... but it isn't. This is the most dynamic and daring film for a long time and I strongly advise those who feel intrigued to watch it to get the cinematic experience while it is still running. It is fresh, tense, innovative and isn't over-the-top - as it could easily have been. The balance and presentation are near perfect. For me and many others, the creators have achieved the best monster movie in decades. This isn't that hybrid of Godzilla, Blair Witch and Predator 2 some have called it. All that is wholly unjustified criticism by people who simply do not understand the film.<br/><br/>Oh, and 'Cloverfield' is the best title this could have had. Imagine the idyllic, tranquil nirvana of a Cloverfield and somewhere you would long to be. Then look at the debris of New York in the film.... Juxtaposition at it's best.<br/><br/>This will be one of those cult, defining films in years to come. No question."
"hcaraso","9","0","1","12 February 2008"," Lovecraft is back!
","It was really impossible to check among the 1334 comments (and growing),to find out if CLOVERFIELD brought back the fantastic Howard Philips Lovecraft(1890-1937), perhaps the most inventive sci-fi writers of all times. In his imagination, the Earth used to be inhabited by giants called The Ancients (Les Anciens) who lived in the bottom of the Atlantic, mainly in the vicinity of the imaginary city of Arkham (or Providence). They may have also inhabited the Atlantide, the sunkcontinent.Sometimes, these creatures land on the coast, in person or impersonated, and do a lot of damage. They have strange names, such as Cthulhu or Shub-Niggurath, divinities such as Azatoth, or historic figures like Abdul Alhazred, the mad Arab who wrote the cursed book of Necronomicon. The unknown giant character that beheads the statue of Liberty, or shake off the bridges of New York in CLOVERFIELD will probably be identified in the sequel presently under filming. Until then, get your goodselves a copy of The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward, Lovecraft's masterpiece.Harry Carasso, Paris, France."

"mast3486","8","0","1","12 February 2008"," A great piece of film....
","Some people seem to be upset that it's so short. Some people seem to be upset that nothing is explained. Some felt sick from the crazy camera movement! I think all of these add to an incredibly entertaining 84 minutes! Here's why:<br/><br/>Running time - it has been said by many a critic that most films could do with losing a third of their running time. It seems like that is the ethos this film has been made by. It gives you just what you need to stay interested in each scene....no more, no less. If a film leaves you frustrated and wanting more at the end, it's done it's job and has created the foundation for a very lucrative franchise, no matter how much the theme is milked in the sequels (Saw - anyone?)<br/><br/>Crazy camera - this is a minor, yet effective point. Let's take Blair Witch as the comparison people tend to use for the direction of Cloverfield. The only similarity here is the type of camera. The camera in Blair Witch has the home movie 'feel', but it is very obvious that each scene is staged and has been directed very precisely (even the bob of the camera while the teens are running about). The completely hectic nature of the camera in Cloverfield is a triumph in realism. You really feel that the cameraman forgets it's in his hand at points! <br/><br/>Lack of explanations - this is the best of the points! No explanation is given at all for what is going on. The lack of a conclusion is quite brilliant. How could it end? Either the monster dies or it doesn't...we've seen all the possible end scenarios play out before. No explanation of where the beast came from...is there any explanation that could be at all unique and plausible? Conventional 'story telling' elements are thrown aside and we are left with a pure experience for the senses that could only be delivered through the medium of film.<br/><br/>My one indifference may be controversial...the special effects. Although they are perfectly adequate they only really work in conjunction with the camera movement and benefit from the out of focus shots. Fast and bright images do their job well, but in terms of detail I was unimpressed..but in a way detailed and cutting edge effects weren't really needed as they would have distracted the viewer from the human element for too much of the film.<br/><br/>Ultimately you should go and enjoy this movie for what it is....a pure piece of interesting, thrilling and generally entertaining film-making. Although I would probably never call this one of the all time greats, it's definitely one of the great commercial blockbusters!"
"UltimoCrofto","5","0","1","12 February 2008"," Monster? Tick. Mystery? Tick. Great story, depth and characters? Er... no tick.
","Cloverfield is a film about a monster attacking Manhattan. On that premise it does a good job: we're given a good view of what it would look like if a monster really did attack a real-world city. The camera work might not be for everyone, but the angle the film is trying to give pays off if you let it (though I'm aware the way the film is made is actually nausea inducing for some people, so fair enough to them).<br/><br/>Where the film falls short, though, is with character and - overall - plot development. The characters are your typical MTV-douchebags who offer any viewer with the slightest hint of intelligence no reason to care for them. And because the characters are useless you barely care for their actions throughout the story, which of course devalues the whole experience.<br/><br/>Fortunately if you go to see this movie with your main objective being to see a huge, somewhat plausible, monster rampaging on the loose you'll be more than happy. There's plenty of mystery but subtle clues peppered throughout the film to add your own kind of depth, so that balances the shortcomings a bit.<br/><br/>At it's core Cloverfield is and always was intended to be a monster movie. It does that part well, and the story surrounding the monster could be good material for future work, but the story surrounding the - could care less for - characters doesn't allow Cloverfield to elevate to anything more than a brainless popcorn movie."

","I went to watch this film expecting something between Godzilla and I am Legend. No big expectations whatsoever. I was pleasantly surprised in all honesty -- not that this is the greatest action/horror/survival movie ever made, no, not at all. But it did keep me glued to my seat for its entire duration, and left me hanging in there in suspense. That, by itself, justified the ticket price ;) By the way, this movie employs a LOT of 9/11 ambiance, and that's some strong leverage it builds upon. So is this Godzilla? Well, yes, and no, we have a monster destroying NYC, with the military bombing it with B-2's dropping 500 pound bombs to absolutely no effect. The monster also spawns spiders which infect you and you then die in agony. Banal and lame, huh? And you get your basic bunch of people, wanna be protagonists, who start dying off one by one. Even lamer, eh? Also, the entire footage is filmed on a hand-held camera, so if you have motion sickness you're better off watching something else, but I am not taking points away 'cause of that -- this is one of these movies where having motion blur actually does help realism greatly. Acting is pretty much on the level and you get decent special FX too, though, as expected, the plot is quite barren and predictable. The film also utilizes throwing loose ends at the audience's imagination, which I personally find annoying (e.g. you never find out where did this monster come from, who ends up dead for sure etc.), but on the other hand that's probably the better choice with these kinds of films, anyway...<br/><br/>Anyway, my final recommendation to whoever is reading this review -- if you like sci-fi or general horror survival movies go and see this one, it's a solid film experience and does have traces of genre innovation -- definitely better and more ambitious than most of the recent titles in this genre (and I do mean Resident Evil and I am Legend :-). Cheers."

","First up this story isn't exactly new, the monster attack on a big city is a well rehearsed and old favourite. What is new about this movie is that they take some One Tree Hill/The O.C. type twenty somethings, add a dash of humour, and a camcorder point of view and mix it together to create an unexpected and surprisingly exciting blend.<br/><br/>The cameraman Hud, who spends most of the film documenting the film is the key source of why the film works; although the main story is about a guy and a girl - Hud is the one who makes sure the whole thing doesn't come across too seriously and it allows the audience an amount of breathing space within the non-stop action. I think whether you like this film will depend a lot on whether you find Hud funny or annoying; regardless of that though there are some wonderful apocalyptic shots of Manhattan to enjoy, and the monster itself is a site to behold.<br/><br/>I walked out of the cinema and I had that strange feeling you get sometimes when a movie draws you into it's world and then casually spits you back into the real; for starters I kept expecting to hear deep rumbling noises and the site of nearby buildings being smashed to pieces. It is definitely a film that hits hard and fast and its nice to see something new for a change. However, like it says in the Empire Magazine review I reserve the right to dock at least 2 stars if they make a sequel."
"Deathstryke","7","0","1","12 February 2008"," Not the mess I thought it would be
","By that I mean I didn't puke from motion sickness, although I did get a bit of a headache during one or two scenes. The hand held camera can be disorientating but it adds a gripping immediacy to the terrifying events and totally immerses you in the thick of it. That is of course if you can suspend disbelief long enough to accept that the camera man manages to keep filming while monsters, missiles and fiery debris rain down around him like lottery balls in a shuffling machine.<br/><br/>We are plonked into an apartment to share in the humorous, occasionally annoying banter of a few likable Manhattan yuppies who rudely have their clambake interrupted by a giant squid/crab/turtle like creature who takes considerable offense to tall buildings and men in green uniforms firing rockets into his face. The explosions, the dust clouds, the wounded civilians, all captured on what looks like grainy news footage create a distinctly 9/11 feel and it's an interesting memory or emotion to play on.<br/><br/>We are told absolutely nothing about...well, anything. There is no explanation as to why the monster is there at all, but the threat, the danger is emphatically realized. Clueless as the characters in the movie, we are left to fathom things at the rate at which they happen, and this mystery makes for a largely unpredictable and stimulating experience.<br/><br/>The acting is credible and I appreciate the director's decision not to use big name actors. This for the most part really does feel like a documentation that was found in a ruin, if not for a few contrived incidences, most notably at the end where we finally get to view the monster in all it's grumpy faced, tentacle lashing glory. The SFX are terrific but some moments have a distinct CGI shininess to them. Dialoge contains a lot of improv as you would expect, it's supposed to be real life, and it goes around in circles a bit. The phrase ""OH MY GOD!!!"" is repeated frequently, yet one would expect less of a PG-13 response to a giant mutant vapourising Central Park! There is also humour scripted in the least likely of places, which is appreciated yet detracts from the effect of a real life documentation.<br/><br/>All in all Cloverfield was a fresh, exciting, slightly nauseating way to watch New York get pulverized all over again."
"cairnswendy39","9","0","2","11 February 2008"," Cloverfield Review
","As we all know, this movie undertook a huge viral marketing in 2007 starting with a teaser trailer back in the summer, but what intrigued everyone was, despite that it had a release date and credited J.J. Abrams as the producer (The creator of ""Alias"" and the co-creator of ""Lost""), the film did not reveal it's name, leaving everyone guessing what the film could be. At the end of the year, the film was revealed as ""Cloverfield"" (originally just a code name) and, despite speculations, turned out to be very close to what we saw in the unusual teaser. Now that the film has been released, there is still a concern of the film living up to the hype, something that very little films has succeeded in.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film is completely shot with a hand-held camcorder documenting footage shot from a monstrous disaster in New York and is done very realistically. The film mainly starts with a going-away surprise party for a guy named Rob. The film does drag on for a while in order for us to be introduced to some of the characters. However, as soon as we hear a thunderous roaring sound the party immediately stops and the fun begins. To see what is going on, the party guests go onto the roof of the apartment building only to witness a huge explosion in the city. In panic, everyone runs down into the street and soon after, the head of statue of liberty comes crashing down onto the road. After that, the film leads into a chaotic disaster film about the survival of a bunch of friends.<br/><br/>Now I may have told the synopsis of the Teaser trailer, but that's literally how the film goes. Now people have criticised the film for it's shaky hand-held camera (which many has experienced motion sickness from). It is unfair to compare it from ""The Blair Witch Project"", the fact that the camera is always shaking around and you usually don't get to see a lot is where the fun comes in. Quite frankly, it was like a dream come true to see how realistic they made it from start to finish, the film's style is the only way you can really appreciate the film. Now I give this a 9 out of 10 because I was surprised to see a lot of glimpses of the monster throughout the film, though you only get to see the whole thing at the end, but I will not reveal what the monster actually is. As well as praising the film's choice of style to make it very realistic, the film also works in other ways too. For instance, you never get to discover what the monster actually is and why it's attacking new york (another reason why the film has been criticised). Is it a top secret government experiment gone wrong, or is it something out of this world? You never know, but that's good because you get to make up your own idea. Despite the fact that the film does have a 9/11 feel about it (Mainly because it is set in New York), I felt that the film pays homage to the classic monster movies such as King Kong and Godzilla as well as many other disaster movies and yet the film is fresh and original. Lenght-wise, the movie is brilliantly structured with a very quick and perfectly timed pace and yet has many different scenes to make the film feel not to short and yet not too long. Unlike films such as ""Pirates Of The Caribbean 3: At World's End"", the movie is not, at any point, too slow, it is (literally) constantly 'on the edge of your seat"" and the film has no time too bore you.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Cloverfield"" is fast, thrilling, exciting, highly entertaining and very original. And it is one of the few, if not, the first film that actually lives up to the hype, and is best to see at the cinema. A very good cinematic start for 2008!"

AND IT KICKED ASS. I'm not sure if anyone else did this, this might just be me, but when you got out of the theater, did you look in the sky to see if anything was there. Didn't it feel so real. I was amazed by how real it felt and thats what sold the movie for me. *SPOILERS COMING UP* I thought that it was a very good idea to not show the monster that much throughout the movie. I am still not quite sure what those parasites were falling off of the monsters body. I watched an interview with Matt Reeves the other day and he announced a possible sequel which is cool. He said that it could possibly be from another b=point of view of a person or group trying to survive. One of my buddies told me the sequel might be from a military point of view. Either of these are cool to me. What do you think? He also announced that the monster was a baby looking for its mother. ITS MOTHER! if that was the size of the baby than how big is the mother.

Do people with weak bladders complain about ""the perfect storm"" making them want to pee? No of course not.<br/><br/>For the rest of us who can manage roller-coaster rides or simulator machines, Cloverfield was a totally innovative experience. If it had been filmed in the traditional manner like Godzilla it would have been nothing special at all. In many ways it was similar to Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"". We stuck with one group of characters, something ""alien"" was attacking us and winning and we knew nothing about what it was or why it was happening. <br/><br/>In an age where YouTube rules I am astounded at the lack of imagination of the people who complain about Cloverfields' camera style. It is a very modern movie and I think we can expect to see more and more films taking on board this very personal style of movie making.<br/><br/>So you'd better learn to live with it!"

","This just opened in South Africa this past weekend. After all the teasers I've seen concerning this movie, I was definitely curious about whether it would be worth all the hype. After reading the reviews once it opened in America, I got the feeling the critics were divided 50-50. Going into it, I knew already that the whole movie was basically like watching a home movie recording. Was I really in the mood for such an experiment? So, with some trepidation I went ahead and watched it...<br/><br/>Verdict? Yikes!!! It was awesome. Something totally different and original. Amazing special effects, simple yet effective plot line, no well-known actors (making it seem more realistic), and a director who knows how to ratchet up the tension. By now, you know the plot: While throwing a surprise farewell bash for a friend, a group of New York 20-somethings witness their city being overrun by a huge monster. And all the while, one of them is walking around with a hand-held video camera recording everything. Doesn't seem like much to work with, but the most effective stories are usually the simplest. One definitely gets the feeling of being there in the thick of the action. With quite a few effective scare moments, this movie definitely takes a well-worn idea and makes it its own. The jerkiness and continual unsteadiness of what you see on screen won't be for everyone though. It worked for me, against all my expectations.<br/><br/>This movie of course most resembles Godzilla, but with quite a bit of James Cameron's Aliens thrown into the mix. Definitely one to see on the big screen, DVD just won't do it justice."

","See it. If you can stomach the hand held motion sickness that may afflict some people, this is well worth the admission fee. Some people have compared it to Blair Witch, which is somewhat puzzling as they aren't even in the same league. A bit like comparing a ferrari to a skoda. Just because they are both cars, or in this case movies, it does not make them in anyway alike. The plot and characters are shallow, but the choice of hand-held camera immerses us right into the action and it feels more like a roller-coaster ride than a movie. This is where the films premise works so very well. Could Abrams have pulled this off with a complex plot, deep characters, elaborate camera angles and huge set designs? Its doubtful. We only have to compare this movie to others of its kind such as Godzilla to discover that bigger is not always best. By taking it down to street level where we are given as much knowledge, vision and sound as the characters in the movie, we have a more intimate perspective on how this scenario would happen for real.<br/><br/>The sound plays a large part and the noise during the action scenes make them all the more intense. The effects are realistic and the monster designs creative. The action scenes will have your heart thumping and you will you cling to your seat. The story is simple and provides us with a good setting for the ride/movie.<br/><br/>We are left with many questions, and very few answers. All we end up being are passengers along for the ride in Abrams imagination. This film is not to everyones liking. The shaky cam, lack of deep characters and plot may deter some people, but its all good fun. One intense scene summed it all up for me. I won't post a spoiler, but it involves a helicopter rescue. That scene had me holding my breath for the whole sequence.<br/><br/>Some people will complain, as the cynical public always do. They will say that they were unimpressed and behave with underwhelmed emotion when describing this movie. But much like children being asked is they found the roller-coaster scary, they will try to hide their feelings as though it is some how cooler to say they weren't, in an attempt to impress their friends. Watch it on the big screen, because it is not meant for the small screen. I for one would pay to see it again."

The special effects are brilliantly handled, making the movie all the more believable, with its handycam view, though might be distracting for some, is actually a great way to show the movie through the eyes of the victims, rather than using aerial shots and pans.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a must-watch for the new generation who even have a passing interest in the genre, and sets a new milestone in movie-making."

Does make you jump sometimes but it's not scary (never had to block my ears or close my eyes). The 'action' in it isn't interesting, there's only little parts of things put together. There is a bit of gore so if you hate the look of blood then don't watch this movie. Also some characters go off camera and are forgotten about, which is annoying.

","A regular night party is being held in New York. And everyone is having a great time. Right until an unexpected earthquake occurred. Then there was a new flash about an unknown intruder has invaded the Big Apple. Every local in the city was curious in knowing what is rotten in Manhatten. Right until they're all running for their lives because of an unknown creature that's so destructive it's wrecking the whole city piece by piece. The whole national guard is doing all they can to stop it. But what will become of New York and all the New Yorkers? The whole movie is view by a group of teenagers who didn't expect to be in the middle of an inhuman city attack. They don't know where it came from. Or what it really is. They just know it's big and dangerous.<br/><br/>What makes this movie an instant classic. Is that it's nothing compared to other monster related movies. For instants it's all filmed on a video camera. Giving it a realistic feel to it. Plus we as the audience will be confused and befouled by what is going on. Because there are no other pointer views besides the group of teens we see throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I like that effect for the movie. Because if they revealed too much of what is happening. Then it be too ordinary to watch. Being questionable like the main cast makes the whole thing worth watching entirely.<br/><br/>And if this was filmed with a cinema camera then it be no different than any other ordinary monster film. If you're looking for something that looks basic but entirely original. Then Cloverfield won't disappoint you. It has a great complex plot, memorable moments, explosions, mysterious themes, suspense, and great special effects all in a video taped movie.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a hit, and an instant cult classic. I'll be looking forward to the sequel."
"mollymormonbrat","6","0","1","9 February 2008"," Nothing quite like a monster destroying NYC.
","This review is late in coming. I saw this movie opening night with no idea of what to expect, due to the mysterious posters and trailers. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself watching the documentary of something large and weird destroying New York City.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, I cannot decide if this movie was supposed to be serious or not. I was under the impression it was pure camp, what with the classic and simple giant monster and the smaller monsters lurking in the darkness. But yes, the key word is classic. Monster movies have definitely made their niche in cinema culture, and I guess they figured it was high time for another one.<br/><br/>Besides the monster, much of the movie focused on the emotional plot line of the humans desperately trying to reach each other. I was interested in their courageous trek through Ground Zero, though I was mostly interested in watching them scream and run from various dangers. Still, I could appreciate the humanity.<br/><br/>The effects. Oh, wow. Now these were some nice effects, from the Statue of Liberty literally losing her head to tilted buildings. The monsters, while still looking classically Hollywood camp, were awe/fear inspiring.<br/><br/>I don't know if I experienced the same terror as the teenagers in the theatre as I spent a good deal of time laughing, but I was certainly entertained.<br/><br/>Old school works. This proves it. Remember that, Hollywood."

A very well done movie in all respects that gets you right from the beginning till the very end. It can be said that it could have been done like all other movies in still camera but... the shaky format makes it different from all other monster/action movies. The director has been very coy in showing the audience the monster. Your glimpses of the monster are limited and he lets your imagination play.

","Hi it's the 14 year old film fanatic again and this is my review on cloverfield.<br/><br/>To review this film i'm going to have to go back to july 2007: Me and a friend went to t go see the first showing of transformers, and me being film fanatic i could name every film trailer that was showing. But. This random trailer came on. I knew nothing about it and i'm sure other people were wondering what this was as well. The trailer showed a party then rumbling then explosions and a familiar head rolling down the street. After that it said 1-18-08 from producer j.j. Abrams. And then from the short space of silence between that trailer all anyone could hear was whispers of confusion ""Godzilla, Blair witch knock off, Lost spin off, Cthulu."" I had made the assumption that it was Godzilla but much more deep. But i would love the idea of Cthulu as i love lovecraftian. After that it was an internet frenzy, viral website, tie-ins, fake sites and crazy rumours that the story was gods versus aliens.<br/><br/>But then the new trailer came out and finally after 6 months Cloverfield is here and i've just come back from seeing it.<br/><br/>In case you haven't already guessed the film is about a giant monster attacking the city of new york. It's shot in the same hand-held camera style as the Blair witch and it documents a small group of people trying to save a friend and escape Manhattan.<br/><br/>First of all there are loves and hates about the style of shooting. The loves is that the fact that it's shot through a hand-held digi-cam adds that sense of true depth rather than seeming really hollywoodised. Also there are no opening credits, just bunch of numbers and strange TV symbols explaining the film is a document in an event designated cloverfield. That one thing makes it seem like it's true and adds to it's expanded universe. But the one major problem is flashing strobe lights but mostly the shaky camera which at certain points makes you stop eating popcorn 'cause your feeling travel sick.<br/><br/>The effects. Well for a film made in entire secrecy it's a massive surprise. By looking at it you would think you would know someone was making a film on a massive scale. It was relatively low budget but it was made great. Great tense moments like the Brooklyn bridge snapping in half etc. almost seemed epic and mega expensive. The monster. I'm not going to go into details of what the monster looks like. But i thought it would follow the tradition of ""Less is more"" But it didn't and you got to see the monster up close and it looks amazing.<br/><br/>The acting truly is deep and you have a feeling for the characters. Even though you can understand their situation you understand they're misfortune.<br/><br/>Once the film came to it's rather dull ending. (True love conquers all) You can't help but stand up and clap, i applauded at this film it was amazingly made, deep, and it wasn't clichéd or exaggerated and was a new gust of fresh air.<br/><br/>The allegations of the 9/11 allusions are almost annoying. And i don't mean to offend anyone who is connected to 9/11 i sympathise but comparing mass murdering suicide bombers to a fictional CGI monster is ludicrous.<br/><br/>The ending of the film did eventually put me off that the two remaining characters, who are each others love interest die in each others arms screaming i love you. But if you have the patience to sit through the credits like i did then you will get an extra surprise.<br/><br/>Definitely worth your time and has been my favourite film of 2008 so far."

","I don't know what movie all the haters of Cloverfield saw but this was an awesome film. While the camera movements in Blair Witch made it stand out from the rest of the films release at the same time. The composition of this film made the movie. Yes there were time that you find yourself saying,""Wow... really?"" But the acting was so believable and the direction was great that it didn't matter. Although it is a monster movie, I like how the focus of the film was on Rob tying to save the woman he loves. I think if it were to be made the traditional way, it might have not come out as well. So to all of those who say that Cloverfield is the same thing as Blair Witch, shut your lips and go watch a mindless movie like Step It Up 2"

","Well directed and a refreshing change to the usual alien Invasion.<br/><br/>I went in to this film with mixed thoughts, should I shouldn't I see It, or should I just wait till It comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>I came out of this film feeling a true sense of reality and thinking that could have actually happened, the only thing I think let It down was the occasional poor cgi.<br/><br/>This film is ""The Blair Witch,"" meets ""Independence Day"" with a hint of ""Godzilla"".<br/><br/>My only recommendation is to not sit too close as it will make you feel a little ill.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this."
"swipe1975","9","0","2","9 February 2008"," A refreshingly new style of film
","I had no idea what this film was about, apart from seeing a short trailer where the Statue Of Liberty's head is rocketed down the street. Exactly one week after I walked out of the cinema, I have come to the conclusion that it is probably one of my all time favourite movies. Why? Because it's a good, refreshing change. No big movie stars, no cheesy background music, a hand-held cam view (you might feel nauseous for the first ten minutes), and special effects that blend in well with the movie. I'm starting to like this JJ Abrams. Not only has he done the brilliant 'Lost', but there was a sneaky trailer of the next big film that's going to be released on Boxing Day... I won't spoil it for you. The first fifteen minutes of the film is a character building exercise, but it's interesting enough to keep you absorbed, so much so that when the real action starts, you're quite gripped. There was a scene towards the end where my girlfriend was squeezing my leg that hard I didn't notice... I had to concentrate on just breathing properly. The only time I've ever felt tension like that in the cinema is when the T-Rex is chasing the Jeep in 'Jurassic Park'. Cloverfield is how films should be made. The Blair Witch Project attempted this style eight years ago, but I felt that film was hit and miss... Cloverfield is definitely a hit. You MUST see this film at the cinema; I don't think it will have the same effect on your television. However, no matter in what format you watch it, you'll be thinking about it for days after, and when was the last time you did that?"
"Markbruinekreeft","9","0","3","8 February 2008"," I can't believe so many people hated it....
","Okay, so the whole ""seen through the camera of some regular Joe"" thing isn't exactly new. But you have to admit that applying the principle to a monster movie was a pretty neat idea. <br/><br/>Cloverfield is an awesome film. I can be a horrible nitpicker at times, and films that can truly captivate me are few and far between. Cloverfield, however, kept me firmly pinned to my seat during the entire film. It blew me away. I have almost no nits to pick at all!<br/><br/>-------------------------Spoilers forthcoming--------------------------<br/><br/>The fact that a choppy, quasi-amateurish ""Blair Witch"" approach is used, combined with the fact that almost no solid answers are given about what the monster is, where it comes from and why it is attacking the city, gives an outlandish concept like a giant monster attack a terrifying and nightmarish realism. We, the audience, know little more than the main characters do, which results in a sense of loss of control, bewilderment and of utter helplessness. <br/><br/>This is further expanded upon by the fact that none of said characters is a larger-than-life, cliché Hollywood-style hero. Presumably, there is some ex-Navy Seal guy with a rocket launcher running around somewhere, with a girl in a torn tank-top and a wisecracking ethnic-minority sidekick in tow. But this is not his story. This is about a random group of people, who suddenly find themselves in a terrifying and unreal situation. Granted, few people get to be vice-president of something in Japan while still only in their mid- to late twenties, but basically, it COULD be you out there. Running for your life with a running camera in your hand. Seeing your friends and relatives die in horrible and shockingly random ways. <br/><br/>There are a FEW nits to pick, of course. Such as the convenient fact that the main protagonists keep blundering into the most spectacular disasters taking place during the attack. Or the introductory holiday/party scene that was exactly long enough to become boring. But most of these are largely either excusable oversights or necessary compromises to the film's ""Blair Witch"" style. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a gripping, terrifying and even quite original film. Those who can enjoy a thriller/horror film that dares to deviate from the mainstream (even if only a little) and who can live with not getting all the answers at the end will enjoy this flick tremendously.<br/><br/>However, those people who prefer more ""traditional"" monster movies, in the mold of the classic Godzilla or Alien films, will most likely hate it. As will people who simply don't like the Blair Witch-like ""one single, shaky home camera"" style used in this film."
"mr_facehead","4","0","2","8 February 2008"," Excellent!
","Cloverfield is a brilliant film. I was expecting it to be reasonably good, but it really was excellent.<br/><br/>The only thing that forced me to lower the rating, was the fact that it almost killed me. For about half of the film, I had to look at the ground, walls or close my eyes, due to the extreme and prolonged motion of the hand-held camera. If I didn't do so, i probably would have been carried out. This seemed to have no effect on a lot of people, but I recommend watching it with some water or nourishment in the anticipation that you'll be sick. Despite making me severely ill, I wouldn't say the hand-held camera was a bad part of the film. If the experience of a film is ruined by something such as this, then it would be bad, but in most cases it wasn't a problem.<br/><br/>Watching this was incredible. It was really like watching an actual camera tape. Even little things like camcorder focusing and features were incorporated. So much thought has been put into this film, it's really great.<br/><br/>There's even a little secret bit at the end that you'll probably miss if you blink, but it's really amazing."
"planet_koumpi","10","0","1","8 February 2008"," Excellent Cloverfield
","Although the storyline is not really one of a kind,the hole perspective of the film was excellent.The fact that the entire movie was filmed with a handy cam gave you a feeling that you were actually there!This is what gave the movie a unique feeling making it one of the best monster science fiction thrillers i have ever seen.Another thing that was well based in the film was the storyline.Although it might seem kind of boring in the beginning,after about 30 minutes of pointless conversation and filming of friends at a farewell party,everything starts to flip around turning an ordinary night into a complete nightmare.Of course in a movie like this you expect to see quite a bit of gore,which i believe the director provides you with just the right amount of it.All and all Cloverfield is an excellent film which will surely keep the audience on the edge of their seat.Definitely a must see!"
"shariqq","8","0","1","8 February 2008"," Strong Stomach? Be ready for a fun ride!
","Cloverfield is to monster movies what Blair Witch Project is to horror movies. But while the latter was a gimicky low-budget fiasco (forget Box Office, it is no measure of quality), Cloverfield is a decently budgeted polished piece of film-making.<br/><br/>Shot entirely from the POV of a hand-held digicam initially being used to make a home-video, the movie takes us through the disaster that NY faces through the experiences of a small group of youths. So while the camera focuses on the bunch of three-four friends, the backdrop shows us what we would have seen in full-focus in a Godzilla or Independence Day - Buildings collapsing, destruction all-around, the monster in attack-mode, the army retaliating, etc.<br/><br/>What really impressed me was the way the movie uses most of its budget (physical/visual effects) only for the background. The production has done a wonderful job in recreating an extraordinary event as it would look, and have a few regular people to react to it. Soon after the first disruption, immediate thoughts go to survivors of 9/11 and their experience to the actuality of the disaster.<br/><br/>Mixed reactions to the movie are mostly because hand-held video for the entirety of the movie can induce motion-sickness though. There were a few walk-outs mid-way, and I know of people running to the toilets due to the shaking effect throughout. As long as you are prepared for and have the stomach for it, be ready for an experiment of a movie that actually works as an experience."

","Really didn't know what to expect went we went to see the movie, the information 'blackout' helped this.<br/><br/>Don't know what is was but we all came away from the movie on an adrenaline rush. Everything said to us that we shouldn't have enjoyed it but we did. Monster movie i.e. Godzilla was at the back of our minds, and of course Blair Witch camera shake and unknown actors, but came away thinking it was money well spent, whereas 'I am Legend' a few weeks ago left me thinking I had wasted the price of a few more drinks and a chat with the people I went with.<br/><br/>The monster was never in your face, the special effects were excellent and the 'unknown' actors helped you concentrate on what was going on. After the scene with the helicopter (which is on the trailer) you could have heard a pin drop in the cinema.<br/><br/>People have moaned about the long intro at the party but I found that I had forgot that I was there to see a monster movie, then when it changed the adrenaline roller coaster kicked in quite abruptly and never stopped until the cinema lights came on just as abruptly. <br/><br/>All in all, a great night out for a something totally different escapism and such a great buzz afterwards.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. Would have given it 9 out of ten but a bit too much camera shaking, especially after a few drinks before going in the cinema."

","Well I liked this movie. Some people may dislike the shakiness a certain points of the movie, but you gotta understand this movie was made from a different point of view. I watch this movie and felt as if I was there. The special effects were well done and storyline OK.<br/><br/>SPOILER ! Just the one thing that kept going through my mind is that this film has a lot of questions that should of been explained. The ending was well, expected, but I just did not like the fact that it ends without explaining what the hell that thing was, and the aftermath of the situation.<br/><br/>I can understand if the director wanted the film to be this way, but a movie like this should have something to answer your questions.<br/><br/>The characters were built up well, not great, but good enough. Overall I think this is a worth to watch movie. I'd recommend this for a rental at blockbuster not a must buy for the average movie goer. I will buy it when it comes out only because I felt what the actors felt in the movie. This movie was one of the few films that actually made me feel in the movie and really succeeds well in showing the point of view of 5 New Yorkers."
"nicola_ball2108","8","0","1","7 February 2008"," Does live up to it's hype
","I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie because of the warnings of motion sickness and the stories I'd heard on the radio during the past week about movie goers being sick in the aisles. I'm personally a little bad when it comes to motion sickness, but I truly didn't find the camera movements that nauseating.<br/><br/>I have seen many comments and reviews about how there is no 'character development' that the camera is 'far too shaky', but those comments and reviews are not taking into account that the movie is meant to be 85 minutes worth of a 7/8 hour period during one evening in New York. It's the perspective of several, scared and confused New Yorkers trying to find their friend and survive.<br/><br/>While the cam-corder style filming has been done in Blair Witch, I found this movie did it in a better manner, causing viewers to feel that they were there with them more than Blair Witch was able to. I found myself thinking during parts of the movie ""Grr I need to look right... oh wait, I'm watching a movie"". The way it has been filmed in my view, is very effective and just adds to the sinister atmosphere.<br/><br/>Parts of the film are fairly confusing, in the sense that you're not really meant to understand it in some ways. It leaves a lot for your imagination to mull over, and the confusion is that of the characters in the film.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie, and I have to say that I found it more entertaining and thought-provoking than 'I Am Legend', which I also saw recently. I would recommend it to anyone who wants something more than the generic 'monster movie'. Cloverfield has a large scope for it's back story, since it's not explained during the movie what the monster is, where it came from and why?"

","I was impressed by the fact that the main girl managed to scale a toppling building and run away from monsters in heels. And manage to look fantastic throughout. There is so much to rant about with this movie, it was the most frustrating, stressful, angering experience I've ever had in a cinema. There were so many ""what the heck?""s and ""oh my gods"" and ""just END""s coming out of my exasperated body, that I felt like I'd run a marathon by the end. It was cheesy,unbelievable, these people just wouldn't die, the camera just kept rolling (12 hour battery life, survived helicopter crashes, alien fights, nuclear bomb...). I was expecting something different - expecting a psychological torment, expected to be scarred, heart in my mouth, expected to care about the characters, didn't expect to see the monsters, and none of these things happened. For a short movie, it dragged and dragged, by the end I was practically jumping out of my seat shouting obscenities at the screen. The whole audience were stunned into silence, not because there was a twist at the end to shock us into silence, but because they couldn't believe they sat through the entire film. The reviews on this site are hilarious because I agree so whole-heartedly with all the one star reviews - it's funny. But the weird thing is, despite declaring it was the worst film I have ever seen, and being so riled by it, I haven't stopped thinking about it, I can't stop talking about it, I feel united in my utter dislike of it, that actually, I guess, it is a pretty unique and special film. In a kind of I hate it so therefore I love it but I really do hate it kind of way.<br/><br/>If you can avoid paying full price and have nothing better to do, go and see this film and be prepared to hate it and feel very angry, but be prepared to spend hours talking about it afterwards and then not be able to forget about it in a hurry..."

The shaky style didn't affect my enjoyment one bit, and I think the film would have been less enjoyable had they used more conventional methods. One thing that blew me away was the sound effects and the rumbling in the cinema during the action sequences. It was breathtaking and I just didn't want it to end. Not too many loose ends tied up but that's the way these guys work, they want you to speculate, that air of mystery gives off a different feel to your average film.<br/><br/>A brave decision that really paid off in my opinion.

","Okay first things first i can see why people don't like it. The hand held camera business did make me feel a bit giddy at first, but after 5 minutes i completely forgot. The point of view from the hand held camera really lets you identify with the characters, and makes the film a lot scarier. I found myself actually wanting everyone to survive, while in most monster movies i find its just more fun when they die.<br/><br/>The sometimes shaky camera doesn't mean you never get to see anything interesting, and its not at all like Blair Witch- you do see some action. Lots.<br/><br/>The entire cast are superb actors, and the dialogue is realistic and exciting. The guy holding the camera gives the audience a few laughs with some quips, and not in a cheesy way either. As well as laughs you will get plenty of scares, and a real sense of claustrophobia.<br/><br/>As for those people complaining its unoriginal, of course it had similarities with other monster films because hey, it's got a monster in it. but i found it all fresh and original. blew my mind, well worth watching in the cinema."

","I think the other reviewer has missed the point of this project. It was not supposed to be a full story, merely a point of view seen through one video camera carried by a group of people in the middle of the city when all hell breaks loose. Of course the camera shakes about and points at odd things. If you were really confronted with what is in this movie you would run like hell most of the time too! I really liked the idea of telling the story of the main character's feelings for someone else by having remnants of an old recording on the camera. I felt that it came together nicely at the end. Sure, the movie left you wanting to know more about what was going on but that's one of the things I loved about it. Like the TV program LOST you were not fed information needlessly.

","Once it gets going the pacing is maintained with relentless intensity. The slowish intro is absolutely necessary in order to establish the context for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>To begin with, the soundtrack is exceptional, creating an involving atmosphere that draws you into every scene, and where appropriate, offering plenty of monster sized impact. It's really one of the stars of the film.<br/><br/>The characters are well played by a bunch of unknowns, who have all the attributes of real people, sometimes frustrating, at other times making the viewer feel truly sympathetic to their situation. (Thank god it wasn't Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise - or any of the other bunch of 'celebrity' actors that put you off going to the movies). Its well scripted too.<br/><br/>It is not obviously CGI heavy, though where it is used it is done very well. The general feel of the film is, well, imagine Blair Witch crossed with Alien crossed with a much darker version of Godzilla and set to a backdrop of 9-11 New York. Don't go expecting a light weight Emmerich movie, this is something much darker, and IMHO, better.<br/><br/>It does have a few failings, like a magic camcorder that is able to run the duration of the film on a single battery, and and at the same time provide a stellar surround soundtrack. You do need to suspend some belief, as to resolve it would probably require a move away from the first person perspective, which would change the whole feel of the film for the worse. <br/><br/>There is also the obvious omission during the film of any references to 9-11, though I guess one must be sensitive to such things."
"SophLOL","Null","0","1","5 February 2008"," Cloverfield - I'm still reeling over how amazing it is!
","Well, first of all, I went into see the film today already pretty excited due to all of the hype surrounding it, and watching the amazing trailer. Although, friends had said it was 'rubbish', but after I've seen the film myself, I couldn't disagree more! So, the beginning is a little slow, it's basically just setting the scene, making the whole thing seem realistic and introducing us to a few of the main characters; pretty boring if you ask me. But, - and excuse my bad grammar - as soon as the statue of liberties head comes crashing down to the streets of Manhattan, you get the eerie similarity between the events of September the 11th, and god, it's so realistic I felt like I was actually there. The whole film is so excellently clever, every aspect of it is completely amazing to me, but then again, I do study media so I know what to look for. So, this leads me onto a negative side to the film of Cloverfield.<br/><br/>For anyone who enjoys your run of the mill 'Hollywood' genre type film, where it depicts a story, and you get a beginning, middle and end; I pretty much guarantee you won't enjoy Cloverfield at all. There is no explanation as to where the monster came from, what it is, and what happened to anyone after the film or what even happened to Manhattan after the film. Instead, we are just given an insight into what would happen if a monster would attack such a major city as America, and not one part of it makes you think 'well that wouldn't happen like that'. Some bits, however, are a little strange; like the shameless endorsement of Nokia phones; or even when they tried the lifts as though you would take them up a toppling building anyway...<br/><br/>This film is something original, exciting, and not guaranteed to be everyone's cup of tea, but one thing is for sure; if you find the film industry to be very tiresome and boring nowadays, Cloverfield might just awaken your desire for modern film. I just hope to god no one tries making a film similar to it, or a 'part 2' is made just to explain what happened in the first one, like what they did to the poor 'Blair witch project'."

","If you have ripped this movie on a bad quality screener, then surely, this is barely watchable. But if you are in a any decent cinema with good sounds, this one will blow you away.<br/><br/>Don't believe people saying its bad. They either downloaded a horrible copy or hate the blair which (dogma) style this was filmed in.<br/><br/>For me this was very believable, and most characters made a very good performance. At times though, they seem alittle too unattached to the fact that they just barely survived an Alien like attack. Most people would be in deep panic and in a very distraught state of mind. I told myself that they would probably get some post traumatic stress out of it, but being able to ignore it up front.<br/><br/>Other than that, its a great movie. I absolutely love it."

","If you are looking for a film that has a similar edge to the Blair Witch Project then this is for you.<br/><br/>The movie is different from anything I've seen on the screens for a while. The hand held camera immerses you and gives it a sketchy realism, which is crucial to this film succeeding. At times I thought that the monster was in fact chasing me! The beginning of the film gives you the chance to meet the characters personality. If you are thinking the visual effects will be poor due to the camera, you are wrong. It is action packed all the way through. The rendering on the creature is photo realistic and a lot of money seems to have been spent modeling these characters.<br/><br/>The plot line is never given away to the audience and adds to the chaotic drama! I have spoken to many people and they all agree, the film is a must see. Some parts of the film trigger your survival mechanism and for that reason alone, I'm giving it a 9/10.<br/><br/>Watch it on a BIG screen!"

","I haven't really commented on any other movies but, if this films rating on here gets pulled down by people complaining of motion sickness, then it's obviously a good film. Basically rating a film down for providing the visceral gut wrenching feeling they set out for? I don't know. I can understand any comments about how poor the Blair Witch project was but this? Hmmm...<br/><br/>Well, that besides, it is the sound that made the film for me. You genuinely forget your in a cinema sometimes. The interaction between the people seems far more real than other movies. They spend most of the film high on adrenaline to really show any emotions and I give kudos to that.<br/><br/>Anyhow, this takes disaster movies to the next level for me. Leaving all others in the dust. It's a shame people are going to jump on the 1 star voting mark because they can't watch the film properly. Surely that would exempt you from rating?"
"mausar","8","0","2","5 February 2008"," A revolution in sci-fi movies
","This is a great movie, because it changes completely the perspective of sci-fi. We are used to watch monster movies (Godzilla, for example) from three different points of view: the monster, the army and some great hero who is trying to save the city from destruction. We don't care about the people who are under the main action. In a classical sci-fi movie, if the monster or a missile destroys a building, we never think about hundreds of screaming common individuals who are inside or under that building. If the monster or the artillery devastates cars, destroys houses and properties, we never think about people who lost their home and all their properties, we can't even imagine what can do or think someone who is suddenly surprised under fire and loses friends and relatives. We never think or care about it in a monster movie. But they are humans and not ants. They have their own lives, personal stories, passions, frustrations and courage. I asked it every time I watch a monster/sci-fi/super-hero movie. This is the first time I have had an answer: this movie shows us what could be reaction of common people (not heroes, not army commanders, not monsters) facing a sudden and unknown menace. It's a real revolution in sci-fi. And it's a necessary revolution, because of Youtube and modern digital technology. We are living the information-age and everybody can bring a camera, always and everywhere. Sci-fi has to simulate and re-create reality in surreal circumstances. And this is nowadays reality: everyone could be a journalist or a director with his or her camera. Look at amateur's videotapes of 9/11 or the combat cameras in the Iraq War: these are great events documented by ordinary people or private soldiers. If you imagine a fictional great event and you want to make it real, you can't re-create it with traditional means, as the great hero or army commander's perspective. You have to see it from the common people's perspective: common people armed with hand cameras and smart cells. This perspective doesn't mean that the plot and the screenplay become useless. Matt Reeves, the director, keeps a great role. He built complex and realistic characters and the screenplay is a high-standard horror movie, with some reference to the first Zombie (the scenes in deserted supermarkets and the task for survival in a hostile environment) and Alien (the attack in the Underground). The scenario is simply beautiful: just every particular is built with accuracy: the hall of the upper class building continues to transmit soft music, also during the tragedy, the alarms of cars start every time there were hit or shacked, the lights of the city change, all the security systems react to dangers. Of course, this movie is far from perfection and we can't consider it as a real masterpiece. The introduction, the party before the attack, is very realistic, but quite boring and there is some lack of realism: the cameraman recs too much, also in impossible situations. I can't rec when I risk to lose my life, or rec my friends when they are living a painful or intimate situation. A heavy wounded girl can't run and behave as a healthy person. The point of view is limited: only one camera. And this is very reductive. I wish I would have seen a puzzle made by lot of cameras used by different characters, from different perspectives to have a panoramic view of the event. These are mistakes and flaws and could be perfected. But, above all, this movie is a revolution. The next sci-fi movies can't ignore it."

","Imagine if Godzilla and Kraken had a baby you would get the monster from Cloverfield. I saw this movie in a tiny theater at a local mall, I highly recommend sitting in the back seats to prevent puking or getting puked on. Well let me explain the plot, the movie follows a group of 20 something year olds that journey through downtown Manhatten in search of a trapped friend (I''ll let you find out who it is on your own) as a giant monster runs amuck. These 20 something year olds not only face off against the giant monster but they also face crablike parasites that climb off the monster. With such a wild plot this movie could have fallen into a pit of clichés, sappy moments, and crappy one liners but it never even attempts these movie atrocities. The movie itself is very experimental even though the cinematographic style has been used before but it has never been used on an epic scale until Cloverfield. The shaky camera style made the cgi seem more realistic and less like Final Fantasy creatures. Some will argue that there is no character development in the movie but the whole movie is seen through the eyes of a guy holding a video camera. Now logically if u picked up a random video camera from the streets (I don't know why would you) and played back the video thats on it, the people in the video wouldn't explain their life stories unless they have the time to do a video memoir. On the whole movie seen through the eyes of one character, this makes the movie much more intimate then if it was told in third person with the ""eye of god"". Now beware (if you're a wuss) there are images similar to that of 9/11 in this movie, but these images are used to forward the movie and also gives it a creepier and familiar atmosphere. Cloverfield is very disorienting but this is good, since disasters themselves are disorienting. This makes movie seem realistic even if you don't expect to see a giant monster attack New York City tomorrow. People with short attention spans beware; even though the movie is about an hour and 20 minutes, there is much dialogue in the film but there are intense moments at critical parts of the movie. The dialogue itself is not dumb dialogue like in most horror movies. I gave this movie a solid three stars out of four or and 8 out of 10 (since I cant rate 7.5 out of 10) because I have never seen anything like it, I enjoyed it, and it left me wanting more even if the acting is a tiny bit shaky it still deserves three stars."
"rowlandy","7","0","1","4 February 2008"," Cloverfield - Review & Interpretation
","This review contains spoilers and is meant for people who have already watched the movie.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is an impressive movie technically; the hand held camera technique combined with high tech special effects feels so real. However, taken at face value, the plot is pretty much meaningless. A monster rampages through Manhattan, senselessly tearing down buildings and killing people. You're not told what it is, where it came from, why it's destroying the city or where it's planning to go next. At the end of the movie you are clueless too. Is this part of an invasion or a lonely stone age entity, awoken too soon from a deep slumber from the ocean floor and now has a bad headache? If so, why did it choose NYC?<br/><br/>To take this movie literally, there are no satisfactory answers to any of these questions. Forums are obsessing over where the monster came from, the ""slurpo"" connection, hidden clues, and Lost references to find answers. The viral marketing clips on youtube are telling. It is an oil drilling rig that gets destroyed. Factions are fighting over oil.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I chose an interpretation that makes sense to me and gives the movie a bit more depth. I see it as an analogue of the war on terrorism and in particular, the war in Iraq. <br/><br/>The movie starts with an earth shattering thud and a huge explosion in the downtown area of Manhattan, very near in location to the World Trade Centre. The attack on the Statue of Liberty is clearly meant to represent an attack on the US. The home video footage is similar to the footage taken by people during 9/11. The references to 9/11 are throughout the film. Examples include the way the Woolworths building collapses generating the dust clouds, subways halted and the fact people are leaving the city via the Brooklyn Bridge. These images all seem eerily familiar. The ""monster"" wants to kill as many people as possible and this is seen in the way it destroys the overcrowded bridge. It has a purpose.<br/><br/>The creature that appears to be born out of the explosion is seemingly impossible to kill. It represents the terrorist threat and in particular the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq it spurred. <br/><br/>You hear the camera operator (Hud) come up with a conspiracy theory that it's something the American government created, that somehow they are at fault. You see the momentary elation that the monster has been killed by the huge arsenal of bombing directed at it only to find the monster still on the rampage (compare that to the initial bombing of Iraq and how quick the war appeared to be over when in fact it was only the beginning of a long conflict). <br/><br/>The monster itself has these small offshoots that act independently of the main creature. These are synonymous with suicide bombers. You see one of the actors blow up after being bitten by one. <br/><br/>From the civilian population, there is a lot of confusion of why did this is happening, very similar to peoples thoughts after 9/11. Apparently, at the end of the movie credits, you hear that ""it's still alive"" (that part of the film needs to be played backwards to hear it  see youtube).<br/><br/>The other possibility is that I'm probably reading too much into this film and it's just another monster movie inspired by Godzilla . . ."

","Forget that the viewpoint has already been explored with Blair Witch... this film is a fantastic departure from the traditional method of film story telling.....<br/><br/>Forget that there is very little depth to the narrative, beyond the allusion to 9/11.... the power of the delivery is incomparably more intense than a similar narrative such as the recent War of the Worlds.<br/><br/>Forget that the actors are, as per Blair Witch, not particularly well known and that the focus of the storyline shifts interest slightly between characters .....we still become interested and concerned about the characters.<br/><br/>As you will know this is basically a hand held camera gimmick.....but taken to a new level...for instance...... in traditional film story - telling...when the camera focuses on something.... it is ""code"" for telling you to watch...this was taken to new heights by the film Cache.....but......with this film in a number of incidents the camera shot for a variety of reasons does not always focus on the action......and as a result the audience engagement is intensified.<br/><br/>Also unlike Blair Witch, there is a great deal of cgi going on but you only see it in passing because of the camera work....nonetheless, I am told that for a film maker to use cgi the camera must remain steady...therefore for what seems to be an amateurish presentation is actually taking professionalism in a totally different direction.<br/><br/>Cinema audiences have become incredibly sophisticated. We do not need men to wear white hats or black hats to tell us good guys or bad guys....we do not need exposition from third parties to follow complex story lines...although oft times we are given it...this film makes you work a little to join dots...but no-one in the audience I sat with piped up with ""what's happening""......there was enough happening to make that question redundant.<br/><br/>The ending will be disappointing for some people .....but I felt that it was exactly right for the narrative device and anything more would have appeared to be have been contrived.<br/><br/>At times I felt I was on a fairground ride travelling with 4g of force....but here's the thing...you go to a fairground and pay £2 for 2 minutes of physical excitement....with this film...you pay your £5 entrance fee and are subjected to 80 minutes of physical excitement, mental stimulation and nerve flaying brilliance.....<br/><br/>I am uncertain about the idea of a sequel....but I think that it is likely that the production team must already be streets ahead of the usual Hollywood thought processes and therefore we should rest easy and await with anticipation.<br/><br/>Go see this movie...but take travel sickness pills first."

In many ways its very cleverly done, and I take my hat off to the people behind it.<br/><br/>Things that I didn't like about it- Character build up at the start was weak, nobody came across particularly likable, so when they one by one started to be popped off I didn't really care that much.<br/><br/>Far too much camera shake, I fully appreciate the concept of the movie, but my stomach and eye's would have liked a more effective steady-cam facility on the camcorder.<br/><br/>The ending was very weak, not to spoil it for anyone, but not a great ending.<br/><br/>Things that I liked about it- The menacing factor, it was effectively frightening at times.<br/><br/>The p.o.v of the film, as I said it was certainly very much a unique perspective to watch a monster movie from.<br/><br/>The effects and the monster, both considering the budget constraints where both satisfyingly good.<br/><br/>Overall I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10, not a great movie but certainly a good movie.

","This movie is unique because it's styled as a film from a personal camcorder. You're watching the movie through the camcorder. Unlike a film being made by a professional camera person, a personal camcorder is typically prone to constant motion unless it's on a tripod. And that's exactly what happens in the movie. So, you might not want to sit too close to the screen if you're prone to motion sickness.<br/><br/>It basically begins at a going-away party, but turns into a run-for-your-life drama as some young people try to escape from a monster attacking New York City. (I guess it had been too long since a monster movie with an attack on the Big Apple. The last alien attack movie was only a few years ago with ""War of the Worlds,"" starring Tom Cruise.) The camcorder video that is the movie follows their escape. Unlike other movies, there is no shift in settings. The focus is only on their attempt to escape."
"NovemberKin","8","0","2","4 February 2008"," Cloverfield a mystery still
","I have been following some of the hype surrounding this movie since the end of last years summer, when people where questioning, right here on this board I might add, what was this monster Godzilla, Ctuhulu (or however you spell it) or even a popular belief a lion (seriously what the freak was up with that!?).<br/><br/>It spurred a lot of interest in me because not only am I of nature a curious person but I also happen to like what J.J. Abrams has been producing and thinking along those lines I knew that we probably wouldn't get to know what this monster was or neither would any plot points be revealed (but hey as the curious person I am I tried my beast to get a teeny bit of information cause let's face it, it was a long wait).<br/><br/>To be honest while sitting in the theater I couldn't help but to feel this story wouldn't be concluded, in the sense that we are used to. There would still be questions unanswered (We are talking about a guy producing LOST remember), but the main story will be delivered not like it's done now a days with movies like Matrix Reloded and POTC: Dead Man's Chest. We get a sense of closure.<br/><br/>Yes, we do not get to know what the monster is, alien or submerged behemoth that clearly woke up on the wrong side of the bed. We do not know if it is defeated or not in the end. We don't even get a good glimpse of it. But watching the movie I found that it would ruin it putting in such information in, people tend to forget that this movie does not focus on the monster but a certain group of people, about loss and hope. Not giving up and staying together in a situation that can only be explained as surreal and terrifying. The threat of not knowing what's going on is a lot more unnerving then knowing what is going on. People fear what they do not know.<br/><br/>I for one felt satisfied with this movie, it gave me everything I was promised, I do not care for it's creation but for the people running away from it. A hand held camera was exactly what this movie needed, it made the camera a person in this whole ordeal, making an objective camera we'd just get nice objective shot that esthetically may be beautiful but lack the soul, you do not need to focus on everything or what can be initially meaningless (the monster). This is what for me exactly the 98 movie Godzilla did wrong they focused more on the monster then the people.<br/><br/>Forget the term monster film and see it for what it is, do not search the monster but the bonds that tie the characters together."

","Lets start by saying I'm not a huge fan of JJ Abrhams. Lost became an instance of Lost interest. So besides all the hype I wasn't expecting much other than to be sadly disappointed by another of his ventures that didn't deliver. However, I am surprised and glad to say I was in for a pleasant surprise. Many have moaned that the film wasn't long enough at only 1hr 30mins. However, in my opinion this was ample to tell the story anymore and the same people would have said it was long winded. You are relaxed into the film with about 20mins of character development. As soon as the monster strikes you understand you have been lulled into a false state of security and roller-coaster has just begun. I felt on edge through out the film as as the film continued. Contrary to what people have said you see plenty of monstrous goings on at least just enough to make it interesting. The realism of stupid American to stupid heroic nonsense just added to the realism.... overall this film was a lot of fun and highly entertaining and having the lack of a Hollywood happy ending was an added bonus."

","Rarely if ever does a film leave me giddy and exited the way i did as a kid - but Cloverfield did just that. When i was a kid I remember the feeling of leaving the cinema and wanting to rush back in and see it again or tell all your pals about it.Anyone of my generation remembers the heroin high of leaving star wars or superman and thinking that life would never be the same again - indeed how could film get any better - any more exciting? Of course now I am a grizzled weary 38 and have seen many hundreds of movies I do not quite get that wet the bed excited but Cloverfield delivers all that visceral wow and all that white light of all engulfing emotional high that I remember as a Kid. JJ dipped his toe in the big scary monster in Lost but here he pulls it out of the shadows and puts it centre stage for a roller coaster horror ride of damn near perfect cinema. Go see - go get excited - go hide behind your hands and go wet yourself. Godzilla hang your head in shame - King Kong go peel a banana- the real deal has stomped into town and cinema is a better place for it.

","Well the hype and rumours have stopped now as Clovefield is officially out everywhere. It had an impressive advertising campaign to say the least, creating media speculation as to what the hell it was, (with it's teaser trailer being released before Transformers in the US, giving away very little of the movie, not even a title). Was it about HP Lovecraft's Cthullu? Or Voltron, or another Godzilla movie, a spin off of Lost. Well it's funny that after all this, after all this teasing and hype and everything else surrounding the buzz of this movie, it turns out that all it is, is a monster movie. Good thing it's a bloody good one then.<br/><br/>The big question is has this daring and frankly brilliant advertising campaign worked? Does the movie live up to the hype (let's remember that hype is the number 1 killer of any big movie)? The answer is a resounding yes! It's bizarre in the fact that it takes the already used premise of the ""found footage"" (used most famously with the Blair Witch Project) yet manages to make it seem fresh and clever all over again.<br/><br/>The film opens with a black screen with the words ""Property of the US Government"" slapped on it. We are then told, that what we are watching is footage that has been found from ""Area site 447"" (Or something) ""Formally known as central park"" and regards the ""Multiple sighting of case designated Cloverfield"". What we then watch for the next hour and twenty (also like Blair Witch, this film is very brief) is camcorder footage intended as a document of a going away party for our protagonist Rob. The party is rudely (and shocking) interrupted by a monster the size of a skyscraper. From then on in, all hell breaks loose as Rob and his friends attempt to survive whilst the party's camera man (Hud) documents the ensuing events.<br/><br/>It's quite a ride! The last time I felt to tense watching a movie was when I saw United 93 at the cinema! The reason this film works is because we know very little about what's going on. Any bits of valuable information (of which there is hardly any) is found out as the characters do. We are just being taken along with them, experience the frenetic horror as they try to survive and when some of the group die (as the inevitably do in these movies) we really feel for them. These are human characters, not action archetypes. The best move this film made, along with Blair witch and united 93 was to use unknowns. We empathise with them more than a star coz, well, they could be you and me.<br/><br/>The monster itself is odd to describe as we only see it in small bits with the only full body shot being saved for the final moments of the film. It ain't pretty and it's nasty. There's always some element in big monster movies where the creature has a sympathetic streak. Not in this movie. This creature is spooked and is taking it's anger out on the city. We see footage of the thing taking down helicopters, pushing over buildings, little parasite like beasties jumping off it and attacking people. It's quite disturbing sometimes too as the group watch their best friends die (one particularly nasty moment sees one of them exploding).<br/><br/>This is just a great, visceral experience and not for those who suffer easily from motion sickness. The beauty of this film is that we know very little and I find the idea that there's a sequel in the works a bit depressing. It should be left as a stand alone film and go down in history as landmark in film. If you don't feel physically and emotionally drained by the end of the film (trust me, emotions run high all through this) then you are a cold person. This is a brilliant film and, whilst it has it's minor flaws (as do all great films) it needs to be remembered as one of the best monster movies of all time. Original, fresh, heartbreaking and relentless are just a few words to describe this film but only one need be used: Brilliant! .<br/><br/>5/5"

I must say I am quite shocked you did not expect a film from this JJ Abrhams to end this way.<br/><br/>First up how can the characters sum up the plot line the reasons for the attack etc... If they are quite possibly dead. Second How much character development do you expect from a character for something that takes place over a time period of roughly 7 hours in a city being attacked by a Giant monster not to mention it's little buddies. I really did not expect to see Rob go back and tell us about his childhood and how he got to this point. If you also though it was a very good action move why the 4 stars??? Seems like you just want to go against the grain because you didn't like the ending to what is obviously a set up to a sequel.<br/><br/>Now the review it self. This was as mentioned above a very good but not quite Brilliant action movie. The tempo of the film is what really sold it for me yes it was short and left huge amounts of the story untold but as I said who would ecpect anything else from JJ Abrahams. Plus the Sequel that is apparently in the works or may yet tell us the story from someone else's angle. If you are looking for what is simply an exciting fun film that isn't going to tax you too much go see this film."

","It is one day since i seen this one and i still hear explosions in my ears. This movie should get Oscar for the sound.<br/><br/>But director's task was also immense as he had to make movie in constrains of an amateur camera guy but keep the action and everything flow consistently and understandable for the viewer. He's achieved more than that as movie looks believable and action takes you with the characters trying to survive that mess together.<br/><br/>I am not an expert in CGI. But I can always tell when effects realistic and when they are not. E.g. in Harry Potter CGI is to cartoonie. This movie has realistic effects. So in this way movie just perfect.<br/><br/>I gave movie 10 which is very rare for me. Because sound, video, characters, idea and all other stuff that makes good movie are perfect and in synergy with one another."

","Beyond being a sci-fi movie, I had no idea what this movie was about. Well, after a lengthy character buildup (which was pretty good), the sci-fi, action and thrills kicked in. It was great - suspense and mystery all the way through. It's been a while since I've gasped at stuff on-screen, so I consider this a job well done.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a lengthy party where we get introduced to the main characters and get a bit of their personalities and background. Everything is interrupted when a disaster seems to be occurring in the city's center. Unfortunately, the love interest of one of main characters is located there - and he, along with a few others, set out to reach her.<br/><br/>I'm being purposefully vague because the less you know about this movie, the more you'll enjoy it. It isn't ""perfect"" - there are things one can gripe about, but who cares - it was a great experience. Whether you like sci-fi movies or not, this film is worth checking out."

","Well, i was going to give the movie a 5 out of 10 for the ending, however after reading the other reviews i changed my mind. Very creative style of directing, they switch the style of the movie around from a third person perspective back to a first person perspective, but, unlike in Doom or the unheard of and wildly unpopular ""a day in the life of.."" star trek series they take it up a notch and put it in a familiar handicam tone, so the moviegoer can relate to the action( no sense in bringing a huge moviecamera with you when running right?). Anyway, i liked how the entire movie after the party was a continuous ride through constant obstacles and loss, they try to run, but they lose people, they try going back, more die, they try running again. <br/><br/>The monster too, I loved that it wasn't just a 1 dimensional thing like Godzilla, go in, smash city (rawr!), leave. Instead, it looked a bit more advanced dropping off drones in it's wake, apparently for recon and attack. The monster's movements also, not random at all, I was just sitting there going ""omg what tank does this thing not step on?"" and jeez, it even took advantage of a cloud of smoke at one point, you'd never see Godzilla do that.<br/><br/>Overall, i'd say it's a pretty good movie, though they could've done better on the ending, I think maybe they would've been better off with the cameraman doing the ""outro"" than the hero, though if that had happened they would've had the ""hero"" getting chewed apart pushing the cameraman out of the way, bleh, they should do that for the director's cut. I just say that cuz it's out of character for the guy in question to suddenly turn around and grab the camera and do a confessional when the guy who's main priority it was is gone."
"MamaPapaXP","9","0","3","3 February 2008"," I was genuinely gob-smacked...
","Where to begin? Firstly,a quick nod to all the forum flamers and negative reviewers here: Yes, this is a VERY shaky film and could induce motion sickness in some, but that is not a reason to mark a film down. If the motion detracted from the storytelling, I could understand but, in my humble opinion, the camera in this film comes off as a character in it's own right. At least, unlike a certain other film, the camera's picture quality is utterly perfect for most of the film and, also unlike that other film, you get to see a fair bit of this film's 'witch'...<br/><br/>From the moment this retrieved camcorder footage begins, you are fed crumbs that come together neatly later on. Rob films his new sweetheart, Beth. All of a sudden, (as this is a typical linear recording,) it's a month later and Rob's brother has acquired his camcorder and is unwittingly about to record Rob's friend's goodbye messages over these earlier memories of what turns out to be a now soured relationship. These messages are chillingly echoed at the end of the movie, as are the occasional breaks in the current recording, revealing some of the too-short time Rob spent with Beth.<br/><br/>After just enough time to become acquainted with the major characters, Cloverfield appears. And what an appearance. If you want to know what it feels like to be caught in the middle of a surprise terrorist attack, a-la 9/11, I imagine the feelings I experienced by proxy through Hud the camera guy's perspective, and those around him, would not be too far off the mark.<br/><br/>I will say little about the beast, except that you DO see it. Not too often and not too much of it. (What person is going to run with a camcorder toward such a thing, with buildings collapsing around them and soldiers running amok?) But later on, you are rewarded with some honestly brilliant creature effects, or at least you are convinced of such because you think it is being filmed live, with a camcorder... (...all of a sudden, the decision to use this type of camera makes PERFECT sense.)<br/><br/>There isn't too much story from here on in. The need to survive is easily enough to drive you onward, but the aforementioned sour relationship comes to the fore here to add a little bit of humanity to the mix and, conveniently, give our victims a reason to actually get closer to Cloverfield while everyone else is bugging out.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting was appropriately tense, camera-work (don't laugh,) was excellent, and the special effects some of the most 'realistic' I think I have ever seen. There are a couple of oddities, such as the nasty Nokia product placement throughout certain scenes, (BAD idea, so obvious, the damn camcorder moves at one point to position the subject on the far left of the screen and allows the centre/right to be filled with a massive nokia poster on a wall! Another scene has a crowd quieting in the lower half of the screen to allow Rob, in the upper centre, to give a speech, and guess what someone in the crowd holds over the heads of everyone else so they can record his speech? Slap bang in the middle of the cinema screen? A bright pink nokia! Stop it!) There was also the very odd 'Dolby Digital' moment that I won't spoil, but when you get there, you'll know it!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this one still pushes all my buttons and I have finally found a reason to buy an HDTV and HD-DVD.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"bigwill3333","6","0","1","3 February 2008"," Well.........hard to say about this one
","Is this a good film? This is a hard question to answer for this film.<br/><br/>First of all, i have to admit i was hooked by the trailer, and cant wait for the actual film. As i come out of the cinema, i was thinking, do i want to buy the DVD for this.... probably not, and seeing it with 5 mates, the opinion is divided 3:3...So i broke down the Pros and Cons of the film for you to decide for yourselves Pro: The filming techeque and the story line is good, put you in the middle of the action, and in within a short while, you do feel like you are running with the actors and in the middle of the action.<br/><br/>The extras around you did a great job and make you sense the panic, and you do start think "" oh i wont do this if i am in their shoes"" There is a few scene where you are like looking at the 9/11 documentary while you are on ground level.<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT A CHEAP GOZZILA KNOCK OFF... it runs in a completely different storyline.<br/><br/>CON: now I am not one who NEED every details explain, but i would at least like SOME. and yet you get none. The only certaintity you know is what is the fate of the main character. There are more questions than answers with this film. like where did the thing comes from etc...why do people die from bite? You can just feel that a Cloverfield 2 is in the pipeline.<br/><br/>There are some stupid things that these characters did which you goes "" you deserve to die because you are stupid"" like.... going in to the subway tunnel without thinking getting a torch? Also running around with a crowbar, but hey this is USA, surely there is a gun somewhere?"

","Too many of the negative comments come from people who appear to have misunderstood the idea behind the film. If you want to see a monster film showing a wider viewpoint, a clearly explained plot, and a nice neat Hollywood ending, see Godzilla (actually don't, it's cr*p), Jaws, Alien, or any one of the hundreds of such films churned out since the original King Kong. Cloverfield was always conceived as something different. The whole film is seen from the point of view of only a few people, who have no real clue what is happening and experience the mayhem first hand, filmed on their Camcorder, and as such the action is, for the audience, very realistic and believable. Echoes of Orson Welles' famous ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast are clear and the film is far superior to the rather annoying ""Blair Witch Project"". As in that film there is the feeling throughout that, if I were the protagonist, I'd have ditched the damn camera and run like hell within the first ten minutes - it is simply unbelievable that he would keep filming at some points. Nonetheless, a terrificly successful experiment in making something unlike any other film you've ever seen. Treat it like a theme park ride rather than Godzilla 2 and you'll be hugely impressed."

The monster to me was terrifying the film was really only watchable when it was somewhere on screen.<br/><br/>I personally never felt nauseous and believe that the camera gave just the right amount of screen time it needed to to any subject.<br/><br/>In summary, it wont win any Oscars, but it will sure keep you up at night!"
"Patrickman","10","0","5","2 February 2008"," The Best Monster Horror Movie Ever!
","Yesterday, I saw the movie Cloverfield. I didn't have much idea about it and I have only seen bits and pieces of trailers and videos from the internet and TV. Not expecting much, I decided to watch it. I'm not much of a horror movie fan myself (the last good horror film that I saw prior to this one is Ju-On: The Grudge (original Japanese version the American version sucked ass big time) some 2 or 3 years ago. Anyway, I have been intrigued by this movie since late last year. And I have seen it at last the best monster horror movie ever made. Why is it the best, you ask? Well, there are lots of factors to be considered for it to be the best. First reason, it is very unique. I have never seen a movie this cool before. When I say cool I mean it put my adrenaline level on high for most of the movie (starting when the monster started shaking New York City (Yes, New York City AGAIN this city has been destroyed countless times before in movies!) and everyone started running for his life). Secondly, the use of a single hand held video camera is very effective in showing realism while documenting everything that has been happening in the movie, as well as the different emotions of the characters (which induced motion sickness to lots of people watching the film due to instability of the camera especially when the person handling the camera is running I wonder what it feels like watching it while sitting on a motion simulation seat). Thirdly, there is no musical score in the movie (adding to the realism because when you are being attacked by a monster, there is no musical score to hype you up, is there?). Fourthly, there are no big time movie stars in movies (because I'm tired of seeing big movie stars running for their lives it doesn't happen in real life). And lastly, the monster the film would not be a monster horror film without the big ass, city-whoopin' monster and the coolest thing about the film is the monster was just the backdrop of the entire movie and the real ass kicker is the people being attacked by the monster; how they coped with the situation and handled their emotions amidst the peril staring them right at their faces (the monster was only shown in glimpses especially in the middle of the movie when it was being attacked with tanks and missiles and whatnot by the military while it wrecks buildings and dropping little monsters and it was shown in all its horrifying glory only once near the end (the monster stared at the person handling the camera straight in the eye, before trying to eat and kill him)).<br/><br/>Let's talk a little about the technical aspects of the movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>The use of a single hand-held video camera: as I said earlier, this technique gave the movie realism like no other film on existence. The disorienting rawness of everything being presented in the movie is just great. I felt like I was there with the people running and dying and I almost felt the terror and fright that the people were feeling. The movie The Blair Witch Project was used the same technique some years ago (I have never seen that movie, though) and people were somehow fooled into thinking that they were indeed watching a real life documentary about witches and stuff. The movie War of the Worlds also came into my mind while watching this movie, but it was not presented in first person point of view so that movie is lame compared to this one. Tom Cruise doesn't show enough rawness. - The lack of a musical score: the movie was either very quiet (when the characters stops for short time to rest on the subway station and no one is talking and the only sound heard is the thumping of the monster's feet on the streets above) or very loud (when buildings crash, missiles are fired, and the monster roars). All sounds seem raw and spine-chilling. No strings or winds or drum beats to perk them up. - The CGI: all the monsters (the big one and its little tiny versions) and Lady Liberty's head and buildings toppling over and bridges collapsing and the stealth bombers and helicopters and tanks and people bursting were all rendered in post production. Well, what's new with that, you ask? Everyone's doing that nowadays. In this movie, since everything is captured using the video camera, everything seems real. The blending of the real characters and CGI is so seamless that it's hard to know which one is fake and which one is really happening (this is a movie so everything is fake, but you get my point). - The length of the movie: the movie is not overly long (hell, it's not long at all; the entire movie ran for less that 1 and half hours) but with all the excitement and realism and monster goodness didn't let me down. I didn't feel like hanging in the air and cheated. The length of the film is just enough to show the drama and terror and all in between.</li></ul><br/><br/>Over-all, this movie is a real must-see. If you want a very unique film with realism like no other and a great adrenaline rush, this is the movie for you."
"Rautus","10","0","2","2 February 2008"," A Great modern Monster Movie
","There has been some really great classic monster movies like King Kong and Gojira, Cloverfield is actually a pretty great modern Monster movie. At first I wasn't sure about this film, the trailer looked interesting but sometimes the trailer can make the film look better than the actual film, so me and a few friends went to the cinemas to check it out and see what it was like. When Cloverfield started I still wasn't sure if this was going to be a good film, I thought the shaky camera was going to get annoying. Once the action started to get going the movie started to become really good, I liked the way they made the Creature so mysterious and gradually let you see more of it has the movie progressed. The camera could get a little tedious at times and could make the movie a little confusing because you can't see what's going on clearly but it didn't spoil the movie too much for me. The Creature itself was kind of cool, it's a giant monster but it can also produce these little creatures. Cloverfield does have some great atmospheric scenes like in the subway and the building, the way it's just filmed with an ordinary camera makes it more creepy. Cloverfield doesn't really explain the origins of the Monster but I guess they left that window open for the viewers imagination, the ending was little bit of a disappointment. We was expecting a little bit more, a few other people in the cinemas even stated that as they walked out at the end. Cloverfield did have some good effects like with the Monster and the little creatures, the destroyed city and the statute of liberty head.<br/><br/>The film sees a group of people throwing a party for a friend who's going to Japan, suddenly after a while they experience something like an earthquake. They quickly leave the apartments and find a huge explosion happen in the city then the head of the Statue of Liberty flying over and landing near them, soon they go through the city and discover that a huge Monster is attacking Manhatten. Instead of following the other survivors the main four go off to help their friend who's stuck in her apartment, as they go on they get caught up in a battle with the army and the Monster, they hide out in the subway and decide to go through the tunnel where they soon get attacked by these creatures that drop off the giant Monster. They escape from the Creatures and hide in one of the rooms, they decide to leave and continue going but soon meet the army who take them to a temporary base. They discover that one of them was bitten by the creatures and is taken away and the mysterious infection kills her, the others are told that an evacuation chopper is going to pick up the survivors at 6 o'clock, they then decide to find their friend and try and make their way to the evacuation point. But the Monster is destroying the city and it's only a matter of time before it runs into their way and gets them.<br/><br/>Cloverfield is a great modern take on the Monster movie genre that tries to do something new and original. The shaky camera may make some people feel a bit queasy but the film itself is a great Monster movie that should be seen. Check this out. 10/10"
"nafcowell","10","0","1","2 February 2008"," A great piece of art
","I saw the trailer for this from an internet comic show back last July. It really intriged me, and ever since then i've been following it. Yes, i was there for the 'it's Godzilla!' days, and i was there when everyone thought the title was 'monsterous', ahh great days. We knew so litte! So today, me and my friends go to see this film. After a shovel full of crappy sequels and action Hollywood movies last year (i had high hopes for them all), Shrek the third, Spiderman 3, and Order of the Phoenix... this film really restored my faith. It had really sad moments (like when the ""main dude"" had to tell his mother that his brother had died in the havoc) and the acting was always pretty great. I think that the method used to make this film (hand held camera) made what would otherwise be cheesy moments (such as 'i'm coming with you' 'no, you have to go!')un-noticeable.<br/><br/>The effects were great, and i'm SO glad they didn't show us the monster in the trailers, because the excitement for trying to find it in the film made watching it more fun (later on in the movie the monster was more visible).<br/><br/>I'm not well known on JJ Abram's work, but now, after this piece of art, i'm going to watch his take on Star Trek - i'm an official Star Trek hater, but this film has inspired me to see his version of it.) Thank you JJ - you've restored my faith in movies. Let's hope that the Dark Knight (the next film i plan to see) keeps up the great movie trend of 2008..."

"simonparker1990","9","0","1","2 February 2008"," Who gives a damn about Godzilla anymore?
","Many months ago I sat at my computer screen and watched the very first trailer for Cloverfield, the trailer that showed a mysterious attack on New York and ended with a shot of the Statue of Liberty's head being thrown through the air and hitting the ground in front of the camera. I have to say, despite many people going absolutely mad about it, I didn't really know what to make of it. Sure I practically pencilled in the release date on my calendar just to see what the hell it was, but I genuinely wasn't sure about the whole thing. Then the second trailer and endless hype arrived, once again it guaranteed a seat in the cinema for me, but I still just didn't truly buy into the hype. I admit I half expected Cloverfield to suck, I really did. The hand-held camera thing looked like a five second wonder and the I just didn't think it'd live up to the astronomically high expectations. Well today I finally saw Cloverfield, and it is an absolute success! This is a re-invention I never thought possible, sure the good old fashioned monster flicks like Godzilla were fun, but after so many films where the generals shout orders and the President debates what to do about the creature, you get sick of it. Cloverfield takes a more risky and far more fulfilling approach by putting us head first into the situation. We see and hear everything from the average persons perspective, what makes this even more successful is the fact that the characters seem real. They're likable, they're believable and they are undoubtedly the best characters in a monster movie I have ever seen! This movie is just a non-stop thrill ride, the minute the attack starts you will be on the edge of your seat! Sure at first we barely see the monster, we get a couple of quick glimpses, but the movie works in terrifying because we don't see it. Once you see the monster it gets even better! Cloverfield only gets a 9/10 for one reason, I'm not sure if it will work as well second time. This is so close to getting a 10/10, and once I see it again next week I might even up the rating.<br/><br/>Okay lets go onto the performances, let me start by saying there is nobody famous in this movie at all. And that's part of the beauty of the whole thing, you can relate to these people more because they aren't Tom Cruise and Angelina Jolie running through the streets. The main characters, I suppose as its from his perspective, is Hudd played by T.J. Miller, however he is off-screen for the majority of the film. Still he is hilarious with some of his comments he makes during the film. Michael Stahl-David is the next biggest character and the one we see on-screen for the majority of the film. He plays Rob, and he is the most believable and brilliant character of the bunch. His story is superbly executed and oddly touching. Just watch the scene where he has a phone call in a subway station, its hard to watch it so sad. Jessica Lucas delivers a killer performance as Lily, a very great character who once again goes through a lot during the course of the movie. Lizzy Caplan as Marlena is great although a tad underused, however saying that she has one extremely memorable scene towards the final third, trust me you will know it when you see it. Mike Vogel, whose past credits include Poseidon, is great although once again underused.<br/><br/>Well I suppose the big question everyone wants answered is how was the monster? Or more specifically what does it look like? I absolutely refuse to spoil what the monster looks like, I'll just say it doesn't look like Godzilla. The monster is just brilliant, when I first saw it I was a bit unsure, but when its seen up close the monster looks very cool. I also very much appreciated the fact that the monster is never explained, we know as much about it at the beginning as we do the end. And I loved that, its nice for a movie to have a of bit mystery surrounding it. The movie also succeeds with the way it is shot, after seeing the movie you will never again worry about hand-held camera movies. It works superbly and I cannot picture the movie in any other way. It puts you head first in the action, the scene where the army attacks is thrilling as a result of this! Also it makes you feel more sympathy for the characters as you actually do feel like you a apart of their little gang wandering round the streets. The movie is action packed, tense and just thrilling. Sure its not incredibly smart and sure there is the odd movie it feels a bit cheesy. But in general this is a short, sharp punch of a movie which is an incredible cinema experience.<br/><br/>Cloverfield might not be perfect, but its sure as hell entertaining. Its one of the best monster movies ever made and very much worth paying the admission fee for. I cannot believe I am saying this but believe the hype, this is something that just has to be watched!"
"perchrc","9","0","1","2 February 2008"," Intensely real
","""Cloverfields"" plot can be compared to catastrophic films such as ""War of The Worlds"" and ""Godzilla."" However, this one has much more to it than those do. <br/><br/>I've heard that people have been known to vomit in the theater during this movie. Although I didn't, I also felt fairly unwell at some points. I don't think it's that much about the unsteady camera, but rather that it feels so extremely real.<br/><br/>With a regular angle, this movie would be far below average in my opinion, and I doubt that I would've liked it as much if I watched it on a small-screen TV. That being said, the effects and naturalistic human behavior is amazing. I really recommend seeing ""Cloverfield"" in a theater."

","Scary fun! The cryptic trailers delivered an efficient thriller in Cloverfield. While it has gotten a lot of flak for the believability factor (hello, it's a monster movie) and for the shaky cam visual style ala Blair Witch Project, the audience anticipation has a great deal to do with the reception of the film (i.e. if you have no imagination, you will not enjoy Cloverfield).<br/><br/>Just like Godzilla was successful having been released right after the war, as it was used as a symbol of helpless doom, Cloverfield resonates with audiences and becomes relevant in light of terrorism. I was just hoping they wouldn't show the monster so much because just glimpsing parts of it is more terrifying than seeing it for what it is because seeing it in its entirety wasn't as frightening for me as, say, the creatures in Alien.<br/><br/>As for the camcorder cinematography, it does take getting used to. I usually get dizzy quickly, but I find that it helped to involve myself in the movie by imagining I was there, too. Silly, eh? But it sure beats motion sickness!"

","A giant monster attacks New York, and three friends try to survive it. Thats all the movie is. Nothing more, nothing less. And that's not a bad thing. It's not meant to be a winding story with twists around every corner. It's meant to be a fun, simple story. The acting buy pretty much a bunch of unknown actors and actresses is really great. They didn't overplay it, and they made it believable that a monster is attacking. The story isn't entirely original, but its great none the less. The special effects are amazing,and the monster is very unique.<br/><br/>In my opinion and from what i've read, the majority of people who don't like this movie are usually the people who like every little thing in a movie explained in extreme detail or people who need the movie to be as realistic as possible. If you're a person like this, let me warn you. Most likely, you will not like this film. There's no scientist who pops up randomly and explains the monsters existence and explains why it's attacking New York. And this movie is less than unrealistic. Just think about what its about.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was highly entertaining. And that's all it was made to do. Entertain. Its not supposed to supply you with a complex story line.

"villanwilson87","9","0","3","1 February 2008"," The finest picture monster movie of all time!
","In my time of watching films nearly all my life, I have never witnessed a film like this. Before the film was released, there was this big hype of potential, and a massive marketing scheme for the release date of this film, know-one never seen a big budget monster film, or about the monster itself because the film was kept secret. People either saying it is going to be another War Of The Worlds or Godzilla or just another promising movie becoming a disappointment. <br/><br/>And after watching this film, I have never witnessed something so striking and ground-breaking. This is a film that you will never forget because it is different, very different. <br/><br/>There has been many similar monster movies in the past, but this film flips all of them easily. The story is basically simple and something very clever thanks to the brilliance of J.J. Abrams and an unknown Matt Reeves. The film opens up with the main characters party before he leaves for Japan, and we then watch and try and solve who are the main characters with ease. Then the monster arrives with one of the most memorable action sequences to date with an explosion and the Statue of Liberty's head on a main street in New York, and yet we still haven't seen the monster yet which makes it even more terrifying. <br/><br/>Then the Carnage begins with a group of people and one person holding the camera throughout the rest of the movie, whilst all of them are picked off one by one randomly and quite horrifically. <br/><br/>The camera work is disorientating but at the same time very realistic and this what makes the film very clever, because it feels like you are there with the survivors and also watching the camera flick to the side and catching glimpses of the enormous and quite breathtaking, most terrifying monster you will see. When watching this film, bizarrely you start to think that this could actually happen with the way that the civilians react to the arrival and the military throwing everything they have at the beast but to no use. There is also other great spectacular sequences in the film, either the Brooklyn bridge sequence, military fighting and stopping the monster whilst it creates massive and amazing destruction on the city on several accounts, and in one sequence which is so scary (reminiscent of Blair Witch Project) in the tunnel sequence where you will move not one part of your body until it's over. <br/><br/>On a budget of only thirty million dollars, this is a triumph in Sound design, camera work, and obviously the C.G.I. on the monster. The film is ground-breaking, moving, funny, shocking, spectacular action sequences that will live long in the memory. This is what Abrams and Reeves set out to do and did it in some style. This film was made for the silver screen and it's cinematic genius at it's best. <br/><br/>One of the greatest films ever created and one that is a classic within it's genre."

","I just came back from the cinema and this is going in the top 5 favourite movies in my personal list. It was amazing. I couldn't really ask for anymore. Every second of it was interesting and it just never got boring! It definitely lived up to the hype.<br/><br/>Personally, I really do not understand the negative comments on this movie. First of all, not enough monster footage? I thought there was enough to see what it was. Why would there be lots of footage anyway? They're running AWAY from the monster, not towards it. And second of all, I felt fine throughout the movie. I DID consider Dramamine, but decided to just watch it without.<br/><br/>Also, people that are saying that there is no ending. That's not true. I loved the ending. The fact that Beth said ""I had a really good day"" is supposed to be ironic. I thought it was an excellent touch.<br/><br/>All in all, I' think I might go watch this again. It's that good."
"thesandfly77","8","0","2","1 February 2008"," Naysayers Completely Miss The Point
","A couple of things which will help you chart my review:<br/><br/>1) I hated the Blair Witch Project<br/><br/>2) Did I mention the above?<br/><br/>Now, to get the motion sickness issue dealt with: Put yourself in a time of trauma, some disastrous 911-style event and imagine the camera-work you are capable of.<br/><br/>Yes, it's all over the place, yes it's frequently difficult to have exact clarity as to what's going on. . . And yes, if it weren't for the above two points this movie would not work at all.<br/><br/>As it is, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly.<br/><br/>Intense is a word that's used in many reviews here and that fits the bill perfectly. The immersion and sense of place is perfect.<br/><br/>Indeed, I suspect - quite strongly - that Cloverfield's style owes a little to the video-gaming FPS (First Person Shooter) genre, BUT do not let that drift your mind towards cheesy cannon-fodder shoot-'em ups, instead think of the much more sophisticated and adult 'Half-Life 2' PC series.<br/><br/>This, for those unfamiliar, is a tremendous compliment in that never before has a PC game managed to create such a sense of immersion and suspension of disbelief, and nor has a movie before mirrored that interactive sense of involvement. <br/><br/>Half-Life 2 sets the player in an alternative near-future where government dealings with extra-dimensional beings has resulted in the collapse of society and the imposition of a totalitarian regime whilst the cities are infested with all sorts of nasties - and in Cloverfield the smaller parasitical creatures which drop off the monster and scuttle around the streets and subways are a direct lift of Half-life 2's 'antlions'.<br/><br/>Indeed, the bleakness of the movie continually drew me to the HL2 gaming experience - there is no saccharine salvation here, just the plain horror of the attack and the ever-perilous dilemma of the characters, into which the viewer is also thrust through the first-person perspective with excitement cranked up after an initial domestic scene that lulls you into a false soap-opera storyline which is cut abruptly and amusingly short with a - literal - bang.<br/><br/>Too many complainers are hung up on the camera style. But there's no Cloverfield if there's no shaky cam. It's realism come to town, beautifully executed and completely understandable. <br/><br/>In fact, as the film wears on I found myself looking for compromise in the shots, scene to scene, awaiting the inevitable third-person palliative for the groaning masses, the shot out of synch with what's gone before. <br/><br/>It never comes, thank god. Honesty and conviction survive and triumph.<br/><br/>And the trembling smile of being immersed into this bitterly tense, sci-fi survival horror along with the amiable characters stays on your lips. <br/><br/>You UNDERSTAND why you don't see this and that clearly - because if it were you wielding the camera its exactly what you'd shoot, too, no more, no less. <br/><br/>A different, brave, and joyful, nail-biting experience that I'm thoroughly glad I indulged in. You'll need a couple of beers to relax after the experience but it's well worth it if you throw yourself into it the way you might not have done since you were a child. <br/><br/>It deserves its 8 out of 10. <br/><br/>In time, if anyone else is competent and ballsy enough to execute similar styles of storytelling and we develop a genre with a canon of work, you might just look back on this as a 10, a defining moment where all the endless familiarity of the 21st Century's obsession with reality TV, and youTube, and eyewitness documentaries, and warzone reportage and the video gaming subculture came together in a sharp-as-a-tack embodiment of our times and our fascination with apocalyptic self-destruction.<br/><br/>My opinion of the Blair Witch Project didn't alter as a result of Cloverfield - they're different enough; BWP a bit gimmicky, with overkill on the camera motion (blah,blah,blah to the 'small-budget' apologists - they still forced it far too much with little respite). But here, the balance is struck beautifully between disorientation and comprehension.<br/><br/>Don't miss Cloverfield. You'll be pleased you didn't. <br/><br/>FOOTNOTE: As for the motion-sickness fluster - a tip which worked for me: when the camera is in extremis, focus on then CENTRE of the screen - you're not missing anything anyway and as the movement stops you'll find your eyes in direct focus with the camera. Think of yourself running - you don't whip your head side to side; there's always a focus for your brain, a direction to which you aspire. Same here, forget the whipping camera - natural if you were carrying it - and instead keep focused as if you were running INTO the screen. In fact, don't treat this as just a movie; think of it as a bit of a theme-park ride thrown in and treat it accordingly."
"mayra0509","9","0","2","1 February 2008"," Great Movie
","The movie was very good. Anyone who says its bad has awful taste in movies. I mean....Like the guy who says Blair Witch Project is better, is a moron. Blair Witch Project was so boring most people fell asleep while watching it. The only thing that most people will either not like or may even have a problem with while watching is the motion of the camera. Its nothing like a home movie because the people are running a lot so the picture shakes a lot. I love the story...not the one the characters are making but the one about the monster. The whole mystery thing is pretty great. We don't know what the monster is or where it came from through out the whole movie. Until the end we get an actual look at the monster. But still nothing about what it is or where it came from. Good movie...cant wait for the sequel."
"adwilsonia","7","0","2","1 February 2008"," Good film, have to see to appreciate
","Cloverfield, I felt took a while to get started with lots of random footage to introduce the characters. Granted, that was boring. However the rest of the film I thought was very well filmed and kept the viewer engaged, seeing as the main characters seemed...disposable.<br/><br/>Amazing graphics and visuals, a good concept and delivery. The script does seem to let the film down a bit, but is supposed to be realistic and therefore flawed. Anyone that would state the film is rubbish clearly hasn't appreciated what has gone into the production and wanted more definition. Which is not JJ Abrams style, look at lost. So anyone expecting Godzilla or a classical 'monster terrorising' film, you maybe disappointed."

","I absolutely loved this movie. The suspense was great. I was bolted to my seat. People said that they couldn't get into the movie because the camera was too shaky. Also, people couldn't believe this event could happen. Never say never. Anyway, of course it's extremely unlikely any monster will ever attack the U.S, let alone anywhere on Earth, but movies are supposed to be fun, not all movies have to be true or realistic.<br/><br/>1) The camera was shaky because Hud, the camera man, was running most of the time. Of course it's going to be shaky. 2) How could you not get into it? You're seeing it through Hud's eyes. <br/><br/>I loved how the movie was shot and I can't wait to see it in theaters again and buy it when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Obviously this movie will be compared to all sorts of things but overall it's a refreshing reminder that thought provoking film making is not dead in the USA. The movie has just opened today here in Blighty and I managed to see it without knowing anything too revealing and it blew me away. Obviously it will be bracketed with utter sewage such as 'Godawful' and that idiot Spielberg's vomit inducing travesty 'War Of The Worlds' but it leaves that tripe way behind choking on its exhaust fumes as it 'zoms' off in the distance with a finger in the air. Doffing a cap to 'The McPherson Tape' and 'Blair Witch' the movie follows the day of a bunch of well off kids having a farewell party for a mate and brother of one of the main characters. I have been to a few wild parties but this one is an unforgettable bash that changes the lives of our revellers in ways they never quite imagined. It's said there was no great character development but it was an 80 minute movie so what can you expect but I did like the way that the director gave us a bit of an insight during the first ten minutes into the main characters and I for one did like them. They were nice people ..via the medium of a guy with a camera and a bit of party gossip we found out enough to know that these guys were OK. Developing the characters in a similar way Chicago writer Jim Cherry introduced his characters in his excellent novel 'Becoming Angel' we discover they were human just like the rest of us and I for one particularly liked Hud the cameraman and the little elfin 'Winona' lookalike Marlena who he quite fancied. And in those first few minutes I found I actually cared about the people in the movie unlike the pathetic attempt of someone like Spielberg to make us give a rats butt about fake ordinary working guy (we know this cos he drove a crane for a nanosecond) Tom Cruise and his family of retards. Where the film scores is in the way the sense of dread develops and never lets go until the last frames. With a rumble we begin to realise that this is no ordinary farewell bash and as the city explodes around them the party goers are off on a flight for survival that had me on the edge of my seat. It was a truly traumatic journey that eventually took us to Central Park and the films climax and the camera work had me feeling I was there with them but glad I was sitting in a nice comfortable seat in a Middlesbrough cinema. Hollywood blockbusters tend to leave this viewer ambivalent when it comes to the end of these kind of movies. Steve Cheeseburghers pitiful WOTW a perfect example 'yeah millions died but we can take solace in the fact Tom Cruise family escaped without a scratch and Boston was looking nice'. Movies like 'Godawful', 'War Of The Worlds' and 'The Day After Tomorrow' never seem to convey a sense of loss but Cloverfield does. I actually felt regret at what was happening rather than 'OK he's dead where are the freaking dinosaurs?'. I liked that about this movie. The final frames were rather poignant and touching and added to the sense of loss brilliantly reminding us that sometimes we need to take our life chances as we never know when a bloody great monster is gonna screw up our day and stomp our town flat. <br/><br/>Best way to see it is without reading any of these reviews and keep away from the internet but ignore the nay sayers this is a bloody awesome movie which will sadly be watered down by pitifully weak sequels."

","What really made me want to go watch this another 5 times was its sense of realism, and the fact that you felt you were experiencing this incident with these people. It was perfectly balanced so that in the beginning you get to know the characters then ride this roller-coaster with them. I would get this sense that I should duck or look back throughout the film. The 1st person view made watching this movie in the cinema fun! <br/><br/>The first time i had the pleasure of watching this film was on the 17th of January (as i live in Australia) and i had waited and waited for this film ever since the first previews. I had to see the first session! Now I'm not a person who watches a film over and over again, only if it has a spectacular narrative or if it's powerful, but up until now i never thought i would want to see a monster movie like this more than once in the theater. This film was so much fun it changed my perspective of what good films are. A good film taps into your emotions and leaves you with a feeling you'll never forget. When a film does this properly no matter what genre or subject matter the film has succeeded! This film did just that! It's enjoyable, exhilarating, and enthralling! I think Matt Reeves and J.J. Abrams have created a new type of disaster film for a new generation."
"techrev-1","8","0","5","29 January 2008"," Good Movie
","Awesome movie, a hybrid of Godzilla, Blair Witch project, and raw 911 news footage. It has a good message, in my opinion, and was very enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately they forgot to put in an ending. I clicked that there was a spoiler, but how can you spoil something thats not there? For me it was like being dropped off a cliff. Such an intense emotional ride, and then nothing... I still don't know if thats good or bad - I can't imagine an ending that would fit this film, although I would have appreciated an escalator, or at least a staircase down the side of that cliff they threw us off.<br/><br/>In all I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is not pregnant or doesn't have a serious heart condition."
"thekayhan","7","0","2","27 January 2008"," Great concept, but not fully realized.
","This movie has a great concept. Old school monster movie with a focus on horror, and modern special effects. Where it falls flat is lack of terror. Events that should have been absolutely terrifying take too long to develop. Much too often you are alerted to the presence of danger before the actual event happens. Lets be clear, I'm not talking about foreshadowing here, I'm talking about seeing something, waiting a few seconds, and then seeing it actually do something. It allows your brain to brace its self for what is certainly going to happen, all but removing the absolute terror that should be felt.<br/><br/>Aside from that, my only other complaint is lack of realism, notably power being on when it certainly wouldn't be if the events in the movie actually took place. Aside from seeming impossible, lack of light would have helped to add to the atmosphere. Other than these issues, the movie was definitely enjoyable, had a unique filming style (camcorder first person) and very high production values. It is possible that they had to tone down some elements to stick to a PG-13 rating."
"alykat61","10","0","3","27 January 2008"," amazing!
","I've always loved movies but could never decide on a favorite one, until Cloverfield. Cloverfield is an amazing movie, the idea to have it simulate that the characters in the movie are filming it is genius! To be in a huge theater watching the movie is quite like being at a Disney world show. It's a great experience. Seeing the movie from literally the characters point of view is like being there. At suspenseful parts of the film I could actually feel my heart beating faster and my hands shaking. I jumped at scary parts more than I did in any other movie. I had to remind myself that the creatures in the movie weren't actually going to get me. Overall, I can't really consider seeing Cloverfield like seeing another great movie in theaters. It was an amazing, intriguing experience."

Luckily I don't have a weak stomach and I'm an extreme ADDer born and raised in South Detroit so I was able to keep up with the insane camera shots in this movie.

","First of all Cloverfield is not Godzilla,on the contrary its five times better.J.J.

"gograyfirego","9","0","2","27 January 2008"," A vote I can feel good about.
","I seriously gave this movie little chance of being more than just slash & bash craziness. And I believe that kind of pessimism made a huge difference because, when the end credits popped up, I was happy to conclude that I really liked this movie.<br/><br/>It essentially starts with a party that seemed to go on and on but it became a great way to introduce the characters. And like comments by others, I think how the movie focused on the characters was terrific vs. focusing on the ""big bad"" while dismissing the characters as film fodder.<br/><br/>New York has sure been the victim of some phenomenal yet destructive visual effects and this movie might just be the pinnacle. Whether it was the ""big bad"" itself or the perspective from a camcorder, this movie was visually outstanding.<br/><br/>And the cast - Seeing Lizzy Caplan was a treat...especially after CBS dismissed 'The Class' just when it was getting great. And Jessica Lucas' time on 'CSI' has probably been child's play compared to what happens with her in this big screen thriller. The rest were terrific as well but you can see for yourself.<br/><br/>So, it gets my vote for one of the best surprises I've had at the movies in quite some time."
"dfcurran","10","0","2","27 January 2008"," One of the most engaging movies I've ever seen once I got past the shaky camera work
","Yes, the shaky camera stuff can make you uncomfortable. I almost left the movie myself and other theatre patrons did leave. If I was going to watch this again I'd have a few stiff drinks first. But the plot and characters here work to create a story line that will awe you if you stay with the action until the end.<br/><br/>At the start the filmmakers use the best of cinéma-vérité, very similar to what was good about 'David Holzman's Diary' to create a very voyeuristic view of a party in New York and establish the characters. <br/><br/>Why they chose to make the camera work as shaky as it is, I don't know. I do think that they'd have many more fans for this movie if they just had whoever was holding the camera hold it a bit steadier. In fact, the camera changes hands not long after the beginning and improves, but still there's more bouncing and head-ache inducing shots then needed.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, having seen the movie and loved it, I have to share the point at which I almost left. Near the beginning of the movie, when the action gets started, the monster is batting stuff around, and this is a spoiler of sorts, our characters are in the street and when the head of the statute of liberty lands near them. Now I have been inside the head of the statue of liberty, and this head which fills part of the street is just to small to be the head of the statue of liberty. And this disappointed me so I almost left the theatre as the shaky camera work started up again.<br/><br/>Still, I stayed and got into the story again and the story did not disappoint, in fact it intrigued and if you can get past the over shakiness, past the too little Statue of Liberty head, and into the movie, you'll not be disappointed."
"WalkoTheGreat","8","0","2","27 January 2008"," Overall good movie, but I knew what to expect.
","The camera seems to be an issue for a lot of people, when the Blair Witch came out I remember my mother leaving the theatre due to the same reasons. Coming into this movie and reading IMDb regularly, we all knew the point of view was going to be through this camcorder throughout the duration of the movie, knowing this, if you get motion sickness do yourself a favor and simply do not go watch the movie and leave a bad review due to that.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself it was a good concept, you can complain about many things acting, why would people video tape at a time like this? the tsunami's a few years back were caught on several video camera's by brave people, its not far fetched for someone do document this. I do agree beth being impaled then revitalized by rob HUD etc is kind of far fetched. people taking pictures of the statue of liberty's head with camera phones, why not? Now, of course surviving the helicopter crash made the characters seem invincible, but in all honesty the tail rotor was dislodged the helicopter descended rapidly but still had the main rotor on to make the coptor ""land hard"" it didn't take a nose dive at 400 m.p.h and the percentage of survivors in any type of aerial crash is small, but its more believable in a helicopter rather a military jet,or commercial airline. Im sure this would have been a much more in depth topic if we were reviewing Cast Away with tom hanks as the movie should not of continued after his Christmas night descent into the pacific ocean going at 450 m.p.h. NOSE FIRST! haha<br/><br/>I wish the movie would have been narrated by a character explaining the monster, giving scientific explanations for the reaction to the parasites, and also I would of loved to see it from a military point of view, but obviously we are following the characters who don't care, but rather try to stay alive.<br/><br/>The ending, yes with Rob and Beth video taping themselves before the final bombs were dropped added to my thrill of the movie. I knew the military were preparing to level the monster with more powerful weaponry, and after being advised of the time in which the military would level Manhatten, Rob knew this was where the story was going to end he found refuge under a bridge in central park and began to say his last words and I heard complaints about rob and beth confessing their love, why is this a problem? I can only hope there will be a sequel to this movie with a higher budget and more explanations and answer. what is this hybrid monster where did it come from was the gigantic size really caused from something in the ocean? The reaction to the bites, why? obviously I have an idea why, but I don't like to speculate."

","Yes, the camera will make those who are weak in the stomach a little sick maybe, but you have to realize that before you go into the theater. The beginning is a little slow, but once the monster attacks it is a very rushing movie that seems to pull you in as though you are there. I've been telling my friends that it's been the first movie in a long time that has actually made me tense. There were a couple points in the movie that just sent goosebumps all the way up my arms.<br/><br/>For those who are planning on going out to see this, wait through the credits because there is a clip that involves the monster a little more.<br/><br/>*If you are an avid movie goer, who can stand a shaky camera for twenty minutes it is completely worth seeing in the theaters.

At least we as the audience get to see glimpses of the monster, a cross between Godzilla and a crustacean and it's little parasitic shrimp spiders as you and your friends travel through the ruins of what was Manhattan. We would have never seen the destruction, the looting, the monster, what the smaller monsters are capable of, what the military were doing about it and what the final move on the part of the military would be had the search for Beth never come about.<br/><br/>If you have not figured it out the love interest in the story line is a narrative device. Even now I ponder on whether or not I sympathized with the characters. That being said I still enjoyed the film because it hits the mark on issues that modern horror films especially monster films sometimes lack; this film gets straight to the point. Who cares why the monster appears? It just does and it destroys and everybody dies and that's what I want. My summary comes off a bit sarcastic but really...how many times do I have to hear Rob's name shouted before I notice I'm watching a movie?! Besides, I find it as a great redeeming factor that these yuppies all die in the end anyhow!"

It was like a first person video game shooter, if you're playing, it was alright, if you weren't ... I almost walked out ( but my curiosity and the cost of admittance kept me in my seat ) The character development was a little long and boring at first.

I'm a news Photog and have always dreamed of getting footage like that!!!! yes its jumpy but your right in the middle of it! it was very eerie 9-11-ish footage which made it real for me, people coming out of the dust after the building collapses. also the cutting in-between the footage that was already there and the new footage was great! any body who has a video camera knows what that looks like. <br/><br/>It was different, they weren't trying to fight off the monster, just get away. and it hit a cord with me because I have been there in the middle of a major event and caught it on tape.........mostly storms, but hey it was great footage and earned respect from my peers!

"lloyddriscoll","7","0","2","26 January 2008"," Surprisingly fresh telling of an oft told tale
","Aside from a generation Y kick off with its overblown and far too long set up, this movie is a surprisingly refreshing telling of what is now a well worn plot line revolving around the destruction of iconic landmarks with humanity against all odds. The effects are solid without being overblown; and the performances of what seems a young and relatively unknown cast are measured: happily the director did not resort to cheap hysteria; the reactions of players of confusion and aimlessness are totally believable. The film has a relentless inevitability which kept me on the edge of my seat. The star of the turn is however the hand held camera which adds fearsome grit. Add to this the dialog which is almost wholly plausible; credible and chillingly convincing pandemonium which engulfs the citizens of Manhattan when they realize what lies ahead, and you have a well told yarn; which could well be the ""Alien"" for the new century."
"cultfilmfan","7","0","2","26 January 2008"," Cloverfield
","Cloverfield is about a group of young adults who while having a party discover that some enormous creature is rampaging through the streets and that buildings are being destroyed and people are dying. The film features only a handful of main characters fleeing from the monster and one of them has a hand-held camera with him, so basically what he films is what we see. There were things I liked about Cloverfield and some things that only made it an okay film for me instead of a great one. The whole idea of a film being seen from the hand-held camera point of view isn't exactly new, but I thought the filmmakers did an interesting twist with this and it gave us a more personal side to the people running from the creature. While the hand-held camera movements were very shaky and did make me kind of motion sick and nauseated, I still appreciated this original way of storytelling and handling the movie. Another thing I liked about the film is that even though it is released by a big mainstream distributor and got a wide release, it didn't really feel like a big Hollywood movie at all because of how everything happened realistically and for a monster film it didn't really feel all that preposterous at times because of how real the characters, their situation and how they handled it was. Also there are not a lot of big fancy special effects, or camera tricks here making the film look more gritty and real. Because the film is not predictable and doesn't suffer from old horror movie formulas that have been done to death I applauded the film for it's original take on this genre of film as well as the direction and storytelling. Other than making me a bit nauseated, which I don't count as a negative feeling for the movie the only real problem I had with the film is that it started to drag a bit in the middle and the suspense and intensity of the film as well as the characters really started to die off for me in the second half. Had it been a little more suspenseful and had a little bit more action, or just anything else to keep my interest up, it would have made this film a really good one rather than just an okay one. Still, I was pleased that a mainstream Hollywood company would release a film as different and original as this, so I can say that that impresses me, but the film itself is only okay and I do feel it could have been a bit better."
"BruddanChrist","7","0","2","26 January 2008"," A hell of a movie
","Cloverfield is a different kind of movie. Like The Blair Witch Project, it presents itself as a first-hand account of a fictional event, attempting to make it more realistic. Instead of progressing like a conventional story, it unfolds as a series of events in a several-hour-long span of time.<br/><br/>Unlike the Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield succeeds in putting the viewer in the middle of the chaos. At times, I was so invested in the characters and their conflict that I found myself panicking with them.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliantly executed. The camera work was filmed in an amateur fashion, but never lingers on a shot or idles at the storyteller's feet for too long. The pace is good, too, giving the audience time to breathe after major events.<br/><br/>Cloverfield isn't for everybody. The guy I saw it with hated it for the reasons I loved it. I think it has a lot to do with expectations. If you expect a conventional movie when seeing this movie, you will be disappointed. Just know going into it that it will surprise you."

","I really liked this movie. I read many reviews here on IMDb before I went to see it, so I had high expectations. For me, the camera POV presentation was sometimes disorienting, yet at the same time, it really made the movie interesting and tense. There was plenty of suspense and many seriously scary moments. I thought lighting and darkness were used very well to pluck my nerves throughout the film. Sometimes, I got angry at the heroes for the decisions they made, but I stuck with them and found myself pulling for them. There was nothing in this movie that struck me as totally unbelievable or ridiculous. The monster and special effects did not disappoint me at all. What I saw of the monster left me wanting to see more of it. It made me curious. The special effects were first rate. I'm glad that there were no gratuitous sex or nude scenes, which are so often just thrown in to movies. No over-the-top gore either. There was no underlying message or moral lesson to the viewer; just an eyewitness view of a spectacular disaster. The film left me with a bunch of unanswered questions, so I do hope there's a sequel. This one ranks up there with my other favorite monster movies (Alien, Predator, and Jurassic Park)."

","""I saw it. It's alive!"" Terrorized New Yorker in Cloverfield <br/><br/>My favorite monster is from Forbidden Planet because I never see it;the anticipation is fearful. In a similarly minimalist approach, the monster in Cloverfield appears later in the film, but the camera never lingers. Good for director Matt Reeves: Less is more.<br/><br/>In the spirit of Blair Witch, the terror of New York City is enhanced by total-film hand-held camera, a story told by a twenty- something who has been recording a party and keeps his camera going through the destruction of lower Manhattan as he and his friends try to evacuate.<br/><br/>In the spirit of Godzilla, the monster is bigger than hell and angry.<br/><br/>In the spirit of 9/11, panic is married to disbelief, a potent cocktail for women crying and men running. The camera, although annoying when I have to watch it jiggling for over an hour, is nevertheless effective in creating a sense of immediacy and danger, transporting me to the site as I maneuver with the actors through present peril.<br/><br/>The biggest casualty is characterization; notice I have not mentioned one name so far, and I won't because horror is the main attraction.<br/><br/>It's no field of clover, but Cloverfield will delight you if you long to see New York brought to its knees from the safety of your seat.

","Waiting for the movie to begin, I expected it to be a total waste of my time and money. Also, I'm not really into monster movies and gore, so Cloverfield already had it coming. My friends wanted me to go with them, and so I obliged. For me, this film generated juxtaposing opinions. While it kept me on the edge of my seat, I missed some key events by just blinking or sneezing. And, despite the headache I got from the realistically shaky ""home video"" footage and the bright lights, I enjoyed the point of view. Seeing the classic Godzilla story through a victim's eye was fairly intriguing and in my opinion, the most creative aspect of the film. This might spoil the movie for you, but the monster is not badass. It's a cross between a praying mantis and a gila monster with mysterious disappearing tentacles. I would not buy this on DVD or even see it a second time, but I think it ended up being worth viewing. I would recommend renting it on DVD to save a few dollars."

"rbsjrx","8","0","2","23 January 2008"," I liked it, but can only rate it an 8
","First of all, this comment does contain MAJOR SPOILERS, so turn back now if you don't want to know what happens!<br/><br/>While you're deciding whether to read further, what can I say that won't spoil it? ""Cloverfield"" has been summarized as ""Godzilla"" meets ""The Blair Witch Project"", and that's a fair description. The hand-held camera documentary effect does hark back to TBWP. That may be something fairly new to much of the film's target audience, but it's really not. Whether it's innovative or simply annoying is a judgment call, although it does help set the tone of the film. I saw the film with my adult granddaughter who is subject to motion sickness and although she liked it, she doesn't particularly want to see it again. That doesn't bode well for its box office ""legs"". I'd also like to add that I'm past 60, so ignore what others may say about this not being for folks over 30-35.<br/><br/>*** Spoiler Pause ***<br/><br/>Still here? OK, here goes... I should qualify my first comment with the fact that I don't necessarily consider the spoilers all that major. The opening titles set up the biggest spoiler, so it wasn't really that unexpected.<br/><br/>So what is new and/or fresh about it? The answer is point of view (POV). Most traditional monster films have central characters who are scientists or military people engaged in battling and/or understanding the monster. The monster's victims are traditionally part of the background. ""Cloverfield"" turns this around... There are no scientists in sight and the military personnel are all secondary characters. The protagonists are some of the same people you see simply running and screaming in a traditional monster film. The scant plot is simply their trying to survive and save friends and loved ones. The hand held video is simply a plot gimmick to facilitate this unique POV.<br/><br/>Some have criticized the characters as being vapid, self-absorbed twenty-somethings, which I don't think is entirely fair. It's largely true of the party group at the beginning, but then once we shift the focus from scientists and high-ranking military types to everyday people, you can't really expect everyone to be all that interesting. The audience doesn't need to admire them, only to identify with them and/or like them at some level. The core group at the focus of the film may not be heroic or deep thinkers, but they are types we all know and are mostly likable enough.<br/><br/>So, what's not to like? Again, just as with TBWP, many people won't like the jerky hand held camera work. So that much is a matter of taste - I find it mildly annoying, but that's just me. What's more troubling (here come the spoilers) is that almost everyone dies! OK, that's not too surprising in a modern horror film. And again, this is foreshadowed in the opening credits. As they rolled, I was prepared that some or most of the characters would die, but not all of the most sympathetic ones! Doing it this way is arguably more realistic. But, since the whole premise of any monster film is unrealistic, my gut reaction is that if I wanted to see a show with a really depressing ending, I'd watch a documentary and learn something in the process. Once I've spent the whole time investing some feelings for the characters, having them killed off seemingly at random may be realistic, but it doesn't leave me with a good feeling as I leave the theater. This may also affect the film's box office ""legs"".<br/><br/>I also have to add that this is one of the most intense films I've ever seen. It's only about an hour long yet leaves you wrung out, feeling that it was a much longer film. In addition to being nauseous from the camera work, my granddaughter was sore from tensing her muscles and generally felt like she'd been through a real workout by the time the final credits rolled.<br/><br/>Conditionally recommended with significant caveats... (However, my all-time favorite giant monster movies are ""Gojira"" (the original Japanese version), ""Godzilla vs. Destroyer"", ""Godzilla: Final Wars"", ""Gorgo"", ""Mighty Joe Young"" (the original version), and both the original and Peter Jackson versions of ""King Kong"")."

I loved the camera work, but I can understand how people wouldn't like it because of motion sickness and whatnot. The movie wasn't really about the monster. There wasn't supposed to be a solid storyline. It was about the experience they went through. And most people think it sucked for that reason. It's a bit more artistic than the typical monster movie. The acting wasn't phenomenal, but it was pretty good. Like I said, the only thing I really didn't like was the ending. It was ""sweet"" and all, but it definitely should have ended differently.

"boogaluu","7","0","1","22 January 2008"," Too little monster, too much inside and underground, but not too bad !
","I just saw the movie and here is my review.......<br/><br/>The movie dragged a bit at first with boring party logistics as the appointed amateur cameraman (Duh you mean you want me to go around the party and document everything on video...well uh.. duh OK.. maybe I'll try some to see how it goes) scoped people who had nothing much to say.<br/><br/>Credits go to the special effects people both audio and visual who really knew how to make things happen. The actors were good because they gave you the impression that they were real people and acted exactly that way. I am down on the screenplay because this could have been a much better movie if it had a decent screenplay. The movie duration of 1hr 40mins could have been cut to 70 or 80 minutes and then built back up to 2hrs with more monster effects, more havoc and more of those little buggers raising hell ! Throw in some retreats similar to the latest War Of The Worlds and you would have something. I got a bargain price of 5 bucks seeing it on Tuesday so I cant complain to much.<br/><br/>When the news flashed an earthquake announcement we could (in hindsight) perceive this two ways.<br/><br/>1. The earthqauke was mistaken for the bad SOB from (we still don't know where it came from) hell stomping mud holes in everythings ass all over the place.<br/><br/>2. The earthquake actually happened and released the bad SOB from a crack below the ocean. This is perhaps a topic for further discussion since we saw giill like sacks in the rear sides of the SOB's head later on. (How did it breathe, like a fish or like a humanoid etc.) As the movie progresses we see small (size of a medium dog) spider like creatures that attack living things on sight and have an infectious bite which will getcha later (as your eyes reap blood and you finally explode).<br/><br/>We feel for the characters as we lose some of them due to the fact that the movie lets us get sort of close to them. None of the characters are allowed too much personality apparently since it is all about the bad ass SOB doing more then stealing your lunch money amidst downtown manhattan.<br/><br/>The movie has some edge of your seat moments and the ever present loud thuds make sure of that. Someone had posted a picture of what they thought the monster looked like on this thread but I can say without a doubt that it was not the bulky thick necked chubby thighed illustration that was posted. The monster has arm like appenditures and I can only compare it to a much smaller monster which was in episode 5 or 6 (try 6) of the series PRIMEVAL (British I believe), PRIMEVAL by the way is a great series in it's second season. (Google ""PRIMEVAL Torrent"" or ""PRIMEVAL Rapidshare links"" you will get some blogs that have the links. There are 6 episodes in season one, and two in season two so far. Different monsters and creatures in each episode make this series a winner along with great special effects.<br/><br/>Anyway after watching the entire movie I thought our two remaining heroes were goners ! Then I see camera segment dated 24 Apr 2007 with the two of them on a roller coaster at an amusement park. One hero (Rob) says to his girl something like ""So how was your day so far"" and they smile at each other. I am trying to figure out if the camera segment was after the monster holocuast or before. If it is after they really left a lot of unanswered questions leading me to believe that we will be teased again with a sequel.<br/><br/>I could see some camera perspective adding value to this movie but they used it throughout the entire movie and it turned many people off. Even people who don't get dizzy or motion sick seemed irritated by it. If there is a sequel I sure hope they don't use this method again unless it is in limited doses."

","Cloverfield is a cheap victory for J.J. Abrams. It looked beautiful, had my senses in a whirlwind, and even brought me to heights of movie excitement/fear that I have never before experienced. It was a great theater thrill-ride. However, it completely lacked any kind of meaningful story. It fell short on character development, had no climax, and was devoid of any significant or resolving conclusion. The writer never had to deal with the tough questions of aftermath or origin, and in that sense totally balked on creativity and story-telling. It is not up to the audience to fill in the gaps--that is the writer's job. This movie is the quintessential one-night-stand of movies: incredible looks, an incredible experience, but with no substance it leaves you feeling empty when the night is over."
"millenniumgamer","5","0","2","22 January 2008"," Good production values but flawed script.
","I saw Cloverfield Saturday night and was a little disappointed. And to explain why I think it's necessary to reference JJ Abrams' television series Lost as an indication for those who have seen that series but not yet Cloverfield, as there are enough similarities that the viewer will know what to expect.<br/><br/>As with Lost, Cloverfield's cast is largely unknowns, which is not a bad thing. It keeps down the cost of hiring an a-list name that chews scenery and allows the audience to take a look at everyone on screen with an equal eye. However in Lost, viewers had several seasons to see relationships develop and personalities and motives explained in back story. In Cloverfield there is no time for any of that. The cast are attractive, 20-something social climbers that I felt little empathy for. Of course there was no indication of who would survive or die, but I really didn't care. Though the cast did provide a good performance of those caught in crisis, even if their lines were a little awkward and decisions unreasonable.<br/><br/>Now to the monster. Again referencing Lost, the show suggested there was a monster on the island but it was never shown. Instead you would see the rustling of trees or the reactions on the actor's faces when they saw this creature but the viewer would not be shown what they were looking at. Abrams takes a similar approach to Cloverfield. For most of the film the monster is not seen, save for brief glimpses on a news cast or a body part suddenly appearing. When the creature is finally shown it does look impressive but the scene is too brief. And really, with CG effects so prevalent in films now the wow factor really isn't there. If you're going to go to all the trouble of creating a kick ass monster you might as well feature it in more scenes and give the audience something to talk about on the way home.<br/><br/>OK, about the camera work. If one reads reviews of Cloverfield at IMDb and elsewhere there are two camps on this issue. One side complains of the shakiness giving them motion sickness while the other says shut up about it. Well shooting from the perspective of a hand-held camera is not a bad idea. It puts the viewer in the action and makes you feel as if you're experiencing the story first hand. The problem isn't that the camera shakes, it's that it shakes too much. Anyone who has ever held a minicam makes an effort to hold it steady, in fact many cameras feature technology to assist in providing a smooth picture. So I did find this an exaggeration, and some of the choices of what one would really train the camera on in the film seemed weird. If I had a choice of filming a giant monster or pointing the camera at my friends, you can bet I would choose to catch the beast on film, I'm sure most people would.<br/><br/>One point of inconsistency is that the monster lets loose small ones that run around attacking people. As shown in several scenes, it is quite easy to defeat them with a good swing from a heavy object, yet the main creature is impervious to the heaviest fire power the military can throw at it. The creature's origin is never explained, and that's fine. But if it was born on earth it must be some type of animal. Very unlikely it could withstand the barrage of tank and rocket fire it is subjected to. I know I know, Godzilla can. And the job offer in Japan is a reference to the land of the big guy.<br/><br/>But I do have to compliment the special effects used to portray Manahattan being blown to pieces. It really was believable and the saving grace of the film. So to sum up, if you do choose to see Cloverfield, don't set the bar too high on expectation and it will do fine. But really, before you drop your $10.50 on this check the paper to see what else is playing. Cloverfield is by no means a bad film but it certainly is not the best one currently on the big screen."

","The much anticipated ""Cloverfield"" was finally released and I finally saw it today. Being a looooong time Godzilla fan (japanese movies) I have been excited to see this movie since seeing the original teaser before ""Transformers"", and I really was not let down. It was an extremely original monster movie, and brought new life into the genre. The movie feels unbelievably realistic, to the point where it is pretty freaky sometimes. Although, I can really see where all of the people complaining about it making them remember the events of 9/11 are coming from. Because it feels exactly like it in many scenes where the monster is not involved. It's almost TOO realistic. If i have one complaint though, it is the monster. I thought it looked to cgi and fake sometimes, and wasn't shown enough, but maybe that's just me. <br/><br/>Overall I thought Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams did a great job with this idea and made it very realistic and fun--7/10"

","First of all, this movie is awesome. Great action, great CGI(some of the best) and great acting. The movie was perfect almost. The only thing that I didn't get was why did this guy keep the camera. I'm sure that if a monster that was 50 times bigger than Godzilla was coming after you, you would have dropped the camera. Other than that, this was very strong in every way. In the movie, your rarely ever see the monster enough to get an idea of what it is. But for those that want to know what the monster looks like, you won't be disappointed. At the very end of the movie, you really see the monster, up close by its front. I'm not going to tell you what it is, but it's scary. In the beginning when the Brooklyn Bridge broke, it looked like a giant snake, but it's not. The CGI was outstanding, especially that it was all shot on a home video camera like the Blair witch project. The only shame on this movie is the ending. It's not a mistake, but it is not at all satisfying, and leaves you with a ""what the heck just happened"" feeling. Overall this movie is definitely worth seeing twice, and getting the DVD. If you like action, sci-fi, thriller, horror, fantasy, or adventure movies you will like this."
"freaky_dave","8","0","5","21 January 2008"," Godzilla meets the Blair Witch in a surreal experience
","Note: To anybody complaining about motion sickness, you all knew months in advance from the trailers what kind of movie this was going to be, so I don't get the complaints. Now on with the review.<br/><br/>Cloverfield was a surreal experience told from the point of view of a movie camera. It is a cross between The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla. I found the movie very effective and did not once feel sick because I knew what to expect.<br/><br/>A group of friends are throwing a going away party for their friend Rob who is going to Japan for a job. WHile enjoying the party a creature the size of Godzilla attacks New York City. During all this time and beyond one of the characters, his name is Hud Platt (TJ Miller) films everything from the beginning of the attack and on into the next day. During this time him and four friends go on a trek through a demolished New York to save a girl who is wounded. ALong the way they come up against several obstacles which include the giant creature, mini-monsters which are falling off of it, and all kinds of destruction which include the Brooklyn Bridge, two skyscrapers which have collapsed on each other, and of course the head of the Statue of Liberty which is the first scene of destruction in the movie.<br/><br/>Some will wonder why these five people risk their lives to save one girl who will most likely be dead by the time they get there? I'm not going to say if she's dead or not, that will be up to you to see the movie. WHat I will say is that Rob (Michael Stahl David), who had an affair with the wounded girl, is in love with her and let her leave his party on a bad note and feels guilty. The others follow him because he is their friend and they don't want him to go off by himself on such a dangerous mission.<br/><br/>From the point of view of the movie camera, the movie has a nice frantic pace that fits in perfectly with reality TV. The character filming everything also makes it more interesting because he has a sense of humor which helps us to get involved with their plight through the devastation. There are quite a few surprises along the way, and some that you won't be expecting when they happen.<br/><br/>Cloverfield, like Blair Witch, is a memorable movie. Like Blair Witch, it makes you feel like you are a part of the action and right there with them as they struggle onward. There are questions that I have about the movie though? One in particular would have to do with injured characters who are able to continue moving forward after sustaining some devastating injuries that would make it impossible for them to even move a little without passing out. Also, there is no way the battery in that movie camera would've lasted seven hours. It is these moments that take away from the reality that the writer and director were going for, but I can forgive it somewhat.<br/><br/>And for those of you wondering if you see the creature or not. Yes you do. There aren't a lot of scenes though, and even the scenes you do get are somewhat blurred. The director's approach of less being better holds true. This movie is also rated PG-13, proving once again that you don't need a whole lot of gore to make an effective horror film."

","On the plus side: The execution of the film is professional for it's genre. Other then the start, the movie is well paced with good timing of surprises and changes. I found two moments in the film very immersive thanks to the camera work. I really enjoyed a few of the death scenes. I highly recommended for anyone that is young, or easily finds themselves engaged in a story.<br/><br/>On the trauma side: The immaturity, stupidity and predictability of the characters resulted in a totally ostrasizing and consequently unenjoyable film for me. Regrettably this stereotypical highly-emotive-I've- lost-access-to-99.8%-of-my-logic-capabilities attitude is present all the way through. <br/><br/>The start of the movie focuses on a home style party which I found very disengaging, slow and painfully like a real teenage home movie. This consequently left me largely disengaged for the rest of the movie (though I was desperately looking forward to certain characters dying). Overutilisation of the camera sytle (ie: the whole movie) trivialised it's potentially awesome impact. <br/><br/>In short, this is one of the most unejoyable movies I have seen for a fair while. Having said that, if I could switch my mind off, I could see why a lot of people have given it a great rating."

","First of all, if you're prone to motion sickness, don't see this movie. Or at least be prepared to hurl in the theater. Otherwise, take some Dramamine and enjoy one adrenaline soaked ride of a movie. The monster defies description, which I wouldn't attempt anyhow, but it certainly wasn't what I expected and was amazingly creative. The size of it was what blew me away - looks like it could make Godzilla into an appetizer. Great action, intense realism, quite imaginative - may leave you shaking for an hour afterward from the experience. And yes, its that good and was worth the months of ""hype"". Don't go expecting a ""beginning"" or an ""end"" or an explanation - just go to experience it."

","We have rap and hip-hop, internet and mobile communications, as well as Survivor and The Amazing Race. These are what our generation can claim our own, and that applies to The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, cinéma-vérité of our generation.<br/><br/>To caution potential viewers about to catch the movie, calling it a disaster or monster film might be misleading. Essentially at it's heart, Cloverfield is a romance story. The character which the film ""documents"" through a hand-held video camera, is Rob, a New Yorker about to leave for Japan to take up a vice-chairman position. This present story is recorded over a previous taping of Rob's day with childhood friend Beth. Through the little snippets that have not been recorded over, it can be deciphered that they have spent a night together and the situation between them is now awkward. Are they just friends? Is Rob willing to stay in New York? Things are unresolved and Beth leaves in a huff.<br/><br/>This is when the story takes a turn. An explosion resembling an earthquake shatters through the city. As the party makes its way onto the street, the head of the Statue of Liberty crashes onto the street. A terrifying cry of echoes in the air, signifying that this is the act of a living thing rather than an earthquake or terrorist act. As the city is being evacuated, Rob receives a distress call from Beth. Along with Hud, his best friend-cum-cameraman, his brother's girlfriend and Hud's love interest, they make their way back to Cloverfield, where Beth's apartment is. Why does he go back for someone who is not even officially his girlfriend? Not to give away anything in terms of plot, I can only say it's hard to see someone you love die, but it's worse to leave someone to die without her knowing you love her.<br/><br/>What happens next is for you to find out. As I left the cinema, I noticed that the majority of the viewers seemed disappointed at how the movie turned out. Just look past the set expectations that a genre carries with it, suspend your disbelief and enjoy a film that will be a classic that is representative of our time."
"postalxris","9","0","5","19 January 2008"," This is the beginning...
","This has to be the beginning of a new franchise of movies. This was awesome, I want to see what happened before and after this hand held camcorder film was shot. Go see it, and remember this is done by a hand held camcorder. But worth the pain of seeing it that way. The thing I enjoyed was that this could happen, not like Transformers. This is exactly what I wouldn't ever want to happen to the world. But wow it makes you really wonder. The director did a fantastic job. I love his movies for the most part, this was top notch. Hurry and send the real movie to print and lets get this party started quickly... I will pay to see this movie again and again. I'm taking the wife to see it again tomorrow when everyones at church."
"Nick_of_the_Rebellion","9","0","5","19 January 2008"," the most shocking experience in my life!!! ill see it again.
","WOW!!! This has to be the most amazing experience I've had in a while. I have been waiting six and a half months for this and its lived up to the hype. My pulse was crazy i felt short of breath and loved it. to make a movie where you feel like your apart of it and then there was the emotional aspect. When rob had to tell his mom about Jason my girl friend cried and i felt awful. The experience is one you absolutely need to experience at the theater. i was shocked at the crowd when they booed it i yelled go waste your money on meet the spartans you dumb red necks. I hope there will be a sequel to this movie and i will go see this movie again and again buy it on blu ray or HD DVD when it comes out and look for clues through out. its a must see"
"semm2120","9","0","5","18 January 2008"," Awesome!!
","I've always loved the cheesy old monster movies. This one is not at all cheesy - which made the experience that much newer and better.<br/><br/>The shaky camera and the fact that you're following a group of ordinary people trying first to escape and then rescue a missing friend while a partially and unpredictably seen monster rampages draws you into the story and holds on tight. Completely unlike most other ""monster destroys city"" movies - you feel this one is real and happening right in front of you.<br/><br/>I will admit that I'm tired of the indestructible Godzilla-ish monster and would have preferred that we appeared to be able to do at least a little damage to it, but I guess it's meaner if all the firepower in the military can't hurt it.<br/><br/>Enjoy the crap out of this one and hope they find another camera somewhere with another perspective on the story. Cloverfield 2, please."
