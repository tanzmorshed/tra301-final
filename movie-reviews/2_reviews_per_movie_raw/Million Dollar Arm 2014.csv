","went to an advanced screening with mom and we were laughing crying and cheering all over ourselves and with the other moviegoers in the theater. i mean, seriously we all clapped and jumped out of our seats. what a treat! the premise is simple: take a self-involved ambitious businessman and stick him with three talented but hungry baseball prospects and they end up changing each other for the better. plus, the cast is superb! Alan Arkin, Bill Paxton and Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal who play their real-life counterparts, wow just wow! <br/><br/>my family loves sports movies and my mother loves baseball movies in particular, so seeing this with her on mother's day was perfect. if you love baseball movies or know kids who love baseball (or any sports for that matter), Million Dollar Arm is a must-see feel good film. it's The Rookie meets Hoop Dreams.... go see it"
"patsworld","9","36","43","22 May 2014"," A Feel Good Movie That Will Have You Smiling When You Leave
","In a spate of recent sports themed movies, all of which were good, I have to say I consider this one the best. Toss together some baseball history, an excellent script, terrific casting, great acting, a bit of the squalor, beauty and toe-tapping music of India and Viola! You end up with a good film. To try and single out one single actor in this film I liked the most or was most impressed with is impossible. Every one was amazing. You don't need to be a baseball fan or even know that much about the game to appreciate this picture. I and my companion (who is about as far from a sports-minded person as you could find) for the viewing were both thrilled with this one. When the people coming out of the opposite door at the end of the picture smile and say, ""Good movie, wasn't it?"" You know you've seen a good movie. There are some I want to see again.this is one."

","The Hollywood's exploration of India based subjects is continuing. I have been enjoying those. Something quite refreshing which traveling on a new perspective to entertain the world audience. Especially, this movie was not a bigger one like 'Slumdog Millionaire' or 'Life of Pi', but cute emotional family drama like 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'.<br/><br/>It was a biopic-sport-drama about an American sports agent, J. B. Bernstein, who brought two young fastest arm Indians to the States to train as the professional baseball pitchers. Before that, he conducts a reality show called 'Million Dollar Arm' in various Indian locations to find the perfect one. In the end he gets two and takes back them to the country. What follows is the cultural collision where these two finds hard to fit in and perform. With many inspiring lines and tears in our eyes it comes to the conclusion.<br/><br/>It was a nice story and inspiring. This movie teaches many things like about family values, sharing culture, hard work for a better future, having faith, true love and all the above the most deserved second chance. It was a predictable story. The minor problem with the movie was it won't explain thoroughly some of the contents it portrays. It is due to cultural different some will have a hard time to figure it out the meaning of it. But for South Asians and Indo-American it will be a perfect movie.<br/><br/>The movie had more than sufficient humorous scenes and many of them were in an Indian accent. I had a great time laughing for those comedies. Those comedies are because of the difference pronunciation of the same word between the people of two countries. The character Amit is the center of the attract when it comes to the humour. In the other end, especially in the second half the story drags most of its parts towards the sentiments. I can't say it was unnecessary, but truly was impeccable and touching.<br/><br/>''They need to know that you care them''<br/><br/>I never knew this director. After checking out his filmography, yeah, I have watched many and liked a couple of his movies, especially 'Lars and the Real Girl'. He did a great job, especially shooting in Indian summer is not an easy task. He himself told in Q&A meet about his struggles. All the actors well cooped. John Hamm's one of the best performances. No doubt he was remarkable.<br/><br/>The boys from 'Slumdog Millionaire' and 'Life of Pi' are the two Indian characters. Suraj Sharma as Rinku and Madhur Mittal as Dinesh did justice to the respective roles, though they were not similar kind of face to the real ones like usually filmmakers choose for a biopic. They were really good, did key performances alongside John Hamm's JB character. Lake Bell was a surprised attraction of the movie. I found her kind of cute in some of the scenes than never before. And other major attractions were Alan Akin with his usual incredible show in the small span, and a few others, especially that Indian character called Amit.<br/><br/>Even before it was released many had criticised it by saying a TV movie and so 90s. But I had faith in it and watched and it never disappointed me. I have already said in my many reviews that I love tearjerker movies, so it was my perfect one. Some mighty one's are releasing on the same week this movie hitting the screen. I believe this is the only one pure family drama that one could ask for an alternate. In fact best by so far in this summer, according to the family friendly films. I highly recommend it, but all you need is to have a low expectation."
"melheartspink","10","40","49","22 May 2014"," Predictable story but still a lovely movie!
","OK, I admit that you could probably predict the course of the movie just from seeing the trailer. However, this movie makes you forget about its predictability. The acting was superb, you really feel for the characters and what they are going through. You want them to succeed and surpass the adversities. With that being said, this movie will make you laugh, cry, and smile. It's just one of those feel good movies. In fact, the entire theatre audibly laughed and cheered on the boys. This is the first time I've ever seen a theatre audience so engaged in a movie. I recommend this movie for everyone. If you're looking for a feel good, charming movie, this is it!"
"Sam-was-sammy","8","50","63","10 May 2014"," Predictable but enjoyable...definitely worth a watch!
","Based on a true story, Million Dollar Arm is a predictable motivating sport film from the Disney stable.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm with his flawlessly groomed stubble and cocky grin plays the haughty sports agent Bernstein with ease. As a groomed smooth talker in sharply tailored corporate suits, there are few to match Hamm and he does what is expected of him. The two main characters of the movie are Suraj Sharma, the star of Life of Pi who plays Rinku and Madhur Mittal, the older brother in Slumdog Millionaire who plays Dinesh. Both of them perform their roles very beguilingly and inspire affection from the crowd. The rest of the supporting cast also perform their roles very well especially Lake Bell who was very impressive in her cameo role as Brenda.<br/><br/>I might be a bit biased since I am from India but the comedy in the movie is hilarious...I found myself laughing throughout the movie enjoying every moment of it. The direction and editing are also pretty impressive. In a nutshell, all the elements in the movie combine really well and the result is a fine movie which has plenty to offer.<br/><br/>So, overall, Million Dollar Arm is a finely made movie which will impress you despite being predictable and is certainly worth a watch.<br/><br/>My Rating : 8.5 out of 10"
"blufrog49","10","47","62","22 May 2014"," Great Movie, Incredible Story
","First, let me say I LOVE sports movies. Second, it is rare that I give any movie higher than a rating of 8. This movie has it all--and it's not really a ""sports"" movie.<br/><br/>To begin with, there is a great story. The characters are well developed and the scenes in India provide just the right background for what these young men must have gone through in their transformation. There was more that one heart-jerking moment without ever being maudlin. I was prepared to give this a lower score because I was sure the love-interest story was contrived just for the movie, but it turns out to be true.<br/><br/>Be sure to stay for the credits, which has many ""real-life"" photos as well as more scenes from India, and updates on most of the characters. I was disappointed to see there wasn't a follow-up on Aash who provided the initial inspiration for the concept, but I'm guessing he/that WAS created for movie.<br/><br/>While sports movies usually follow a tried-and-true formula, and this one hones pretty close to that formula, it is still refreshing nonetheless and quite enlightening. I was not at all familiar with this story, and am interested in finding out more.<br/><br/>And lastly, how refreshing it is to see a good movie (set in professional sports, no less) that has NO obscene language. Other filmmakers, take a look at how successful and enjoyable this movie is without a profanity laced (or drenched) script."
"alienator345","9","37","48","11 May 2014"," One of the better sports movies in recent memory
","I am a pretty big sports fan. Despite this, though, I can be fairly picky with my sports movies. A few general questions that I always ask. First, why was this movie made? There are a ton of great moments that happen in sports, but not all of them deserve movies to made of them. And along with that, sometimes an ordinary event is glorified in the movie, which causes you to raise an eyebrow when you learn the actual events. Next, how faithful is this to the actual events? Yes, I know this is Hollywood and they are going to change things. But if they change things too much, it can be a problem. For example, if the actual person portrayed in the movie doesn't like what Hollywood did with them, that is a problem. Finally, sports movies can be really cliché and predictable because there are only really two options for the ending -- the team/player succeeds in their goal or the team/player fails, but a lesson is learned. So what else do you bring to the table that will give your movie substance and avoid being just a cliché sports movie? <br/><br/>Going into Million Dollar Arm, I was actually really excited because Disney had been raving about this movie for quite some time. I'm happy to report that it passes this test with flying colors. First off, yes this is a movie that deserved to be made. And no, it's not just an ordinary event that was glorified. And while I'm at it, it seems pretty accurate to the actual events. This is a movie about a sports agent named JB Bernstein. He's in a pretty dire situation and needs to make a huge splash or else business-wise he is in a lot of trouble. Using Yao Ming's situation as inspiration, he decides to go on a quest to get the first Major League Baseball player from India. Just like all of China followed Yao Ming's journey in the NBA (he made the all-star team even when he didn't play most of the season because of fan voting in China), an MLB player from India would be equally as huge with how many people live there. With this idea in mind, Bernstein sets up the competition called the Million Dollar Arm, which is essentially a try-out where the top two throwers would get to come to America with the opportunity of trying out for an MLB team.<br/><br/>Is this a predictable sports movie? Of course. The events of this movie took place just a few years back and a quick wikipedia search can tell you all about these two players. But the point here isn't to throw a curveball at audiences. The main focus isn't even on telling the world about an extraordinary event that happened less than a decade ago. It's all about relationships. Bernstein is a single man that is all business at first. What he seems to have missed is that he's brought two human beings halfway across the world just to make a successful business move. These two Indian boys are still teenagers that have never been away from home, at least not so far away from home. They are scared, nervous, alone, and don't even know the language at first. This is an emotional roller-coaster for everyone involved and watching it unfold is touching and beautiful.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work is the performances from all the actors. It's a grand slam performance. Starting from the top, Jon Hamm plays JB Bernstein and if this movie came out in the fall, I'd say he'd be a good contender for Best Actor at the Oscars. It'd be a deserving nomination. Lake Bell plays the neighbor/love interest for JB. She does a fantastic job as the mediator between JB and the boys, helping JB come down to earth to treat the boys right. Finally, our two Indian players, Rinku and Dinesh are played by Indian actors Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal. These two are the stars of the show. From the very beginning, you become emotionally invested in them and their journey. You want them succeed. You cheer for them when they perform well. You are devastated when they slip up. You scream inside at Jon Hamm when he treats them poorly. You fall in love with Lake Bell when she takes them in. Sharma and Mittal are fairly new in the acted business; however, they are not unrecognizable. Sharma plays the lead role of Pi Patel in Life of Pi and Mittal shows up in Slumdog Millionaire. There's also other great performances in this movie from the likes of Aasif Mandvi, Alan Arkin, Bill Paxton and Tzi Ma, but this will suffice.<br/><br/>Overall, Million Dollar Arm is a movie that is a must see in my opinion. Yes, there are a ton of huge summer blockbusters in the next month or two that will all fight for your attention, but don't let this movie slip past you. If for some reason you find yourself tired of all the huge blockbusters, then this is definitely a movie that you should check out, because it will be a breath of fresh air. Even if you are not a sports fan, I think this is a movie that you will love, because like I said, it's all about the relationships in the movie as opposed to the historical sporting event that is portrayed. If this movie were to come out at the end of the year, I would think it would be the type of movie that contends for an Oscar nomination or two. It's that good. It will certainly join the ranks of all the great sports movies. My grade for Million Dollar Arm is a 9/10.<br/><br/>For more reviews like this, go to drogemiester.blogspot.com"
"l_rawjalaurence","6","29","37","21 September 2014"," Likable Film, Although it Does Perpetuate Stereotypes
","In terms of content, it's hard not to like MILLION DOLLAR ARM. There's a winning performance from Jon Hamm as the harassed agent trying his best to re-establish himself, while discovering the importance of looking after his charges; complemented by Lake Bell as the next- door neighbor, the intern who understands more about the young Indian boys' predicament of inhabiting a completely alien culture. As the two boys, Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal are particularly good at communicating - often through nonverbal means - their sheer bewilderment once they are transplanted from their rural Indian surroundings to metropolitan Los Angeles. Although they eventually make a success of their quest to become major league baseball pitchers, they nonetheless find it difficult to adapt to alien surroundings.<br/><br/>And yet there is a strong sense in which Craig Gillespie's film serves to perpetuate rather than negotiate stereotypes about the Indian nation and its people, and the Americans' responses to it. Hamm's JB is predictably confused by the disorganized ways in which the Indian people do business, especially in his interactions with Vivek (Darshan Jariwala). By implication, therefore, the American (i.e. efficient) ways, are naturally superior. Meanwhile aging coach Ray (Alan Arkin) rejects the Indian way of life altogether, as he complains about the prospect of contracting the so-called ""Delhi belly"" (an upset stomach), and returns to America on the first available flight.<br/><br/>Once the Indian boys are transplanted to the United States, they are frequently used as butts for cheap jokes; there is one scene in a hotel, where they experience problems with the elevator, which is particularly orientalist in tone. The film seems not to be aware of contemporary realities; in economic terms India is no longer a backward country but gradually becoming an economic superpower in its own right. <br/><br/>Nonetheless the film does make an effort to recognize the strengths of Indian cultures; the emphasis on family stability and the ability to converse contrasts starkly with JB's life, in which he is so busy that he has little time either to consider marriage or even to talk to anyone at length. The Indian characters also take time for daily prayers; the contemplative life is as significant as the active life in human beings. Perhaps the western world has become too secular to understand this.<br/><br/>MILLION DOLLAR ARM is an ambivalent piece, at once celebratory of yet still reluctant to recognize the strength of contemporary Indian cultures. Yet it's still worth a look."

","Regardless of how people say the film was a Disney Film, predictable, etc, unaware of this true story, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Being an Indian student in America, the film connected me to my culture in India. The background music, the sentiment, and the portrayal of Indian traditions made me feel nostalgic of how I miss my home back in India. All I can say is that watching this movie made me feel like I was in India enjoying this experience with Rinku and Dinesh! The music was excellent. AR Rahman killing it as usual! Suraj Sharma has a bright acting future and Amit looked very cute. Excellent film! Go India!"
"rtp4242","6","9","10","19 May 2014"," Million Dollar Arm. Making a pitch for a new audience.
","JB Bernstein (Jon Hamm) is a sports agent, venturing out on his own to start his own sports management agency, with his partner Aash (Aasif Mandvi). He has represented stars like Emmitt Smith and Barry Sanders, but they have long since retired. JB is looking to sign a lineman named Popo (Ray Maualuga) but Popo signs with another agent, so JB is left with no clients, and no prospects. While watching a cricket match and Britain's Got Talent, JB hatches an idea to sign an Indian baseball player, and turn it into a reality contest, called Million Dollar Arm. <br/><br/>After finding a crotchety, old, retired baseball scout named Ray, (Alan Arkin) JB heads to India to find his prospects. He and Ray find 20 prospects, and whittle it down to two, Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Maddhur Mittal) and a translator named Amit (Pitobash) who dreams of being a baseball coach. Together, the four go back to Los Angeles, where pitching coach Tom House (Bill Paxton agrees to work with Rinku and Dinesh, and they have a year to get a tryout, or the deal with their financier, Chang (Tzi Ma) falls through. Do Rinku and Dinesh succeed? Is JB more interested in the deal or in Rinku or Dinesh as people?<br/><br/>Disney is marketing this movie as a cross between Slumdog Millionaire and Jerry Maguire. It is very much like Jerry Maguire, but it's more like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, because the Brits are openly contemptuous of India and Indians much like JB is, but gradually a transformation occurs and the Brits in Marigold Hotel learn to love the country and its customs. Does the same transformation happen here? Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. But let me say this Marigold Hotel is a much better movie, a much more deep and profound movie. Maybe Million Dollar Arm is neither deep nor profound, but it is entertaining. There are laughs to be had here, and it's a different kind of baseball movie. It's fun to see two people who've never thrown a baseball before pick up a vital aspect of the game in such a short time. If you don't like baseball, this movie won't hold much entertainment for you, and while it's not Field of Dreams or Bull Durham, it is fun.<br/><br/>There's a lot of culture clash/fish out of water humor, both with Hamm's character and the Indian boys. I don't particularly enjoy fish out of water humor, and it doesn't particularly work here, but the movie works because of the acting, and not so much the script. Is it an entertaining movie? Yes it is. Is it worth going to the movies to see? No it's not. But it is worth the price of a rental.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm is good, he doesn't stray too far from his Don Draper character, believe it or not. He plays JB as a superficial womanizer who only dates models. He plays a ""Grade A Jerk"" in the words of this movie, and if I was JB Bernstein, I wouldn't be too flattered by this portrayal. Lake Bell plays a woman who rents a room from Hamm's character and serves as some comedy relief and eventually a love interest, but the love story is clunky. Lake Bell reminds me of Amanda Peet, a pretty girl who's trying too hard to be funny. Alan Arkin plays a crusty old curmudgeon again. He seems to have found a niche. Asif Mandvi is less funny than I thought he'd be, and therefore disappointing. <br/><br/>The best actors in the film are the Indian actors, Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal and Pitobash as the translator. Their natural performances add a lot of depth and emotional weight to the film. The boys are away from home, they miss their families, but they have a once in a lifetime chance. Their performances are complex in ways I didn't expect. And Pitobash shows sincerity in this performance, he really wants to learn about baseball. He has a dream too, and he's realizing it through his countrymen. Bill Paxton does an excellent job as pitching coach Tom House. He doesn't want this to be a publicity stunt, he wants this to work for everyone involved. Paxton plays House with a no-nonsense intensity, which is refreshing.<br/><br/>Finally here's a non-animated film that you can watch with your family, and it's worth seeing. Was Disney doing a little marketing themselves? Selling this movie to the growing Indian community in the US and a huge international audience in India? I didn't see many Indian people in the audience at my theater, but it made 10 million dollars in it's first week, not bad for a film going up against Godzilla.<br/><br/>For more hardball reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

","Actually a very effective movie. It's got some great performances along with a great script. Its funny at times and keeps you entertained At times though moments are stretched and it is very predictable. Hamm gives a good strong performance and Arkin just cracked me up! It's not the best movie in the world but its worth giving a look. I think down the road it will be looked at as very underrated and it has a reason. The reason is that this movie is how a movie should be, a funny, smart, family drama with good performances and leaves you with a feel good mood after exiting the theater. Its appropriate for all audiences And sometimes thats all a movie needs."

","Another year, another attempt from the studios to bring out a feel-good sports film. In 2014, they have succeeded with, ""Million Dollar Arm,"" a movie based off factual accounts. I really liked this movie for a variety of reasons. I am always fascinated by Indian culture, and the movie shows the Bollywood culture to a true extent. Baseball is my favorite sport, and just seeing people learning to play the game is pure delight. The film itself is provoking, as well as intelligent, funny, and just a well-crafted movie despite its predictable outcome. <br/><br/>Craig Gillepsie's film is about a sports agent who is down on his luck and is losing money fast. His final play involves starting a program to teach Indian cricket players baseball so they can be scouted by MLB. But J.B Bernstein finds out it is a lot harder than he thought as these Indian players must get used to a foreign sport and an alien culture. <br/><br/>Jon Hamm does a great job in the lead role as J.B. Sure, his character is self-centered, but Hamm plays him well. Lake Bell had a few great scenes as a possible romantic interest of J.B. Alan Arkin cracked me up as the grumpy elderly scout. I also liked Suraj Sharma who know delivers back-to-back Hollywood performances with this film and ""Life of Pi."" <br/><br/>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Million Dollar Arm. It's a fun, clever sports movie that has a typical Disney ""feel-good"" tone to it. I also liked the culture clash that is presented in the movie between the Indian and American cultures. The film presents an unique opportunity to learn about Indian culture and I appreciated that. A funny, entertaining sports movie. <br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
"forbes-16","9","10","16","17 May 2014"," Touching and Entertaining
","This film is based on the true story about Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel, two young men from India who leave their homeland after winning a baseball competition. <br/><br/>I'll give you a slightly different perspective, since I am not a sports fan. However, I value and appreciate a good movie with a sports theme when I see one (i.e. Glory Road, The Blind Side, etc), especially when it is based on a true story. This is one of them. I loved it. <br/><br/>SPOILER <br/><br/>When it comes to the try-outs for a chance to win thousands of dollars and a trip to America, thousands pitch for the cameras but don't make it. These young people might not have any ""hope"" of making it, but they try it. They give it their all. They have fun. A few make it to the finals, showing they have talent. Many showed potential but only two passed the test. <br/><br/>It's what happened next that affirmed this was a good movie - that moment when something happens to your emotion button and tears flow. I could only imagine what it might have been like for the families of these two young men to bid farewell. Disney et al gotcha! This was nicely done. <br/><br/>But that's not what this movie's all about. There are several important themes - sports, politics, relationships, greed, naivety, etc - that happen throughout the story, and then they all come together. And the humour is great. <br/><br/>One thing I would have liked it to see Rinku and Dinesh in a real game as part of the movie. Just don't leave the theatre as soon as the movie is done, as there are some film footage and photos of the real Rinku and Dinesh. That is always a bonus in a movie like this. <br/><br/>It's a good movie worth seeing."
"rgkarim","8","5","7","17 May 2014"," Disney Hits A Grand Slam Predictable Tale
","Disney seems to have their hands in every pot these days with animation, superhero movies, even Star Wars is in the plans these days. However tonight's review is all about Disney's sports movie genre. Now with classics like Remember the Titans and Miracle, we've seen the studios make history come alive, yet the current focus for many sports movies is moving out of the arena and going behind the scenes of the athletic world. Today I share my thoughts on Million Dollar Arm, another addition to the baseball movie franchise. . <br/><br/>Now we all know Disney, they like to open up a film, most of the time, by showing the protagonist being down on their luck, and this film is no different. After a client decides to look at a different company to sponsor him, JB (Jon Hamm) is forced to take a gamble on recruiting the first Major League players from India. With the help of his crew, he manages to find Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal), two boys with big dreams and big hearts, who are forced to take a trip that will challenge all of their characters. <br/><br/>Will they do it? I'm not telling you, but Disney has combined a variety of things to make a great story for you to enjoy. First thing to mention is the blending of cultures. Director Craig Gillepsie has crafted a film that shows off the lifestyles of both Americans and Indians alike. The comparison and contrast of these cultures is beautifully captured on film, often accompanied by a score that compliments the customs and feel of the scene. While Disney still has a way of adding sappy, everything is happy moments; they alleviate such antics with comedy relief, often throwing insults to both cultures in a classy way that keeps the movie fun. This balanced blend is much appreciated, as it keeps the movie fresh and avoids making the movie a two-hour snooze fest. <br/><br/>However the cinematography is not just about showing off the unique settings, but also assisting in bringing the characters to life. Of course acting helps with characters as well, and Million Dollar Arm has a strong cast to support the story. Hamm has the most dynamic role, forced to transition between various qualities, as his character evolves over the course of the film. Sharma and Mittal, do a nice job playing the boys discovering a new world who bear a heavy weight of making their country/families proud. Pitobash and Alan Arkin are the comedy stars, each delivering the lines with well-timed emphasis that adds the kick to make the scene funny, especially when it's not beaten over your head (take notes people, more doesn't mean better). Finally the lovely Lake Bell cleans up for the main crew. A combination of beauty and acting, Bell's character Brenda provides confidence, rationality, and fun that makes you feel energized no matter what consequences may arise. The chemistry between all of them is incredible, and very balanced to craft a family you will fall in love with. <br/><br/>Of course this is a Disney movie and that means, especially when it comes to real life movies, inspirational moments. Million Dollar Arm is filled to the brim with moments that will make you want to go out and fight for your dreams. As custom to Disney, these scenes are often elaborate, with great emphasis on the characters challenges, struggles, or skills. Close ups on their faces are often followed by sequences of audience members watching in suspense, including skeptical scouts and coaches, trying to bring you into the scene. And of course, Disney quickly offsets such suspense, with a light hearted gimmick that helps relieve the tension you might be feeling. Such feel good moments are old hat for Disney, especially with the music score they choose to play alongside the scene, but at the end of the movie you will get a warm feeling in your heart that might bring a tear to your eye. <br/><br/>Yet like their heartwarming scenes, Million Dollar Arm is a predictable story filled with obvious foreshadowing and build-up to what comes next. Those who don't pay attention to obvious cues may be surprised by the outcomes, but otherwise don't expect many twists in this story. Also the stakes for failure seem to be high in the movie, yet when they actually fail, the consequences do not reflect the tone the characters make and are often blown over. Perhaps it's because they wanted a quicker movie, or perhaps just wanted to keep it upbeat, but there is a lack of bite to this film. Even when JB goofs up and upsets his ""family"" there is no edge, just quick a resolve that makes everything suddenly okay. A final, minor weakness, is that this movie is like all the other Disney sports movies you've seen. The formula is still the same and the lack of a new approach takes away the uniqueness of the film<br/><br/>Regardless of the weaknesses, Million Dollar Arm is a good movie that is great for audiences of all ages. The chemistry between the actors should pull you into their little group, having you root for the team, as they embark on their journey. Throw in the comedy and a little love story, and you've got something for everyone to enjoy. Yes, it's still Disney's ""magical"" approach to everything, but I assure you that this movie will put a smile on your face and entertain you nonetheless. So if you're looking for a film this weekend, I give two thumbs up for Million Dollar Arm! <br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Biography/Drama/Sports: 7.5 Movie Overall: 8.0"

","Million Dollar Arm is a biographical sports drama about baseball pitchers Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel who were discovered by sports agent J.B. Bernstein after winning a reality show competition in India.It stars Jon Hamm together with Aasif Mandvi,Bill Paxton,Suraj Sharma,Madhur Mittal,Lake Bell and Alan Arkin.This Walt Disney Pictures produced film is directed by Craig Gillespie.<br/><br/>JB Bernstein is a once-successful sports agent who now finds himself edged out by bigger, slicker competitors. He and his partner Aash will have to close their business down for good if JB doesn't come up with something fast. One night,he came up with an idea of going to India. Late one night, while watching cricket being played in India on TV, JB comes up with an idea so radical it just might work. Why not go to there and find the next baseball pitching sensation? Setting off for Mumbai with nothing but a gifted but cantankerous scout in tow, JB stages a televised, nationwide competition called ""Million Dollar Arm"" where 40,000 hopefuls compete before two 18- year-old finalists, Rinku and Dinesh, emerge as winners. JB brings them back to the United States to train with legendary pitching coach Tom House. The goal: get the boys signed to a major league team. Not only is the game itself difficult to master, but life in the U.S. with a committed bachelor makes things even more complicated-for all of them. While Rinku and Dinesh learn the finer points of baseball and American culture, they in turn teach JB the true meaning of teamwork and commitment. Ultimately, what began as a purely commercial venture becomes something more and leads JB to find the one thing he was never looking for at all-a family.<br/><br/>This is definitely an inspirational sports Disney movie.It is charming to a fault and watchable as it provides inspiration to people to achieve the goals they have set in life.Also,the movie successfully manages to mix emotion and comedy to move the viewer.Overall,it definitely scores a home run as a baseball film."

",". . . and his jaded, semi-retired baseball scout character ""Ray"" in the current MILLION DOLLAR ARM is no exception. Based on a true story, ARM explores how a vast country on the verge of becoming the most populous on earth can get about half of America's formerly good-paying jobs through out-sourcing and YET NOT HAVE A SINGLE PLAYER on any major league baseball team (or NFL football, NBA basketball, or NHL hockey, for that matter). It's not as if major league athletes are paid peanuts nowadays. Thanks to their proudly-worn Union label, the thousands of major league pros AVERAGE MORE THAN A MILLON BUCKS PER MAN!! How then has the suction effect of globalization that has swirled the livelihoods of so many non-famous middle class Americans down the toilet to the other side of the world NOT managed to fill at least half the pro athlete slots with Indians from India?

","I saw ""Million Dollar Arm"", starring Jon Hamm-Mad Men_t.v., Sucker Punch; Lake Bell-No Strings Attached, Boston Legal_t.v.; Aasif Mandvi- Premium Rush, The Last Airbender and Bill Paxton-Haywire, True Lies.<br/><br/>This is a Disney movie that is based on a true story about a sports agent, Jon, that goes to India to try and find the next big major league baseball pitcher. Jon is having some money problems since he lost his last big football client and really needs to get some new clients. Almost all of the major foreign countries have been depleted of future sports talent by other scouts so he figures, why not try India? He discovers that the people in India love the game of cricket-which involves throwing a ball-and he thinks that it might not be a giant leap for them to pitching a baseball. Jon takes a trip to India and has a talent hunt, in the form of a reality type t.v. show called Million Dollar Arm, in which the winner will win a trip to America and the chance to play in the major leagues . Aasif plays Jon's business partner, Bill is a trainer and Lake plays, literally, the girl next door to Jon that becomes his love interest. There is a lot of humor using the fish out of water themes, what with the Americans in India-getting sick on the food-and the Indians in America-they are not familiar with a lot of our conveniences. During the end credits, they show both pictures and video of the real players from India that the movie is based on, and they also tell you what happened to them. It's rated ""PG"" for some mild language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. It's a nice Disney family style movie and I would probably buy it on DVD."

"anagpal","6","6","14","10 May 2014"," Baseball with an Indian flavour in a Disney fairytale
","Feel good, fun film, very predictable but still manages to hold attention thanks to its Indian flavor and the self-discovery some of the characters go through, particularly Jon Hamm.<br/><br/>Jon is a sports agent down to his last throw of dice when he convinces a Chinese entrepreneur (Tzi Ma) to fund a search for new baseball pitcher from India's vast pool of cricket bowlers, setting it up as a talent hunt, criss-crossing the country. After many a hiccup, they finally narrow it down to 2 candidates, Suraj and Madhur and whisk them, along with Pitobash (a wanna be baseball coach, translator) to the USA to get them to train, get ready for a tryout in a very tight deadline. Things don't go exactly as planned and Jon at one point complains about having signed up for a talent contest, not to become a primary care-giver. <br/><br/>His business partner, Aasif (remember him from Ghost Town ?) and tenant, Lake Bell, are the ones helping keep things on track, while Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton as the baseball scout and coach, try to help with their wise counsel, while Darshan Jariwala plays a cameo. <br/><br/>This is a film that doesn't really go deep but keeps things moving while skimming through what the characters are going through. The adjustment issues – Jon's to India and then later for the Indian trio in America are humorously and quickly told. The relationship between Jon and Lake – beginning with a broken down washing machine, then Skype and later at home is crucial to the plot. And most fascinating of all is watching Jon's character, the deal hungry, self-centered sports agent, try and figure out what life is about – of course, with a few helpful nudges from friends<br/><br/>Sport movies usually suffer from predictable endings and this one is no exception. It drags a bit in the second half too but the music score by A R Rahman helps gloss over that. It's a true story apparently but one, surprisingly not too many Indians are aware of, so in that sense, the chief objective of doing the talent hunt, to popularize baseball in India, doesn't really seem to have worked. Unfortunately, going by the low key promotion, release and the small crowds, even the film wont help do that here<br/><br/>More at ApurvBollywood at blogspot"
"Prismark10","5","2","3","2 May 2015"," Not the right throw
","I guess Hollywood has run out of film ideas concerning the prejudice black people suffered in various sports so now they have turned to the inspiring true story of people from cricket loving India trying to break into professional baseball.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm plays the struggling sports agent who hits upon an idea of launching a talent contest to find baseball talent in India and then bringing them over to the USA and train them for the major league.<br/><br/>The film has location shooting in India as Hamm tagged along with a snoozing Alan Arkin looks for pitchers with the right throwing arm. We have scenes of Mumbai, Agra with the obligatory Taj Mahal.<br/><br/>When he finds two pitchers we have the cultural clash as they try to adapt to life in the States as well as impressing the big league scouts as Hamm and his partner stave off money troubles.<br/><br/>The film has a side plot of Hamm trying to sign a major league player which echoes Jerry Maguire right to the bit where the player signs with a bigger agency as Hamm is diverted to look after his other charges.<br/><br/>There is nothing original in the story. In fact it's downright predictable with only the idea of getting players from India being novel. It also felt too long which led me to believe the film was padded.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm and Aasif Mandvi give a lot of conviction as the struggling sports agents. Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal have the right balance of sweet eyed innocence, young people leaving a village life in search to hit the jackpot in the lottery of life."

","Just saw this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this true story of a sports agent's going to India to find a couple of potential baseball players to take to America. Jon Hamm plays the leading character with charm despite his not-too-subtle way of sometimes coming off as a jerk. The players picked to play the baseball athletes and English interpreter were also quite compelling. And I also liked Lake Bell as the border of Hamm's who might just win his heart and Alan Arkin as the retired talent scout who also teaches Hamm a thing or two. Oh, and Bill Paxton as the coach. And the whole India scenery also was fascinating to watch. So on that note, I highly recommend Million Dollar Arm."

"bkoganbing","9","2","3","20 May 2014"," Indians want to be Pirates
","The story of how Babe Ruth took an all star team to tour Japan in 1934 is well known and how baseball spread there. Now Japanese stars are coming to the USA for the big bucks and have become accepted. Latin Americans were here before and now we have Australians playing in the Big Show as well.<br/><br/>I imagine it was only a matter of time before someone sought to popularize baseball in India, a place where British cricket is played and is the popular team sport. This is a true story about how Jon Hamm's character went to India as a business promotion to bring back a pair of the Indian equivalent of Jackie Robinson.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Arm follows the Japanese tradition in that Japan came to Major League baseball via the pitching route. It was years before position players started to fill the ranks of the Major Leagues. I guess Hamm's character figured that baseball could wait for an Indian shortstop or outfielder. It was a pitcher that the contest was geared for and two prospects Hamm got in Suraj Sharma and Maddur Mittal.<br/><br/>The two Indian actors were quite charismatic and appealing as the Indian kids who carry a lot of hopes and dreams with them. They might not have to face what Jackie Robinson faced or what the first out gay player in the Major Leagues might face, but still the culture shock for these two is quite real.<br/><br/>Two other roles of note are Bill Paxton as a baseball coach who tutors them in the fine art of pitching and Adam Arkin as the somewhat jaded old baseball scout who can tell the quality of the fast ball by its pop in the glove.<br/><br/>Of course sooner or later some Indian kid will develop the knuckleball of Hoyt Wilhelm and Arkin's theories will blow up.<br/><br/>I'm always up for a good baseball movie and Million Dollar Arm is a very good one indeed."
"zkonedog","4","1","1","4 March 2017"," I Really Wanted To Like This Movie, But...
","I saw this movie in theaters for two reasons: 1. I'm a huge baseball fan; and 2. I watch Med Men (i.e. the Jon Hamm factor). Even after 20 or so minutes, when I knew exactly what this movie would be, I still really, really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, this one is schmaltzy ""Disney"" through and through.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Million Dollar Arm"" tells the story of how sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) starts a competition called Million Dollar Arm in order to find a major league baseball player from the relatively untapped market of India. The two athletes he finds, Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal), are in for quite a culture shock as they travel to America for the first time and have to essentially learn baseball from scratch.<br/><br/>First of, let me be clear in that I'm not attaching a star-ranking to the overall story here. It is truly a fascinating and inspiring tale for baseball fans and human-interest fans alike.<br/><br/>As a movie, though, ""Million Dollar Arm"" falls far short of being great. The main problem? It doesn't have a clear focus, so it tries to do too much and doesn't really nail anything. This could have been a hard-core baseball fan movie. It could have been a love story. It could have been a redemption story. It could have been a new culture assimilation piece. Had the filmmakers looked at the story through just one of those three scopes (and just bolstered it with shades of the others), it would really have worked.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, director Craig Gillespie (or maybe the Disney producers) tries to cram every single theme possible into one movie. It really feels like the old ""throw the kitchen sink at 'em"" method in terms of trying to evoke every possible emotion from the audience. I realize that this movie is supposed to have a broad, family-based appeal, but but focusing on everything the producers ended up focusing on nothing.<br/><br/>The two biggest wastes in this movie? 1. Hamm, a terrific actor who plays as transparent of a character as one can see on screen; and 2. The fact that hard-core baseball fans like myself will not enjoy the baseball aspects of this movie. It is made for the family set first and foremost.<br/><br/>Thus, though I wanted very badly to enjoy this movie and all the right pieces existed for that to happen, they just didn't come together. The ""Indian culture"" angle was interesting, but not nearly as compelling as, say, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and recently baseball-themed movies like ""Trouble with the Curve"" and ""Moneyball"" will appeal much more to the die-hards."

","It's rather like a cable TV movie, which starts out funny, becomes a bit gloomy, and then ends on a transcendent note. And there's not an unpredictable moment in it.<br/><br/>That's not necessarily bad. When we encounter a ritualized narrative like this, it can be relaxing. There may not be thrills galore or laugh galore or anything else galore, but it's a fixed point in a changing and disappointing universe, like a church service.<br/><br/>John Hamm is a sports agent or some kind of promoter who is running short of clients and needs to find a super pitcher to sell to a baseball team. He's all business. That's why he's able to drive a gold-plated Bugatti and live in a Los Angeles house that Frank Sinatra might have approved of. He has a sexy tenant living in a cottage in his backyard but he has no time for her,.<br/><br/>So, with the backing of an inscrutable Oriental angel, he goes to India and recruits two young guys who bowl at cricket games. They've got speed up the मलाशय but they're wild. Their pitches go all over the place.<br/><br/>The naive kids are brought back to Lower California and subject to discipline and training. Hamm shows little interest in their progress because he's too involved with pimping his services to other clients. The kids are terribly homesick. They've never seen a big city; they don't know what a baseball mitt is. They eat too much pizza or accidentally drink alcohol and puke in his spiffy sports car.<br/><br/>The inscrutable Oriental insists that the agreed-upon time limit is observed but the kids aren't quite ready and they fail their first public test because they are nervous. A cloud of gloom. Hamm is angry. The Indians are ashamed.<br/><br/>Cherchez la femme. Lake Bell emerges from the cottage in the back yard, gets to know the kids, seduces Hamm, and together Bell and the Indians humanize Hamm. He gives up all his other clients and fully commits himself to the job. The kids throw him a lavish party and Bell is Hamm's date. She wears a sari and sports a bindhi.<br/><br/>And they all live happily ever after -- we're led to believe.<br/><br/>I can't really recommend it because so little of it shows any originality, but the performances are pretty good. Alan Arkin shows up long enough to collect his paycheck. John Hamm could be interesting in another cinematic context. He sort of looks like a movie star and has a husky voice. It would be nice to see if he has any range or whether he's headed for television. I didn't find Lake Bell's character appealing -- perceptive, candid, full of common sense. And her voice is that of a locomotive grinding to a halt.<br/><br/>But if you don't feel like answering a challenge, if you just want to stretch out and watch a warm film full of human interest, this is your huckleberry."

Million dollar arm is exactly what I needed for my Sunday evening, when my mind was already thinking about my next day at work. <br/><br/>A sports agent (Jon Ham) is on the edge of going out of business but he has a big idea: he will go to India to find talented kids, who can pitch like a National baseball league player as part of the ""Million dollar arm"" campaign. Everything goes from bad to worse, as you would expect, but after going around the country for days or weeks, he finally comes across two boys who seem to have what it takes. Neither of them has ever played baseball or any sports alike but Jon Ham takes them to the USA regardless. <br/><br/>They will spend the following months learning how to play baseball for a trial in front of professional teams at the end of it. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for them to leave their old life behind once and for all, to make the billions of Indians who are following them proud, and to save Jon Ham from a hopeless future.<br/><br/>It's not hard to imagine the clichés you will encounter in this movie: the man that is old but still has the best eye (or ear in this case) for spotting talent, the girl next door who is sweet and kind and makes Jon ham more human, the stereotypes about Indians, etc <br/><br/>I was hoping also for a moment of fist pumping at some stage but I never saw it.

R. Rahman which is narrative complimenting, excellent and somewhat better than 'Slumdog Millionaire' in my view.

"TheSquiss","5","2","4","30 September 2014"," Adequate, against all odds, feel-good baseball flick for a rainy Sunday afternoon.
","After a hitherto very successful TV career, Million Dollar Arm was presumably supposed to do for John Hamm what Batman and Robin was supposed to achieve for a post-er George Clooney. It won't. It's certainly a far, far better film (though that in itself is neither hard nor a great selling point) but Hamm lacks the charm, charisma and versatility of Clooney (who overcame almost the biggest clunk of 1997) and Million Dollar Arm is neither good enough to be universally celebrated, nor bad enough to be derided. What Million Dollar Arm is, is a pleasant, feel good(ish), based-on-truth yarn in which Hamm plays an updated, slightly softer Don Draper.<br/><br/>In 2008, with a sports agency floundering against the tide of bigger competitors, JB Bernstein (John Hamm) is inspired by the emerging crop of TV reality shows and hits upon the idea of creating his own in order to save his business and make his mark; essentially becoming the Simon Cowell of baseball. He quickly realises the major flaw in his plan: baseball is pretty much covered in the USA and the big boys have snapped up anyone with any talent long ago.<br/><br/>What JB requires is an untapped market that doesn't know it needs baseball in its life. Enter India, the home of all things cricket. After an arduous search, JB selects two aspiring cricketers, Rinku Singh (Suraj Shama) and Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal), and whisks them back to America where he must work to transfer their skills to baseball, make their dreams come true and, in the process, find his own humanity.<br/><br/>There is nothing in Million Dollar Arm that we haven't seen countless times before, but because it carries before it a banner proclaiming 'This really happened' we forgive director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) for its predictability. It isn't necessary to know or love baseball to enjoy Million Dollar Arm any more than you needed to be a quizmaster to enjoy Slumdog Millionaire, but it in this case it probably helps. That said, Gillespie has carefully crafted a film to appeal to the Sunday afternoon feet up masses. It requires little thought, only moderate emotional investment and you know from the outset, though you may try to fool yourself to heighten the excitement, that all will work out well. Why else would Disney stump up the cash? Disney doesn't do failure! <br/><br/>There is much to enjoy but little to inspire or satisfy. The performances are adequate but predictably overshadowed by Alan Arkin's familiar irascible old-timer cameo. The romance is plinky plonk and the against all odds, triumph in the face of adversity plot engages but doesn't tug at the heartstrings like, say, The Blind Side.<br/><br/>There is nothing here to dislike vehemently, but perhaps that would make Million Dollar Arm a more memorable film. There just isn't anything on display to be really passionate about, good or bad. Save it for a rainy Sunday when the belly is too full for a hike across the moors.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","This was a decent feel good sports movie based on a true story. A struggling sports agent travels to India to check out cricket bowlers in order to convert them into baseball pitchers. The two ""winners"" are taken back to the States and baseball spring training camps. Imevitable culture clashes, misunderstandings, and hilarity ensues.
I loved the scenes in India, the ""tryout"" scenes, and where the scout stumps the guy in India with a basic baseball question.
This is a good family sports movie that will satisfy anyone. I enjoyed it.

","When I saw the credits in the beginning of the movie and I saw it was a Disney movie I feared the worst because that's normally not the kind of movies I like. But since it was based on a true story it makes it a bit different and more enjoyable to watch. And I have to admit it was a good movie. A bit predictable but nonetheless an enjoyable feelgood movie about the two first Indians becoming professional baseball players. Even my wife that hates baseball and most sports in general thought it was a lovely story. You don't need to love baseball to appreciate Million Dollar Arm. The cast did a good job and the filming was very professional. You feel immediately an immense sympathy for the Indian characters. If you like feelgood stories with a happy ending than you should watch this one."

","A struggling sports agent is at the end of his rope, which forces him to get creative and try a gamble no one has ever tried before. He figures that he needs a new and upcoming baseball star pronto, but where would one find one. Then he figures that India as a country is a huge untapped market and surely he can travel there, hold auctions and find someone who's able to pitch a mean ball.<br/><br/>And from thereon out it's the tried, true and patented Disney sports film formula played to death in front of your eyes. You know exactly how the story is going to go from minute one. Sure, it's not a kid's film per se, so the main character is allowed to be a bit of a jerk and there can be scenes where people are not covered from head to toe in conservative clothing, but it's still squeaky clean and safe. And I have nothing against the Disney formula, but it still means that the film is very much paint by numbers.<br/><br/>That being said, the film is based on true events, which gives it a bit more oomph. India as a country is given a fair treatment, the two Indian baseball players given a chance to break into the American leagues are a lot of fun, the main character is likable despite or perhaps because of his jerkiness.<br/><br/>Would I recommend the movie to anyone?

","Baseball and cricket, two vastly different sports from totally different countries. The two sports are integrated into one movie in Craig Gillespie's Million Dollar Arm. In the movie Million Dollar Arm, J.B. Bernstein must find a client to sign or his career as a sports agent will be over. J.B. invests all his time and effort into finding a cricket star who he hopes to turn into a major league baseball player. To find his golden goose, he holds a contest called the Million Dollar Arm in order to find someone who can throw a ball both accurately and quickly enough to compete in the major league. J.B. eventually stumbles upon two potential clients, Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel who prove to be promising clients. The two Indian boys must overcome the overwhelming American culture, while J.B. must mother and coach the two eighteen year old boys. Although Million Dollar Arm may seem like any other cliché sports movie with an underdog, the film is much more than the stereotypes and is about culture, compassion, and risk.<br/><br/>J.B. Bernstein is a total wreck in the beginning of the movie. His life is a mess because he will lose his job if he does not find a client soon. He remembers what a friend was mentioning to him earlier in the week about cricket being extremely popular, so he watches cricket late at night and he has a brilliant idea to turn a cricket player into a baseball pitcher. To find the cricket player, he must travel to India, where cricket is extremely popular. J.B. Bernstein is overwhelmed by the vast culture of India and shares his unique experience with his neighbor, Brenda Fenwick, through video chat. India's culture is obviously quite different from America's, but J.B. Bernstein is too focused on finding his new client that he is blind to the fact. The boys are sent to stay at J.B.'s house since they had no where else to go. J.B. is furious at first, but his neighbor helps him to understand that the boys are just kids and are a far way from home and are homesick in a brand new environment. J.B. is confused by a scent coming from the boys' room. They are praying with their heads bowed and had burned incense and J.B. does not know what to think of what the boys are doing.<br/><br/>Compassion is a key trait that J.B. must quickly adopt because he needs to look after two foreign children without any experience. After he discovers Rinku and Dinesh, he brings them back to America where the kids are overwhelmed by the huge transition into the United States. Dinesh and Rinku are even amused by something we, Americans, often overlook, an elevator. The kids are so amused that they play with the elevator several times and stick their arm between the doors as they are about to close so that the doors open. They find the doors opening to be magic and have never seen anything like it before. The hotel that they were staying in, with the elevator, later notified J.B. about a situation at the hotel. The boys cause a huge inconvenience to hotel staff and other guests by setting off an alarm. J.B. leaves them alone and they all go to a party later at night. J.B. is too caught up in his own job and maintaining his reputation that he loses sight of Rinku and Dinesh. They had wondered off at the party's and had eaten and drank a little too much. J.B. does not realize that the boys are feeling sick until someone tells him about a problem that the boys are causing. J.B. has to take them home, but on the ride home, the boys throw up in the car leaving J.B.'s new van covered in vomit. J.B. and the boys soon grow close with each other with the help from a translator named Amit. J.B. grows so close, that he even shares details about his complicated relationship with his neighbor, Brenda Fenwick. <br/><br/>J.B. takes a huge risk by going to India and bringing two boys overseas and training them to become MLB pitchers. He also risks his reputation as a sports agent and could make a potential fool of himself if this fails. At the boys' first MLB tryout, he looks crazy because the tryout is in the middle of a parking lot of a shopping mall and the boys pitch the ball very inaccurately. The boys are depressed at how poorly they performed, but J.B. takes another risk by assuring them that they will have another chance, but a lot of people begin to decline because they heard about the disaster in the shopping mall. However, he fortunately finds a tryout with other MLB scouts and they eventually are drafted to a team. Nevertheless, all J.B.'s mission was based on risk and found success with the slimmest of chances.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Arm was much more than an ordinary sports movie. It is about compassion, culture, and risk and also combines the qualities of a regular sports movie with hints of Disney throughout the movie."

","Million Dollar Arm By Jordon Wright<br/><br/>If you are looking for a sports movie that's funny and inspiring, then million-dollar arm is for you! This movie contains all the great things a movie should have, comedy, plot/background, and it's a true story. This movie is entertaining weather you know anything about sports or not. That's what make this movie so special as you can watch it with family, friends, or anyone regardless of their interest in baseball. Not only is this movie heartwarming to anyone that watches it but it will make you want to watch it again and again. <br/><br/>This movie has a compelling plot/ background story to it. Its very inspiration to everyone that watches this movie, which is based on a true story. The way that the characters' progress in this film is astonishing and the progress they make in baseball blows your mind how fast they do it. The main characters came from nothing one was a truck driver that worked for his dad and the other one was just going to school in India. They both had never picked up a baseball or even seen one before. They just took a chance so they could possibly get out and start a new life. They gave up everything they had and hopped on a plane to the USA to try and start their baseball carriers. Leaving behind all their family and friends and all their valuables just to try and start a new life. It is a very inspiring towards the end when you get to see how they end up doing with what they have worked so hard at.<br/><br/>All good movies have to have some humor to them, and throughout this entire film it will keep you laugh till the very end. The way the screenwriter integrate comedy into their film is truly great you will always have a smile on your face when watching this film. The humor involved in this film is in no way inappropriate to the younger generation so all ages can watch this movie and enjoy it.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this fantastic movie to you.

It's truly a great movie, and it is a must see movie."

But it was recommended to me by a good friend and it proved to be a sound tip. No knowledge of baseball (or cricket) is needed and indeed the film is not really about sport at all, but rather an examination of how chance and opportunity can change people's lives, whether it is poor young men in India or a middle-aged man in the States.<br/><br/>Unlike say a sports movie such as ""Moneyball"" with Brad Pitt, this is not a work fronted by any stars. Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal play real-life Pittsburg Pirates players Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel, while Jon Hamm is sports agent J. B. Bernstein. In an able cast, some more familiar faces - Alan Arkin, Bill Paxton, Lake Bell - appear in support roles. In a sense, the pitch for the film must have been similar to events it narrates: something that can appeal equally to audiences in the USA and India, the two most lucrative film markets in the world. It is formulaic and unoriginal but it works because it is so charming and amusing."

While this movie is very predictable, a little slow and doesn't have very many funny parts, the acting is very good, the story is a good one. It throws in a success story and a love story, two out of three of my favorite things in a movie. It would have been great to see more funny parts in the movie, but it's not what it was all about. While I like the fact that they had a story about two boys they brought from India to be successful pitchers here in the U.S. it reminded me of businesses that continue to outsource to other countries because they don't want to pay for the people here.

","You can give Million Dollar Arm a miss: I went to watch the movie expecting that the movie is the American Dream transpiring to the Indian Diaspora. Unfortunately the movie failed to live up even to my modest expectation. The movie shows India in a bad light and exaggerates poverty and bribery. Parts of the story are completely out of sync, for example, the movie never shows why the athlete Poco calls JBB again after they fall out in the beginning of the movie. It appears to be an after thought. India has much more to offer than chaos elephants and poverty. True India struggles with its issues but there should be sensitivity towards these. If the intent of the movie was to make baseball popular in India it has failed at this task miserably. It shoud've focused instead on Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel's success as baseball pitchers."

A down on his luck sports agent, Jon Hamm, goes to India to try and recruit a baseball pitcher in a contest called Million Dollar Arm. His scout, played by the always wonderful Alan Arkin, is a welcome addition to the cast. They also recruit a young Indian, Amit, played by Pitobash who is excellent in the roll, as the interpreter. After traveling all over India they find a couple of young men who are very raw but have potential. Of course they've never played baseball before so it's not going well. Enter Coach house played by Bill Paxton. He has six months to turn them into baseball players so they can have a try out with a major league team. Lake Bell as the love interest and nurturing influence has good chemistry with all the guys. Based on a true story (with, I imagine, plenty of literary license) it makes for a good, old fashioned uplifting movie. I've seen this now several times and enjoy it as much now as I did the first time I saw it. I'm not a huge baseball fan but it wasn't so much about the baseball as it was about second chances. Probably not for everyone but a good vehicle for Jon Hamm as he moves off the small screen and into movies."

","I thought this was a cute movie because of the young Indian men's precious responses to their new environment. I would be curious to see if beyond the baseball element, all the stuff took place. Did they stay with the guy? Did they get thrown out of the hotel? The actors are charming and lovable. Having been a baseball fan for 60 years, I can't believe that, as presented, these guys would be offered a contract. Unless it was to sell tickets or gain publicity. They can throw hard, but at no time do we see them with a batter in the batter's box or under game conditions. I would assume that if this is indeed a true story there would be more unseen than seen. I hate to be too critical, but I've always felt that a true sports movie must have credibility when it comes to the day to day requirements of the sport. There are also some really schmaltzy moments that are strictly to manipulate the audience."

","Million Dollar Arm (2014): Dir: Craig Gillespie / Cast: Jon Hamm, Lake Bell, Madhur Mittal, Suraj Sharma, Bill Paxton: Based on a true story with a title that physically references the arm strength of two Asian teens with arms for baseball pitching. It also refers to the Jon Hamm seeking them out and what his presence means to them. Hamm plays a sports agent down on his luck and after watching cricket on TV he decides to seek out talent in India. The culture references are interesting as Hamm settles in and produces a contest that would have the winners sent to America to train for baseball. There is two impressive contestants that are packed up and sent to the U.S where predictably, they don't fit in and Hamm constantly feeds them pizza because he doesn't know how to relate to them. That's not the end of it. We are given a useless romantic subplot with Lake Bell as a nurse neighbour and the idiotic hints at a relationship. She is all sweet and giddy and totally should have all her scenes in the deleted section on the DVD release. The best performances are from Madhur Mittal and Suraj Sharma as the two Asian potentials struggling to become the next big baseball stars. It is fun watching them try to adapt to Hamm's massive house but eventually we arrive at the obvious conclusion. Bill Paxton is also strong as a coach who is sceptical about the success rate of these two new players. Directed by Craig Gillespie who previously made such diverse films as Mr. Woodcock and Fright Night. Despite the formula Mittal and Sharma bring meaning to the opportunities they are given.

Bernstein, comes up with the idea of having a reality-show type competition finding Indian cricket players and turning them into pro baseball players in the U.S. He convinces one of his investors to go along with it.<br/><br/>At first, it's hopeless, but eventually they find two young men with great arms, though they don't play cricket, Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel. They travel to the U.S. to train and then compete.<br/><br/>It turns out to be more than just a competition, particularly for Bernstein, who realizes slowly that he's not doing his job right. He's treating the competition as a business and leaving the emotions of these boys dangling.<br/><br/>Well made if predictable film and a wonderful feel-good story of these young men, far from their country, homesick, trying to adapt to Los Angeles, baseball, American food, and big homes; and it's also the story of a smart but desperate man who loses sight of what's important.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm prejudiced, but I happen to think that Jon Hamm is an excellent actor. Granted, in the beginning, the character is closer to Don Draper in his shallowness; character differences are subtle. He's a little less formal and a little more energetic than Don. But like his Don Draper, his performance is multilayered. He's a very internalized actor, but when his character becomes angry, watch out.<br/><br/>Alan Arkin is hilarious, and Lake Bell is just right as the medical student next door.<br/><br/>The Indian actors do a tremendous job as young men taken out of their village and thrown into a strange world.

Gillespie who is perhaps most well-known for his Ryan Gosling oddity Lars and the Real Girl seems to reveal in the films set pieces, from the bustling streets of the ever chaotic India through to the green fields of American college sporting grounds, Gillespie gives the film a great tone.

You feel like your rooting for JB and these wannabe baseball players throughout the entire film and with great supports from Pitobash as over excited Amit and Alan Arkin as the never far from asleep baseball scout Ray, the film has a real winning feel from a cast perspective. The weak link of the movie and something that gets in the way of an at its core basic premise is Lake Bell as JB's potential love interest Brenda, this arc creates a few too many side acts to a story that doesn't benefit greatly from it.<br/><br/>A unique true story allows Million Dollar Arm to create something that doesn't feel stale, despite playing out in a very familiar and well-trodden sporting fashion.

","I don't follow sports all that closely so I never heard of this story when it occurred, even though it happened not that long ago. This is one of those 'stuff that dreams are made of' tales that almost seems like a fantasy written for the screen instead of real life. It's a pretty enjoyable movie and even though it sizes up as a sports film, it has more to do with relationships and how individuals of disparate backgrounds can find a commonality of purpose once a goal has been established. It's always interesting to see how people adapt to totally unfamiliar places and situations the way Rinku, Dinesh and Amit did upon arrival in the States. Obviously these young men from India were a long shot to make it in the Big Leagues, but you have to admire the tenacity and perseverance it took to relocate to a different country and try to fulfill the aspirations of yourself and others who believe in you.

","'Million Dollar Arm' is a formulaic feel-good sport movie produced by Disney, just like tons of other films that you can see every day on their TV channels.<br/><br/>The movie stars Jon Hamm as JB, a sport agent who comes to India to find new baseball talents to help his struggling career, and in the process, learns to enjoy life. Right from the first 10 minutes, you can already see a big problem with the movie's direction: its inconsistent tone. One moment it is all cheerful and comedic with Indian music in the background, and right in the next, it shifts to Jon Hamm's character angrily punching his driving wheel in the fashion of Brad Pitt in Moneyball. It's like the movie can't even decide whether it wants to be just a fun family film or a more daring and emotional one. And in the end, it became neither. It's not either comedic or exciting enough to be fun, and it's just far too safe to be really emotional. None of the characters, including the lead, ever really stray off-course. Everyone seems nice, understanding and reasonable. Even when there are some kinds of disagreement, JB will always come to his senses and sort things out shortly after.<br/><br/>As the result, it's quite clear after a while that's the movie doesn't really have anything to tell, and has to rely on cheesy drama to keep things going. And even then, instead of focusing on the direct relationship between JB and his Indian players, the movie cops out and uses Brenda, his tenant played by Lake Bell, to represent them and simplify all conflicts even further. <br/><br/>The only positive thing about 'Million Dollar Arm' is that it has a fairly good cast. Jon Hamm does his best with what little materials the role gives him, while Lake Bell and Pitobash are both surprisingly good in some scenes.<br/><br/>'Million Dollar Arm', like most formulaic Disney sport films, is not bad. It has its moment thanks to the cast, but there's really nothing memorable about it."

","American sports film and specially with sports like American Football, Baseball are hard to relate to a non American. But some films rise above the sport itself and it becomes more than the sport a human drama perhaps the last film to achieve this was brad pitt's money ball and Jerry McGuire before it.<br/><br/>John Ham does justice to the roll of a recruiter trying to get a buck to save his agency and as films go rises above his dreams of fortune to do something greater than that. . If you're looking for an exciting drama which grips you or something that makes you go whoa this is not it and nor does it give you the kick after watching the super bowl. But it definitely is a decent feel good film about a recruiter who gambles to get out of the grunts and the story of two young Indian boys who find their dream which they don't know was there's. <br/><br/>Worth a watch on lazy Sunday afternoon."

","Or ""Arm(y) of one""? Which would be factually incorrect, but you catch the drift. I was surprised at the movies beginning but it did make sense, because this is as much a story about a manager than it is about baseball or the dream of making it there (especially for the characters/people who try it here). It's a little bit like Jerry McGuire if you look at the story.<br/><br/>It does have great actors to support the story and the characters of course.

","This is a well-intentioned film, based on a true story, of a sports agent trying to score a big break by being the first to raise interest in baseball to the potentially huge audience in India. Since it is a Disney film, it tends to follow the underdog-makes-good formula without detouring far from the predictable course. As such, it does not live up to the enchantment in director Craig Gillespie's prior work ""Lars and the Real Girl,"" perhaps being constrained by the true story element or the oversight at the Mouse House. Still, it is a generally likable film and one that is pretty safe for the whole family.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm does a competent job as the lead sports agent finding his way in India and in his own life. Mr. Hamm is well cast as his considerable charm helps to raise the scenes above the dialog and plot which at times can fall to the level of the made-for-TV genre.<br/><br/>To see my other movie reviews, please visit:<br/><br/>https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com"

","Review: I quite enjoyed this true story about a baseball scout who stages an event in India to try and recruit cricket players to go to America to play baseball. The director showed some depth to the characters which made there journey quite emotional, especially as it's a true story. Rinku and Dinesh achieved so much in there 10 month journey to the baseball major leagues which was truly inspirational. The director added wit to the script which made it a joy to watch and the serious undertone with all of the characters kept the movie interesting. Jon Hamm, who plays the main character in the movie, put in a great performance and his cool demeanour, even though he was under severe pressure, also made you care about his character. I liked the fact that the film didn't sway into the love direction because the story of the 2 Indian baseball stars was what made the film interesting. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the addition of Bill Paxton and Alan Arkin made it one to watch. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Jon Hamm, who shot to fame after playing the lead role in the Mad Men, is somewhat of a late bloomer at the age of 43. He had brief roles in the A-Team, The Town and Bridesmaids but he's mostly known for the hit series. I think that he was the right choice for this movie but his commitments to the series doesn't leave him much time to do anything else. Bill Paxton and Alan Arkin only have small roles in this film, but it was good to see some other big names alongside Hamm. You might remember one of the Indian baseball players from the Life of Pi, which he was great in, so it's good to see his career blossom even though he's returned to college to study. In all, the movie was an eye opener to a world that I didn't know anything about,<br/><br/>Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $38.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/sport/comedy movies about a baseball scout travelling to India to put in an event to recruit cricket players to play baseball in America. 7/10"

","The true story behind this film provides a lot of potential. Unfortunately, while aspects are enjoyable, the slow pace, predictability, dialogue and overacting by the cast take us down a few notches from what could have been a great sports film.<br/><br/>Highlights include slow pans of the Indian countryside, the wonder of the people in India found in baseball, and some of the training clips. Sadly, much of the film progresses down obvious paths, an example of wasted film (this could have been nicely condensed to a 90 minute quality film) are the reaction shots of relatives whose sons were headed to America to play a foreign sport coming from a village in the midst of quiet farmland.<br/><br/>The script could have included the reality that boys who enjoy rap and country/R&B music from a modern democracy (albeit one with 1+ Billion inhabitants and plenty of poor and those unable to obtain internet, university degrees, and thousands of other differences from the US/EU) don't act like 10 year olds when visiting the land with the most worldwide publicity.<br/><br/>Good thing the film was made. A shame it was Disnefied."
"DKosty123","6","0","0","29 December 2014"," Drawn From A US point of View
","Yes, this is based on a true story but no it does not quite connect with reality. It does connect with a political view and it does have a standard Hollywood G rated love story.<br/><br/>This movie begins with a strong relationship for US viewers - Jon Hamm making a sales pitch worthy of Don Draper on Mad Men. Then it concedes to a clean version of a real story.<br/><br/>It admits at long last one glaring fact, even though Baseball is a sport that named it's championship a ""World Series"" it is far from really known in the entire world. The second most populated country in the world knows little to nothing about it.<br/><br/>This story has been done in Baseball before. The sport reaches out where it has never been before and finds out there is more talent out there than has ever been imagined. The actual World Series champion is only representative of the talent that has been reached and networked into the American System. <br/><br/>Pretty much in a way US Football is the same way but the NFL is not as assuming as Baseball and the World Cup to call their sport a World Champion. No sport ever has a World Champion unless they become truly democratic and reach out to all the best talent in the world and puts the best of it on the field.<br/><br/>Even the Olympics do not reach that noble goal. Despite the World getting smaller, that can not happen. Politics and agendas and lack of exploration always prevents that.<br/><br/>This movie is a good depiction of greed trying to reach out and find more talent and expand a sport and it does illustrate that. It is a great reminder that the human spirit can go only where it imagines it can be. That is truly s Disney type of story. Baseball takes a back seat to that here."

","This is a nice movie, more about interpersonal relationships than baseball, although baseball is the catalyst.<br/><br/>The central character is Jon Hamm as JB, an agent who decided to strike it out on his own. He desperately wants a famous NFL linebacker as his client, as that would give him the cash flow that he needed for himself and his two employees. But that doesn't really work out.<br/><br/>So he is given the bright idea, India is a country of roughly one billion and they love cricket. So surely they can find a couple of cricket players who have good enough throwing arms to be trained as MLB pitchers. The winners of the contest would receive a big cash prize, travel to California for training by a famous pitching coach, and when they actually get to play for a team the exposure in India would be great for business.<br/><br/>The irony is that not every guy who tried out was a cricket player, and in fact the two who won the trip to the States were javelin throwers who didn't play cricket. Those two were Suraj Sharma as Rinku, who became the more successful of the two, playing with a minor league team in the Pittsburgh system, with a decent record but some injuries. He is still in his mid-20s and may get to the big league yet.<br/><br/>The other was Madhur Mittal as Dinesh who had less success and returned to India to finish his education and teach baseball to kids.<br/><br/>So, while the theme is thoroughly ""baseball"", the real meat of the story is how JB came to realize what a dysfunctional person he was, and a better way to live his life and relate to others. Plus the two young men (19 or 20) who had to adjust to a new sport in a strange country. <br/><br/>Good movie, based on real people and a true story but many details were no doubt changed for dramatic effect."

","Sports movies come in all ages, speeds, throws and color. And most of them are very entertaining and satisfying and more than anything they are emotionally inspirational. Every year at least there is one sports movie that makes big news and I don't know if Million Dollar Arm is that movie so far. However this movie makes a real mark as it has a different mood and a flavor than any of the previously famous sports themed movies. The reality show and south Asian flavor combo is indeed something beautiful to see on the screen.<br/><br/>JB (Jon Hamm) is a sports contractor who is desperately looking for a talent to sign up as his company is reaching no fruitful businesses for some time. After failing in a raw he comes up with a brilliant idea of seeking for talent in far India. Pushed for unrealistic deadlines from his investors, JB launch his Million Dollar Arm reality show campaign in India seeking for the fastest pitcher for Baseball in a country which Baseball has no significant value.<br/><br/>The first quarter of the movie looks and feels familiar. A failed agent looking for a strong comeback is not the freshest of ideas out there. But as the story evolves it reaches untested territories and after sometime it reaches a solid peak that holds the movie on a steady state. There is a cool down period somewhere in the middle which builds the stage for the emotionally strong events to take place afterwards. Being a movie which is based on true events the director has put some good effort to keep the fans entertained throughout. I can't say I was bored at any stage of the movie though there are phases where it falls in to average.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm who is seldom seeing in movies but holds the title for one the most powerful TV characters of all time in Mad Men brings in energy to JB's character. The movie evolves around JB but the rest of the characters even how important and strong they are is not given enough attention as I feel. This is a bit of a letdown as some characters especially the Indian boys could have being more prominent if they were introduced from the start of the movie which could have bought in more dramatic approach to the whole plot. But Million Dollar Arm is a very entertaining movie which of course the entertainment side is stronger than the sports side at times. So I will not call this as the best sports movie I have seeing but it's a movies I enjoyed from the start to end."

","I saw Million Dollar Arm on a lazy Saturday night, bored with all the metal trash thats being remade these days. Truly speaking, i was massively impressed with the script, and most importantly the performance of the entire crew.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Arm is basically a biographical drama story of Rinku Singh and Dinesh Kumar Patel, the first ever Indian athletes who get signed to a major American Sports League, thanks to an innovative (again ""late Saturday night"") idea by JB Bernstein. In true Disney style, the movie is complete family entertainer, with no violence or even PG content. The film's music is composed by AR Rahman, and the sound mixing by Resul Pookutty.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film are the three Indian actors, Suraj Sharma (playing Rinku Singh) and Madhur Mittal (playing Dinesh Patel) and the super talented Pitobash Tripathy (playing Amit Rohan, the ever energetic assistant baseball coach-cum-translator), all of whom get selected by JB (Jon Hamm) during his Indian jaunt. Like all sports drama films, this one too starts with a failure and JB needing desperate ideas travels to India to spot unseen talent. JB brings them over to the US, where Rinku and Madhur struggle in the super competitive environment. The saving grace to these pitchers is JB's tenant and medical student Brenda Fenwick who helps motivate them each time they return after a tired day. Basically, these five characters drive the whole story, peppered with wonderful and lilting music by AR Rahman. The stress of the performance takes its toll on JB too, as he ends up losing contract after contract, including a well marketed tryout for the best MLB clubs. Brenda strengthens bridges with Rinku and Dinesh, and JB is able to get one last opportunity to present to Pittsburgh Pirates. The last 15 minutes really lift you up as a viewer, as you really starting feeling the emotions for Rinku and Dinesh. The movie ends with an excellent musical collage of how Rinku and Dinesh made their journey from small Indian villages to Major League Baseball.<br/><br/>The development of self-confidence amongst the two leads is the finest point in the entire movie, and it helps demonstrate the true victory of human spirit. Million Dollar Arm is an excellent movie to watch with your whole family, especially with young kinds. The music is just excellent, and the entire crew has chipped in their best. This is surely one of the best feel good movies of the year!! Happy watching!"
"estebangonzalez10","6","0","0","14 October 2014"," Predictable but inspirational nonetheless
","""We might have to tweak that a little.""<br/><br/>It had been a while since Disney had produced a sports movie but if you sat for the opening 10 minutes of Million Dollar Arm you could tell that the formula hasn't changed much for the genre over time. Everything about this film is predictable as it follows pretty much every cliché possible. Director, Craig Gillespie doesn't bother to change the successful formula here so you see pretty much everything coming, but somehow Million Dollar Arm is still an enjoyable film that manages to pull at your heartstrings thanks to a solid cast. Gillespie's Lars and the Real Girl is perhaps still my favorite film of his and I wish he would have played a bit with the genre conventions like he did with the horror genre in Fright Night. I expected a lot more from the screenplay considering Thomas McCarthy's past works were superb (I am a huge fan of his previous screenplays for Win Win and The Visitor). Perhaps he didn't have the same creative liberties considering this was a Disney production and they are known for controlling various aspects of the process. The film was based on true events so the audience was already expecting an inspirational tale and it accomplishes it. There are several funny scenes that elevate the film and the scenes in Mumbai stand out as the movie shows the difference between both cultures. The portrayal of Indians is stereotypical but the humor works nonetheless and it's the highlight of the film. So despite being painfully predictable at times and a bit overlong, the scenes in India and the comedic performances were enough to turn this into an enjoyable experience. I may be a bit biased considering I love sports although I'm not a huge baseball fan, but it is nowhere near being this year's Moneyball. Disney's Remember the Titans continues to be their best sports drama. <br/><br/>A lot of the success of the film relies on how much you like Jon Hamm, and I thought he gave a solid performance considering his character isn't entirely likable. He is very flawed as this sports agent who seems to be interested in looking out for his agency. Hamm pulls it off and I ended up routing for him. Hamm may not be the most engaging presence of the film, but he leaves that to the supporting cast who all give delightful performances. The Indians, Suraj Sharma (Pi from Life of Pi) and Madhur Mittal (Slumdog Millionaire), play the future baseball prospects who are recruited from the reality TV show that Hamm's character created in India. They are the people who we are routing for as an audience and they achieve the purpose. They bring the emotional aspect of the film. For the comedy, Gillespie recruited Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton who are always a sure bet. Without being exceptional they still managed to be funny. The funniest scenes however come from newcomer, Pitobash Tripathy, who was a fresh addition to an otherwise predictable film. Lake Bell is the only female character present in the film and she delivers a solid performance as well. Her chemistry with Jon Hamm also lifted this film from being a mediocre movie."

","Has anyone seen Miracle? I'm not a hockey fan but that movie is so stuffed with fluffy, Disney inspiration and spirit that after watching it even I wanna throw on a couple of skates and ice-tackle some giant Russian dude. It was a great sports movie from The Mickey Mouse guys, MILLION DOLLAR ARM is the latest baseball movie from Disney starring Jon Hamm. Did this movie make me wanna pick up a glove and throw a no hitter or was it another clone off the Moneyball success train? <br/><br/>Sports agent, J.B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm) has a struggling agency that is hungry for some talent to represent. Their best prospect was an up-coming linebacker that jumped ship to a flashier agency. So in an act of desperation he takes on a job for a business investor looking to recruit some Asian talent for some Major League play. So, Bernstein decides to scout around ""the next great untapped market"" for young baseball talent, India. In order to dig out the next Jeter, J.B. and his associates plan this talent competition, where the best hometown athlete would win $1 million and a chance to try out for a major league contract. It's during one of these stops that the crew discover these two young guys, Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal) who both have quite the pitching arm! Rinku has this weird, Swan Kick like pitch that had me ROLLIN'! So after seeing these kids' talent and picking up this hilarious little translator dude, the squad flies back to the states and it's up to J.B. to both get these kids to perfect their pitch for the pros and maybe improve his own personal way of living.<br/><br/>Disney has always been pretty good when it comes to their live-action sports movies. The previously mentioned Miracle is a sports classic, even Invincible with Mark Wahlberg was a pretty good football movie. Million Dollar Arm is a welcomed addition to that fine group of movies, not the best but certainly entertaining. It plays everything pretty close to the formula that a majority of similar sports films follow, so don't be surprised if you can see where this story if going from the start. Thankfully, the strong familiarity of it all isn't too much of a burden as it's a very ewell acted and good looking movie.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm is at his suave, best as J.B. Bernstein. His character has a lot of Jerry McGuire in him; he's a model dating, smooth talker that is on the edge when it comes to his career. But what makes his performance a plus here was how Jon Hamm brought out the likability and humanity of his character, which I didn't think I was gonna see. He wasn't Don Draper here. The two young actors who played the baseball hopefulls were also very good in their roles. Like with Jon Hamm's character, I was surprised with how the movie actually took the time to show some of the smaller, more tender character moments. Moments that made you care for the people on screen. Especially with the young Indian players! Alan Arkin is as enjoyable a screen presence as always, I didn't even know he was in the movie. Bill Paxton and Aasif Mandvi, who I always loved on The Daily Show, also had very good supporting roles. By the way, that's BACK-TO-BACK awesome Paxton flicks with this and my previous review of Edge of Tomorrow! It's great to see him in some good movies again.<br/><br/>Disney is never one to spare any expense with their movies. The production and cinematography are top notch! The 2nd act that takes place across India, when they're recruiting guys, is awesome and authentic, taking us to multiple cities across the country. The film's soundtrack is also a pleasure to the senses. It's this awesome culture and genre blend just like the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack. There is no shortage of feel good vibes in this movie, or as I like to call it fluff or cheese. The script is soft and standard enough that it won't be as memorable or as sharp as Moneyball but it's got all the heart and baseball smarts to make for a sports movie that's never boring and actually, pretty touching.<br/><br/>Sports fans and non-sports fans alike will find enough to enjoy this movie. It's an easy, feel-good watch with a great cast and some terrific production. Another win for the Disney Sports library. I say, ""IT'S WORTH A WATCH"".<br/><br/>What about you guys?

I can't say this is a bad movie because I did enjoy it OK but it was pretty much what I expected. The main downfall of this movie is that it felt too forced to seem real. That is funny to say because it's based on a true story but the entire time it felt like the movie was dragging you to where it wanted you to go. The thing that stood out the most was the love story aspect. To me it just didn't feel needed. The movie The Rookie was a much smoother style and really had the emotion needed for a movie like this. I know this review sounds harsh but keep in mind that I did think the movie was OK. The problem with a movie like this, one that has the ability to inspire, is it needs to be more than just OK. Overall, a movie that is OK and worth seeing but came off as feeling way to forced to have the emotion needed. I give this a B-."

","This movie reflects the variety of people and how they do things. People has their own ways of getting around, may it be the conventional or unconventional. J.B Burnstein took 2 young Indian Nationals to the US to become Major League Baseball Players, both having no experience in Baseball. He did the the screening unconventionally as his thoughts that Indians mostly play Cricket and are good hitters and sluggers. These young men reflects other methods of getting the job done, Showing a lot of character and diversity. Either way, they moved on and became successful.

"mohitshh","8","0","0","19 September 2014"," More than just a Sports Biography
","IMDb says this a biography sports drama but i would call it more of a biography than a sports film. The story is about a sports agent in the US trying to save his career by thinking out of the box. He recruits two Indian youths (Rinku and Dinesh) belonging from poor Indian families and brings them to the US to get them trained by professional baseball coach.<br/><br/>The film is based on a true story and I do not know whether the retelling is a bit dramatized for the sake of the screen or not. But, the movie clearly shows a transition in the character of JB. His little adventure of foraying into uncharted waters leads him to self realization. He comes to value the things which matter in life and I think this was one of the points the director was intending to make.<br/><br/>The story of Rinku and Dinesh is also much tumultuous. They find themselves in the foreign land and struggling to adjust to their new lives. They have to dig deep to get their heart and soul into the game and find their fire so that they are able to shine at the right time. I cannot say more without inviting a spoiler tag.<br/><br/>The music is wonderful and A R Rahman has done a good job as usual. The movie was able to reinvigorate even the clichéd scenes like that of ""bypassing the system"" :). By the way, not all Indians are like that.<br/><br/>Being an Indo-US drama there are some scenes where the non desi population might call it to be over dramatic but they blend with the overall story perfectly. Also there is some dance and music sometimes at completely unexpected points in the film. This was included maybe to put some local touch. <br/><br/>The film is an amalgamation of both cultures and it is more than just a sports biography. It is good enough to keep you cheerful for the major part.<br/><br/>Do watch till the end as there are real life photos and videos of Rinku and Dinesh who have underwent a truly rags to riches transformation."

","If Ron Shelton directed a sports themed version of Crocodile Dundee (which includes the fish out of water element) coupled with a plot similar to Jerry Maguire, well you'd probably get 2014's Million Dollar Arm. Starring Mad Men's Jon Hamm, based on a true story (not entirely true I'm sure), and written by Win Win's Tom McCarthy, this Disney theme vehicle doesn't seem as sugar coated, saturated, manipulated, or predictable as most sports movies coming from its long running studio (examples would be Remember the Titans and the badly acted, Invincible). No this is a solid character study of Jon Hamm's J. B. Bernstein. As a down and out sports agent, he is easily agitated, cold, reserved, uptight, and downright ornery. He's an egg about to crack. But as the film progresses, you realize that Bernstein seems to be on a personal journey to become a better person not to mention a more feeling human being. Hamm, with his definitive smirk and buried five o'clock shadow, brings a lot of charisma to the role. I've never met a sports agent (only seen them on TV) nor do I know the exact way they talk, walk, and act. I do know this, Hamm gives a superb, heartfelt performance. There is no doubt in my mind that he can succeed as a stripped down lead actor.<br/><br/>Directed by Australian native Craig Gillespie and shot in India, Georgia, and Los Angeles, Million Dollar Arm opens up with independent sports agent J. B. Bernstein (Hamm) pitching the idea of the benefits of being managed by his company (he does it twice, once to himself as practice, then to a famous NFL linebacker). Popo (played by real life football god Rey Maualuga) as NFL royalty, wants a million dollar signing bonus right up front. Here's the problem: Bernstein and his other colleagues (one of which is Aash played by Aasif Mandvi and I couldn't figure out what exactly he did for said company) don't have any money, haven't signed any clients in forever, and seem on the brink of losing their job office space. The solution: go to India, find some fresh new baseball prospects (basically find cricket players and develop them as major league pitchers), and sign them to big moneymaking contracts. During the film's most pivotal moments, Hamm's Bernstein develops a relationship with two young boys (lightning rod arms in the form of actors Suraj Sharma and newcomer Madhur Mittal), starts a romance with his live in tenant (the likable Lake Bell), and as mentioned earlier, finds his center as a human being who before the events started, didn't have any kind of family, camaraderie, or just someone to really lean on. That being said, Million Dollar Arm's strength inevitably lies in its ability to be swift and breezy fun. Its tone harks back to an old school sports film like The Bad News Bears. And its behind the scenes topography feels akin to a less calculated version of Moneyball.<br/><br/>If this spring release has any overall flaws, I would say they would have to do with the romantic interludes between the Hamm and Bell characters. Maybe they are meant for each other maybe they're not. But the whole plot element of them getting together seems forced, not only by the writers but by the stars, the co-stars, and the whole set design (they live in the same house pretty much, how can it not). As for overall logic, ""Arm"" slips a bit when it asks the audience to believe that although Hamm's character doesn't have money or clients, he still is able to fly to India (that's about $2000 round trip), hire a scout (Alan Arkin playing well, Alan Arkin), have endless supplies for a tryout, hire two assistants, and pay his winning pitching prospects over $100,000 dollars. I know he is being financed by a rich dude (businessman Chang played by Tzi Ma) but how much is the question. Do you really think that a smart, powerful baseball owner would ever put this much trust in a sort of has been schlep like Bernstein?<br/><br/>Anyway, despite an ending that seems totally lifted from 2012's Trouble with the Curve, this Disney produced release still gets my full fledged recommendation. It's edited at a lightning quick pace with a kind of tight, straightforward method of storytelling. A lot of what's on screen is familiar stuff. However, like most sports movies, the feel good element is key and Million Dollar Arm's feels as if it's genuine or sort of earned if you will. Bottom line: with a level of predictability that's not overly predictable and a proof button assuring us that Jon Hamm is capable of holding the lead in a feature length film, Memorial Day weekend is the perfect time to check out something like Million Dollar Arm. It's entertainment that is worth every ""dollar"" (ha ha)."
"Robert_duder","7","0","0","22 May 2014"," Disney does what they do best and provides a solid genre flick
","There are NO surprises with Million Dollar Arm. The trailer looked good and I could have sat down and written this myself because of the trailer, because its Disney and because we've seen it all before. Its not always baseball but we've seen this again and again. But so what? There are a lot of genre movies that use the same formula and still manage to be entertaining and Million Dollar Arm is exactly that. A fun, sweet, memorable little flick that will make you smile but adds absolutely nothing new to the family friendly sports genre. It doesn't strike the heart strings deeply but you will definitely appreciate it. It gives you exactly what you should go in expecting. I do wish they had tried just a little harder to find something new to cover but it is what it is and I enjoyed it. It certainly is a fun story, based on real events and I loved seeing the real characters at the end. Usually the best part of a ""based on a true story"" film is getting the what happened after update. I admit I did almost tear up at one particular part involving a performance that ends up being truly terrific but there have been other Disney or Disney like sports stories that had me crying like a blubbering baby.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm will be looking to Hollywood films with the end of Mad Men imminent and I welcome him! He does a good job playing Sport's agent JB (Mr. JB sir...you'll get the joke after you see the movie.) The only issue with him in this film is how excruciatingly obvious and stereotypical his character is. We have seen this type of character beaten to death. He's rich, a womanizer, big ego, fast car and he's going to be humbled and learn about life and love and find the woman of his dreams. Call it the Emilio complex (Mighty Ducks anyone?) Hamm still handles it well though and he is very charismatic on screen. Pitobash is straight up amazing as the wanna-be Baseball coach that Hamm reluctantly takes under his wing. Pitobash only gets better throughout the film and he is adorable and fun and you will absolutely love him in this. Not to be outdone the other two stars to come out of this film are Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal as the two Million Dollar Arm contestants from India. They are terrific and they play the fish out of water card perfectly without overdoing it and they don't come across as stupid but rather just struggling to live in a completely different world. The four of them (including Hamm) have terrific, outstanding chemistry that really drive this film. Lake Bell feels like an awkward choice for the film. I don't mean to say she isn't good because she does a decent job but she seems to be the oddest fit in the film. Her and Hamm have good chemistry but are such an odd couple (which is also supposed to be the point.) She plays her role with an edge of eccentricity and it stood out in the movie. Still, she was good and I didn't mind her in the role. Alan Arkin...oh its becoming almost painful to watch him. I love the guy, he's a legend, but this is honestly the only role he ever plays anymore. He's a crotchety, old, washed up has been who yells at people and he does it again and again and again. He nailed it in Little Miss Sunshine and has been literally beating the role to death ever since (Grudge Match, Argo, Burt Wonderstone.) I guess if they needed someone for that role they might as well have Arkin. Bill Paxton was also good in a small role that was very effective.<br/><br/>So we have a good to great cast, a painfully predictable script and some characters but a feel good film nonetheless. Disney knows what it does best and this is one of those times. Craig Gillespie is sort of an up and coming director and I'm already a fan. He directed the absolutely brilliant Fright Night remake and has had his hand in some decent comedies as well along the way. I'm not sure this would have been hard to direct given they probably handed him the recipe and told him to bake the cake exactly as it said. Still, the scenes in India were very nice and it definitely hit the right nerves to be in that setting to get the contrast of where these boys come from. The romance is well paced (I hate when they rush the lead couple together) and the film won't offend or annoy anyone. It's just fun. I did feel it dragged just a little bit in the middle but I won't fault them for making sure the entire story was told. All in all if you love baseball, sports films or are looking for something reasonably acceptable for the family (there are some mild sexual innuendos and one or two minor four letter words) then try this one out. Enjoy it but keep your expectations middle of the road. 7.5/10"

","What made this movie so good was that it finally presented baseball in terms of having fun and not necessarily the money angle which has become so prevalent in this major American sport.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm was excellent in the role of the agent who goes from seeing the big money angle to the exact opposite.<br/><br/>He goes to India to recruit prospective pitchers for the big league in an attempt to sign them at big salaries. He finds his guys and brings them back to the U.S. but after a series of disasters brought about due to the psychological, social and cultural differences between countries, he sees them fail miserably at tryouts.<br/><br/>It is only when he comes to see that baseball is not solely an investment,that success is achieved in the end. There were times that Hamm's facial expressions reminded me of his Don Draper of ""Mad Men."" There are the usual disasters, love interests and other items deemed comical, but in the end it's the human element that allows for success to be achieved."

","I am surprised by the pretty high score that ""The Million Dollar Arm"" has gotten.<br/><br/>Yes, I know that it's based on a true story, but that doesn't mean that it has to be so bland and disconnected. Setting aside that Jon Hamm's character (the agent) was so remarkably unlikable, the movie, AS A MOVIE, is a big disappointment. <br/><br/>After a cute scene of the kids encountering their first elevator, there are almost no scenes where we see someone actually doing something -- we just get oral summaries of the latest incident from one of the characters, e.g., the agent's tenant, or his secretary, etc. This is story-telling as a bunch of news- clippings, not as a MOVIE. <br/><br/>About the only acting pizazz comes from the tenant, who keeps reminding the agent to show some humanity, and from Alan Arkin, but he wanders in and out of the movie like a sort of fairy godmother, come to occasionally refocus the agent on the job at hand.<br/><br/>This could have been a FAR better movie. As it stands, it played like a dry newspaper story. Truth is, I learned more about the two kids from their respective Wikipedia articles."

","Million Dollar is a charming sport-biopic about how two Indian village youngsters Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh Patel(Madhur Mittal) transform into American major league baseball players with the help of sports agent JB Bernstein (John Hamm). While the story is undoubtedly predictable and formulaic (also being a Disney production), the positive thing the movie offers are its lovable characters and light atmosphere not stressing the viewer much. <br/><br/>The Million Dollar Arm, a contest put forth by JB, to find baseball talent in India where sport of cricket is a religion. Even if there are similarities in cricket and baseball, the two guys who eventually do the best had ironically no interest in cricket whatsoever. Anyways after topping the contest, Rinku and Suraj are flown to U.S. for training with Tom House (Bill Paxton). Along with them is Amit (Pitobash Tripathy) who is Indian local baseball fanatic who also acts as translator for both Rinku and Suraj. The boys being transferred into an amusing alien environment of U.S. , JB finds it hard to get these three used to the surroundings. JB also has tough time balancing his personal and professional life. The boys who are not yet adjusted,find it difficult to give even a justifiable performance and JB starts getting furious. Then we have the regular mentor-student conflicts where in the end both parties end up respecting and valuing each other.<br/><br/>Even if the story did not have anything new, but it did have interesting and enjoyable character with whom I could easily connect. Both Suraj Sharma (Life of Pi fame) and Madhur Mittal (Slumdog Millionaire fame) give a justifiable performance as two young Indian villagers who find their destiny. John Hamm was okay while Bill Paxton is always a delight to watch. But the character I liked the most was Amit with a innocently funny act by Pitobash. He was key in bridging the gap between the boys and JB. A.R. Rahman's score with an Indian touch was very effective even if it wasn't his best. The movie captures the Indian culture very pleasingly. I felt really inspired to see how these ordinary boys became stars. Overall despite having nothing stellar plus being heavily predictable, Million Dollar Arm was worth a one time watch thanks to is charming characters plus feel-goodish story.<br/><br/>RATING: [2.5/5]"

"RforFilm","5","1","4","21 May 2014"," Million Dollar Story probably as a better story then then movie portrays
","I'm gonna come clean. I don't like to watch soccer. I'm sorry, but I find the sport visually boring. I don't mind play with the ball, but watching the professional sport just doesn't sell well to me as well as something like baseball. I know like any sport, being able to be a pro at soccer is a gift. If I was as good as Pele was, I'd be on that field in a heartbeat. I don't understand the fandom. I know that soccer or ""football"", as the rest of the world calls it, brings in a big audience worldwide.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a cultural thing or possibly that I don't know much about soccer, but I won't fault somebody for liking something that I don't. Where I'm getting at is introducing a foreign sport can't be easy, especially if there is already some parallel equivalent. Like how us Americans have baseball while most of the world has cricket. I haven't seen enough of the sport to have a say, but I know that bringing it to the US would be difficult. I know how difficult baseball was bringing it to the UK. Million Dollar Arm is about bringing baseball to India. <br/><br/>In the early 2000's, a sports agent J. B. Bernstien (played by John Hamm) is loosing clients to bigger firms that can promise players more money upfront. Bernstien seems to be at the end of his career until he gets an idea while watching cricket t home. After making a deal with a billionaire, he arranges a trip to India to start a big reality show called ""Million Dollar Arm"". The idea here is to scout through thousands of people signing up and trying out to possibly become the first major league players from India. Along for the ride is an Indian business partner, baseball scout Ray Poitevint (played by Alan Arkin) and an Indian baseball fanatic Amit Rohan.<br/><br/>The contest ends with two candidates, Dinesh and Rinku, two young men who have never played baseball nor cricket, but seem to have strong arms to pitch. The two are sent to Los Angeles along with Bernstien and Amit who look to train them for a year before giving them a tryout. Though Bernstien seems to see his candidates as future stars, he doesn't see that the two guys are far from home and only have USC pitching coach Tom House to teach them about the game. Bernstien later learns about caring and such, bonding with the two and giving them the chance of a lifetime. <br/><br/>The problem with a lot of sports stories is that they are mostly underdog scenarios that we've seen before. The Bad News Bears started this trend, you know about the misfits that nobody thinks has a chance until someone comes along to build them into star players. Million Dollar Arm is nothing that different. It two has the misfits, our two Indian guys, and a guy who learns the lesson about teamwork, Bernstien. Give me a break. <br/><br/>Inside Million Dollar Arm is an original story, but the movie treats it like any other old sports movie. Why couldn't the movie be fully focused on the reality show and the travels in India or keep the focus on the two Indian guy throughout. Most of the movie is seen watching John Hamm trying his hardest, but having little to work with. The movie looks impressive and is acted well, but you know what's gonna happen, whose gonna learn which lesson. If you're a baseball fan or simply looking for a nice story about underdogs, you'll get your feel here. But I doubt this will rank among better baseball movies like League of Our Own or The Sandlot. <br/><br/>I'll give this three Indian baseball caps out of five. Million Dollar Arm is what you expect if that's what you want. An underdog story. But as so, it could have pushed itself for a home run"

If you're looking forward for a baseball game, Man.. stay on your couch grab a coke, turn on your TV.<br/><br/>Jon Hamm got the texture of one classic fine actor.

"sesht","Null","1","6","9 May 2014"," Low key, but decent
","Had never heard of American Baseball reaching Indian shores before, but it apparently had, according to the true story this movie's based on. A good friend of mine also mentioned following it at the time, and making the connection while watching this one (where the hell was I, and what the hell was I doing?). :-).<br/><br/>A slice-of-life / rags-to-riches tale for the main protagonists, this is also a tale of (in-your-face, simplistic) redemption for the main character, who's a cad, conforming to the common perception of most agents. Yes! they're as 'beloved' as lawyers are, never mind 'Jerry Maguire'!<br/><br/>This one can't shake off that particular comparison, or others (more on one more later) and doesn't try to avoid those much. What Gillespie (Fright night remake, Lars and the real girl) gets right is his complete focus on the overarching theme, and the fish-out-of-water aspect to the entire thing, though the effect is not dramatic enough to shake off the overall TV movie low-budget feel.<br/><br/>It helps that this has been penned by Thomas (Tom) McCarthy, of 'Station Agent' and 'Visitor' fame, though this doesn't quite reach the heights those works did. <br/><br/>The sequences where they're scouting around for the various pre-final tryouts are glossed over, but contain a few nice tidbits, with Alan Arkin front-and-center. They're lightweight funny bits that are there to beat any tedium one might feel. Gillespie also tries to avoid many of the racist clichés that abound, and succeeds to an extent.<br/><br/>Lake Bell, as always, is a delight, but doesn't have anything substantial to do, as such.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma (Life of Pi) has come a-ways, and the intensity he shows in his performance, with the limited scope provided, is quite impressive. Madhur Mittal, on the other hand, also playing against type, is required to keep it toned-down, and succeeds. In fact, one of the key reasons I feel this movie succeeds is from the strength of its performers. Hamm is serviceable though, and that's not his fault, for he's just playing a stock character, and its a walk in the park for an actor of his caliber. Other than Alan Arkin, the scene-stealer is Pitobash (Shor in the city and Dibakar Bannerjee's Shanghai), who's supremely effective in each one of his scenes. All of the actors respect the material, and do not try to belittle it in any way, performing their roles to the extent required. Aasif Mandvi's also one who gets another stock character, and does what he can with this thankless, yet beefy role. Darshan Jariwala, Bill Paxton (not many meaty roles these days - he chomped the scenery in '2 guns') and Tzi Ma do just fine, and its nice to watch them interact as well.<br/><br/>In spite of all the good things, however, this one could've been much, much more, and I'd rate it worth one watch, no more. Home viewing will also do just fine. And oh, for those wondering about another comparison - I'll watching anything with Clint Eastwood in it, but this one's much better than 'Trouble with the curve'."

The film is undeniably inspiring, as the subject matter practically guarantees it would be, but it's also extremely clichéd and unoriginal.<br/><br/>The story is set in 2008 when sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) was desperate to find new talent, at a cost he could afford, due to his competitors having a lot more money. One night, while watching 'AMERICAN IDOL' and cricket on TV, he came up with the idea of finding cricket players in India to bring home to America and train to be professional baseball players. Bernstein then developed a reality show challenge, in India, where Rinku Singh (Sharma) and Dinesh Patel (Mittal) emerged the winners; even though they didn't play cricket. He then brought them home to Los Angeles, where he had less than a year to get them ready for a major league try-out. Cultural differences and overwhelming pressure made this challenge nearly impossible for the two young men to overcome.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of heart, and is pretty emotional at times, but it's still nowhere near a great sports film. It's filled with overused stereotypes and has absolutely no signs of originality. The performances are good and the directing and story are decent but I expect a lot more from McCarthy and Gillespie (as well as the material they had to work with). They've done much more memorable work and they should be able to make a more passionate sports drama flick together. Like I said the heart of the movie is in the right place but the craftsmanship, of the filmmakers involved, is not.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/TybVNWfCjYM"

","​ Million Dollar Arm <br/><br/>It makes sense that Hindi-speaking athletes would gravitate towards baseball since there's a team called the Indians. <br/><br/>Racial epithets aside this sports-drama does involve players from India.<br/><br/>When down-and-out sports agent J. B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm) vacillates between a televised cricket match and a singing competition, he formulates a plan to invigorate his firm with talent from India.<br/><br/>Convinced he'll find the next great baseball pitcher through a reality TV show format, J.B. enlists a cantankerous scout (Alan Arkin) to be a judge in the competition.<br/><br/>Eventually, J.B. discovers two worthy candidates (Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal) and ships them back to America to try out for the majors.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Million Dollar Arm is a boilerplate feel-good Disney sports movie that concludes as expected, with no complexity or ingenuity required.<br/><br/>On a related note, females traveling to India alone should always bring a baseball bat with them. <br/><br/>Yellow Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"

","Million Dollar Arm was one of the most under-rated film which will inspire and motivate you with head-strong story of two boys who succeeded and achieved within short span of time.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Arm tells story of a sports agent who travels to India to look for the best arm-pitcher for a major league baseball team. <br/><br/>Hats off to Craig Gillespie for choosing a difficult subject and bring out the true story of 2 Indian boys coming from a remote village. He succeeds in telling the story of brave kids who, despite all odds,dares to dream and achieves the goal. The screenplay is outstanding keeping the audience alive coupled with beautiful background score and strong performances. Music by A.R.Rehman gels well with mood of the film supported with crisp editing. May I please request the Hollywood makers not to show India in bad light. There are more things in India than just showing dirt, hunger and cows. You have to explore the better side of India. Anyways , the film boast of wonderful performances by Jon Hamm, Madhur Mittal, Suraj Sharma and Darshan Jariwala. Special mention for Alan Arkin for giving a fabulous performance in a short role. All of them suited the characters till T.<br/><br/>A nice , brave attempt with wonderful direction and hard-hitting performances. Very good 4/5"

","This kind of unsentimental character piece needs a tight focus so all of the nuances of said characters shine through. Well, the characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. Hamm is one of the world's supreme artistic talents and he should do more serious work than any other movie star. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect."
"Krdouglas30-25-313623","3","0","21","11 June 2014"," Would say about a 3 star movie
","Although I have not seen this movie I have read reviews and have been surprised because of some of the contents in this movie, usually in a Disney movie there is nothing in appropriate in there movies. I believe that this movie is going to misrepresent Disney because of the contents in this movie. The first time I found out about this movie I thought it was good and was turned down because of the reviews. I would recommend to parents to not allow there children to see this movie. I would probably recommend this movie to adults. I would recommend reading the reviews of the movie first before seeing the movie in case you change your mind about seeing this movie. Lastly, be positive and only see this movie if you can be responsible."
