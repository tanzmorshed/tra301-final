","With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.<br/><br/>The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right."
"Quinoa1984","10","92","106","15 September 2005"," Like Citizen Kane it's almost been TOO analyzed and cherished as a landmark, but still not without good reason
","If you're a film student, or were one, or are thinking of becoming one, the name Battleship Potemkin has or will have a resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other silent-film pioneers like Griffith (although Eisenstein's innovations are not as commonplace as Griffith's) and Murnau, has had such an impact on the history of cinema it's of course taken for granted. The reason I bring up the film student part is because at some point, whether you'd like it or not, your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the ""Odessa Stairs"" sequence of this film. It's hard to say if it's even the 'best' part of the film's several sequences dealing with the (at the time current) times of the Russian revolution. But it does leave the most impact, and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense, or just plain montage (The Untouchables' climax comes to mind).<br/><br/>Montage, which was not just Eistenstein's knack but also his life's blood early in his career, is often misused in the present cinema, or if not misused then in an improper context for the story. Sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point A to point B. Montage was something else for Eisenstein; he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency, the passion(s), and the ultimate tragedies that were in the Russian people at the time and place. Even if one doesn't see all of Eisenstein's narrative or traditional 'story' ideas to have much grounding (Kubrick has said this), one can't deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns. Some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20's; it has that power like the Passion of Joan of Arc to over-pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion.<br/><br/>Of course, one could go on for books (which have been written hundreds of times over, not the least of which by Eisenstein himself). On the film in and of itself, Battleship Potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie. The first segment is also one of the great sequences in film, as a mutiny is plotted against the Captain and other head-ups of a certain Ship. This is detailed almost in a manipulative way, but somehow extremely effective; montage is used here as well, but in spurts of energy that capture the eye. Other times Eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves, as the soldiers grow weary without food and water. He isn't one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story; he is, of course, very much early 20th century Russian, but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style, and that is what wins over in the end.<br/><br/>Some may want to check it outside of film-school, as the 'Stairs' sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film, displaying the ugly side of revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the more 'accessible' silent-film directors, but if montage, detail in the frame, non-actors, and Bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, it's truly one of the must sees of a lifetime."
"Jim Tritten","10","61","72","30 September 2000"," One of the greatest movies ever made.
","Originally supposed to be just a part of a huge epic The Year 1905 depicting the Revolution of 1905, Potemkin is the story of the mutiny of the crew of the Potemkin in Odessa harbor. The film opens with the crew protesting maggoty meat and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents. An uprising takes place during which the revolutionary leader is killed. This crewman is taken to the shore to lie in state. When the townspeople gather on a huge flight of steps overlooking the harbor, czarist troops appear and march down the steps breaking up the crowd. A naval squadron is sent to retake the Potemkin but at the moment when the ships come into range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass through. Eisenstein's non-historically accurate ending is open-ended thus indicating that this was the seed of the later Bolshevik revolution that would bloom in Russia. The film is broken into five parts: Men and Maggots, Drama on the Quarterdeck, An Appeal from the Dead, The Odessa Steps, and Meeting the Squadron.<br/><br/>Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but at the genius level. Not wanting to make a historical drama, Eisenstein used visual texture to give the film a newsreel-look so that the viewer feels he is eavesdropping on a thrilling and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used by Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers.<br/><br/>Unlike Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on typage, or the casting of non-professionals who had striking physical appearances. The extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers from Potemkin. This technique is later used by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe. But in Potemkin, no one individual is cast as a hero or heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect known as montage--the editing and selection of short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer. D.W. Griffith also used the montage, but no one mastered it so well as Eisenstein.<br/><br/>The artistic filming of the crew sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by the graceful swinging of tables suspended from chains in the galley. In contrast the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their rage with injustice.<br/><br/>Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity. The breaking of a plate bearing the words ""Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread"" signifies the beginning of the end. This technique is used in Last Year at Marienbad. Also, when the ship's surgeon is tossed over the side, his pince-nez dangles from the rigging. It was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the maggot-infested meat. This sequence ties the punishment to the corruption of the czarist-era.<br/><br/>The most noted sequence in the film, and perhaps in all of film history, is The Odessa Steps. The broad expanse of the steps are filled with hundreds of extras. Rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit yet the visual images of the deaths of a few will last in the minds of the viewer forever.<br/><br/>The angular shots of marching boots and legs descending the steps are cleverly accentuated with long menacing shadows from a sun at the top of the steps. The pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians who summon up courage to beg them to stop. A close up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller in Bonnie in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the czarist regime.<br/><br/>The death of a young mother leads to a baby carriage careening down the steps in a sequence that has been copied by Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent, by Terry Gilliam in Brazil, and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles thus drawing out what probably was only a five second event.<br/><br/>Potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for those already committed, and propagandizes it for the unconverted. It seethes of fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent czarist regime. Its greatest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved on techniques invented in Russia several generations ago."
"korch-3","8","18","21","10 December 1999"," This is a cinematic masterpiece, way ahead of its time.
","There are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making.<br/><br/>""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" is one of these movies, and it should be on anyone's list looking to learn more about the history of cinema.  <br/><br/>
Grigori Aleksandrov & Sergei M. Eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a Russian battleship. When the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors, the locals embrace the them, and support them. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business.  What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Anyone who has seen ""The Untouchables"", and ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" knows exactly what I mean.<br/><br/>Overall I think this movie raised the bar for film making just as ""Intolerance"" did a few years earlier. If you do not mind silent films, do yourself a favor, and see ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"".  <br/><br/>If you don't like silent films..... watch ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" anyway."
"Orlok","10","86","118","20 June 1999"," Still one of the best films ever made.
","Quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film.  If you are interested in film history, to truly understand the innovations Eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing Potemkin along side most any film made before it (those of D.W. Griffith offer a good contrast).  It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time.  However, even today, few directors have approached the skill with which Eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium.<br/><br/>If you are not interested in that sort of thing, Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made.  You should see it, buy it, and tatoo it to your chest."
"ackstasis","9","21","26","5 April 2007"," ""The time has come for us to speak out.""
","On June 14 1905, during the Russian Revolution of that year, sailors aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated with the second-rate treatment they receive, and most particularly the maggot-infested meat that they are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspirational Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decide that the time is ripe for a revolution. And so begins Sergei M. Eisenstein's rousing classic of Russian propaganda, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin / The Battleship Potemkin.'<br/><br/>The film itself is brimming with shining examples of stunning visual imagery: the spectacles of an overthrown ship captain dangle delicately from the side rope over which he had been tossed; the body of a deceased mutineer lies peaceful upon the shore, the sign on his chest reading ""KILLED FOR A BOWL OF SOUP;"" close-up shots of the clenching fists of the hundreds of spectators who are finally fed up with the Tsarist regime; a wayward baby carriage careers down the Odessa Steps as desperate onlookers watch on with bated breath (this scene was memorably ""borrowed"" by Brian De Palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his 'The Untouchables'); the barrels of numerous canons are ominously leveled towards the vastly-outnumbered battleship Potemkin.<br/><br/>However, the film itself is best analysed  not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes  but as a single film, and, indeed, every scene is hugely memorable. Though divided into five fairly-distinct chapters, the entire film flows forwards wonderfully; at no point do we find ourselves losing interest, and we are absolutely never in doubt of whose side we should be sympathetic towards.<br/><br/>The film is often referred to as ""propaganda,"" and that is exactly what it is, but this need not carry a negative connotation. 'The Battleship Potemkin' was produced by Eisenstein with a specific purpose in mind, and it accomplishes this perfectly in every way. Planned by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the 20th century celebrations of the unsuccessful 1905 Revolution, 'Potemkin' was predicted to be a popular film in its home country, symbolising the revitalization of Russian arts after the Revolution. It is somewhat unfortunate, then, that Eisenstein's film failed to perform well at the Russian box-office, reportedly beaten by Allan Dwan's 1922 'Robin Hood' film in its opening week and running for just four short weeks. Luckily, despite being banned on various occasions in various countries, 'The Battleship Potemkin' fared more admirably overseas.<br/><br/>The film also proved a successful vehicle for Eisenstein to test his theories of ""montage."" Through quick-cut editing, and distant shots of the multitudes of extras, the audience is not allowed to sympathise with any individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. Eisenstein does briefly break this mould, however, in a scene where Vakulinchuk flees the ship officer who is trying to kill him, and, of course, during the renowned Odessa Steps sequence, as our hearts beat in horror for the life of the unfortunate child in the tumbling baby carriage. The accompanying soundtrack to the version I watched, largely featuring the orchestral works of Dmitri Shostakovich, served wonderfully to heighten the emotional impact of such scenes.<br/><br/>One of the greatest films of the silent era, 'The Battleship Potemkin' is a triumph of phenomenal film-making, and is a significant slice of cinematic history. The highly-exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never actually any violent massacre on the Odessa Steps) have so completely engrained themselves in the memory, that we're often uncertain of the true history behind the depicted events. This is a grand achievement."
"Snow Leopard","Null","34","45","19 December 2001"," Vivid & Memorable
","This classic is filled with vivid images that stay in your mind after you have watched it, and there is a lot to appreciate in the way that the key scenes were set up and photographed. The visuals are so impressive that the movie's imperfections are usually not so noticeable, and they don't keep it from being a memorable film.<br/><br/>The movie certainly deserves the praise that it gets both for the influence that it has had, and for some ideas that for the time were most creative. The famed 'Odessa Steps' sequence alone demonstrates both fine technical skill and a keen awareness of how to drive home an image to an audience. It deserves to be one of cinema's best remembered sequences. Some of the other scenes also demonstrate, to a lesser degree, the same kind of skill.<br/><br/>It says a lot for how effective all of the visuals are that so many viewers think so highly of ""Battleship Potemkin"" despite a story that is sometimes heavy-handed, and despite characters and acting that are both rather thin. These features might simply stem from the collectivist philosophy that lies behind the story, and they are obscured most of the time by Eisenstein's unsurpassed ability to present pictures that viewers will not forget.<br/><br/>Despite the flaws, this is a movie that most fans of silent films, and anyone interested in the history of movies, will want to see. There's nothing else in its era that's quite like it."

"EThompsonUMD","10","12","16","5 July 2007"," A Seminal Masterpiece of Silent Film
","The silent film masterpiece Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905 and to establish the event as an heroic foreshadowing of the October Revolution of 1917. Ironically the film's director, Sergei Eisenstein, was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to film art. Subsequently, Eisenstein's formalism and suspect politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on ""socialist realism."" Influenced by the Russian film theoretician, Lev Kuleshov, and through him by D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (smuggled into Russia in 1919), Eisenstein constructed his films from a ""collision"" of rapidly edited images, a montage of shots varied in length, motion, content, lighting, and camera angle. Without question the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history - is the ""Odessa Steps"" sequence in Potemkin.<br/><br/>In structure Potemkin is a ""five reeler"" divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of Western drama. In ""Men and Maggots,"" Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and discontent of the battleship's working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny. Even before the sailors and their upper class officers/masters are visually introduced, Eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea. Onboard ship we witness crowded, unsanitary conditions. Eisenstein emphasizes the sailors' dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings, harsh labor, and - most memorably - the maggot infested meat intended for the evening's meal. The ship's nearsighted physician is brought forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup, boiling like the sailors' rage. In accordance with Marxist maxims, the church also fails the men, and we see one of them smashing a plate inscribed with words from The Lord's Prayer from two different camera angles (in perhaps the first deliberate ""jump cut"" in cinema history).<br/><br/>Identified by inter-titles as ""Drama on the Quarterdeck"" and ""An Appeal from the Dead,"" Potemkin's second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the onshore funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution, Vakulinchuk. United by Vakulinchuk's appeals to brotherhood, the initial mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers. A chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by Eisenstein's editing techniques. The officers' quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggot-ridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the revolt (no omelet without breaking eggs) and he is laid out with dignity on an Odessa pier. Hundreds of ordinary Odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge ""Death to the oppressors."" Shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness.<br/><br/>The complex and unforgettable Odessa Steps sequence constitutes the film's fourth act. It begins with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects (parasol, eyeglasses, baby carriage). Suddenly (as exclaims a title card in huge letters) the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. Here Eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting Cossacks below. The mise-en-scene is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom, symbolic metonyms for Russia's oppressive institutions: tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian church.<br/><br/>Punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children. In the first, a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughter's first victims. The boy is shot, but the mother continues running until close-ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son's fallen body being trampled by the crowd. With a much slowed editing pace, the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). They summarily shoot her dead. After this lull, the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach (the womb of Mother Russia?) as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage. In a scene famously imitated in The Untouchables, the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase. Horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom. When the carriage reaches the bottom there is a cut to a Cossack wielding a sword and a classic Kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see: the slaughtering of this pure and symbolic innocent. The final series of shots in the Odessa sequence is of three stone lions, one in repose, one sitting up, and one roaring. The editing animates them into a visual metaphor of the people's awakened rage.<br/><br/>Somewhat anticlimactically, the fifth act returns us to the battleship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await an encounter with other ships from the fleet. They and the viewer expect retribution, but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of comradeship. Eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years. But that quibble aside, Battleship Potemkin stands as one of the seminal works of the silent film era, and it retains extraordinary cinematic power."
"Richardcheese_6","Null","22","35","30 June 2004"," Propaganda? Yes Stunning? Definitely
","To think that this was made almost 80 years ago, but still inspires movies of today (The odessa steps scene = The Untouchables for example). Yes - it is a propaganda movie - it considers the lynch mob attacks on the ruling class / ship's officers to be justifiable, but the shooting of the leader of the ship's revolution is just not on - but even so it is a stunning piece of cinema. It was even banned in Britain until 1954 - so strong was its political message. The characters are one dimensional, but it must be remembered that the aim was to make political statements and symbolise events, so the characters become mere tools of this symbolism. Witness the twirled wax moustache of the evil tsarists - only stopping short of tying a girl to a railway track to complete the image.<br/><br/>The most stunning piece for me however was the quick three frames of the heraldic lions, as the battleship fires upon the Opera House we see first a sleeping lion, then a waking one, and then a third fully alert statue. Whether this symbolised a waking beast representing the revolution, or the tsarists being awoken by the assault upon it I don't know.<br/><br/>Even so, propaganda has never been so impressively done."

Any normal person today who don't know what you ""should"" think about this movie, would probably find it quite boring and strange at times.<br/><br/>Thing is I'm not comfortable with the way the 'rebels' in this movie value lives. Reminds me of the death sentence mentality in the US and other countries today. The sailors kill several officers on the ship, but since they are bad guys that is perfectly OK. When one of the sailors however get killed, the horror. Out of nowhere a couple million of Russians come along and cry their eyeballs out for some sailor's death, a person they've never seen before! It lacks logic, and as I said I think you can go on fine without seeing this movie. Don't get me wrong I still think the movie's OK, but certainly not the greatest of all time."

The scene on the Odessa steps should remain seared into anyone's mind.<br/><br/>Okay, so ""The Battleship Potemkin"" wasn't actually the first movie to use montage, but they did a great job with it here. Certainly any film history class should show this movie. It's a great historical drama (although I will admit that I don't know how accurate it is). A 10/10.<br/><br/>Oh, and we should have learned by now that ""Potemkin"" should be transliterated as ""Potyomkin""."
"jzappa","7","16","25","7 October 2008"," This Film Is Now Obsolete.
","Sergei Eisenstein wrote Battleship Potemkin as a revolutionary propaganda film, but also used it to test his theories of ""montage"". The revolutionary Soviet filmmakers were trying out the result of film editing upon audiences, and Eisenstein endeavored to edit the film in such a way as to generate the utmost emotional reaction, so that the viewer would feel compassion for the defiant sailors and extreme dislike for their pitiless overlords. In the style of most propaganda, the characterization is clearcut and uncomplicated so that the audience could unmistakably tell with whom they should identify.<br/><br/>In both the Soviet Union and abroad, the film stunned audiences not so much for its political message as for its violence, which was explicit by the standards of the age. The film's capability of having great bearing on political ideas by means of emotional reaction was observed by Joseph Goebbels, who said ""anyone who had no firm political conviction could become a Bolshevik after seeing the film."" This remarkable influence felt and feared by tremendously powerful and influential people is something that never happens in regard to cinema today and hasn't for at least half a century now. Do you know why? Because film is a seminal part of life now. It is a part of the media, and it is easy to overlook one movie in favor of another, or film entirely for another facet of the media, like television. When this picture emerged, it was pure, ripe, brand new, almost surreal to its spectators. Eisenstein's theory of montage has been diluted and adulterated by now to the point where it is either completely ignored or thought of as kindergarten. In 1925, who would have though that a moving picture could provoke such a reaction? Who would have thought it had the capability to change someone who watched it?<br/><br/>Now, this film is obsolete. Film-making has advanced too far for this film to have any kind of effect on the contemporary viewer. The dialogue, as in the title cards, feel too painfully scripted, due to having no need to acknowledge during the writing how people, especially common sailors, speak. The title cards that don't represent dialogue are so self-explanatory that they make the images futile and redundant. ""Bowl of soup."" Oh, really? There are great closeups of canons, but aside from them, there is no composition, which had not been established as firmly as Eisenstein's montage theory. One shot juxtaposed with another doesn't necessarily say it all. One has to direct the forces withing a shot for a cut to serve any purpose.<br/><br/>I have tried this picture twice. I have felt nothing. The movie's legendary moment is in the scene of the slaughter of civilians on the Odessa Steps, in which soldiers shoot a mother who is pushing a baby in a carriage, and it rolls down the steps in the midst of the escaping mass. This image has been imitated in Brazil, The Untouchables, The Godfather, Joshua and 28 Weeks Later to name a few. These are the only ones of which I can think that I myself have seen, and each one has a more exciting ""Odessa steps sequence"" rendition than the original ""Odessa steps sequence."" There is nothing wrong or flat in Eisenstein's sequence. It is well shot and well edited, and why would so many great films imprint off of an unbearably boring film? Because to the generations to which their makers belong, it still had resonance, and it left an effect upon them. But can you watch Brazil or The Godfather and feel that Potemkin, in your own perspective regardless or history's, even compares?"
"LawrenceWoodman","8","3","3","7 October 2011"," Slow start, but a great second half
","Battleship Potemkin is really a film of two halves. The first is a bit slow and sets the scene, showing the sailors mistreatment at the hands of their officers. Where it really livens up though, is once the action switches to the Odessa steps. Here the stirring music is the perfect accompaniment to the events and as the second half progresses a strong continual beating of the drum echoes the soldiers footsteps and indeed the heartbeats of the people you are watching. It helps build the tension until the drum is even syncing with your own heat beat as you become engrossed in the events. For me this is the true master stroke and the reason that I can let the first half go and still really recommend this film."

Of course, the German High Fleet and the Royal Navy didn't mutiny but conditions on board their ships were similar. It is also of interest for the filming of the small sail boats that go out to the Potemkin with provisions. Hundreds of them and it is an important film record of the type of craft still being used in the 1920s.<br/><br/>As for the rest, so much of it never happened but it is etched onto peoples minds so much that people visit Odessa expecting to see a plaque or a statue commemorating the massacre on the steps.<br/><br/>Once you know the true history I think the film loses some of its impact but as an example of film making, of its time, it will always be studied and commented on. Definitely worth watching but prepare to be a little disappointed."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","5","6","24 July 2011"," Masterful film-making from Sergei Eisenstein
","When ""Battleship Potemkin"" was released in Moscow back in 1925 it was described by some as the greatest film of all time. While I can't claim much familiarity with films predating 1925, I expect that those people were probably right. But what's truly astonishing is how well the film stands up, even today.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin. Fed up with poor treatment, they revolt and overthrow their superiors. However, this accomplished, they meet the inevitable resistance from the military, whom they implore to join them. Predictably, the plot & intertitles savour of propaganda but not overwhelmingly so.<br/><br/>Easily the most impressive aspect of the film is the visual aspect. Eisenstein's direction is impeccable but his editing techniques were nothing short of revolutionary. There's a reason why this film is still considered one of the greatest films of all time by countless critics.<br/><br/>That's not the film's only drawing point, though. Nearly as impressive is the original score by Edmund Meisel. I watched the 2005 restoration where the score was adapted by Helmut Imig and I found it to be an integral element of the picture. Though there have been other scores for the film over the years I can't imagine any better than this one.<br/><br/>Ultimately, while ""Battleship Potemkin"" is mainly notable for pioneering influential techniques it also functions as a rousing, tense historical drama. If you're a true lover of the art of cinema there's simply no excuse for not seeing this movie."
"MartinHafer","9","8","11","29 July 2006"," Complete propaganda but technically brilliant
","At the onset, it must be understood that this film was a propaganda piece that was made with the backing of the new Soviet government. I doubt that director Eisenstein had a lot of control over the product as it had to conform to what the government demanded,...or else! And, as far as producing a propaganda film to commemorate the abortive 1905 Revolution goes, he did an exceptional job! So good that it took years for Stalin to get around to persecuting the director and purging several of his later films (now THAT'S gratitude ""Stalin-style"").<br/><br/>The film is a pretty simple movie that concerns a real-life rebellion on the Russian naval ship POTEMKIN as well as an uprising in Odessa by the masses. And, from what I was able to learn, the story was probably relatively faithful to the events though they were of course dramatized a bit here and there. Despite the movie making it appear that all the officers on board were killed, the crew killed several but others were allowed to live. Also, the incredibly sensationalistic and evil character of the insane-looking priest on board the ship was just a very clumsy attempt by the Soviets to ridicule their enemy--organized religion. But, the crew really DID rebel, the citizens of the city really were massacred by the army and the Potemkin did actually escape unscathed because the other ships refused to fire on her. Unfortunately, what happened next was never covered in the film and I wish it had been. While it made it look as if perhaps the other ships joined Potemkin in rebellion, this wasn't the case. Instead, the ship defected to Romania and most of the crew either stayed there or returned after the 1917 revolution--the few that returned sooner were prosecuted.<br/><br/>If you ignore some inconsistencies and over-the-top priest character, the rest of the film is brilliant, moving and was a very effective piece. Compared to other Hollywood productions, the camera-work was amazing--with crane shots, cameras that seamlessly moved with the action and terrific dramatic scenes that made you almost wish you, too, were a Communist.<br/><br/>I noticed that there were quite a few negative reviews and those who felt the film was overrated. While I do agree its reputation is greatly overrated, I can't agree with scores of 1, 2 or 3 stars, as technically the film is well-made and effective compared to other films of the day. Don't let the film's political bias make you dismiss it unfairly, but also do not accept the film as Gospel (that's an interesting choice of words considering the Atheist Soviet government, eh?)."
"sheepie87","5","11","17","18 June 2008"," Honestly, I wasn't a fan
","Okay, so let me start off by saying that I am not a film studies major, neither am I a doofus who only finds cinematic satisfaction in shoot-em-ups (although they are quite fun!). One of my favorite movies is Lang's Metropolis, so I expected something similar here.<br/><br/>Alas, not really. I can't analyse the montage, the shots, the cuts, etc. because I don't have that background. But to my (perhaps jaded and most definitely cynical) eyes most of the movie seemed quite ridiculous. I know I have to think of the context and of film-making at the time, but I honestly think that Potemkin could have done without a lot of film we see.<br/><br/>So, anyway, we start out on a ship where the soldiers are maltreated by pompous officers who order them to eat maggot infested meat. This is shaping up well. They refuse to eat the soup made with the meat (so good so far), which ticks off the officers, most of whom have pointy waxed mustaches that they twirl with malice. The portly captain orders all hands on deck and proceeds to inform those who did not eat the soup that he will kill them all. <br/><br/>This gave me pause. Logically, what would a captain have to gain if he executed the majority of his crew? A whole lot more work for himself, that's what! Okay. So the captain is a dolt. Anyway, he orders the ship's guard to fire upon a group of ""we want something else""-ers who have been draped in a tarpaulin for easy jettisoning and assuaged consciences. In an agonizingly long and unrealistic sequence, everyone looks at each other for a while; finally the ship's resident revolutionary persuades everyone to turn on the officers, most of whom are thrown overboard to drown (since swimming is not a prerequisite to become a naval officer in tsarist Russia, evidently). The ship's priest, a man who desperately needs some Frizz-Ease or maybe just a hint of hair gel, and who is very much the crazy-man Rasputin type, gets pushed down a ladder (into Hell?). However, one of them pursues the ship's Lenin and shoots him in the back of the head. Said shot man then is obviously a hardy fellow, since he manages to reach his hand up and touch his head wound, fall into a net of ropes and writhe for a while before he falls into the sea. His comrades sail into Odessa harbor and dump him on the shore in a tent.<br/><br/>The whole town turns out to see him, and they get all whipped up and vow to destroy the oppressors. Then we have the famous Odessa stairs sequence, which I admit was quite moving, but also too long. I felt like an awful person for smirking when the bereaved mother with her obviously dead son in her arms says to the troops ""My son is very ill."" Well, if that isn't an understatement I don't know what is. Does anyone know if this is an exact translation?<br/><br/>Anyway, at the end of the film all the other ships join Potemkin. Revolution is fun, yay!"

The mutiny starts an uprising against the tsarist government among the people of Odessa. However, the government sends a squadron of warships to bring the crew of the Potemkin to heel. Things look grim for the crew.<br/><br/>Directed by Sergei Eisenstein, Battleship Potemkin is not just a landmark film in history, for its cinematic innovations, but a great film full stop. Great action, empathetic characters and plot and a fantastic cliff-hanger at the end.<br/><br/>Eisenstein's main contribution to cinematic development was 'Soviet montage theory': through clever editing, the viewer is drawn into and carried along with the scene. A great example of this in Battleship Potemkin is the soldiers vs townsfolk scene on the steps. Through dozens of mini-scenes within the main scene, the dynamism, panic and horror of the situation are conveyed to the audience."

","So, I approached this in the way I guess people might approach silent movies - as something that was going to be clunky but quite interesting. I'd seen Metropolis - I thought I knew the form.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the way Eisenstein captured everyday events on board the Potemkin. It has none of the fierce narrative drive of later movie, leaving the director free to show whatever he wants, anything he believes to be visually arresting. The use of boiling soup as a visual metaphor for conditions on board ship is inspired.<br/><br/>The propaganda aspects verged between odd and amusing. Make no mistake this is a communist film. the crazy priest with the wild hair showing the communist disapproval of religion. At times it verges on the unbelievable - could one cry of ""Comrades!"" really stop an entire firing squad? And then I got to the most famous sequence - The Odessa steps. And that was where all my tolerant amusement shattered and fell to pieces.<br/><br/>The Odessa steps sequence is savage. It's brutal. Like Salvador Dali's Un chien Andalu, it remains shocking even to this day. Blood, carnage and brutality. And of course, a baby in a pram falls to its death, in one has to be one of the most renown sequences in cinema.<br/><br/>You may thing you've heard enough about this film, but you really have to see it to believe it.

Cinema owes this movie for what it has done. Some people see it as a precious collectible only to be enjoyed from time to time but it is much more. It is a dramatic and emotional experience of anguish. There are many scenes from this film which are now famous. The baby carriage rolling down the stairs in the middle of a massacre is the most famous. The whole scene is tragic, suspenseful and wonderfully filmed.<br/><br/>Although there is little or no character development, I felt the anguish the sailors felt. I felt sorry for the people during the massacre. The plot is minimal, but that doesn't make the movie boring. I was never bored during those 75 mins.

I think that a mistake, and would like to recommend to viewers that they put two others higher on their lists -- one very early and one very late.<br/><br/>`October' is highly experimental.

But the film has soul compared to mere competence. It lives rather than just points to life.<br/><br/>`Ivan Part 1' is much later. Apparently by this time, Eisenstein has abandoned the montage and (because beaten all his life) has adopted the relaxed, `normal' style. But this is not so. It has instead been so completely absorbed it is invisible, But it is there with shocking mastery. If you are interested in film and editing. <br/><br/>Don't flock to ""Battleship:"" it is too obvious to be interesting -- not yet mastery and too late for the exuberance of invention.

","I'm never one to turn a film down, unless it's got Ben Affleck in it, then i'm always hesitant. But alas, i recently received an invite to a 1925 silent Russian film named Battle Potemkin, and once it was confirmed Ben Affleck was not in this film, i was good to go. Showing at London's Southbank, i was excited to see a silent film in the cinema, something i've never done before, and also excited to see a film called by many critics as one of the great films of the 20th century. <br/><br/>The film is a bit of revolutionary propaganda, dealing with the plight of a rebellious set of sailors, and from the minute it begins it is clear that these sailors are the heroes of the film. What follows is five brief episodes (the films is only 70 minutes long) which charts the mutiny led by the sailors against their heinous officers. Soon enough the whole of the City (Odessa for those keeping count) revolts and in a magnificent piece of film-making (especially considering this was made 86 years ago) there is a stampede which is brutally captured and wouldn't look out of a place in a low-budget film made today. The finale of the film is a triumph and strangely uplifiting, who woulda guessed a Russian mutiny would evoke such emotion??!<br/><br/>This film is a great way to introduce somebody to silent films, it is relatively short and moves at a great speed. One thing i loved about the lack of dialogue was the focus instead on the visual aspects of the film, as an audience member you also have more space to look at facial expressions and mannerisms without being held back by subtitles, and this is where the attachment to the film really comes alive. I would give this film an 8/10, it's different, and has certainly got me interested in silent films, now, where's that Charlie Chaplin DVD?"
"kluseba","9","2","2","18 December 2011"," The political message is questionable but technically this movie is a milestone
","The works of Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein in the early days of Soviet Union's cinema easily beats anything Hollywood published at the same time. The score is bombastic, the images are intense and the avant-garde camera shootings and runs are innovating. Even a century after its creation, the scenes on the Odessa staircase are still highly impressive.<br/><br/>For Eisenstein, cinema was an art with many facets and his attraction montage fusions the meanings of images, words and music into a powerful and baffling piece of art. This movie works a lot with contrasts. You can see the small and dark rooms of the sailors and the big and light rooms of the tsarist officers. You can see the beautiful dishes with religious inscriptions for the rich personal on board and the foul dead meat for the sailors. You can see the sadness of a despaired woman that loses her young child that is shot in the back while you can see the pitiless army that creates an incredible bloodbath. The movie focuses on the rebellion and solidarity of a crowd and not of a single hero and already represents early Soviet ideals but the acting of many single persons is simply incredible and very close to theatre if you take a look at the expression on the faces of the actors. This movie is filled with details and close to perfection from an artistic point of view.<br/><br/>Of course, there is a lot of symbolism in the movie and a lot of propaganda but as censorship wasn't yet as extreme as it would be during the next three decades under the tyranny of a powerful madman called Stalin this movie still portrays the opinion of Eisenstein who comes from Latvia that had been annexed by the Russian tsar. It's more a revolutionary movie than a propaganda movie and is not so far from true historic facts as it is the case for movie such as ""The Birth Of A Nation"" or ""Der Jude Süss"". Still, this slight slices of propaganda are reason enough to cut off one point from the final rating.<br/><br/>This is a truly artistic movie that any fan of cinema should at least once see in his lifetime. If you haven't seen it yet and doubt its quality, don't hesitate any longer. Even if the political message is definitely questionable, this short flick is definitely bombastic, epic and always entertaining."
"peqdavid5","10","2","2","29 January 2009"," A breathe-taking and innovative film
","Silent cinema has a special delight because sometimes you can't express with dialog an idea that can be shown in a single frame. In ""Battleship Potemkin"" we find a young and inspired Eisenstein that wanted to do something for the upcoming anniversary of the October Revolution. The famous case of the rebel crew of the Potemkin and the Odessa massacre looked like the perfect plot for a director with unique vision. This film took Eisenstein to glory and to hatred. Why? Foreign film critics considered the film as a work of art (which it is) but the Russian people and politicians hated it because it gave ""a bad image"" of the USSR. After some good but forgotten films (""October"" is a nice example), Eisenstein ran away from his detractors and finished his life filming some ambitious films in Mexico and Japan. Sergei became the European version of Orson Welles: no film of his after ""Potemkin"" became as famous or recognized. Something curious happens with this movie: every time you watch it you find something new and fascinating about it. After 20 times I watched it, I realized that not only is the finest editing work in the history of cinema, is one of the greatest and spectacular war films of all time. By the way, I read the trivia few days ago and I learned that it was Chaplin's favorite film. Now I understand why."

","I saw this for only the second time recently and I'm not sure I can judge it properly. You sort of have to BE there in order to fully appreciate something new, and I mean ""appreciate"" in the sense of ""recognize the quality, significance, or magnitude of"" the thing. Any artistic or scientific product has to be judged in the context of its time and I've only seen a couple of Charlie Chaplin's movies from that period.<br/><br/>This was released in, what, 1926? Eighty years ago. So imagine a viewer eighty years from now transported to our age, seeing only one or two movies, and trying to judge them. ""Die Hard 2""? A MASTERPIECE. It's in glorious color, dodekaphonic sound, superwide screen, a story that blends drama, excitement, adventure, period airplanes, humor, all in one superb Gesamtkunstwerk. But a time traveler wouldn't think so if he knew that a hundred other action movies, more or less identical, were being ground out like Superburgers at a Sonic Drive-In.<br/><br/>That's the position most of us non film scholars are in with respect to films like ""Battleship Potemkin."" We KNOW it must be good because everyone says so. Directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the Gay Revolutionary given to triadic arrangements. But in many ways it's primitive. The officers aboard the ship look like stereotyped sneering villains. The characters, good and bad, are made of cardboard. We don't really get to know any of them well. The miniatures are obvious toys. And the acting is uniformly over the top.<br/><br/>But from our current perspective, even with the most minimal of contexts, it's a gripping movie because of the theme and the way the director handles it. The first time I saw it the maggots on the meat were kind of disgusting. Shockingly disgusting material was still a rarity on the screen, though it's now commonplace. And the Captain of the ship is about to execute a dozen of his men because THEY REFUSE TO EAT HIS STUPID SOUP! Okay, that's one thing. But look at the way Eisenstein manipulates the detail in the scene when the execution is about to take place. The recalcitrant swine are huddled together on deck. A conventional treatment calls for them to cower against the rails and wait for the bullets. But no. Eisenstein spends time having them covered up with an ominous canvas tarp that gets several shots of its own. We can't see the men under the canvas. It's just a rough bubble with an irregular surface -- until one of the men under it faints and one of the bumps in the canvas slumps to the deck. Well, context aside, that's a pretty innovate statement. A less imaginative director would have spelled the whole scene out for us. The terrified faces of the men, the pleading, the sobbing, the praying. But Eisenstein trusts in the maturity of his audience and turns the incident into a rich display of mature taste. And that kind of realistic detail is used in other important scenes. When the wounded hero falls overboard he doesn't simply splash into the sea. Instead he lands on a snatch block, bent backwards, head and feet dangling a bit above the water, hanging for a moment while his mates dive in to save him.<br/><br/>The blood comes later and there isn't much of it but what there is, is powerful. One bullet on the Odessa steps generates a greater emotional impact than the sight of all the gallons of Haemocolor Number Nine Red that Bruce Willis has shed in all his action movies put together. We can make a good guess that the one shot of the bullet hole through the eyeglass lens was an innovation because it's been copied so often since -- from dramas like ""The Godfather"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" to parodies like Woody Allen's. A guy with no legs running away from the bullets. I'd guess that was innovative too.<br/><br/>The story is about the 1905 uprising that took place after the debacle of the Russo-Japanese war. It adumbrates the REAL revolution that came in 1917 during World War I. If the Czars knew what was good for them they'd have avoided wars whenever at all possible. (Change that from ""Czars"" to ""heads of state."") Like all revolutions, though, this one left unanswered the question, ""Who's running things around here?"" Certainly the church would have nothing to do with it. The priest who tries to quiet down the mutineers gets bonked for his pains and the crucifix embedded in the wooden deck.<br/><br/>At any rate, historical context aside, it's a powerful movie despite any weaknesses. Eighty years, and we are still gripped by its images and its story. It can still rouse us, like those sleeping lions in Odessa."

What he did was try to utilize them to<br/><br/>create a stirring and powerful cinematic experience, which he<br/><br/>certainly did.<br/><br/>One thing I love about Eisenstein's films is his use of ""types"",<br/><br/>really distinctive-looking actors. The citizens of Odessa look<br/><br/>fascinating, especially the wealthy-looking woman with the veiled<br/><br/>hat. The ship's creepy-looking, bearded and mustachioed doctor<br/><br/>was very effective as an evil presence just asking to be overthrown.<br/><br/>Eisenstein also provides us with plenty of beefy, sexy sailors,<br/><br/>which you really can't complain about.

The same 5 second snippet of sailors brawling during the mutiny is spliced in so many times amongst other footage that I lost count.

","I did something a little daring tonight when I watched this movie. I attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores. Sure, when this film originally was distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. Oftentimes, the director would choose the score himself (Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released. And, then again, there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score. I do not know the history of Potemkin's score, so I decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within - film. <br/><br/>Soon after I turned the music off, unaided (or should I say unimpeded) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen, I became utterly attached to the film. Visually, it is easily one of the most stunning of all films. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The editing, possibly the cinematic technique Eisenstein is most famous for (montage), is extraordinary. The mood of this film is anger, and it stirred my passions violently. <br/><br/>It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film, especially a drama, but films like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this film! Your education is incomplete without it."

This film broke ground on the illustrative syllogism which depicted the deplorable living conditions in Russia!! The classic staircase scene marked an unprecedented précis of bedlam emanating from relentless squalor, as well as doom and despair!! Brian DiPalma (Fanous director who directed ""The Untouchables"") attempted a duplication scene of the baby carriage going down the staircase. It would stand to reason that such classic cinematic genius that ""Battleship Potemkin"" illustrated with this scene would be subject to imitations by subsequent movies; that is almost something that is inevitable!! What is so remarkable about this movie is that just because it was made when only silent pictures were around, did not mean that this film conveyed any less of a socially poignant message!! The fact that this film was silent became an aspect to ""Battleship Potemkin"" that actually enhanced this picture a great deal!! This film has always been rated as one of the best pictures ever made, and, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is a movie classic that brings on an intellectual enlightenment to the forefront of the wonderful world of cinema!! YOU MUST SEE ""BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN"" IT IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!! HERE IS A BIT OF VERY INTERESTING TRIVIA FOR YOU: ""BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN"" WAS CHARLIE CHAPLIN'S FAVORITE MOVIE!!"

","When I was going to see this, it wasn't for anything else than film history (im not a film student, just very interested) I was shocked to find out how much I actually enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The core power of the film is how the director got the viewer involved in the story, which Eisenstein was a master at. From when the crew on the battleship start to rebel, and the massacre, its all very powerful. The shots are beautiful, and the music is great. This went right into my top 10 films of all times, its a great work of art. <br/><br/>The most memorable thing about the film though, was the massacre scene. There was many powerful shots, like the woman with her dead son in her arms, lots of people getting killed outright, and of course, the famous baby cradle scene. <br/><br/>If one does not find appreciation in the value of the film, it should at least be appreciated for being one of the most influential films of the 20's."
"Andy-296","5","8","15","27 January 2008"," Has aged somewhat, but still must see for film buffs
","Sergei Eisenstein's landmark film, from 1925, alerted western audiences that something important was happening in the Soviet Union in terms of film-making (Lenin: ""Cinema to us is the most important art""). The film itself deals with the 1905 uprising of the battleship of the title, how the crew of the ship rebelled against the czarist officers when they were asked to eat rotten meat, how after the mutiny the ship landed in the port of Odessa in the Black Sea (receiving the support of the population), and how the rebellion was suppressed by troops loyal to the regime. To achieve its effects, the film used the then new technique of rapid cutting. Elected in a film congress in 1959 as the best film ever, and still considered a classic, it hasn't aged that well. There is the famous scene of the repression at the Odessa steps, repeated so many times in TV, that are famous to even those who hadn't seen the movie. Whatever its failings, every film buff should see this movie at least once. Personally, I think Eisenstein made better movies, for example, ""Alexander Nevsky"" or ""Ivan the Terrible"". It is unfortunately true that cinema ages much faster than other forms of art. For example, one can read a novel written in the 1930s without much problems, yet most movies made in that decade look terribly dated now (I think many movies made in the 60s and 70s look dated). This has to do with cinema being an art supported by technology, and technology can get outdated quickly, of course. But there must be something else that I'm not able to define that make movies age so quickly."
"francpsantos","9","3","4","12 November 2018"," A lesson in editing a lot of film makers should learn nowadays
","The fact that I watched this laying in bed in a Sunday night, without loosing my attention or even falling into the embrace of Morpheus, already says a lot. For starters, the soundtrack is interesting a good way to engage you in the movie. Plotwise, it is an interesting story to contextualize the spirit of the Russian revolution. Albeit heavily propagandized, which sometimes may throw you off if you're not particularly crazy about the ideology, the plot still provides for some entertaining 75 minutes, while complementing what, to me, is the focal point of the film. The way ahead of its time editing and cinematography. It may not come to one's mind while watching the movie, but in a time when editing consisted in cutting and glueing film rolls together, it takes a tremendous amount of work to create a movie where some shots last less than a second. It is some common today, with digital film making, that it is easy to forget how big an accomplishment Battleship Potemkin is. This would, of course, be rendered forgettable if not used ingeniously by Eisenstein to immerse the viewer so deeply in the atmosphere of the story. After reading about his 5 methods of montage, it is clear how he uses every single one in the movie, and how much it serves to enhance the plot. If just watching the Massacre at Odessa scene, without over-analyzing, is already quite an experience, watching it again after knowing what's behind is an even further enriching experience. The cinematography is good as well, particularly in scenery of the port of Odessa, with great examples of high contrast and lighting. And again, this was 1925, and visually it is still miles ahead of a great deal of movies I see today. I am truly never tired of watching movies from this period, where the movie industry was not dominated by one single market, and I advise anyone to watch this movie to show that not all the great things in cinema were made in Hollywood.<br/><br/>""Killed for a plate of soup"""

","FILMING OF OUTDOOR events on a truly grand scale is the hallmark of this film. It is obvious that there was near unlimited budget and an autocratic and absolute control exerted by the director, Comrade Sergei Eisenstein. The filming is done in such a carefully plotted manner as to appear to be an actual newsreel documentary.<br/><br/>THE STORY IS a retelling of a 1905 incident of rebellion and mutiny against the hierarchy of the Imperial Czarist Russian Navy. It builds its tension with use of varying camera angles, liberal doses of editing, imaginative & original lighting and boldly placed bits of shocking realism.<br/><br/>THE FILM IS very powerful and will hold just about anyone's interest for the duration of its time on the screen. We do recommend that anyone and everyone can and should see it at least once, But we do do with just one caveat to all.<br/><br/>THAT PRECAUTIONARY WARNING would be that we all must remember that the movie is and was intended as a propaganda piece for the likes of Joe Stalin and his comrades the USSR. Director Eisenstein definitely knew of what side his bread was buttered as he carefully crafted the telling of this 1905 incident on the Black Sea as an allegorical work. In his capable hands & clapboard, the whole situation and all of the incidents surrounding it were reduced to metaphor for the Russian Revolution and the ascent of the Communist Party.<br/><br/>DURING THE PROCESS of telling this story, the director actually manages to make a case for the dignity of man. Now that is just bizarre and ironic; when one considers the track record of the Kremlin masters. The Communist Party has always called itself: ""The Vanguard of the People"", no matter how many of their own people that they had to kill to prove it."
"Tweekums","10","3","4","23 September 2011"," A silent classic
","There are many films that film fans should try to see at least once and this is one of them. Sergei Eisenstien's 1925 silent classic features the sort of techniques one still sees today but at the time were, if you'll forgive the pun, revolutionary. Set during an uprising against Tsarist oppression in 1905 the crew of the eponymous battleship have had enough of ill treatment and being served soup made from maggot-infested meat is the last straw. They refuse to eat it and the captain orders them to be shot! Luckily for them the firing squad refuses to obey their orders and soon the officers are in the sea and the men are in control of the ship; although not without the loss of the man who inspired their revolt. When the people of Odessa hear what has happened they rally in support of the men, but in one of cinema's most famous scenes many of them including women and children are gunned down on the now famous Odessa steps.<br/><br/>Before I watched this film I must admit I didn't know what to expect; I knew it was a classic but I wasn't so sure that somebody used to modern films where people actually talk could be gripped by a film with only the occasional inter-title to give some idea of what was being said of course I needn't have worried; it is a classic for a reason. The action scenes where they take over the ship and even more so where the Cossacks gun down innocent civilians were more gripping than many of today's action directors could hope for. Being made in the Soviet Union less than ten years after the successful revolution of 1917 it is obviously a propaganda piece but that doesn't matter as the story is gripping and the action is believable. I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody who can cope with the idea of watching a eighty-five year old movie."
"chaos-rampant","Null","3","4","22 August 2011"," The working, collective eye
","I don't recommend that you see this as a 'landmark' in film; don't merely pass through to say you did, or because it's a travelled destination for most people. Instead, come to this with fresh eyes if you can. Rarely since has a film - and film tradition - been so deeply centered within its worldview, rarely indeed is a film made of the very fabric of the world it gives voice to. Most films these days are built at random, or from random spare parts.<br/><br/>Eisenstein had already made a more successful film before this, more reflexively about the seeing eye. So, even though there is a more rip-roaring story here, you may have to struggle a bit with how faceless appears this world to us, these days so accustomed to the paradigm of the individual hero. But Eisenstein was an architect - literally, as well as in film - and so space matters, our relationship with space through motion matters.<br/><br/>In other words; this may have been preserved to us as a museum piece, which is an indictment of our own understanding of cinema as coming down to us by the books and lists of assorted institutions, but at the time it was part of the most deeply revolutionary film school, one that rigged trains as movie studios and sent them scurrying the countryside to film the people and show them to themselves. I mean, here was a man - Eisenstein - who studied Japanese ideograms to understand synthesized image; who discovered that editing to the beats of the human heart affected more, true or false it shows the desire to both know and reach out.<br/><br/>Our cinematic ideas have mostly regressed into mechanical reproduction since the time when these things were first engineered. Oh, there's plenty of Eisenstein every time you open the TV, but none of it is knowing. It's merely a matter of going-through-the-motions, without the blueprint anymore.<br/><br/>So, look at how crowds are orchestrally conducted through stark geometries, how Eisenstein dissects cinematic space with even a stationary camera. But this type of cinema meant to agitate the people, was never about a thought, it was about an action.<br/><br/>And so with this one. There is the one hero who, although dead, calls out to the people. They rush to him, like ships around their harbor. So on board the ship there is valiant effort for brotherhood and justice, inspired revolution; portside is the motherland, cheering the effort with aplomb. And in the end there is the hero ship, itself filled with heroes, now passing through a sea corridor lined with brother ships, all cheering the one. You can imagine the people cheering at the cinema, who had been there to cheer the real thing years ago. <br/><br/>And when I say 'the real thing' I mean the revolution 8 years before; the Potemkin event depicted here was purely fictional. Yet by the famous steps at Odessa is erected a monument to the fictional sailors, what better example of cinema shaping reality?<br/><br/>So yes, it is a revolutionary film. We may be inclined to make fun of the notions, or worse yet dismiss off-hand because of hindsight knowledge. But this was a film celebrating a time when the world seemed like it could be new again. Then came Stalin and, ironically, vanished all these filmmakers that sung the paeans."

The story is based on the real-life Russian Battleship Potemkin. You wouldn't think it but some of it was sad and disgusting. Sad being that the mother dies and the pram rolls down the stairway and disgusting being they have to eat rotten meat with maggots in it.<br/><br/>Today it is still considered to be one of the best silent and Russian films ever made.

","The Battleship Potemkin is one of those few films that can truly be said changed cinema forever. The story focuses around sailors aboard the Potemkin Battleship, a Tsarist ship in 1905. The crew is heavily mistreated and are fed rotten meat. Eventually revolution breaks out and mutiny occurs. The events lead the crew into sailing for Odessa where one of the most famous scenes of the 20th century occurred.<br/><br/>Battleship Potemkin is one of the most influential films I have ever seen.

Few directors are able to captivate crowds but Einstein does it with relative ease.<br/><br/>The film gave brought forth many new elements to films. Violence is the biggest of all. Films before 1925 did feature violence but in a way in which it did not bother a crowd. Battleship Potemkin's violence is straight forward and overall in your face. The Odessa Steps scene is one of the most violent and saddest scenes I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Battleship Potemkin is a film not to be missed by anyone. The story is top notch and based on the actual mutiny aboard the Potemkin in 1905. The acting is outstanding for its time with no central character which makes the picture a lot better in my opinion. But by far the greatest part of the film is the extravagant cinematography and camera work.

In fact, if one were to have The Odessa Steps segment in a film today, it would be met with with the same jaw-dropping amazement as it must have been in 1925.<br/><br/>Besides his brilliant montages, Eisenstein gives us some awesome visual moments - the parades of people walking down to the ship, the fuel of the ship curling out against the ocean sky; the sails on the water, and the dramatic way the film ends as the ship moves toward us - all breathtaking.<br/><br/>But I am in complete amazement over The Odessa Steps segment, the entire thing, of which the massacre on the steps is a part.

"Qanqor","4","9","18","21 August 2010"," I'll add a negative voice
","In some ways, Battleship Potemkin was probably pretty impressive in 1925. I can understand why it is a milestone in the history of film and why film students study it and all. The camera work and montage editing is pretty impressive. There is a lot of epic spectacle captured on film. And I will even grant that some of the scenes work pretty well. For these reasons, I gave the film the four stars that I gave it.<br/><br/>But for me, the negatives still significantly outweigh the positives. On the whole I did not enjoy the film, and I even found some of its technical aspects very poorly done, even for the day.<br/><br/>The big problem here is that what we have is a propaganda piece. As such, the film is ridiculously heavy-handed and obvious, to the point of bathos. The evil officers and soldiers are so over the top that they lack credibility. We're supposed to feel this great sympathy for the downtrodden sailors and workers, but I felt precious little, mainly because I was so aware and irritated at the overt and clumsy way I was being manipulated. And let's get real here: these men are serving on a major *warship*, which means they potentially face a life of war and death and destruction and pain and suffering... having to eat soup made of bad meat should be the worst hardship they ever have to endure! The nadir, when I was supposed to feel the most empathy and I actually felt the least, was when the guy's corpse was on display, with the sign about him having been killed for a plate of soup. Puh-lease. He was killed for inciting a mutiny.<br/><br/>While we're discussing overbearing, heavy-handed propagandizing, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the priest. Now let's set some personal context here: I am a devout atheist, I despise religion in all forms, and certainly have no love for Christianity. Yet even *I* was offended by the crude characterization of the ship's priest, as some kind of wild-haired, wild-eyed hermit type, by crackey! When a Nazi propaganda film depicts a Jew in an over-the-top slandering caricature, we're all properly offended; so why is it suddenly OK when a soviet propaganda film does the same thing to a priest?<br/><br/>But propaganda here isn't the only problem. There is also the problem of pace. By modern standards, this is a short film; the version I saw was only 74 minutes. Yet it felt like an eternity, because in many scenes the pacing was just leaden. For instance, the scene where all of Odessa comes out to mourn the death of the sailor (and I wholly agree with another commenter here about how preposterous it is that these giant throngs of people are weeping tears, consumed with grief, over this one dead sailor that not one of them knew or had ever heard of; again, we reach the stage of bathos), this scene seems to run for a decade.<br/><br/>And the nadir of bad pacing: the scene preliminary to the mutiny, when the captain is ordering up punishment. The scene is so slow it actually induces physical pain. It's so slow that it actually becomes surreal. We have to sit there and actually watch as these officers rather clumsily and ineptly unfold the tarp. Let me say that again: we have to sit there and watch them actually unfold the whole tarp. Nobody thought that having the captain say ""Bring out the tarp!"" and then cutting to a scene with the men holding an open tarp would be good enough. No, that would ruin the whole film! We must watch them *unfold* the tarp! That's where all the meaning is (I guess)! The result of all this is that the scene is so slow that it becomes ridiculous, as *everyone else is just standing around*. When the targeted victims have the tarp thrown over them, they proceed to just stand around for what feels like 10 minutes, just standing there under a tarp. Remember, these were the men who were supposed to be at the breaking-point of mutiny, but they're just meekly, dumbly standing there, with a tarp on their head. For 10 minutes. The whole thing is so ridiculously paced, it comes off as amateurish. Like a 4th grade play, where the kids aren't entirely sure where exactly they're supposed to be and what exactly they're supposed to be doing. Everybody's just kind of standing around.<br/><br/>Frankly, I just don't see how any thinking person can consider this a great film (let alone the greatest of all time!)"

","1925 was 86 years ago. That was when Sergei Eisenstein's 'Battleship Potemkin' was first released. Hailed then as an exemplary piece of propaganda the film continues, in the minds of many cineastes, to stand the test of time.<br/><br/>As the opening credits rolled, I had this sort of giddy feeling, a feeling that I was experiencing history. This feeling soon faded. Most of the audience were people closer in origin to 1925 than me. That's not to say you have to be 'old' to watch and enjoy 'Battleship', but it's no coincidence that most of those lovely folk were in fact 'old'. <br/><br/>People will debate on IMDb and elsewhere about how relevant the themes remain and how it endures as a seminal piece of film-making (it clearly inspired Brian De Palma's train station sequence in his 'The Untouchables'), but the ultimate question when judging any film is 'Is it enjoyable?' My answer is: It isn't.<br/><br/>The episode – four, I think it was – called 'The Odessa Steps' was the only sequence I, if not enjoyed, then certainly didn't roll my eyes at. It's the scene where a vast army of Odessans rise up against the tyranny under which a sailor is killed, and are then routinely massacred by Tsarist troops. It comes on suddenly and is relentlessly violent. It's a familiar boast from directors nowadays, but it boggles the mind to think how Eisenstein controlled such frenzied scenes.<br/><br/>Look closely at the praise and you'll see that critics only really praise this episode. Why? Is the rest of the film not as impressive to them? Can a film really be considered among the greatest based on any one scene? Of course not.<br/><br/>If until then I had enjoyed the film, I would have felt cheated by the ending. Without spoiling it, there is a fairly effective crescendo of tension before a highly anticlimactic climax. I thought afterward that, were this story one of fiction, ending on the steps could have been a much more powerful ending. Allowing the oppressors the victory would have been the stronger condemnation of tyranny instead of the convenient real-life one Eisenstein understandably went with, given the era he made it in.<br/><br/>Even Roger Ebert, whom many consider to be the greatest of all living critics, demonstrated not a fine balancing of opinions, but a contradiction. After praising 'Battleship' to the hilt, he ended his review by saying, 'The fact is, Potemkin doesn't really stand alone, but depends for its power upon the social situation in which it is shown... it suffers when it is seen apart from its context (just as 'The Graduate', by striking the perfect note for 1967, strikes a dated note now). It needs the right audience.' <br/><br/>Unless you have an assignment to write on this film, don't feel compelled to see it. I can't recommend it because on this occasion I can't even say I was at least glad to have had the experience.<br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net"

","This Sergei Eisenstein silent classic from 1927 chronicles (and embellishes) the true story of the uprising of the crew of the Battleship Potemkin in 1905. Their harsh captain and weaselly doctor are forcing them to eat maggoty meat and the crew has had enough. They revolt, killing 7 of the officers including the weaselly doctor. One of their crew is pursued and killed. When they dock at Odessa, they place the dead crew member in a tent on shore. Odessa was already a hotbed of socialist activity and many people come out to see the body. The government freaks out and sends the calvary (mostly unmounted) out to quell the crowd. They open fire and mow down many on the steps. This scene is graphic, exciting and heart-wrenching as we watch women and children get brutally shot by the heartless calvary. The Potemkin leaves and is pursued by warships who mean to bring it back.<br/><br/>This movie is like a milk-chocolate Hershey bar. Or an anti Hershey bar since how can an all-American chocolate represent a, albeit brilliant, propaganda film supporting the Bolsheviks. Let me tell you how. When Hershey's developed their milk chocolate in the early 20th century, it was a huge breakthrough for the chocolate retards (the Americans). It became huge and Hershey's got a large contract with the U.S. Military. Soldiers all had Hershey bars in their rations. This helped spread Hershey's popularity and made the American soldiers popular with kids when they entered new cities. In a way, Hershey bars served as American propaganda. For their time, they were great, but compared the excellent European chocolate, Hershey's is waxy and tastes of sour milk. This film was absolutely brilliant for its time, but silent movies are not to many people's taste these days, nor is melodrama, as we've matured and moved on to bigger things. I enjoyed the film, had I seen it in 1927, I would have given it a 9. If someone had produced this film last year, I would give it a 4. Overall, I'm giving it a 7/10, weighting the historical significance higher than the actual enjoyment of the film on today's terms.<br/><br/>http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"

From the first shot, when the limbless man appears, you get the idea something might be wrong; since the overall shots are composed, though, you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. Then an amputee appears, and people start falling in dramatic poses. Still, the shots are composed... until the Cossacks appear into scene, and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear. This scene is easily worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>4) The fact that this movie is 100% unadulterated propaganda. Then again, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan he also was having something to do with ""propaganda""; only a different kind.<br/><br/>Overall: a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative.

"FilmDog-1","8","3","5","18 March 2002"," A Classic Soviet Propaganda Film That Influenced the Entire Western World
","Filmed throughout the year of 1925; Potemkin was first brought about when director Sergi Eisenstein was commissioned in March of 1925 to make a feature on the 20th anniversary of the beginning of the revolution in 1905. What the final script came out was a script that ran over a hundred pages in length (big for that time) and would attempt to highlight all the main actions and events that happened up to the revolution.<br/><br/>Altogether looking at the film now it can be understandable why the film was banned from any Western countries for nearly 30 years. It's a full ahead propaganda film for the early name Soviet Union. But wonderfully made film.<br/><br/>One of the most memorable and harrowing scenes in the film is the 'Odessa Steps' massacre. A set piece that only lengthed for at least 3 pages in the script but would become one of the most celebrated and most used sequences in the world of cinema. What makes 'The Odessa Steps' so great tho is nothing that it is shot; but the way in which the sequence is edited to together with fast cutting shots added together, which would come about being called 'Montage Editing'; the quick shots of a woman crying, of soldiers marching down the steps firing volleys into the fleeing cowards, the shot back to the woman with blood over her face then one's of soldier's feet marching gives the impression of force and power.<br/><br/>The only problem is with the film is that it gives the impression that it lasts too long; the full version which was re-cut when it was allowed to enter Western cinema's (or even straight to video) was cut down to 63 minutes, from the 189 minute oringal (in which sadly the negative of the epic has been lost somewhere in russia and would probably never be found). The film carries on to long; into which the acting is very poor. But that can be understandble for a silent film; and especially a film of this scale.<br/><br/>The reason for such over the top acting is how can you bring about your charcter's views or opinions in any other way. You can't with sound; because their wasn't any, you can't with continues dialogue captions, because the audience would become to anoyed for reading all the time and not watching in which is the main reason for the cinema, to show moving images that astound the audience. If the film didn't astound the audinece; then the 'Odessa Steps' scene does for film makers later on in the cinema. With films such as:<br/><br/>Woody Allen's 'Bannas' (1971) Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' (1985) Brain DePalma's 'The Untouchables' (1987) and even Leslie Nielson's 'Naked Gun 2 1/2 The Smell of Fear (1991)<br/><br/>

","I am far from an expert on early films.  I can't tell you why certian shots that Eisenstein does here make them as brilliant as they are.  Yes, this is early film and it is quite interesting.  But for me to comment on the "" struggle "" and such is pure nonsense.  But what I can comment on is that I really admired how "" The Odessa Steps"" sequence was very well done.  For the techniques that were employed in 1925, they really made this sequence one to remember.  As for the rest of the film, to be honest I find it interesting but that's as far as it goes.  I am too much a product of the 80's to truly appreciate it.  But I will acknowledge that it has some ground breaking shots and that makes it worth a look."
"ElMaruecan82","9","2","3","17 March 2018"," Images Speaking a Thousand Words, for a Million People...
","Why is it that so many cinematic landmarks happen to be propaganda? <br/><br/>I guess there was a perfect timing with the birth of a new art / medium coinciding with a new century, allowing the early cinematic masterpieces to be studied in film-making schools while not losing any relevance in history classes. <br/><br/>If in its silent first steps, cinema was the latest 'hip' thing, a funny wonder from two French siblings or a mild bourgeois amusement, as technology advanced and authoritarian regimes were looking for the most effective ways to capture the spirit of the masses and then, cinema became a political weapon.<br/><br/>It's all about masses when you think about it, propaganda movies confront us to the real bargain of cinema; different people sitting altogether in the dark, anonymously and eyes converging toward the same images. We're individuals but we form an audience, a collectivity meant to react. The director shouts ""Action!"", for us, it's the reaction.<br/><br/>And this is not a hazard either if most propaganda movies worked during the Silent Era where it was all about the power of images, dialogs rather than faces. In ""Battleship Potemkin"", the most iconic image involves a woman with a broken eyeglass and bleeding eye, Bunuel had the eye sliced but the point is all the same for Eisenstein, the eye is more sensitive than the brain and Eisenstein definitely knew how to catch it.<br/><br/>His ""Battleship Potemkin"" chronicles the injustices underwent by the Potemkin crew, the resulting mutiny and martyrdom, then the solidarity displayed from the people of Odessa and the iconic confrontation with the Tsarist army during the iconic 'steps massacre' and finally another battle leading to the triumph of the Potemkin whose cause has been embraced by the other rebellious ships. <br/><br/>Constructed in different chapters, ""Potemkin"" bears some resemblance with the seminal ""Birth of a Nation"" but the technique of Griffith was far more elaborated in ""Intolerance"", a film he studied to get his inspiration. But while watching ""Potemkin"", I was fascinated by the way Eisenstein almost never uses narration in his cardboards, they all feature cries and dialogues but they never verbalize.<br/><br/>No need to, this is a film that trusts its material. If it was a Griffith' movie, we'd have a group of sailors coming to the office and complaining about the food. Eisenstein provides disgusting glimpses on the maggots crawling over the meat and close-up on an evil officer twirling his mustache while ordering for the borsch to be prepared (with the rotten meat). Close-ups are integral to the power of the film, because it's only when you grasp the feeling of one person that you can extrapolate it to the masses. <br/><br/>Eisenstein understood that we all have a Pavlov reaction, believing that what goes through one person, goes through the other. This is why you can see close-ups on clenching fists, anger sights or before the massacre, of people smiling and waving to amplify the shocking suddenness of the Russian army intervention.<br/><br/>This method also served Eisenstein for shooting of the climax, feeling that there was a lack of energy from the extras, he called one of them by his name, the others thought there was some sort of magic eye staring at them. In reality, Eisenstein picked a random name and had the right effect. That's exactly how the movie works, it finds the perfect balances between crowd shot and individual shots. That's the ""Stakhanovite"" move, and while the massacre feel like a giant wave of people flooding down the stairs, there are individuals we still remember.<br/><br/>Who can forget the woman who just witnessed the death of a child and carry him to the top, going at the exact opposite of the runners, that moment alone while giving a focus on that death enlightens all the other deaths. This isn't just stylish filmmaking, this is a humanity standing and questioning the use of violence. That's something that works out of context and that's the power of ""Potemkin"", whether the unforgettable baby carriage, the killed mother and the broken glasses eye, at the very moment where it happens, we don't think of the Tsar, we think of War.<br/><br/>So the argument that the massacre never happened doesn't hold up, Eisenstein wanted to shot the opposite of truth in the realm of plausibility, and that's why the sequence is powerful regardless of the context, it represents something that can happen anywhere and anytime, and for real. While seeing the woman carrying the child, I start thinking of the Vietnamese girl burnt by the Napalm and running scared and naked on the picture, I thought of that Palestinian boy who died in a shootout while his father was begging the soldiers to cease fire. <br/><br/>""Potemkin"" uses a sort of universal language that transcend the barriers of time and countries, many propaganda movies couldn't work on a universal level because they're too specific. When Goebbels saw Eisenstein's masterpiece, he knew the Third Reich needed a similar movie and on that level, ""The Triumph of the Will"" also became a landmark on its own, but being a masterpiece of propaganda doesn't make it a masterpiece in its own right. ""Potemkin"" can get away with it because the film never let speeches undermine the message, it trusts the images and more than anything, it trusts the editing.<br/><br/>Eisenstein needed a movie to celebrate the revolution of 1905, he initially planned to make an epic project based on many historical chapters but weather convinced him (once again) to have a specific focus, one central piece: from the Potemkin, the spirit of the revolution would be magnified. See, it's all about imploding from within, one image that speaks a thousand words, for a million persons.<br/><br/>The steps massacre became a staple of filmmaking, countlessly replayed in movies for thrills or laughs, elevating it into one of the greatest movies ever, the merit goes to Eisenstein who was so creative and daring that he didn't just made a film about revolution, but he made a revolution!"

"Reverend3000","6","2","3","27 May 2014"," Stunning Imagery, important but still I feel a bit romanticized even for the time
","It is hard for me to criticize this movie because of its importance in cinematic history. As early as 1925, filmed images of large angry, determined masses of people were I am sure few and far in between. Something we take for granted with movies of our time like Hoffa.<br/><br/>Battleship Potemkin, though a must see for any buff or one who appreciates historical events in their context, played out to me like too much of a cliché propaganda film. Obviously I know it was meant for propaganda purposes, so I cannot fault the movie for that. And again, as early as 1925, there wasn't really a mold yet for how propaganda films should look or feel. However, there was news footage, yes even then there was short filmed, propaganda packages with a concise point.<br/><br/>The propaganda of this movie is sometimes just too blatant for me to appreciate it cinematically. Surely, in this time, we had yet to see the horrors and failures of 20th century forced collectivism, and in recent memory was far-right imperial rule in which made the living reality for everyday working men and women, (as always, the majority of the population) a living hell. So in this context, one may try to view this as a film that broke through some kind of barrier to catch that revolutionary spirit and heart of the everyday people who may see this film.<br/><br/>But unfortunately I felt it could've done better. It didn't achieve this exactly at a human level, or a gut connection. The heroes and villains of this seemed too cardboard for me. With every officer, and a clergyman, as stiff oppressors,not one that was sympathetic. Hardly could this be 100% realistic when we are talking of human situations. <br/><br/>I am glad I have finally watched this film. I look forward to watching more of Eisenstein's work."

","Many movies have great cinematography. These movies will have a handful of excellent shots. If that is great cinematography, great would be an insult to this movie's cinematography. Instead of a few excellent shots, every single shot is excellent, every moment wows you. It is relentless; it doesn't give you time to marvel, it makes you marvel more. Considering it is at the core of cinema history, almost everything is, if not a first, the first well developed example of a certain bit of film. The opening scenes are subject to an unfortunate disadvantage of early film: while it has one of the first uses of swinging objects to make an ominous feel, the camera rolled too slowly, and the objects swung too fast. The scene where the execution is imminent takes full advantage of the battleship's guns. Almost all shots are taken from right next to the cannons, thus showing this grim scene from a tool of destruction, establishing the mood perfectly. <br/><br/>The Odessa steps sequence is perhaps the most influential scene involving the portrayal of military brutality in film. It has the higher ground of the oppressors, allowing them to fire at a downwards angle, showing the helplessness of the victims. It has the emphasis on young children, which has been used quite effectively in Schindler's List. Most importantly, it shows them firing in a unified, systematic fashion, which portrays them as unfeeling killing machines, with no pity or hesitance. <br/><br/>Finally, the approach of the battleship to the enemies is the best early example of suspense in film. With the constant use of few shots, it makes the wait seem longer and longer. The guns pointing strait at us make us truly realize the unspeakable power they are about to discharge. And the use of the ""all for one"" narration is an incredibly effective way of showing us the kind of suicide mission they are on. Nothing but stunning."
"ACitizenCalledKane","9","2","3","16 January 2005"," A milestone in cinematic history!
","I cannot explain how influential Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin has been during the course of the last eighty years. Eisenstein's use of montage is extraordinary, flashing from one idea to another, and back again so quickly that you don't even realize that it is happening! Based on an actual mutiny that took place in Russia in 1905, Battleship Potemkin explores revolution through splicing together powerful images in a way that can, at times, literally take your breath away. The sheer brutality of the soldiers opening fire on the civilians at the shore of Odessa is truly horrifying! The intensity of the scene is truly unforgettable. The audience witnesses the chaos that comes from social uprising; children and mothers gunned down, baby carriages falling helplessly down flights of stairs. These are the visions which will stay with anyone who sees this movie. This particular scene is quite moving and disturbingly graphic. I am not sure, though, whether it is the power of the images, or the brilliance of the order in which they were placed that makes this movie such a force. Through his use of symbolism, powerful photography, and ingenious montage, Eisenstein created one of the most important and influential films of all time!"

","I was quite moved by Battleship Potemkin. I had shivers up my spine through so much of it: the firing squad scene, the plate with the religious phrase on it, the scene where the leader is hanging on a life-raft, the incredible crowd scenes, but most strikingly, the Odessa steps massacre. The nuanced performances are some of the most subtle and effective i've seen in silent films, though this is more of an action film than a straight drama, truth be told. I was surprised to find myself cheering for the revolutionaries on the Potemkin, and was in awe of the power of Eisenstein's cinema.<br/><br/>
The Odessa steps sequence is one of the finest things i've ever seen: the glorious tracking shots down the steps, the fast-paced editing, the little boy being shot, then the close-ups of his hands being trampled on by the crowd fleeing from the Cossacks, then finally the magestic moment of his mother carrying him in her arms in the pieta position, walking angrily towards the marching, descending row of Cossacks, demanding restitution. The most powerful single shot i've ever seen is the shot from behind her, carrying her boy in her arms, walking towards the ordered ranks of Cossacks, who march towards her. The famous pram down the steps is marvellously chilling, as is the woman shot through the eye of her glasses.<br/><br/>I look forward to checking out more Eisenstein. This is my first, at time of writing, and i was very impressed."

It is interesting to think the film age and then observe the modern use of camera and editing. The other thing that took my attention was the movement of camera during the 'steps'.

"goosnargh","8","2","3","2 October 2001"," Very good but lost much of its power.
","The main problem with The Battleship Potemkin is that it is a propaganda film, meant to celebrate Communism and the Soviet state it was made in. It tells of the rebellion of the crew of a battleship in Czarist Russia, which is joined by a rebellion on land by oppressed peasants.  There are no well-defined characters, and a minimal narrative.  In addition, the violence depicted has lost much of its shock value, making the film that much less potent.<br/><br/>That said, this is still a very well-made and relatively powerful film, for what it is.  The cinematography and editing are both good-looking and eye-catching, even if some of the sequences seem to drag on for no good reason while nothing seems to happen.  The famous massacre scene makes up for lost power with technique, as faceless machinelike soldiers steadily march towards the all-too-human crowd.  Also, the climactic confrontation is laced with tension as the Potemkin sail toward the Czarist fleet, while the camera cuts from the Potemkin preparing for battle and calling upon its fellow soldiers to join them, and the approaching fleet.<br/><br/>Many consider this to be Eisenstein's (""the king of cinema"", to some) best film. While it is very good, I would recommend his ""The Strike"" which deals with a similar event and which I found to be even more powerful."

","A wonderful movie. If you are not ""allergic"" to black and white or silent movies, this is a definite must-see!<br/><br/>Eisenstein is undoubtably one of the most important film-makers of all time, and has been the inspiration of the directors we know and love to day."
"SuperSoul","10","2","3","28 June 2000"," Short notes on Eisenstein as a film maker
","This is an example of film making under almost unique circumstances; in many ways Eisenstein's success could be attributed to the situation under which his films were made; but this belies the fact that he was an extraordinary talent.  Potemkin contains imagery which even now is light years ahead of most standard, good film making.  His ability to draw drama is second to none; witness in particular the famous scene upon the steps which pits helpless civilians against seemingly invincible soldiers.  However beyond Eisenstein's aesthetics, it is worth noting the despair which engulfs this film; as a director he spares no emotion.  To think what audiences of the 1920's made of this film is mind boggling; by todays standards it is not only epic but virtuoso; a depth that many film makers can only aspire to. However, despite all which I have said about this film in such a brief time, it's success ultimately rests upon the fact that it is unparallelled entertainment, more excitement and earthly fear than any other film that has since followed.  Cinema, it would seem, peaked too early."

","The film as a whole is very tragic yet intense, with some indulgence for its age, but interesting is relative. There are no characters that you can follow in more detail, instead, the film is incused with communism propaganda and brotherhood. Revolutionary for its time, regime and ideology.

","Besides the difference in their outcomes, there were important differences between the unsuccessful Russian revolution of 1905 and the successful Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917. The revolution of 1905 was a popular uprising, and the participants were by no means all Bolsheviks, but were drawn from various leftist and liberal groups. In 1905 the revolutionaries were fighting against Tsarist autocracy, whereas in October 1917 the Tsar's regime had crumbled several months earlier and Lenin was fighting to overthrow Kerensky's nascent democracy, which was supported by many of those who had risen in 1905. Despite these differences, the Russian Communists often tried to claim 1905 as a dress-rehearsal for their own revolution, and it was frequently celebrated in Soviet art, such as Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony.<br/><br/>In 1925 the Soviet government decided to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the 1905 revolution with make a grand epic film telling the full story, and Sergei Eisenstein was appointed director. In the event time constraints meant that this film never materialised, and Eisenstein decided to concentrate on one single episode, the mutiny aboard the Potemkin, a battleship in the Russian Black Sea Fleet.<br/><br/>The film is divided into five sections. The first deals with the events leading up to the mutiny, when the ship's crew protested against the rotten, maggot-infested meat they were expected to eat. The second depicts the mutiny itself, when the crew seized the ship from their officers, and the third the funeral of Vakulinchuk, a revolutionary sailor killed during the mutiny. The fourth is the famous ""Odessa Steps"" sequence, when the Tsar's soldiers massacre the people of the city, who have risen in support of the mutineers. In the fifth the Potemkin puts out to sea to confront a squadron sent against it.<br/><br/>This is, of course, a propaganda film, so some of the criticisms made of it on this board seem rather wide of the mark. Yes, the Odessa steps massacre (if it had actually happened) would have been over much more quickly than the several minutes which Eisenstein allocated to it here, but this was done deliberately in order to heighten its emotional impact. (I say ""if it had actually happened"" because this event was an invention of the scriptwriters, whereas the rest of the film is based upon historical fact). Yes, the portrayals of the Tsarist officers and the Orthodox priest are exaggerated caricatures, but a film which effectively said ""Of course, we need to remember that there were some good things about Tsarism..."" would not only have failed in its propagandist purpose but would also probably have earned Eisenstein a one-way ticket to the gulag.<br/><br/>The propaganda message of the film, however, is not simply ""Communism good, Tsarism bad!"" Marxist historians tended to play down the ""Great Man"" theory of history, arguing that historical events are brought about by impersonal economic forces rather than by great men, but this did not prevent Soviet propagandists, Eisenstein included, from idolising the Great Men of Communism, not only Marx and Engels but also Lenin and Stalin. ""Battleship Potemkin"", made a year after Lenin's death, subtly reinforces the idea of the Great Man; Vakulinchuk is portrayed as a heroic, charismatic revolutionary leader, rousing his crewmates to action by his stirring rhetoric. His funeral takes on a quasi-religious character; the Communists might have rejected other aspects of religion but the cult of the martyr was alive and well in Soviet Russia. When the battleship puts to sea in the final scene it is clear that the mutinous sailors are not a disorganised rabble but are able to work together like parts of a machine, something emphasised by shots of the ship's machinery. Someone- we never learn who- is clearly giving them orders. Message to the comrades: ""Communism is not about anarchy! We might no longer have a Tsar but we still need leaders!"" It is perhaps significant that the actor playing Vakulinchuk combines Lenin's bald head with Stalin's moustache.<br/><br/>""Battleship Potemkin"" is often to be found on critics' lists of the ""greatest films of all time"", and, indeed, has sometimes been ranked at number one on that list, although I suspect that what those critics really mean is that it contains one of the greatest scenes of all time. The Odessa Steps sequence, exemplifying Eisenstein's theories about ""montage"", is indeed a masterly piece of film-making, heart-stopping and emotionally riveting even if one is aware that these events never happened. The final scene is also well-handled, but there is nothing of similar quality in the first three segments; Vakulinchuk's funeral, in particular, is dull and overlong.<br/><br/>My main reason, however, why I cannot agree that this film is one of the ""greatest of all time"" is the same reason why I cannot award that accolade to ""Birth of a Nation"" or ""Triumph of the Will"". Like Griffith and Riefenstahl, Eisenstein was a highly talented film-maker, but like them he used his talents to make technically accomplished films in a bad cause. In public the Nazis might have denounced him as a ""degenerate Jewish Bolshevik"", but in private their own propaganda chief, Goebbels, regarded ""Battleship Potemkin"" as a masterpiece of the propagandist's art. Bad as the Tsarist regime was, it is hard to argue that the Communist one marked a change for the better. The Tsar may have slain his thousands, but Lenin and Stalin slew by the tens of millions. Within a few years of this film being made, the people of Odessa and the rest of the Ukraine would be suffering a famine so severe that they would gladly have accepted the maggot-infested meat which provoked the Potemkin mutiny. 5/10"

Using the power of film and visuals, Eisenstein works as a master manipulator, pulling at every string in your body, a surging sea of pain and sorrow exploding across his forever influential screen. Who could ever forget those haunting images? The child being trampled on! The baby carriage falling! The old woman with her shot out! Blood everywhere!

","That, of course, is far from a fresh observation but it's true. Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin tells the real life story of the 1905 mutiny on the Potemkin in the Russo-Japanese War. When the crew of the Potemkin are fed borscht made from rotten meat most opt to eat bread and butter instead. When the officers of the ship hear of this, they become outraged and they believe the enlisted men of the ship to be spoiled. Chief Officer Ippolit Giliarovsky (Grigori Aleksandrov) orders the men the be executed. A revolutionary sailor named Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) inspires a mutiny and the oppressive officers are thrown overboard. The mutiny is successful but Vakulinchuk is killed by Giliarovsky. The sailors mourn their fallen hero and deliver him to the port at Odessa. When the Odessa residents learn of what has happened they protest but are brutally suppressed by the Tsarist guards. In response a revolution goes underway. The film is done very well and has since come to be regard as one of Russia's best films. Not to mention the commonly used soundtrack by Dmitri Shostakovich is brilliant and perfectly fitting. The film is most famous for the ""Odessa steps"" sequence, so much so that the stairs on which the sequence was filmed has come to be known at the ""Potemkin stairs."" It is important to note that no such event took place at the Potemkin stairs but that doesn't make the sequence any less groundbreaking. It should also be said that the film is brutally violent, even by today's standards. Overall, Battleship Potemkin is highly recommended."

Griffith and never hesitated to credit Griffith with having taught him the art and skill of editing.<br/><br/>""Battleship Potemkin"" uses editing in part to propagandize, but more so to advance the story.<br/><br/>In addition to skilled and dramatic editing, Eisenstein used a brilliant moving camera, especially at The Steps (if you haven't seen this before, I don't want to give anything away, but you'll see quickly what I mean) to, again, tell the story, but to tell it in so dramatic a fashion, any thoughtful person, and even just the person seeking a movie to relax and enjoy, will be caught up and moved and excited and fascinated.<br/><br/>Eisenstein was his own editor, and this was only his second feature film, and that he was a rare genius is immediately obvious.<br/><br/>Bear in mind this was financed by the Soviet government, for its own purposes, so Eisenstein's huge crowds and the availability of the Soviet navy are understood, but they help make this one of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>As propaganda, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is occasionally obvious, even blatant, but as a movie, it is simply -- to repeat -- one of the greatest of all time.<br/><br/>I cannot stress too much how strongly I recommend ""Battleship Potemkin.""<br/><br/>Probably there are several versions around for home consumption, but do try to see the one with the enhanced original score.

"joshuafagan-64214","9","1","1","29 July 2016"," The Moment When Editing Became an Art
","In all respects that matter, this film hasn't aged a day.<br/><br/>Sure, the story is hamfisted, but so what? It's basically a propaganda movie. I'm not watching it for depth of character. That's not the reason it has endured. Sure, it's almost dreadfully short, but so what? Films can show a lot in 69 minutes if they don't dawdle, and this film doesn't even think about dawdling.<br/><br/>Through and through, it feels like a 20's movie, but it feels like how you want 20's movies to feel, how 20's movies have been portrayed as feeling by our nostalgia for that time as well as the Hollywood Machine itself. Most twenties movies, while charming, lack cinematic sophistication. The actors can be funny or poignant, but the effects are lacking and the camera work looks like it was done by someone who had never been to film school. Many end up feeling like half-finished films. It's hard to embrace films from that era, even films that I want to like and are interesting, such as Nosferatu or the original King Kong, because of this. I can appreciate them, but appreciation does not translate perfectly into affection.<br/><br/>This film is different. I wouldn't go so far as to call it the best film I've ever seen, as some film critics have, but it is definitely a awe-inspiring accomplishment. It's not only astonishingly good, it's astonishingly good in a dynamic, electrifying way. The title cards don't just exist to provide information- they punctuate the story beats. Each scene flows into the next. Each part flows into the next. There are montages and elaborate wide shots and quick, clever cuts. It's better on a technical scale than most films released today.<br/><br/>Nothing is done without a purpose though. Every shot and trick furthers some thought or feeling. It's both lean and remarkably ambitious. It does not run for three hours, but it tries and mostly succeeds to capture the emotions of the audience. Eisenstein knew what he was doing; he had to. Many of the creative technical work was his invention. When Hollywood filmmakers saw this film, they were shocked. They had never seen anything like it before.<br/><br/>This deserves a place among the films that changed absolutely everything. Just like there is a pre-Citizen Kane era and a post-Citizen Kane era, there is a pre-Potemkin era and a post-Potemkin era. Every film buff has their favorite Potemkin shot. Mine is the long shot on the steps where the woman holding her injured son is shot by the Cossacks.<br/><br/>Back in the day, even people who didn't know exactly what made this movie special couldn't stop thinking about it. Fundamentally, it is different from every film that was made beforehand. Even now, I can hardly think of a film that's made me care so much about a scenario I would have otherwise cared so little about.<br/><br/>I've repeatedly said that even as an outsider from the 21st century, it's possible to tell an innovator from a copier. Even if you didn't know anything about Star Wars, it's easy to differentiate it from the works that copied off it. The original carries itself with a poise, an energy that the copiers just don't have. It's in the 'blood' of the film, if you will. This film has that. I can see myself rewatching it over and over again. It's one of the most gripping motion pictures of the 20th century."

","A study in heroics. A call to violent revolution. A propaganda piece. A work of homo erotic art. A story for the ages. A commercial success only in the west....<br/><br/>Sergei Eisenstein's first full-length feature is all of those. It's also the movie that brought his name to international audiences, forever. Arguably, few movie directors reach that pinnacle of fame so early in life - Eisenstein being only twenty-seven when Battleship Potemkin (BP) was released. Such is artistic genius.<br/><br/>The story, largely based upon the actual facts of history, follows no single protagonist; for Eisenstein, the working class is paramount, represented by the sailors and the people of Odessa. The visual narrative shows the sailors taking over the ship, steaming on to Odessa, gaining the support of the local population and finally venturing forth to sea again to meet the Tsar's opposing naval forces who, against the odds, did not fire a single shot in anger, allowing BP to pass through the cordon to freedom. The mutineers had won, a metaphor so strong that, at a later time, Lenin called the entire incident ""a dress rehearsal"" for the 1917 revolution. <br/><br/>On the other hand, although some of the local Odessa population were in fact killed by Tsarist troops, the massacre on the Odessa steps - a seven minute, seminal montage of exquisite action forever copied by others - was entirely Eisenstein's fiction. Moreover, the mutineers did not truly win: after sailing through the opposing fleet, BP was eventually retaken by Russian authorities at a Romanian port on the Black Sea. Other minor aspects of the story were also changed to suit Eisenstein's creative inspirations. Good storytellers, though, never let facts hinder creativity.<br/><br/>Of greater visual importance, I think, is the long, slow sequence of thousands of local people descending to the dockyards to file past the body of Vakulinchuk (Antonov), the valiant leader of the mutineers, who was shot to death by one of the officers. Regardless of how many turned out in reality, Eisenstein's cameras capture the mood and reality of those times with a mix of sharp, extreme close- ups and long shots of staggering complexity and a cast of thousands.<br/><br/>I saw this movie first in 1968 or 69. Forty-five years have not dimmed the imagery I recall so vividly when I saw it again recently. It's that sort of movie. Along with Strike (1925) made soon after BP, these are cinematic icons you cannot afford to miss, especially if you consider yourself a movie aficionado. <br/><br/>No movie ever gets a ten from this reviewer. If I could give this 9.9, I would, however. Recommended for all.<br/><br/>April 5th, 2015."

","The Battleship Potemkin, written by Nina Agadzhanova and directed by Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein, is a film inspired by actual events that occurred in the port of Odessa, Ukraine today, during the week of June 26, 1905. Everything starts when sailors boat, they decide to revolt from the maltreatment inflicted by the officers, to be forced to eat rotten and maggoty meat.<br/><br/>Being a silent film, his drawings and pictures are very expressive, representing the class struggle against oppression. It opens in early 1925 Russian revolution, based on the facts that surrounded the Potemkin during the failed revolution of 1905, to make way for 1917, which did succeed.<br/><br/>Another significant detail in the film is the music. It written by Edmund Meisel and Dimitri Shostakovich, rhythmically adapted to the dynamic editing of the film. It was performed by an orchestra hall and was subject to government censorship at the time it was composed. In several scenes, you can hear the strains of the Marseillaise, nowadays national anthem of France, which is a revolutionary battle song and hymn to freedom.<br/><br/>This film shows the importance of visual information. If a vast majority of human communication is nonverbal, pictures speak louder than words and the Battleship Potemkin, is the perfect reminder, demonstrating that the silent film is not a dead genre, quite the contrary, they are masterpieces serve as inspiration for new movies plays and stories."

Strangely the most identifiable character in the film never speaks, and is in the film for less than a minute, of course I am talking about that man who tries to stop the Tsarist soldiers, but ultimately dies. The much discussed Odessa Steps sequence, is still as well-shot and frightening as ever, I want to be one of those people who did not know that that scene was going to come up!

The Odessa Staircase sequence is unequivocally the best scenario in the film.<br/><br/>The movie brings forth an account of the uprising on the Battleship Potemkin.

Just as the guards get ready to fire at the rebels, Vakulinchuk enlightens his fellow sailors that they're about to fire at their fellowmen and thus a mutiny arises. The sailors hunt and cast the senior officers off the ship while a frenzied officer fires his rifle at Vakulinchuk.

","In Battleship Potemkin, the main story behind this is a group of men that are slaves or prisoners that are put to work on this battleship by the crew. The crew however is mistreats the men who aren't high ranks like them by feeding them meat with maggots crawling all over the steak, pretending that you can just brush them off or cook it and be safe. While sailing through the ocean one of the sailors while resting in his hammock one of the officers comes over and starts whipping him, well at this time the sailors have finally had enough of the abuse and mistreatment from the officers and start a mutiny on the ship. During the mutiny, the officers grab the weapons in the lower decks, but the ratio of sailors to officers was at almost a three to one. The sailors out manned the officers and took control of the ship, while taking over the ship they threw the doctor over board, because he was the one claiming that the meat with maggots ""is in great shape and can be eaten, just brush the maggots off and cook the meat."" Towards the end of the film, the sailors had taken over the ship and fired the big guns on the ship to sound there, victory or ""freedom"" .The significance of this movie however was that during this time zone the Soviet Union had shortage in film stock. So the director Sergei Einstein would have to be careful with what he shot and at times would have to reuse some older footage in order to get a full length film out of the amount of film stock he was allowed."

","I have now seen this film twice. I didn't care for it the first time but upon a second viewing I have grown to appreciate it. I think it is fair to call this a masterpiece in terms of political propaganda. <br/><br/>Eisenstein's use of crowds is pretty stunning to watch. While the modern U.S audience may be frustrated with the lack of character development, I found the crowds to be particularly engaging to watch. Again, keep in mind this film has to do with the politics of the time. If one really pays attention to the film it is clear the Eisenstein really did a great job at portraying life on a ship, the Odessa steps etc. I think it is easy to classify this movie as an under- appreciated piece because of its non-narrative structure. However, no one can dispute that the Odessa steps sequence is one of the most famous in all the history of cinema. Eisenstien uses montage to really provoke the audience's emotions and it is heart wrenching to watch the small child and mother be killed. This section really brought a lot of emotion to the film and I loved it. Obviously, the music has been re-mastered but I loved what it added to the film. If you have seen this film once, then see it again because I think a second viewing will really help you understand it better."

","This was an excellent movie. There is a huge amount of historical significance to this film, in the realm of history and film history. The elements of montage filmmaking within this film are what makes it great. Despite the fact that it was made for a Russian audience that had endured years of political turbulence, the film holds particular elements that can also attract a younger audience, often with no knowledge of the history surrounding the film. That, is what truly makes ""Battleship Potemkin' a great film; it goes beyond the limits of language and promotes a historical quality within filmmaking. The film's narrative, which follows a traditional structure, is easy to follow, and is only interrupted by intense moments which contain elements of montage filmmaking. These elements add quite a bit to the film, showing the disjointed state of politics within Russia during this period and highlighting the traditional narrative structure. The film's altering of the actual historical ending of the revolution within Russia actually fits well with the structure of the film, but also is seem by some critics as a blatant promotion of Russian nationalism."
"pontifikator","8","1","1","23 November 2009"," Propaganda that surpasses its intent
","This film is first and foremost an object of communist propaganda. It was directed by Sergei Eisenstein in 1925, and it glorifies the mutiny on the ship against the officers of the czar in 1905. The film is silent, and it is more noted today for its use of montage than for its message. Eisenstein's direction is far ahead of its day, foretelling many of our modern techniques.<br/><br/>The story is that the men on board the ship are routinely flogged, fed rotted meat, and treated as subhuman scum by the officers. At the point where they rebel, a dozen or so men are going to be shot for not eating their soup. (Yes, really - not eating their soup was correctly viewed as insubordination.) The enlisted crew convince the armed guards to come over to the side of rebellion, and they take over the ship. All of the officers disappear, and we never learn their fate. <br/><br/>One sailor is killed by an officer, though, and his body is taken into the port of Odessa where it lies in state. The thousands of citizens of Odessa file by his bier (where there is a sign ""Killed for a plate of soup"") and weep. I found this completely lacking in credibility, but it was necessary for the uprising for the towns people to join in brotherhood with the ship's men. Hundreds of citizens hop in their boats and sail out to the Potemkin with more food than could possibly be eaten.<br/><br/>The famous scene where the czar's police march down the steps shooting people occurs, the crew of the Potemkin launches a broadside against the opera house, symbol of the czar, then turn to face the approaching squadron of czarist ships. The Potemkin sails out to meet the squadron and do battle if necessary. The rebelling sailors ask the squadron to join them in their rebellion against czarism, the squadron does, and they all live happily ever after under the red flag of communism.<br/><br/>The issue is why is ""The Battleship Potemkin"" seen as a great film, while Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"" is seen as nothing but propaganda, dragging her name down in villainy for ever after?<br/><br/>I'll propose that ""Triumph of the Will"" glorified one man, and that its groundbreaking uses of tracking shots, cranes, and the like were broken under the weight of its intolerable burden: Hitler.<br/><br/>Eisenstein's film, on the other hand, pioneered the use of new editing techniques to tell the story of plain men who rebelled against their oppression. No one monster is singled out for glory in ""The Battleship Potemkin,"" so after the years have passed, we can look at it more objectively.<br/><br/>Eisenstein's use of montage was to juxtapose several shots in quick sequence, pumping drama and meaning into a scene where one static shot would have remained empty. With his quick cuts of individual sailors cheering and showing exultation, we get a more personal feeling of their excitement than showing ranks of more or less faceless sailors waving their caps. Eisenstein showed us not a crew but individuals. <br/><br/>The famous scene on the steps of Odessa is actually long and contains a large number of stories, not just the pram rolling down the steps with the armed police marching down after it. Eisenstein shows up rich and poor, lame and healthy, joined together to happily embrace the rebellion of the ship's crew. He shows a series of shots of individuals gleefully cheering and talking to each other, saying All for one and one for all. We get to know each person in the happiest moment of their lives. <br/><br/>Then the czar's police show up with bayonets fixed to their long rifles as they march in step down the long stone staircase, shooting people as they move, stepping over the bodies in step. And it's not just people - it's the humans we saw and exulted with minutes ago.<br/><br/>What Eisenstein does in the shooting scene is to show, for example, a woman on the steps looking up, shouting in fear. He shows her again from a closer view. He shows her yet again as the camera dollies in to a close up, then he cuts to a close up showing blood running down her face, her glasses broken over her eye. Without a zoom lens, this is the same technique used by Hitchcock in ""Vertigo"" and Steven Spielberg in ""Jaws."" Eisenstein forces us to see that woman's face and the horror of her murder is forced upon us. These shots probably also qualify as jump cuts, and they certainly violate the rule of continuity, as we see the same person repeatedly from different positions as the camera is moved in on her as quickly and relentlessly as the approach of her killers.<br/><br/>We see the human cost of bravery on an individual level rather than a crowd, which would make the scene have less impact. This was a great insight on Eisenstein's part: the cinematic impact is in the person, not in the mob.<br/><br/>Eisenstein is mostly successful at drawing our attention to the abysmal life they lead as subhuman parts of a well-run machine, then at their excitement and freedom after they mutiny. The problem is that Eisenstein was promiscuous - we get the same exciting montage of scenes of the men raising the boarding stairs and stowing them as we get of them hauling up the cannon shells and gun powder and stowing it in the turrets as they prepare for battle.<br/><br/>Although the propaganda aspect is a little ham handed in the scenes concerning the dead sailor and the townspeople, overall the film works for me as an example of the Soviet view of montage. Eisenstein's photographic compositions were excellent, and his use of the ship to frame the action kept my interest piqued during some of the longer, uninteresting speeches."
"monty-57","8","1","1","21 April 2009"," Charlie Chaplin's favorite movie
","An unique achievement in cinema that continues to amaze even after all these years.<br/><br/>Eisenstein didn't reinvent the reel with his film, but combined existing film-making techniques that had been used individually by other silent film directors – such as montage, tracking shots and extreme close-ups – for maximum effect in telling the story of a mutiny at sea and subsequent mayhem on land.<br/><br/>In 1905, the armored cruiser Potemkin is returning to Odessa on the Black Sea from defeat in the Russian-Japanese war. The conditions on board are abysmal and the sailors rebel, eventually taking over the ship. The sympathetic people of Odessa help them by bringing them food, only to face a bloody reprisal from Tsarist troops in a famous but fictional sequence on the steps of the city leading down to the beach. Well, they do occasionally say that life's a beach.<br/><br/>Eisenstein's artful editing, which in addition to illustrating his dialectical editing theory of point, counterpoint, fusion, elecits tremendous empathy for the sailors and citizens of Odessa, sparking the viewer's sense of moral outrage. This power to galvanize audiences led to the film being banned by several governments, even (shudder to think!) the Soviet Union under Stalin.<br/><br/>Reportedly, this was Charlie Chaplin's favorite movie."

That the latter turned so sour dulls the enthusiasm of the modern viewer but it is, nevertheless, historically fascinating. As a piece of cinema it is also powerful and impressive....I'm no expert, but you can see there is real talent at work here from the director.

"jluis1984","10","1","1","18 April 2007"," Poetic!
","Very few people in the history of the cinema have left an imprint as deep as Sergei M. Eisenstein, Russian director and film theorist whose ideas about montage changed film editing (and film-making itself) forever. As one of the first to discover the potential of the artistic manipulation of film in order to transmit emotions, Eisenstein transformed film editing from simple chronological cuts to a more expressive language. His third movie, ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" (""Battleship Potemkin"" in English), is definitely his most famous work and the flagship of the montage theory, as it was in this movie where he was able to fully explore the ideas he had developed initially in ""Stachka"" (""Strike), his first feature. Many has been written about ""Battleship Potemkin"", and not without a reason, as this movie lives up to its status of classic like no other.<br/><br/>""Battleship Potemkin"" is the dramatization of a real life story, the uprising of the Potemkin's crew against their officers in June 1905. The story begins when in the Potemkin, sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) and his mates discover that the meat destined for their consumption is rotten and filled with maggots. The sailors protest, but the officers state that the meat is in fact in good conditions and that the sailors will have to eat it. These statements increase the rage of the sailors, who that night refuse to eat the rotten meat, defying their superiors in a blatant display of protest. The next day, the Potemkin's officers decide to execute those who defied their orders, and it's at that moment when sailor Vakulinchuk decides to call for a rebellion. The consequences of the Battleship Potemkin uprising will be enormous, and the first place that feels them is the small city of Odessa.<br/><br/>While the movie was co-written by Eisenstein and three of his collaborators, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is completely Eisenstein's brainchild, as he devised the movie as an experiment about the effects of his editing technique on the audience. The desired effect was that the audience felt completely identified with the revolutionaries and their cause, while at the same time had feelings of antipathy and rejection to the czar's army, arguably the film's ""villians"". While this may sound like a very simplistic approach to the story, it is really the perfect devise to Eisenstein's highly visual style of film-making, as what matters in the film are not the characters, but the events happening. Despite being a fictional account of the real life event, Eisenstein's script captures the spirit of the uprising and the ideologies behind it (after all, it was conceived as revolutionary propaganda) in a quite powerful way.<br/><br/>Obviously, Eisenstein's direction is the true star of the movie, as he shows his mastery, not only of montage, but also of cinematography (by Eduard Tisse and Vladimir Popov) and overall visual composition, which give the movie a nearly poetic majesty. It is often said that movies with good narrative should be able to tell its story without sound, and ""Battleship Potemkin"" proves that statement true with its near perfect visual storytelling that without problems (and with very few inter-titles) transmits its message to the audience. Another interesting trait of the film is how despite the manipulative montage, it feels incredibly realistic, almost as if it was a documentary on the subject. The now legendary Odessa Steps sequence, a monumental achievement in film-making, is done in a tremendously realistic fashion that, as critic Roger Ebert points out, ""is often referred to as if it really happened"".<br/><br/>To achieve this atmosphere of realism, Eisenstein often used untrained people (and even members of his crew) to play basically themselves in his movies, and ""Potemkin"" is not an exception, as to most of the actors on screen this meant their only participation in movies. A notable exception is the man playing the movie's most important role, Aleksandr Antonov, who plays rebel sailor Vakulinchuk. Antonov had his debut in Eisenstein's first movie Dnevnik Glumova, and went on to have a relatively prolific career during the following decades. As Vakulinchuk, his performance is quite powerful and very natural, capturing with ease the traits of the legendary rebel and transforming him into a myth. On a side note, directors Vladimir Barsky and Grigori Aleksandrov (Eisenstein's close collaborator) appear in the movie in the roles of the battleship's evil officers.<br/><br/>More than 80 years after its initial release, one can still say that Eisenstein's experiment was an enormous improvement in film editing techniques, and more than that, it was probably the final step to complete the transformation of film into an art form. While the use of film editing to create emotions was of course done with the purpose of using the films as revolutionary propaganda, the use of images and symbolism to create emotions in the audience is hardly objectionable and one could say that it was even necessary for movie to be the expressive art form that is today. Due to all those reasons, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is without a doubt one of the most important movies ever made, and one that even today manage to bring great emotions from its audiences, as its universal message of freedom is certainly more powerful than any political ideology.<br/><br/>An obligatory entry in almost every book on the history of cinema, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is a movie that even today, more than 80 years after its conception, keeps being not only a thrilling an entertaining story, but also as fresh and influential as when it was originally released. Some critics may accuse it of being manipulative propaganda, and while they are probably right, in the end, what film is not manipulative? 10/10"

","Battleship Potemkin is by general consensus Eisenstein's masterpiece. Coming between the over-the-top action melodrama of Strike and the formalist documentary style of October, it's the most ""normal"" looking of his silent films. Rather than being overly stylised it best demonstrates how the montage technique can be used in regular cinematic storytelling.<br/><br/>Eisenstein here takes the editing techniques he perfected in his first film Strike, and uses them to greater effect in telling the story, creating tension and staging action. Whereas the action in Strike was almost relentless, Potemkin contains moments of stillness and calmness which act as a counterpoint to the more exciting situations, making them tenser and more effective. He stretches out time to an incredible extent, sometimes even splitting sentences over two title cards. He also slows things down to give certain scenes greater consideration. The section in which Vakulinchuk's body is brought to the pier and visited by Odessa citizens has a slow tranquillity to it, which gives it an air of sadness.<br/><br/>When Battleship Potemkin does burst into moments of action, the direction is tighter than ever. Looking at the most famous sequence  The Odessa Steps massacre  the scenes of mass panic begin before we are actually shown what is causing them. If you watch closely, you can see how well directed the crowd scenes are. It's not just a hundred or so people dashing madly down the steps, there are also for example some people confusedly trying to cut across the crowd, implying Eisenstein directed the group at the level of individuals, and took real care composing each shot.<br/><br/>On that note, although Eisenstein's silent cinema is characterless and based around the actions of masses of people rather, he still has respect for the individual, and often uses the action or experience of one person to hammer home a message. For example, the opening sequences with the sailors becoming tense and angry all builds up to that one man smashing a plate. Later in the Odessa harbour, shots of the crowd are intercut with close-ups of fists clenching. And of course although the Odessa Steps sequence involves hundreds of people, it's the individuals that we remember most  the mother and child, the woman with the pram, the man with no legs and so on. Eisenstein also makes the impact of the set pieces all the greater by introducing us to these ""characters"" just prior to the massacre.<br/><br/>Eisenstein's symbolism, which was rather heavy handed in Strike, is here much subtler and cleverer. It is also much more skilfully woven into the narrative. For example, when Vakulinchuk makes his first big speech, he is both literally and metaphorically waking up the other sailors. Later, the boiling soup is used as a metaphor for the sailors seething with rage. Even the title of the first part  the Men and the Maggots can be taken as a reference to the difference between the sailors (""real"" men) and the despicable officers who command them.<br/><br/>Eisenstein is also now a little more reserved in his use of artificial cinematic techniques, such as superimpositions and lens masking. These techniques were all over the place in Strike, but here they just crop up once or twice, giving them greater impact when they do appear. It also shows more confidence in his own direction  he doesn't have to rely on cinematic trickery to hold the audience's attention anymore.<br/><br/>Eisenstein's silent pictures are arguably the most totally cinematic of their era. By taking the possibilities of the editing process to their extremes, he follows on from D.W. Griffith to further cut cinema free from its ties to theatre and literature, helping establish it as a unique storytelling form. As a result Eisenstein's other silent pictures sometimes suffer from too much style over substance. However, in Battleship Potemkin, he not only perfects the use of montage, but does so without compromising as much on the drama and storytelling, and that is why it's his best film."

","Im not going to go into the plot or technical brilliance of the film, that has been done by lots of other posts, just to say this film works in my opinion not least because it is a great action film,there is largely no need for dialogue since the actions and acting is largely self explanatory, the use of subtitles is minimal and only used when required to move the narrative along, the soundtrack is also vital to the film and really does help the emotional roller-coaster of revolutionary fervour that swells among the crew of the potemkin and people of odessa, hard to find fault with the story or execution although the guy who says "" kill the jews"" must be the most stupid man in all of mother Russia ! for a film to be 80 years old and still provide real entertainment and a bit of a history lesson, is a real achievement, great stuff!:)"
"nycritic","10","1","1","13 June 2006"," Poetry in Editing
","The power of the moving picture, focusing on creating a tightening noose that has become the blueprint of how movies are made and released to audiences today. This is the movie BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN, a film that was made in 1925 to commemorate a historic uprising, and one with images so potent that it was banned in several countries because it apparently contained propagandist images. Because of its documentary feel it has effectively led people to believe that the massacre at the Odessa steps actually did happen -- and such is the power of film, the strength of this breathtaking movie.<br/><br/>Divided in five parts, like a Shakespearean play, BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN narrates a plot that barely focuses on one character for too long -- a technique that only enhances its symbolism. An uprising on the Potemkin takes place as a protest from the sailors from getting ill-treatment from their superiors and being fed rotting food. The leader of this uprising, a brave sailor, is killed by one of his superiors and transported to the city of Odessa, where civilians are so moved by his plight that they mourn his death (over a bowl of soup) and decide to revolt against the Czarist regime.<br/><br/>At the height of the movie, and the film's most powerful sequence that literally starts with a bang, the Czarist soldiers appear from behind and systematically shoot down the citizens as they run down the Odessa Steps. Of the victims, a couple stand out in abbreviated story lines: a boy who gets separated from his mother who goes back to retrieve him and defiantly walk up the steps to certain death, and most notably, the death of a young mother who's baby, cradled in a carriage, crashes down the steps as the infant cries.<br/><br/>The Odessa Steps sequence is even now a masterpiece of editing, focusing on loose elements to tie in an all-encompassing picture of mounting horror as the faceless, almost inhuman soldiers advance upon them. It creates an overwhelming sense of destructive horror even when never a drop of blood or actual carnage is seen, and because these citizens have been introduced as peaceful, feeble people, it's even more numbing. This sequence has become one of the most imitated in cinema, most notably in Brian de Palma's THE UNTOUCHABLES which had a similar sequence that was shot in slow motion and in its own right, truly breathtaking.<br/><br/>However, nothing can come close to this movie. It's too bad that extant prints make it seem a little fuzzy here and there, but there is no denying its sheer power of storytelling even in a couple of its slower segments. I believe BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN doesn't need a musical score to be fully enjoyed; I turned off the volume of my own equipment, sat down, and was able to literally be moved to the edge of my seat when the Odessa Steps sequence began. Horror and mass destruction made poetry by the force of its own message, it's an essential movie for anyone into movies."
"A_Roode","9","1","1","29 April 2006"," Impressive, moving and rewarding
","Whispered at like some urban legend, 'Battleship Potemkin' is a film epic in the grandest sense. A shame that its influence has permeated so much of film today but that it seems to be seen by few outside of film schools. I'm from the non-film school group, but I know from other films that they have drawn on images and sequences in 'Battleship Potemkin.' To name just three: <br/><br/>1)Extreme close-ups: Eisenstein's use of extreme close-ups are wonderful. He'll zoom in on the face of cruel officers. As a propaganda film he needs to exaggerate the menace and it works extremely well in helping to create sympathy for the sailors. Later during the Odessa Stairs massacre, his close-ups of panicked, helpless and fleeing civilians is heart-wrenching. If you've ever watched Sergio Leone's films (especially 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,' or 'Once Upon a Time in the West') you'll see the obvious influence.<br/><br/>2)Editing: There are almost twice as many shots in 'Battleship Potemkin' as there were in contemporary American films. What this meant was rapid fire switches from shot to shot that the MTV generation would approve of. Also, Eisenstein was somewhat unusual in this film's editing because editing for the most part is used to shorten time. Eisenstein was trying to connect an earlier historical even with a later one; his editing extends time.<br/><br/>3)Odessa Steps: One of the best and most suspenseful moments in Brian De Palma's 'The Untouchables' is the staircase scene with the baby carriage. That is a tribute to 'Battleship Potemkin' and a longer and similar sequence in it. Czarist troops descend on Odessa and are planning to punish the citizenry for the aid it has lent to the battleship. People flee chaotically down the stairs while the soldiers march as one behind them pausing only to fire into the crowd with their rifles. It is a visually stunning sequence highlighted from both technical and emotional standpoints. Technically, the cuts from shot to shot are panic-stricken and rapid. Eisenstein has an early establishing shot to show the size of the stairs and the number of people fleeing. From there the camera moves directly into the action focusing on individual characters: a woman with an umbrella, a man with no legs, a woman and her little boy, a group led by an old woman who hide at the side of the staircase and a young mother with a baby in a carriage at the top of the stairs.... Eisenstein's manipulation of the footage is nothing short of brilliant. I'll not describe anything else from the 'Odessa Steps Massacre' and add only that it is tremendously moving. All of the characters listed above are ""rebels"" and all are dealt with by the soldiers.<br/><br/>In my mind, 'Battleship Potemkin' suffers only from the fact that it is so heavy-handedly a propaganda film. Its extolling of soviet values may strike some as too hard to swallow. That said, it is an utter masterpiece and if you are serious about film at all (or if you just want to see where De Palma got his idea!) 'Battleship Potemkin' is essential viewing. It rightly belongs in the IMDb top 250. At the time of this reviews writing, it is mysteriously NOT in the top 250. Aside from the hokey 'brotherhood prevails' message at the end and the heavy propaganda, I think the film has an audience out there today that would respond favourably to it if they only took the time to seek out the film and watch it. If this review convinces even one person to take that time my job is done."

","Eisenstein's film about an episode in the Russian Revolution is one of the most famous films of all time and still one which surprisingly few people have actually seen.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, we have here a piece of propaganda cinema: the film maker is clearly on the side of the common soldiers rebelling against their aristocratic and bourgeois officers and exploiters.  This may put some people off, but notice that this is more open and honest in its approach than many western films of the cold war era in which the outcome (who's the good guy?) is as predictable as it is here but in which the viewer is fooled into thinking that it is not.<br/><br/>The reason Battleship Potemkin is famous is not because of the acting performances: most actors weren't even professionals and the acting is quite often outrageously over the top, although it is fair to say that this is a problem of many silent movies.  No, the reasons this is a famous film are (i) the clever use of editing, and (ii) the even cleverer use of imagery.  The perhaps most famous scene of the film shows a deserted pram hobbling down the stairs.  It is a symbol of the violence against civilians that just preceded it and in its way it is even more powerful than the actual act itself.  The film is full of such symbols, probably too many for a 1990s audience, but back then it was new and it left a deep impression on its contemporaries and it proved to be highly influential on film makers."

Its stench of cheap propaganda is as strong as the presumable stench of the rotten meat in the film.<br/><br/>I give this a 3/10 because of the Odessa scene, without of, the movie would have gotten no more then poor 1/10."
"sddavis63","5","3","7","2 September 2009"," A ""Revolutionary"" Movie
","The necessary prerequisite for watching this silent classic is, of course, that you understand that it's a piece of communist propaganda, produced in the Soviet Union in 1925 as Stalin was solidifying his hold on power. (In fact, I thought the actor who played Vakulinchuk - the hero of the mutineers - even looked a bit like Stalin, probably deliberately, since it wouldn't hurt Stalin's image to be associated with the movie's hero, although it is interesting that Stalin was not always a great supporter of director Sergei Eisenstein's work or of his views on communism.) <br/><br/>The first half of the movie is very strong. Opening with a quote from Lenin glorifying revolution in general, the story begins with the crew of the Potemkin being given rotten, maggot-infested meat to eat. Along with other brutal treatment and the contempt with which they were treated by their officers, everything leads up to a mutiny by the sailors, as they turn viciously on their officers and take over the ship. One could read into this a warning about the dangers of revolution - revolutionaries can become just as vicious and oppressive toward those who used to be their oppressors, as the oppressors were in the first place! (That might be deliberate, since part of Eisenstein's problem with Stalin was founded in his belief that film-makers should have creative freedom - hardly what Stalin wanted to offer them!) The first half of the movie very effectively builds sympathy from the viewer about conditions for the Potemkin's crew, and the mutiny itself was very well portrayed. The first half would surely gain an 8/10.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie is nowhere near as strong in the second half. There are very long stretches of basically nothing from about the 35 minute mark on. In very long scenes, the people of Odessa stream to the pier to pay homage to the sailors, the people of Odessa flee from the authorities as they attempt to re-establish control and the sailors wait for what could be a titanic confrontation with ships from a Russian squadron obviously sent to get things under control. There really was very little that interested me in the second half of the movie and, of course - given the propaganda purpose of the movie - the crew of the Potemkin are portrayed in the end as glorious victors, whereas in reality they ended up having to surrender to authorities in Romania, having accomplished little except giving Eisenstein a great story that could be easily twisted into propaganda by the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Overall, based largely on that very strong first half, I'd give this a 5/10."
"jeffcoat","6","3","7","16 January 2004"," Well worth the effort.
","Remembering that the film was both a product and a tool of the Soviet political machine, the hatred of the Tsarists is evident throughout.  It takes discontented masses and charismatic leaders to spawn a revolution. The seeds of discontent are graphically illustrated in this classic production.  The charismatic leadership is not an issue in this movie, which is not surprising since they were no less evil then the Tsarists.<br/><br/>The story is compellingly portrayed through the rapid transition of action sequences that should please even the short attention spans common in the MTV set.  No Hollywood Pretty People in this movie, each is distinctive and right for the role.  The grime on the faces, maggots in the food... the polished brass on deck, the bloodshed on the famous steps of Odessa... the story is a visual delight, though it was hard not to smile at the obvious propaganda promoting a classless society."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","2","4","16 October 2005"," Epic Propaganda
","Undoubtedly one of the most influential movies from the silent years of cinema, Sergei Eisenstein's recounting of the 1905 naval mutiny by sailors on the Potemkin has been referenced by so many other movies that you'd be forgiven for thinking that much of its power would have faded over the years. It is perhaps then a measure of the technical accomplishment of the 27-year-old director that the film looks remarkably fresh today and still possesses the ability to move modern-day viewers.<br/><br/>The story is a deceptively simple one, focusing more on the actions of the people/proletariat as a whole than any particular individuals, and yet it is laden with a symbolism that relentlessly hammers home the propagandistic ideology of its Communist party backers. It is impossible to see the events unfold with an unbiased eye because all who fall outside of the Party's rigorously defined circle of revolutionary heroes are portrayed as weasel-like characters who stroke their waxed moustaches while caring nothing for the plight of those beneath them. No doubt there must have been an element of this at the time, but this one-sided depiction simply reinforces the impression that we are watching a none-too-subtle exercise in what can perhaps most charitably be described as occasional deviation from reality.<br/><br/>Technically, however, the film excels. While abandoning any particularly characterisation, Eisenstein focuses on the human face of the revolution by having Eduard Tisse's camera pay close attention to the faces of the participants. He constantly uses close-ups on a wide range of characters to show us the heroic stoic features of the young sailors, the seamed faces of grieving women, the heartless smirks of ship's officers and even the hypocritical standards of the church. Eisenstein's pioneering of montage and overlapping editing is much in evidence. The first rebellious act, the smashing of a plate by a disgusted sailor is shown from different angles, giving an action that would take only an instant in real time a power and resonance that would otherwise be difficult to create. Later, when a sneering member of the bourgeoisie sneeringly heckles a woman protester, the reaction shot of a man turning around is edited so that a close-up frame is sandwiched been medium shots, giving the moment an immediacy and element of threat. It's the mark of a cinematic genius and must have been incredibly heady stuff to see back in the 1920s - it isn't difficult to see how such mastery of editing technique would have inspired a generation of movie makers.<br/><br/>The film is packed with memorable sequences, the most intense and powerful of which is the famous Odessa Steps sequence. If ever the genius of Eisenstein was in doubt one would only have to point at this incredible sequence that still manages to excite and horrify an audience eighty years after it was filmed. While mainstream audiences might find this film difficult to watch today, true cinema aficionados will recognise it for the early masterpiece it is. It's just a shame so few of us will get the opportunity to experience its power on a full-size cinema screen"
"gftbiloxi","10","2","4","26 April 2005"," Brilliant; Seldom Equaled
","Based on actual events of 1905, silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an Imperial Russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city Odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of Imperial forces, who attack the civilian supporters with savage force.<br/><br/>POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. Amazingly, each of these sequences manage to top the previous one, and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history. Filming largely where the real events actually occurred, director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film.<br/><br/>To describe POTEMKIN as a great film is something of an understatement. It is an absolute essential, an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, seldom equaled, never bested.<br/><br/>Gary F.

","/*may contain SPOILERS, but of course it does not matter :) */<br/><br/>Battleship Potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images. The visual direction is (well, and has been) inspiring, the sheer scale of the film is impressive, and the technique is certainly pioneering. What is really amazing is, to my mind, the depth and effectiveness of a film, devoid of proper literary script, sound (save the soundtrack), decent image quality, the faux-profound (self-)referentialism of today, exceptional acting, pretense, etc. What you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered.<br/><br/>BTW, the previous poster noted: ""Eisenstien felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted. The problem is that you think Eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you. It's a little cheap. I would've rather seen a huge final action scene.""<br/><br/>I must warn you, that the end is not cheap, and Eisenstein wasn't being generous to the heroes. History, however, was. Potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the film.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd strongly recommend seeing Battleship Potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema. See it with a fellow movie buff, it kept me talking for hours. However, if you tend to consider films, generally accepted as ""great"" or ""classic"", to be ""slow"" or ""boring"", this film might not be for you yet.

My take on it is this - there are gripping scenes, rather incredible use of editing and structure, and a good use of music to pump up the story.

","This silent films is organized in chapters, or as some other reviewers refer to them, as montages, though it didn't seem to me that the technique was needed. The story moves fairly seamlessly and the viewer has no trouble following the sequence of events; the title cards signaling each montage is almost like a break in the flow of the story. Even so, this is a gripping film, all the more compelling for it's production during the silent era under director Sergei M. Eisenstein. There is an early preface relative to individuals falling under the spell of mass consciousness which itself dissolves into revolutionary fervor, and that theme dominates the story. As impressive as the movie is, I was totally awed by the sequence involving the citizenry of Odessa filing out on that incredibly long strip of land with ocean on both sides, for the viewing of Grigory Vakulinchuk, leader of the mutiny aboard the Potemkin protesting inhumane conditions and rotting meat masquerading as food for the sailors. And as so often has happened with my movie viewing pleasure, I was rewarded once again with a moment of cosmic serendipity upon witnessing the Odessa Staircase montage with it's baby carriage sequence. I had no idea that was coming, and with my very prior viewing of ""The Untouchables"", the scene had me just about jumping out of my seat. If that comment makes no sense to the reader, you'll just have to watch both films, and not necessarily back to back, as the sequence under consideration will be most apparent. The only negative I found with 'Potemkin' was the obvious use of a model used in some long views of the battleship which brought down the professionalism of the project. Otherwise, this was a competently made film, all the more so for it's silent era origins, and one which every cinema fan should see at least once."

","It's sixty-six minutes of perhaps the most arresting imagery in movie history, also one of the most dynamic. Every shot includes movement of some kind, whether people, smoke, guns, or the prow of history overtaking us. There's no scene of focal conversation, let alone silent talk. Thus politics of revolt remain largely unregistered. Instead the symbolism of rotten meat force-fed to sailors sums up crumbling Tsarist rule. The revolt is told in compelling movement, crowds rushing to and fro, Tsarist forces ahead or behind. One after another, the human wave cascades, with hardly time to breathe. Surely, the Odessa Steps is one of the most memorable in all moviedom; at the same time, a common humanity is deepened-- the dead baby, the shattered eyeglasses. Yes, the 1905 revolt failed. But seed was planted taking down Tsarist rule but ten years later. No need to go on—the film's brilliance is there for all to see, and remains so though not a word is spoken. It's Eisenstein's masterpiece, an enduring one-of-a-kind."

","Battleship Potemkin is a 1925 silent drama film directed by Sergei Eisenstein and is often considered one of the greatest films of all time for its revolutionary camera work and incredible montage techniques, impressive action sequences and compelling plot of comradeship. The story is told through five acts which goes from an uprising on the Potemkin against the barbaric ship captain and senior officers all the way to Odessa to begin an uprising and leading to one of the most important and at the time shocking scenes in cinematic history- the infamous Odessa steps massacre, where we really see how Eisenstein didn't shy away from graphic and near-disturbing imagery The plot has a distinct and recognisable narrative which is now the backbone and basis of film today, again showing how significant and of great importance it is, with a distinct first, second and third act, all the while telling a phenomenal tale and delivering a hugely satisfying, tense and fantastic ending. The film proves itself over and over again as the story evolves and constantly betters itself throughout, its powerful and at times brutal imagery really pushes and signifies the message. Battleship Potemkin is a shining example of early Soviet film and the most significant motion picture of the silent era, still after all these years remaining one of the all time greats, the film never fails to deliver on its hard-hitting emotional impact, graphic violence, alliance-themed story and ground-breaking, hugely influential film making from a mastermind of the era. Battleship Potemkin is a prime example of a perfect film, with the only nit-picking flaws being in an overly long middle act, with a leads to a temperamental delay on forwarding the plot. 10/10."
"StevePulaski","9","0","0","12 October 2015"," A few thoughts on a widely regarded masterpiece
","NOTE: This is not a conventional review; this is my required response to Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin for my college course Intro to Film & Screen Studies...<br/><br/>Cinema, both domestic and foreign, owes a lot to Sergei Eisenstein for creating not only one of the most successful propaganda films with Battleship Potemkin, but one of the most successful examples of montage in history. Eisenstein employs a wide variety of subversive montage styles here, some considered tonal ones that string together a continuous feeling that rubs off on an audience, some for the purpose of continuity and consistency in events, and some for the purpose of putting grandiose, large-scale sequences into a specified perspective, though all significant in their own right.<br/><br/>One of the most jarring inclusions of structurally conflicting shots is the famous shot of the statue of the lion, which is shown sleeping, awakening, and rising all in the matter of about two seconds. These static images, when strung together, inspire the kind of momentary shock we, the audience, have upon watching Eisenstein concoct a film so raucous and battle-hungry that it's as if the lion is replicating our personal feelings whilst watching the film. The conflict established is more or less a circumstance of reactionary response to the disobedience of order; order which is constantly affirmed throughout the entire first chapter of the film.<br/><br/>Then there's the scene in the second chapter where the passengers aboard Potemkin begin to rebel. Eisenstein utilizes his montage theory to establish the events occurring before zeroing in on specific people fighting and specific blows in a way that shows the conflict between the two parties whilst showing a more concise focus on a large-scale playing field. The effect is unique because it's rare we see a large battle (or even a large battle conducted in a small area) specified so humanly by way of close-ups and intimate shooting techniques that Eisenstein employs that make the sequence so personal.<br/><br/>As far as alternative logic goes – where Eisenstein creates some sort of visual poetry or distinction without the use of his beloved montage technique – there's the scene early in the film where one of the captains goes to observe the actions in the bunkers. Eisenstein's camera observes the actions of the captain while interjecting cuts of pots and pans precariously placed atop boards of wood that are strung up and suspended to the room's ceiling. These scenes establish what the captain is looking at and what his environment is composed of in a manner that relates greatly to Kulesov and his own personal effect.<br/><br/>Then there are scenes that are more concerned with fleshing out a specific event, rather than encapsulating the horror and the messiness of other events (the uprising aboard the Potemkin and the famous Odessa Steps sequence just to name a few). One scene is the final straw for the workers, of sorts, when they are persuaded to believe that rotting, maggot-ridden meat is okay for consumption, despite being viewed by everybody on board, even the cooks, as otherwise. Eisenstein keeps things grounded more-or-less in a real-time here, allowing his camera to go back and forth between the workers and the captains in a manner that doesn't shortchange or rapidly look for a way out of this event in order to interject other scenes and create a compilation of ""last straws"" for the workers. This scene in particular establishes the logic that Eisenstein uses can be equal parts broadly observant, as seen in his montages, or decidedly focused.<br/><br/>In a way, I feel Battleship Potemkin was a film made for the masses to, for once, look introspectively at their situations in Russian and observe the treacherous, unfair living conditions and the willfully oppressive nature of the rich and able. Eisenstein had to combat the fact that most of the commonwealth Russian population was illiterate and unknowing of their own exploitation, which made him make a film like this that, despite being able to be dissected in numerous ways, almost demands a response of any kind. The complete and total disregard for the health and wellbeing of humans should at least warrant some response from people, and Eisenstein's images reflect the horrors of oppression without getting lost in symbolism or any kind of discernible auteurism. His montage elements only add to a film, rather than being stylistic distractions that work to muddle the themes at hand.<br/><br/>Starring: Aleksandr Antonov, Vladimir Barksy, and Grigori Aleksandrov. Directed by: Sergei Eisenstein."

","I really find it hard to describe Battleship Potemkin because it's just a film that just wows you over before you can even stop to think about it, a technical masterpiece with a genuinely thrilling plot. The story takes place in June of 1905 on the battleship well Potemkin, we see the crew of the ship are not so happy and they are revolted by the standards they have and so they stick up for themselves and when fellow crew members are nearly killed by their own officers, it seems quite the time for the crew to get up and fight. It is a dramatized version of true events but this movie really pumps up the workers as complete heroes, I mean this movie is Soviet propaganda through and through, but it's superbly well made even if it is.<br/><br/>The man behind this perfectly crafted motion picture is Sergei Eisenstein who directs this in a way which even when it's going very slow still manages to either be thrilling or throw in some kind of thing to make it so amazing. I think what he also does is create a movie that isn't just for critics to feast their eyes on, this can be enjoyed by anyone I swear and it's actually a genuinely exciting kind of movie, although I would always watch a few silent movies beforehand so that you get the right feel of this. What Eisenstein also does is bring in all the crafts that make up a film and creates an art piece, one that's cameras are perfectly working, editing is finely tuned, dialogue (even for a silent movie) is great and then utilises production design especially in the famous ""Odessa Steps"" scene where the outfits and the general look of the scene looks amazing.<br/><br/>This is so often placed on the lists that people compile with the greatest movies and for good reason, the reasons become even more so when you consider this was made in 1925 and it is silent, but you never truly think about that and this doesn't seem to have aged at all, in fact other than the cast the only expired thing is the Soviet Union. Yet again it is Eisenstein who makes it ageless, I felt he just knew what he wanted and did it, made a film that although is made for a certain political position, can still entertain no matter what your views on politics.<br/><br/>I feel that again those steps are like come on, I mean those boots are just a brilliant cinematic piece. The scene is one that is thrilling yet also oddly touching with a little added darkness (well OK make that quite a bit). The choreography of the entire scene is marvellous too with the enormous cast to run and fall down it not only makes it incredible to see but you'd think also really dangerous! Don't watch this just for this scene I mean this has sublime scenes elsewhere, take for example the ending which of course I won't spoil but when you think one thing it does something else and builds you up until you are really excited to see what happens next. <br/><br/>I think that if you consider this not your kind of film then think again, this isn't a movie that should only be shown in history classes or film studying lectures, it's a movie that should be seen because it is entertaining but also technically a film of flawless dimensions. Yes feast in what Soviet cinema has to offer and maybe you might like it quite a bit, in fact you might even be accustomed to raising a red flag above your house even if the neighbour calls you a commie."

","I'm not going to lie, I did not enjoy this. I appreciate the importance of the film and the enormous steps it took for early cinema but wow, I was so excited for it to be over. Obviously the context of the film is incredibly important, and it is vital to note that this is a propaganda film. That being said, there aren't really characters. It's like there were just two: the people and the soldiers. The stair scene is just as legendary as it is hailed to be. Halfway through it I noticed my jaw was dropped open as much as possible. I've been watching early films lately and I must say that the violence is shocking. It's not especially graphic or even realistically performed, but the reasons they have to start fighting and the quickness of it was jarring. These soldiers just gunning down civilians was incredibly disturbing and I can't believe that that is a thing that happened, and continues to happen. There were a lot of creative angles and techniques used, absolutely. Just the way the story was told left me guessing a lot. Wasn't a lot of build-up to action, it was just suddenly inaction to action- and since I didn't know what was going on all the time, it was really confusing. Just not a format I'm used to, but I'm working on it.<br/><br/>There were so many points where I was like ""okay, I GET IT"" like so many repetitive shots and close-ups held for far too long. There were a lot of shots that should have been cut shorter because it would continue on even after the characters were mostly out of frame. There was one scene where two people walk away and the scene keeps going until all we can see is their ankles and I was like, ""ok, what do these ankles symbolize"" Just kidding, haha, I mean I can't knock this film too much because it's truly an important part of the foundation of modern cinema, and these guys were out there with nothing but ideas and some film equipment. They didn't have film schools, they didn't have movies to watch and study, they didn't have books about filmmaking. I do appreciate this movie's contribution to film but I did not have a good time watching this film. The story didn't do it for me and the shooting style was extremely frustrating to watch. The stair scene is worth a viewing, but I don't intend to watch this again. Not sure why any government would endorse/pay for this, but I'll never pretend to understand Russia. <br/><br/>Did I enjoy it? No Do I ever want to see it again? No Do I ever want to include it in my own collection? No<br/><br/>6/10 Bye love you -Jessie Carlson"

In this movie we watch a protest strike that started when the crew was given rotten meat for dinner and ended in a riot. After that the sailors raised the red flag and tried to start the revolution in their home port Odessa. <br/><br/>This movie is divided into five episodes which are:<br/><br/>1) 'Men and Maggots', in which the sailors protest because they gave them to eat rotten meat, 2) 'Drama on the Deck', in which the sailors mutiny and their leader (Vakulinchuk) is killed, 3) 'A Dead Man Calls for Justice' in which Vakulinchuk's body is lament by the people of Odessa, 4) 'The Odessa Staircase', in which Tsarist soldiers massacre the Odessans, 5) 'The Rendezvous with the Squadron', in which after all of these the sailors cheer on the rebellious battleship and join the mutiny.<br/><br/>Some things that we have to mention about this movie are that is based on historical events and shows us everything about the Battleship Potemkin. I liked this movie because of the direction of Sergei M. Eisenstein which I found very good and also for the music. <br/><br/>Finally I have to say that ""Battleship Potemkin"" is fairly considered as one of the best movies in the history of cinema and I strongly recommend it to everyone who is a fan of cinema.

"JaydoDre","6","0","0","13 December 2014"," An epic but overrated propaganda
","When you read that Battleship Potemkin is a propaganda movie, please be aware that this does not mean that the movie just has a revolutionary tone to it or a message, like Birth of a Nation. No, it really literally is a propaganda film where one side is getting viciously vilified, the other side is wholly righteous and victimized and there is a very clear motivational message told to the viewer.<br/><br/>This is different from a normal heroic movie where there is a clear villain and a clear protagonist. Such exaggeration of characters in a normal film is for the viewer's benefit because the viewer gets more enthralled in the characters actions and more entertained when they succeed. In propaganda films it is not for the viewer's benefit and you can feel that! Propaganda films feel preachy and pushy as their purpose is not entertainment, even though they may be entertaining in the process. Such films therefore have a disgusting core, and unfortunately, for all its epic feel, Battleship Potemkin is no different.<br/><br/>Besides that, when this film tries to convince the viewer it on occasion misses its mark or is hilariously corny. A grown man gets slapped on the back a couple of times in his sleep and that gets him crying. It just feels awkward, like the movie is trying to look for trouble everywhere, clutching at straws.<br/><br/>Other times it just does not explain things well. There is a scene where the men look at an officer with contempt but does not give a reason for it, until later I realised that it was because the sailors were refusing to eat.<br/><br/>Visually Battleship Potemkin is very impressive. It is very good at conveying its propaganda with simple to understand messages and symbolism. It is also good at creating tension, surprise, atmosphere and just showing off some pretty maritime scenery. There are a few interesting special effects and cool camera movements during the famous stairway sequence.<br/><br/>However, as already mentioned, the events are not always shown clearly and it goes overboard with the its propaganda scenery to the extreme. There are other oddities too, like a gun clearly not pointing at a person and yet the person falls to the ground anyway after the gun is fired. There are also a number of scenes that drag on for a too long with nothing important happening, and that in a movie that is only about an hour long. If you cut out all the unnecessary bits the movie would probably not be more than 30 minutes. It only has 3 events to show (though the film divides them into 5 parts).<br/><br/>The best thing about this film was the music. It was not just providing the mood but also the sound effects for what was happening on screen, which was not a standard thing for silent movies at the time, and the music managed to do so without losing its flow and without stopping being music, so that if you remove the movie, the orchestral music is still really interesting. It has a bombastic modern feel to it of a Hans Zimmer composition but a timeless sensibility of the classical music.<br/><br/>Now, to take that support away a little, if you see the modern version of the movie you will likely get the remastered version of the soundtrack, and no doubt the original quality would have been lower.<br/><br/>The most pleasant thing about this film is its presentation, consisting of an epic and lively soundtrack and visuals. But its story is presented awkwardly, with the political pushing being uncomfortably obvious and other awkwardness in the scenes. This film has plenty of sins."

","Sergei Eisenstein's ""Battleship Potemkin"", is one of the more tolerable Propaganda movies of it's era.

The most infamous segment ""The Odessa Staircase"", is pretty much unforgettable in terms of imagery even though it never happened (Much of it inspired artist Francis Bacon and Brian De Palma's ""The Untouchables"", 1987). Eisenstein's method proved very experimental and was met with mixed results, but definitely proved to be long lasting. It didn't go on to inspire the masses, yet more or less it offended them due to it's scenes of violence which were considered graphic at the time.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It remains one of the most influential films you should definitely see. Due to it's effectiveness of demonstrating early pioneering techniques of montage, and for being a very strong piece for it's time. 8/10."

"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","23 July 2014"," Indeed, Battleship Potemkin is one of the most influential propaganda films of all time!
","Directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the movie presents a dramatized version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their officers of the Tsarist regime. Eisenstein divided the plot into in five acts: Act I: Men and Maggots, Act II: Drama on the deck, Act III: The dead man calls for Justice. Act IV: The Odessa staircase and last, Act V: One against all or Rendez-Vous with the Squadron. While the masterpiece has remained one of the most influential silent films of all time, influencing such directors like Terry Gilliam, Francis Ford Coppola, and Brian De Palma's later works. The movie also have a negative side with the Revolution Will Not Be Vilified attitude. While it is certainly a classic it's nonetheless still, an old Soviet propaganda movie that help keep tyrants like Joseph Stalin in powers for years. Soviets seized upon the mutiny as a propaganda symbol for their party and unduly emphasized their role in the mutiny. In fact, the people that lead the mutiny on the boat, were Socialists of one type or another and cared little or nothing for Communism. The Bolsheviks had little to do with it, despite the movie saying so. Eisenstein made other changes to dramatize the story, ignoring the major fire that swept through Odessa's dock area while Potemkin was anchored there, and showing a tarpaulin thrown over the sailors to be executed. So I wouldn't say, the movie is historical accurate. It had a heavy-handed message that Communism is good. Anything else is bad. After all, the local Cossacks are portray so negative here, as over the top shadowy evil villains who shots women and children. You're really feed force to feel this great sympathy for the downtrodden sailors and workers. Clearly, the movie is very manipulate. A good example of this is one of the dead sailor corpse being display, with the sign about him having been killed for a plate of soup, instead of inciting a mutiny. He wasn't even the leader in real life. The real leader of the mutiny continue with life with the ship, finally settling in Dublin and silly as it is, open a fish-and-chips shop. Yes, that's really did happen. Another is the famous Odessa massacre, it never did happened. It was just made up so that the revolution would look more justified. Yes, there were reports of demonstrations being put down by troops on that day, but it was greatly exaggeration of some of the real events. In fact, Joseph Goebbels said that this film was the greatest propaganda film ever, and really help influence him on Nazis propaganda films. You really see a glance of what, he was talking about, with the film making a crude characterization of the Russian Orthodox priest. By showing him, it was meant to show how religion is used to support the status quo and reinforce authority. It was clearly an anti-religion comment. Later, Nazi films would use the same tactical in their media war against Jews, portrayal them as the greedy authority that kept the German people down. It's clearly haunting. The movie was often banned from countries like United Kingdom, France, Germany, and even Soviet Union at one time, because how much, it influence people to overthrow the government. While, not a huge hit, when it came out, the movie has received extremely positive reviews from critics, over the years. A lot of this come from how great the montage editing techniques were. Sergei Eisenstein learned/discovered cutting clips in experimental Soviet film workshops with his teacher, Lev Kuleshov. It shows in the powerful, and violent Odessa Steps sequence. I love the epic rush of how it was film. Added with the music from Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony and you got something powerful and disturbing. Suppressed anger. A dangerous and distressing time. I particularly like the fact that the fate of the infant in the baby carriage is left to the imagination of the audience. The baby represents the fragile hope of progress. At the top of the steps are the advancing forces of imperialism and autocracy, at the bottom a wild mess of violence. The people are caught between great forces of destruction, to which there is no appeal. Does the baby survive? We do not know. Even the action scenes on the boat were pretty intense. It was really surprise to see the splash of color in the end of this movie. It really work in the symbolism department. Then, there is ship scenes, where people notice some phallic and sexual imagery. Who knows!? Maybe, there is. After all, most propaganda film at the time are pretty homoerotic. Maybe, sometimes the cigar is just a cigar. The faults of the film could be its pacing. By modern standards, this is a short film; but for 74 minutes. Yet it felt like forever. It had a lot of slow moments and repetitive recycle shots of nothing happening. Then there are oddly cut shots that don't match up, what happening on screen. Since the old Soviet production company is no more, Mosfilm released a selection of its classic films online for free viewing. It's shouldn't be, too hard to find. The movie is indeed in the public domain under a free license Creative Commons. If not, try to find the various DVD edition. Most video transfer are pretty good with few scratches and speckling. A lot of them are restored. Since the movie is indeed a silent film. There are several film scores. The best one to watch it is under Shostakovich. Edmund Meisel & Mark-Andreas Schlingensiepen works as well. Other film composers versions, Nikolai Kryukov, Chris Jarrett, Eric Allaman, Del Rey & the Sun Kings band, and Pet Shop Boys are worth checking out. Just stay away from the avant-garde jazz version. It's really bad. Overall: A must watch for any silent film fan or film student. A alright watch for everybody else."
"estebangonzalez10","8","0","0","9 May 2014"," Uprising!!!
","""There is an uprising!""<br/><br/>Battleship Potemkin is one of the true masterpieces from the silent film era thanks to the innovative editing techniques used by director Sergei Eisenstein. He took the basic principles of continuous editing that D.W. Griffith had used a decade earlier and revolutionized film with his now famous montages. Battleship Potemkin has brilliant montages and by combining these different shots together an entire new meaning emerges. This is one of those rare silent films that not only can be appreciated for the important role it played in the revolution of cinema, but it also happens to be very entertaining on its own. The action scenes were beautifully shot and edited together to stir an even greater emotional impact. Of course, the film isn't without its flaws because being the political film it is (Communist propaganda), its leftist message is heavy handed. The sailors and workers are presented as the saints, while the tsarists are demonized. No matter if you agree or not with the message of the film, there is no denying that this movie is worth watching thanks to Eisenstein's technical achievements and some iconic scenes that continue to influence the way we view cinema today. <br/><br/>The screenplay commemorating the uprising of 1905 in Russia was written by Nina Agadzhanova. The story focuses on the crew of the Battleship Potemkin who were being treated poorly by their commanders. One of the sailors, Vokulinchuk (Alexander Antonov), decides it's time for them to stand up like the rest of the nation has against this oppressive government. The next day, the crew refuses to eat the rotten meat served for them and begin a protest which leads to a violent riot. The sailors try to ignite the revolution by raising a red flag near their home port, but when Vokulinchuk is violently killed the people of Odessa become outraged. Things get out of control for the Tsar regime who violently kill hundreds of innocent people on the Odessa Steps, which only ignites more indignation from the rest of the protesters. They have reached a point of no return and there is no stopping the revolution now.<br/><br/>The climactic and most memorable action scene takes place during the middle of the film in the Odessa Steps where Eisenstein brilliantly uses rhythmic editing to build the suspense. This scene has become iconic and many directors have payed homage to it. These montages were a perfect fit for propagandistic purposes because they stirred powerful emotions and could easily manipulate the audience. That is why some directors prefer using long takes instead of montages, but there is no denying that Eisenstein's visionary way of directing has influenced cinema today. I appreciated this film very much, but I also enjoyed it and was entertained throughout its short running time. There are also some beautiful shots in Potemkin so a lot of credit has to be given to cinematographer Eduard Tisse. This is a must see film for all the technical achievements involved, and you will be surprised at how well Eisenstein put together those scenes to leave audiences at the edge of their seats."
"sashank_kini-1","9","0","0","29 May 2013"," Two intensely memorable moments from the film strike you with such a crashing force, you cower in your seat in disbelief of the horror you're witnessing in the film.
","Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin has two intensely memorable moments; the first one surges when the captain of 'Potemkin' (a battleship) orders his loyal officers to execute the mutinous sailors who are covered in tarpaulin, which instantly took me to the horrifying image of the shrouded Abu-Ghraib prisoners. The second one erupts when the Tsarist army marches down Odessa steps as Cossacks attack the revolting civilians during the famous 'Odessa Sequence'. These two sequences strike with such a crashing force not only because they are expertly edited by director Sergei Eisenstein, who rapidly cuts his camera across the various forces in action in a way that keeps one's heart racing throughout, but also because the scenes are supplemented with astoundingly evocative background score by Edmund Meisel. The images terrify at times because they're so direct, such as the close up shot of a baby getting trampled by fleeing crowd during the Odessa massacre. You cower in your seat as though you're the one being attacked, and you sit with the same expression the characters in the film have because you can't believe what you're witnessing. That's the impact Battleship Potemkin had on me in 2013 so you can imagine how deeply it would've influenced movie-goers in 1925, when the film actually released.<br/><br/>Eisenstein's take on the 1905 incident in Russia where the crew of 'Potemkin', a battleship, mutinied against the dictatorial regime of their Tsarist officers, is partly subjective. He deliberately chose not include the outcome of the mutiny in order to present his film as a celebratory instance for the mutineers. He has included a fictitious massacre sequence that's become the most famous scene in the movie – the Odessa massacre, which never occurred. He opens the film with repeated shots of waves crashing on rocks and then takes us to the Potemkin ship, where an officer inspecting the sleeping crew unfairly vents his anger on a young member. The officer is angry because he finds it difficult to make his way through the room filled with sailors, who are huddled in a small room and given little space to sleep. As the other sailors console the weeping sailor (yes, Russians men do weep easily. Know it because I've read Tolstoy), Vakulinchuk, an older sailor incenses his crew to fight back the officers.<br/><br/>The next day, there's a commotion on the ship as the crew complaints that their meat is rotten with crawling worms visible. An officer's response – 'These aren't worms. They are maggots. Just clean them and they're fine' (not quoting verbatim so don't bother correcting). This kind of cruel indifference leads to further non-cooperation from the crew, who refuses to finish their soup. For this minor reason, the captain willfully orders for their execution until the soldiers fight back. The spirit of their revolt further manifests in the people of Odessa, who no longer are tolerant against Tsarist oppression. Eisenstein knows the facts but he can't put across his intended message without some artistic tweaking, and so he does it without making his changes feel evident. As Roger Ebert said: 'he did it so well that today, the bloodshed on Odessa steps is often referred to as if it really happened'. The bloodshed sequence comes as so shocking that I was taken to the Jallianwalla massacre that actually happened in India; it made me reflect on what it would've felt at such a moment of unbridled horror.<br/><br/>Battleship Potemkin works excellently as a film. A similar mutiny-themed film came out in 2012 which many of you may be aware of – Les Miserables. I have a hunch that the editing in the latter film may have been influenced by Battleship Potemkin. I also know why Potemkin works so well now: firstly, it was silent and so broader gestures and highly expressive classical acting was necessary, whereas Les Miserables was an overkill of broad gestures, expressions and singing,singing,singing; secondly, music is solely what drives the movie's expression without characters having to tear their lungs out singing till even music says 'Take a break already!', and thirdly, the characters in Potemkin, despite their gestures, seemed natural and made the scene look as if it was really happening, unlike the artificial Broadway feel in Les Miserables. Masters like Eisenstein and Kurusawa are very judicious in their use of film elements; they know what-to-keep and what-to-leave so the audience is impacted in the best way. And they made movies ages before, so why haven't many newer filmmakers perfected the art yet? You should compulsorily watch Battleship Potemkin for its able to impact you greatly within a quick seventy minutes, something Les Miserables couldn't do in two-and-half chugging hours.<br/><br/>more on sashankkini.wordpress.com/‎"

They are given the poorest quality of meat which turns out to be the last straw and the sailors rebel against their officers and take control of the boat. This inspires their civilian counterparts also and the citizens of Odessa join the sailors against the Tsar. There is retaliation by the Tsar which sets the stage for a tense climax. The movie is technically brilliant and is a great indicator of the sheer genius of Eisenstein.The scenes of rebellion and the retaliation by Tsarist forces are shot beautifully.

","Sergei Einstein's silent film, Bronenosets Potyomkin, captures real life events from 1905. It's been named as one of the most influential propaganda films of all time. I don't exactly agree with this, but I do think that Einstein did a wonderful job at showing us the injustice and brutality of actual events. One of the scenes that stood out to me was when the crew was fed rotten, maggot infested meat. I was extremely disgusted by this scene, but thought Einstein did an excellent job at showing us what their life was like aboard the ship, even though it might have been dramatized. There were a number of vivid and grotesque images that stayed in my mind even after I watched it. The Odessa Steps was one of the most violent scenes that I have seen. Einstein did a fabulous job at creating shots that were rapid and sharp. It enhanced the feeling of panic as the civilians run down the stairs. The close-ups used by Einstein of the panicked civilians really captured our class' attention as we gasped and cringed. I believe that the use of these zoom shots added to the drama and emotion of the audiences. In the beginning of this scene he zooms out and captures the full flight of stairs and the mass amounts of helpless civilians. This caused me to feel a sense of panic as I watched this scene due to his shot of the larger picture. As a propaganda film, Einstein did a wonderful job at making us feel sorry for these sailors. Although, this movie wasn't my favorite, I do think that Einstein created a action-packed silent film that had us at the edge of our seats. He did a wonderful job at grabbing our attention even though there was no sound."

","I'll be the first to admit that film is not my expertise, and many of the nuances in Eisenstein's masterpiece may have been lost on me. It is clear that his control of the camera is impressive, and the way in which he creates emotion through the camera is equally as impressive. However, the story seemed a little contrived to me. Although the underlying event was fact, it seemed to intentionally incite emotion rather than draw it out naturally. In the scene at the steps, this behavior is prevalent. The chaotic stitching of shots together insights the desired emotion, but it ignores the fact that the actual event was much more benign than Eisenstein's reenactment. So, if we wan't a realist reenactment of Soviet Russia during this time period, I would recommend looking somewhere else; however, if you want to see one of the greatest innovators in film history, this is a great film to start. Eisenstein's most notable work was definitely in montage. This film allows us to see how these ideas were invented. Since the concept was unpolished at this point, it allows us to see Eisenstein's intent in creating effects through montage.<br/><br/>If your looking for a casual day at the movies, this is not your pick. If you are a scholar of film, then there are a number of interesting points of exploration in terms of composition and exploration in film and narrative techniques. In this aspect, Eisenstein was a true pioneer.<br/><br/>I know that was kind of a continued rant on just one aspect of the film, but it most certainly is a defining featuring. In addition, the film doesn't entertain on some level. The action is interesting and does help to see the discontent manifested under Russian Fascism. The plot plays very basic, and barely held my interest. The authorship is almost peripheral to what makes this interesting though."

","My overall opinion of the film is that I loved it. It is a very successful in getting its emotions across and it is that which makes the film brilliant. Even though the film is not perfect it is definitely a film that I will not forget in a hurry. It says a lot for how successful all of the images are that so many people think so highly of ""Battleship Potemkin"", regardless of a narrative that is from time to time hard to follow. This is because the film does not have the best acting talents but it still delivers a hard punch that stays with you. I would say that the Odessa Steps has to be one of the most well known sequences in the history of film. The famous Odessa Steps montage single-handedly reveals equally the excellent industrial talents and an intense understanding of how to deliver a picture that stays with the audience. I would say that the overall techniques used in this film were to make it shocking, just like my first and second film in A2. The images are so striking that the movie's faults are often not so obvious and they don't keep it from being an unforgettable film. There is a lot to understand in the way that the main scenes were set up and shot. The Battleship Potemkin is packed with vibrant metaphors that stay in your brain after you have watched it. The reason I selected this particular film, The Battleship Potemkin is that it is a stunning success of imaginative montages that lead the way for films like Rocky. What makes this such a good film particularly is the well-known Odessa Steps scene where blameless city dwellers are chased away down the steps. The motion picture is an all time movie standard for all film fans. The cinematography is incredible in this Russian film, it used a combination of tracking and crane shots that move with the battle and used modern viewpoint and composition layouts for a film of that time. Historical references that go with this film were easy to find out as the film is based on the historical actions that happened at that time. The motion picture tells the narrative of a rebellion at the battleship Potemkin in Russia. Troops were given gone off meat for food which resulted in the uproar/dispute."

","Sergei M. Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin was a huge success involving the Russian revolution. Starts off when a hard working crew get's fed up with the captain's treating them like dogs because they fed them a piece of meat that was way past its prime, and so the crew revolts. This movie shows the innovations that were brought upon by Sergei Eisenstein. Because filming isn't just about making or directing films, it's about coming up with the newest way to film. He shows many new techniques that revolve around our films today. The feel of this film was a huge surprise to me because it easy to keep track of. This film continues and one of the crew members, I believe the one who started the revolt, was the first and only to get killed, and all of the crew honors him and gives them a somewhat unorthodox ceremony. They put his body at the port in a tent with a note on him explaining why he deserves such honor, and quite quickly the entire town is there to honor him. Then that's when all Hell broke lose when the Russian government, and it was the end for those at the port, and this film continues. Sergei Eisenstein's directing was superb and outright professional. The music kept me on my feet on what was about to happen next, and this film had a lot of those moments. This film had a clear image of how the Russian army was as well as the government. With a scene in the film, soldiers kill which included a mother who is carrying her baby in a carriage, and the soldiers look emotionless and keep going. If you want to see a great silent film that includes some action this is sincerely a film to watch."

","I normally can't stand silent movies, most of the time I just can't connect to any of the characters and I'm always frustrated by the slow pacing and exaggerated ""acting"" characterized by the period. Battleship Potemkin, however, really struck a chord with me.<br/><br/>The cinematography was consistently fantastic, and the story was simple and elegant. I also found eisenstein's use of non professional actors to be an incredibly smart move. Instead of giving the usual over-the top theatrical performances of the typical stage turned film actors of the time, they gave realistic, natural performances that I found were much easier to relate to than someone flailing their arms in the air to show that hey are angry.<br/><br/>Obviously, the editing was near perfection. It's amazing to see just how far ahead of it's time this movie was as far as editing goes. Whether it was the film's complex juxtaposition of images (like the priest during the uprising or cutting from the doctor being thrown overboard to the rotten meat) that form a whole greater than the sum of it's parts, or the legendary Odessa steps sequence, the editing is never short of spellbinding. Battleship Potemkin should be required viewing for anyone who considers themselves a film buff."
"parkermenn","Null","0","0","6 February 2011"," Battleship Potemkin
","Battleship Potemkin is unlike any movie I have seen before regarding the treatment of the protagonist and the antagonist. More specifically it is the lack of protagonist and antagonist in the film. In modern cinema there are always specific, identified characters that oppose one another from beginning to end. Battleship Potemkin does identify several characters however they do not carry the narrative very far. Indeed their roles seem limited to simply serve a purpose in the bigger scheme of things.<br/><br/>Rather than specific characters as protagonist or antagonist, Eisenstein uses opposing forces. The opposing forces are the oppressed people versus the oppressive authority. They are groups identified by typage. That is they are simply identified by their appearance and their actions. Officers, soldiers and priests compose the oppressors. Sailors and townspeople compose the oppressed. The story is about the struggle between these two groups. It is a somewhat successful rebellion. One in which innocent lives must be sacrificed to overcome the oppressors.<br/><br/>The initial rebellion begins when sailors refuse to eat rotten meat and the officers of the ship refuse to recognize that the meat is rotten. Action on the ship comes to a climax and the sailors overpower the officers with numbers and they successfully take over the ship. Their rebellious act spills over onto the mainland and inspires the people there to come to their aid by delivering food. In doing so the people on the mainland are targeted for execution.<br/><br/>Next comes a great scene because it is so emotional. Staged on the steps of Odessa, soldiers march and fire upon a large unarmed crowd. The people are massacred and the Potemkin is forced back to sea. Although this would not seem to be a victory, it is in some regard. The sailors are not deterred rather they are emboldened by the injustice. They decide as a group that they will sail on and confront the fleet.<br/><br/>The movie has a happy ending. Although it is probably unrealistic, it enforces the idea that a group can rise up and achieve unity. Suspense mounts as the Potemkin sights the fleet. Guns are raised and the sailors prepare for a battle. At the last moment, they realize other sailors have rebelled just as they have and the movie ends with the two crews rejoicing together."

","Over the past couple of years, I've made it my mission to watch many of the most famous films ever made. And while I've greatly enjoyed some of these films, others have struck me as overrated drags.<br/><br/>""Battleship Potemkin"" falls somewhere in the middle of the scale. I admire the film for its groundbreaking direction and sequences of extreme suspense and horror. But, on the other hand, much of the film is a little ... dull. Indeed, my girlfriend is now snoozing heavily in the next room, having passed out during the long sequence of the Potemkin approaching the rest of the fleet. (I suspect that I liked the film a little more than she did. Bless.) <br/><br/>Now, I should unpack what I mean by ""dull,"" because I hate it when people are imprecise with their criticisms. I quite like a lot of films that can be construed as ""dull"" -- Twilight Samurai, Alphaville, Tokyo Story, and so on. But these films aren't boring to me; they're paced in such a way as to invite contemplation rather than generate excitement. And because I care about the characters in these films, this pacing doesn't bother me at all; indeed, it draws me into the story even more deeply.<br/><br/>The trouble with ""Battleship Potemkin"" is that it doesn't have great characters; nor does it really invite you to contemplate anything. At heart, it's an action movie designed to appeal to the most basic of emotions, not your brain. So, in the slow stretches of the film between action segments, ""Potemkin"" sort of grinds down. This problem doesn't spoil the film completely, but it does in my opinion prevent it from being an all-time classic.<br/><br/>So why did I give it an ""8""? Because it truly is fascinating to watch. Because the Odessa steps sequence is rightly celebrated (and the imitations aren't as good). Because the propaganda bits are actually sort of interesting. And, of course, it's full of memorable images that are both beautiful and terrifying.<br/><br/>And yet, I can't help being a little annoyed at film critics for over-praising films that were groundbreaking for purely technical reasons. Even though film is a largely visual medium, shouldn't we be more invested in plot, characters, and themes than in novel use of cuts/dissolves/montage/etc.? There's more to movies than clever trickery with the camera -- or there should be, anyway.<br/><br/>In short, ""Battleship Potemkin"" looks great and is a fascinating piece of film history, but it might not entertain you, and it almost certainly won't enlighten you. I liked it fine, but I can think of quite a few movies I'd rather watch -- many of them foreign, and most of them slow-paced."

"GypsyJ","9","0","0","1 November 2009"," Eisenstein's montage
","Eisenstein produced a tense and violent rhythm with his dialectic montage. He passed on a particular perception of history to the audience through his way of editing. Overall the collision approach itself attempts to represent the conflict and collision of history itself, at the same time the technique applied to individual scenes enforce certain emotional response of the audience. His editing technique serves as psychological stimulation rather than a narrative device, allowing him to deliver his political message through emotional sensation to the audience.<br/><br/>Let me illustrate a few sequences. <br/><br/>In Act I, after a group of sailors refused to eat the maggot-ridden piece of meat, there is a scene of the three sailors washing the dishes. One suddenly realises that the plate he is washing has the hypocritical inscription ""Give us this day our daily bread"". In the next four seconds a montage sequence of nine separate but overlapping shots shows the sailor smashes the plate twice, the first from his right and second from his left, emphasising the violence and angriness of the sailor's action. <br/><br/>In Act II there is a sequence of objects on the ship after the sailors under the tarpaulin kneel down. First the priest tapping his palm with his crucifix, then the lifebuoy with the words ""Prince Potemkin Tavrichesky"", then the ship prow with Czarist eagle, lastly a bugler with a bugle. This montage sequence is Eisenstein's expression of emotional time, which extends and suspends the time of thought of Vakulinchuk and the marine squad, and represents the feeling of the elongated fearful moment of the sailors.<br/><br/>The opening of Act III is the famous ""fog montage"" sequence. Here Eisenstein puts together a sequence of shots of various aspects of the habour just before dawn: sailing vessels, steamships, gull-covered buoy, surface of the sea, dockside cranes, Vakulinchuk's tent, etc.. The sequence is an example of ""tonal montage"", as Eisenstein suggested. Each shot in the sequence increases luminosity progressively as the sun rise and gradually disperses the fog. It depicts a long night has passed and finally the dawn has been broken, the death of Vakulinchuk has awaken the anger and support of mutiny against czarism.<br/><br/>Act IV is the famous ""The Odessa Steps"" that depicts a massacre of the citizens by czarist troops on the steps. The collisions of movements and dramatic graphic patterns in this sequence of shots bring audience huge psychological and emotional impact. The sequence begins with the intertitle ""Suddenly"", instantly followed by a few close up shots of the dark hair of a woman in white with her mouth open who moves so violently, abruptly shocks the audience. These close-up shots are followed by several shots with citizens run down the steps from left to right in a chaotic way. The source of terror is revealed in a following shot from the reverse angle, the top of the steps, showing a horizontal line of troops in white carrying riffles coming after the people on the steps. Another long shot from the bottom of the steps of people running down is inserted here.<br/><br/>Throughout the sequence there are several different figures are isolated, one of them is the woman who run with her son. As they are fleeing, her son falls and is trampled by the crowed and died. She gathers his body and walks up against the crowd from right to left across the screen towards the troops with her dead son in her arms. Meanwhile a woman in pince-nez decides to go up to the troops as well. All these individual actions are shown in shots in between shots of people running down the steps. Now two people are moving up, colliding with the direction of the crowd and the troops, while the disorganised and chaotic fashion of the citizens running downwards is colliding with the orderly descending line of troops coming from the top of the steps. <br/><br/>The most famous editing sequence in this act is around the young woman and her baby carriage. She is first shown afraid to push the carriage down the steps, then the troops march down and she is shot. Her falls is illustrated in several overlapping cuts. The montage returns to her every few seconds as she sinks lower to the ground. The successive shot is noticeably discontinue from the previous one, as her position is always more upright than her position at the end of the last shot. Her fall is stretched and repeated by editing. Eisenstein again replace the actual linear time with the emotional time, to emphasise the violent and disruptive action of the troops and the powerless and innocence (which is symbolised by the baby carriage) of the people in front of the audience.<br/><br/>As she falls to the ground she also loses control and protection power to her carriage and pushes it offscreen, down the steps. Then Eisenstein intercuts between the baby carriage rolling down the steps, the woman in pince-nez, the student with glasses and the crowd slashing by the Cossack at the bottom of the steps rapidly. Towards the end of the sequence the student screams as the carriage overturns, and without a clear ending for the carriage shown on screen it quickly cuts to a Cossack slashes his saber several times in discontinuous close shots, which then rapidly cut to a close up shot of the woman in pince- nez whose shattered glasses blood spurts from a slashed and blinded eye.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the famous three shots montage sequence of a sculptured stone lion. The brief sequence consist of three shots of separate stone lions all posed differently in different position: the first is asleep, the second is awakened, and the third is standing up. With the understand of the Kuleshov's effect, Eisenstein put together the shots to give an impression of a sleeping lion awakening and rising up, symbolising Russian people are awakened to fight against Czar."

Herr Graf personally witnessed how rude the Russian navy sailors can be if they are forced to eat rotten food ( they should have considered themselves lucky in comparison to this German count's servants who are nourished only on bread and water ) or how complicated it is to sail aboard an aristocratic yacht in the Russian seas because they are full of dangerous battleships , not to mention trying to walk about the Odessa streets, crowded with people who must be moved out of the way by the Tsarist soldiers in order to put order in those streets.<br/><br/>Times have changes since then, certainly, but there is something that it is intact, that maintains the same spirit in Odessa: the magnificent, the masterful, the great and superb film direction of Herr Sergei M. Eisenstein in ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"".<br/><br/>It is not necessary to say to much about this unique silent film masterpiece, a film than any longhaired youngster who wants to be irremediably captured by the power and fascination of silent films must-see ( and their elders revisit) because this oeuvre is a stunning film exercise .

","This movie, I must say, exceeded all my expectations that I had developed after reading and listening so much about it from critics and reviewers. I am once again very glad to have tried this silent era classic (other being 'Man with a Movie Camera' another gem). The movie is about the mutiny in the ship Potemkin that in turn grew and reached the lands and probably played some part in Russian Revolution. The movie may not be politically correct and some scenes may have got the facts wrong but nonetheless to watch it as a neutral viewer and cinema lover satisfies me to great extent.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the sailors protesting at having to eat rotten meat and then depicts the sailor's mutiny against the officers and in the process sailors leader gets killed. The leader body is then brought to the land (Odessa) where as the news spread of his bravery and the mutiny on the ship, huge crowd draws to pay their respect and mourn on his death. As the demonstration increase on the Odessa Steps, Tsar Soldiers massacre the crowd (apparently this is fiction) and then finally we see other forces (squadron) joining battleship sailors in their revolution. One of the finest and famous scenes in the movie is in the Odessa Steps when a child is killed by the soldiers and crowd runs all over him and then his mother holds her sons dead body and goes to the soldiers where even she is fired at and dies eventually. Other heart wrenching scene is when a child on a crib falls down the stairs after the baby's mother is killed. There are other scenes too which are really good and well handled both visual and emotion wise. Now I know why Eisenstein is regarded as one of the greatest directors of all time because of his revolutionary vision and work in Cinema.<br/><br/>I would rate this movie 9/10, the only reason being the movie kind of slips in the last 5 minutes or so where it succeeds in creating good tension between Battleship and Squadron but then it ends little too soon, I was little disappointed then and probably one or two more scene/detail on that would have been great. Other than that I would definitely call it ""One of the Great Masterpiece of Cinema"". <br/><br/>I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is interested in watching silent era movies."

"vovazhd","9","0","0","3 November 2007"," Perhaps the greatest silent film
","Battleship Potemkin is a silent film by Sergei Eisenstein. It gives a historically dramatized account of the battleship Potemkin, where the crew revolts against the captains. This is Soviet propaganda without a doubt, which gives it an interesting historical perspective. It mainly focuses on the importance of revolution, brutality of the Tsar, and individual expense for the greater good. All these strong themes make the film easy to focus on, even for modern audiences.<br/><br/>The acting is good, although not outstanding. The main captain, doctor, and priest make an infamous representation of cold leadership. The captains of the ship are contrasted with the crew by their black jacket. This makes it instantly recognizable which side is which. The placement of the people and actions is perfect. Its editing like this that makes it so easy to watch even though the film itself is old. The good planning carries out through the whole film.<br/><br/>The most impressive quality is the cinematography. The shots of the water, ship, and building structures are all meticulously done. A very effective image is shown early on, where the ships meat is crawling with maggots. The captain's refusal to provide adequate food for the crew reaches a climax when he plans to execute crew members that did not like the soup. This leads to the first impressive scene: the ships revolt. The action here is comparable with many modern action flicks. Later, the famous scene on the Odessa steps and the conclusion are also shown through phenomenal editing. It is very obvious that this quality is years ahead of its time. Few films are so technically great without the use of color and sound.<br/><br/>This might be the greatest silent film in existence. I have yet to see Metropolis, but have seen most other notable silent films. I found Battleship Potemkin to be the easiest to watch out of the bunch.

There is absolutely no character development. It is repetitive. You will see a couple of sailors climb up a ladder on the ship, and then see that same shot repeated four or five times. This occurs when the sailboats are going to meet the battleship, and when the battleship is entering the fleet. Throughout the whole film there are sections where nothing is happening, (like when the sailboats meet the battleship), and you will be listening to demented carnival music when the camera will cut to an old lady, or a seagull. This film is total crap. I actually felt physical pain sitting through this movie. This is the reason why people won't watch art films. But while art films are beautiful and make you think, this is propagandist drival, filled with symbolism that it would take fifteen autistic children to understand.

","This movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time...if you suffer from insomnia. It is a fool-proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. As the movie slowly progresses, the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain. This effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action/sweet babes.<br/><br/>Also, Mr. Eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage. A prime example of this is the scene on the Odessa steps. For no apparent reason, an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer. This editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film. Honestly, i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons.<br/><br/>Some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed Battleship Potemkin as: ""One of the greatest movies of all time"" and, ""Truly a masterpiece"". Well i'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. Surely what they meant to say was: ""One of the greatest snooze-fests of all time"" and, ""Truly an epic fail"".<br/><br/>In conclusion, don't waste your time.

"keith-moyes","7","2","5","7 February 2007"," A sense of proportion
","I don't want to be controversial just for the sake of it, but I have to ask if this really is the classic it is supposed to be.<br/><br/>It is often quite exciting in a purely visceral way and has some striking images and memorable sequences (the Odessa Steps being the most celebrated), but has little or no emotional depth and is rarely moving.<br/><br/>In essence it is a piece of fairly crude Communist propaganda, so its undoubted technical merits have to be seen in the light of what it was promoting. In 1925, the worst may still have been in the future but the Leninist wind had been sown and the Stalinist whirlwind was soon to be reaped. I feel as uncomfortable praising this movie as praising Leni Riefenstal's work.<br/><br/>As for its technical merits, have they not also been somewhat overblown? Of course, Eisenstein orchestrates images very well and any film company in the world at that time would have been happy to employ him. But as good as he was, there were many other film-makers doing similar things and sometimes doing them just as well.<br/><br/>If this movie has had any lasting influence on cinema (which is doubtful) it is probably on second unit directors, shooting crowd scenes and action sequences, rather than on other major artists. Some of the most striking moments (the famous lion statues, for example) were pure silent cinema and within a couple of years these 'innovations' were largely redundant.<br/><br/>The irony is that Eisenstein's own masterpiece, Ivan the Terrible, has far more in common with Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc than it does with this movie. Similarly, more recent Russian directors like Tarkovsky were more influenced by Ivan than by Battleship.<br/><br/>I suspect this picture was lionised chiefly by critics and cultural pundits who were only occasional movie-goers and who were once memorably described by Andrew Sarris as 'slummers from the other arts'. In short, people who had no real idea how movies were made and had seen very few of the other movies that were crucial benchmarks for a proper evaluation of this one. They credited Eisenstein with inventing what all half-decent movie-makers had routinely been doing for a decade.<br/><br/>Battleship Potemkin is undoubtedly of some historical interest, but it is not a great work of art (by a long stretch), it is not nearly as original or innovative as movie-illiterates have often claimed and its ultimate impact on the development of movie technique has been hugely overestimated.<br/><br/>This movie is certainly worth watching at least once or twice on its own merits. It won't disappoint.<br/><br/>But let us keep a sense of proportion, please!"

","Bronenosets Potyomkin/Battleship Potemkin(1925) was made to comemorate the twentifth anniversary of the Russian Rebellion of 1905.  It is the greatest silent film of all time as well as the greatest foreign film of all time. Its a political films with messages that support the idea of communism.  The story takes place after the defeat at the hands of the Japanese Navy during Russia's war with Japan.  The power of image takes place in this film espcially in the Odessa steps massacre.  The use of montage is surpurb and the acting is very good.  It contains one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema with the ""Odessa Steps massacre"".  It would be borrowed from De Palma for The Untouchables(1987), and parodied for The Naked Gun 33.3(1991).  It was recently restored after years of being cut due to the violent and sometimes bloody scenes depicted in the film.  This year marks the 75th Anniversary of the movie which is a reason to give this film special treatment to be released in the theatres as this is a movie that deserves it."

","The main question of the ""hero's"" morals starts in the beginning of the film. The main Russian who starts the mutiny, Vakulinchuk, is about to get shot in a firing squad for disobeying the captain. Then he says ""Brothers! Who are you firing on?"" as in, the Russian would kill another Russian. The firing squad disobey the captains firing orders and even stands in front of the firing squad while yelling ""Fire!"" (Genius, am I right?).
Then Vakulinchuk gets the sailors to attack their ""brothers"" then proceeds to yell from on top of a turret, ""Kill the monsters! Kill them!""""Kill them all!""
Maybe it's my western way of thinking, but he seems very hypocritical in his ways as he is killing his ""brothers"".

"politfilm","10","1","2","15 February 2019"," One of the most influential films of all time
","When the film was made in 1925, it quickly established a film editing as one of the key elements of film language and radically changed cinema. Indeed, when we're watching this film it's hard to believe that was shot in distant 1925. However, Battleship Potemkin should not be viewed as a museum artifact. Today, as almost one hundred years ago, it calls to revolt against oppression and oppressors, and its powerful propaganda message carries the energy of not only the past but also the future revolutions.<br/><br/>In 1918 Sergei Eisenstein left the studies of architecture and joined the Russian Revolution, where he became a revolutionary propagandist. Together with Dziga Vertov and others he developed a new cinematic language that went out to change the cinema forever. Eisenstein wanted to stir the emotions and inspire viewers of his short films, and in this way to put the new art, cinematography, in the service of the Revolution. By far the strongest and longest lasting effects achieved his feature films Strike, October and above all Battleship Potemkin which soon upon release inspired hundreds of thousands of viewers, among them hundreds of future film directors. Luis Buñuel said that this movie changed his life and decisively influenced his decision to become a film director.<br/><br/>Historically, sailors' mutiny on the imperial Russian military ship ""Potemkin"" of June 27, foretold the first, unsuccessful, Russian revolution that erupted in October 1905, and was crushed in December that same year.<br/><br/>During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/05 most of the sailors of the Black Sea fleet were transferred to the Pacific, leaving ships with mostly inexperienced recruits and less capable officers. In this situation, the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Organization of the Black Sea Fleet, called ""Tsentralka"" made a decision to start preparations for the simultaneous revolt on all ships of the Black Sea Fleet. The first rebellion erupted on ""Potemkin"", when on 27 June 1905, the deputy commander of the ship threatened to shot sailors who refused to eat maggoty meat. After a short struggle sailors took control of the ship and on the same evening sailed in Odessa flying a red flag.<br/><br/>Based on actual events."
"marcin_kukuczka","9","1","2","12 December 2010"," Where Nation Appears in Lead...
","While analyzing the historic directors and movies, one cannot ignore the important influence of the Russian productions. Although the films, for the new reality that came with 1917, were a powerful means of revolution propaganda, some productions can boast unique features that could not even be traced back in the Hollywood silent era. The name that constituted a milestone of that period in the Soviet Union was, undoubtedly, Sergei Eisenstein, the sort of ""Russian D.W. Griffith."" He is not only famous for having made movies concerning the distant history, like IVAN THE TERRIBLE or Alexander NEWSKY, but also for having directed the powerful pro-revolutionary production like this one, the silent movie that still overwhelms viewers in a unique way.<br/><br/>The most striking feature that BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN can boast are not the revolutionary ideas, which brought quite different things in later history, but the artistically innovative merits of the movie. Foremost, it refers to the use of camera and the stunning images that call viewers' attention in an unforgettable way. Here, there is a special need to mention the iconic moments presenting the inhabitants of Odessa and the powerful, still very dramatic depiction of the Odessa steps tragedy. The faces of the people, the whole tension, the camera close-ups of the growing terror in people's reactions and faces, the focus on fists and teary eyes are particularly believable. They still shock, they still depress, they still create a unique horror in the viewers' perceptions: you see a mother with a dying child, you see people who helplessly and vainly try to beg the robot-like army of slayers for mercy; you see the tramping boots that unemotionally move on and on and a perambulator with a baby sleighing down the steps after the mother has just been shot to death...I admit that this scene touched me most and left a lasting impact in my memory.<br/><br/>Another great merit and uniqueness of the film is the fact that it is not any vehicle for some important cast, it does not feature anybody eminent. On the contrary, it is a movie where a nation becomes a hero, where there are people who are at the focus. That makes it a true story of the 1905 uprising and perfectly crafts the developing wrath in equal brothers who struggle against the cruelty and ignorance of their commanders. In that respect, I do not hesitate to say that BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN does a better job than the American top notch production of later years, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY (surely, the intentions hidden behind are different in case of Eisenstein). It is really the people who fight together (in a propaganda way). There are no single stories, no emphasis on single events but a mutual aim...something very communist, on the one hand, but something that is beautifully executed thanks to Eisenstein's unique handling.<br/><br/>Consider, for instance the scene when the rotten meat is given to the sailors - the concrete reason for their radical ""no""...there is a wonderfully logical link with the later question of the commander: ""Who liked the soup?"" Immediately we see the faces of people, the growing rage and the revolutionary ideals brought into real actions. I believe this must have created a very powerful impact in the viewers of that time due to this masterful depiction. The film must have done a convincing job in promoting the new Russian reality. But my aim is not to evaluate difficult paths of history but merely see it as a cinema production, a silent production.<br/><br/>And in that respect, I say with honesty and certainty: WELL WORTH SEEING! No important content, no great stars nor terrific performances; yet a significant production of the silent era and a powerful IMAGE that will truly remain in your memory."
"thisissubtitledmovies","8","1","2","1 September 2010"," applicable to even today's world issues
","Like the other features in the box set, Battleship Potemkin opens with an epigraph by communist leader Joseph Stalin about revolution being the only justifiable war, the film's rebellious undertones and convictions of equality are immediately embedded from the get go. <br/><br/>Eisenstein's montages depicting the masses is a crown bejewelled with sparkling moments as the dust settles - only for this to be disturbed and gears changed to quick cut-away and repetitive shots to further elevate our own sympathy towards both the crowd and the sailors. The contrast of the sweeping and panning montages captures the true chaos and power of a crowd that produces feelings of claustrophobia, as well as a close bond towards the nameless faces we have come to recognise.<br/><br/>In a way, events that shaped the noughties, such as the war on terror and the conflicts arising in the middle east over the Taliban's restriction of human rights, contain themes, dilemmas and strife that make the film's core values applicable to even today's world issues, whatever an individual's beliefs."
"dromasca","8","1","2","11 August 2009"," a classic of its time
","What new can be said about a film that was commented by some of the most famous critics and was taken as inspiration by some of the most remarkable directors in the history of cinema? Even if one sees it for the first time it has good chances to recognize scenes or themes that were taken over by many other movies that followed.<br/><br/>The new version that was shown by the European cultural TV chain ARTE brings a few new elements beyond the reconditioning of the film. It has a new musical score which is very well fit to the rhythm and action building that Eisenstein mastered so well. It also features an odd color addition that aims to emphasize the red of the flag raised by the revolutionary on the crusader which was an idea that I liked less. Most important it includes a prologue written by Leon Trotsky which was part of the original version screened in the Soviet Union in 1925, but which was censored shortly after, as Trotsky fell into Stalin's disgrace and than flew Soviet Russia in exile.<br/><br/>Many scenes of the film keep their beauty and magic until today. The port of Odessa filmed in the morning fog by Eduard Tisse would be an impressionist masterpiece if it was a painting. The scenes of the shooting on the stairs or of the naval encounter in the final are exquisitely built and edited. Yet also the weak parts of the film are being made clear by the renovation and new screening - characters are stereotypes, and they serve a propaganda cause. For a viewer who has lived in the Communist system the political context and the background of the invented or deformed history put in the service of the enrolled messaging cannot escape.<br/><br/>Esthetically 'Potyomkin' is and will always be a masterpiece. The message it carries is clearly dated."

One of the more horrific shots, shows a elderly woman having her eye shot out, by the troops during the steps scene.<br/><br/>Sergi M.

These men were mistreated with plenty of cruelty involving whipping and beating by the senior officers. The Russian people heard about the horror that caused many men to die on this ship and the complete population decided to storm the officers of the Battleship in order to gain justice for the crimes caused on this ship.

Of course, this film has it's own agenda, but as it is a practically redundant cause, it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense.<br/><br/>The tension created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself, and then moving onto the mainland.

","What would Eisenstein do today!  His films still pack tremendous wallop even 65 years later.  Yes, the baby carriage falling down the steps and the bullet in the eye still impact today, but the most telling image is the lock-step soldiers with rifles and bayonets at the ready, treading forcefully down the steps is an even greater image! Eisenstein's films are masterworks of double entendre for just as he silently condemns the czarist authorities, the irony that he portrays is that the communists are just as guilty.  I believe that his films deliberately show this irony as his way of damning all authoritarian/totalitarian regimes, and he got away with this in the USSR by doing precisely this. The characters in his films are not first-rate actors, but the images and faces of these characters are startling in their realism.  Watch the monk playing the organ in ""Alexander Nevsky"" and you'll see what I mean. What a face!  And Eisenstein...what an artist of the first rank!"

","It's pretty hard to pull off any story no matter what the medium it is being told in. But Battleship Potemkin completely fails at this attempt. So I would suggest you go spend your time watching some other more interesting black and white movie that is more interesting and more historically accurate than this poor excuse of a movie.<br/><br/>The camera angles are not so bad. But If you have great aesthetics but no creative content to keep the audience lost in your story then all of it goes to waist. Obviously the makers of this movie were not worried about this. They just wanted to make a statement against something something they didn't approve of but they didn't do a very good job of it.<br/><br/>You could tell they put forth a good amount of effort into this movie with all the extras and the props. This all of course didn't pay off in the long run. They ended up just making an expensive movie that had no lasting effect. I think the only reason I saw it in my film history class is because it is a Russian movie and he wanted us to see an example of something that wasn't completely controlled by the government when it was produced. Which is good because i wouldn't want to watch over an hour of that brainwashing communist crap. The thing is that they were trying to hard to make this elaborate movie that they put no depth into it. I literally sat there at the end of the movie saying, ""Oooooookaaaaaay? Why did I just watch that?""<br/><br/>The music was okay but nothing I would oggle over. I found this movie so bad that it was slightly humorous. But I don't think it was the director's purpose to be funny. This film was a fail so just pass it up and look for something more informative or entertaining which would be just about anything."

The battleship open fire against the Tsarist forces and then sail to face the fleet. The other ships refuse to fire and join in the revolution.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is well-made. The story is simple. It does need a protagonist to break a POV but this is very much a communist film. It's about the people and about the amazing tracking shots on the steps.

","This film was about a revolt on a ship that was started because the commanders were not concerned with the midshipmen. The commanders were overworking them and also not feeding them properly and that became a recipe for disaster. The movie reminded me of a grassroots uprising. It was about the little man gaining the respect that he rightfully deserved and finally standing up to the people in charge.<br/><br/>While the midshipmen were on the boat they were constantly treated wrong and then they finally decided to turn on the commanders. This on sea revolt is heard about on land and causes a stir and the people start a revolt on land. The revolt did not go as well for the people on land though, it turned into a massacre. Many of these people that revolted were running down the stairs as they were shot in the back by the infantry of government. I believe this was symbolism of what was going on with the Russian Revolution and how the people have to stand up for themselves and become heroes. This film allows the people who should and would normally be viewed as villains to be viewed as the heroes. This film was one of the better propaganda films of the 20th century. The editing of this movie that I see is the switch between the ship and the stair scene. That makes you think about the revolution on the sea and the contrast between the revolutions on the ship. I think the director did a great job with this film contrasting the views of both on shore and off shore revolts, really made me think. I also believe that this film was very successful because it was something that many people could relate too. In some way I believe that all people feel like someone is holding them down or trying to oppress them and that people who watched or heard about this film could relate to that"

Different angles of one single action also added to the film. The shot of the soldier falling and landing on the metal piece of the ship hanging from the ropes was breath taking. I felt the anger that the soldiers felt when the leader of the uprising died in such a heroic way. The death of the soldier inspired a future of the country under united peoples. The theme is expressed with the repetition of the word ""Brother"" throughout the parts of the film. The message of hatred for hierarchy was portrayed with the montage of clips of actions in the movie. The movie was portrayed well for the silent movie. I liked sense on unity in the movie. The German montage moment was focused more on the group rather than the individual. Einstein used the death of the officer to unite the people against a common foe. Part five, the final battle, was the worst part in the film. The preparation for the battle took ten minutes. The men prepared the cannons and loaded everything for a pointless battle. The music was edging the audience on and getting them hyped up for a disappointment. ""Brother?"" Really? It was a joke. I was hyped for the battle scene and was completely disappointed with the ending. I wanted to see blood and gore and I got people cheering. Those people on the stairs died for nothing.

"finchy9-976-77969","5","1","3","13 February 2011"," The Battleship Potemkin
","In The Battleship Potemkin made by Sergei Eisenstein, he uses a form of film editing called Russian montage, which combines a lot of different shots shot in different settings and edits them to tell multiple stories at one time. It can also show different perspectives of different people at the same point in time so that the viewer is aware of the different effects that that certain event has on the different types of people experiencing it. This is the main reason why this film is so effective. And it has influenced many films up to this point such as, 2001: A Space Odyssey which starts at the beginning of mankind and jumps to a time far in the future. But this film presents a dramatized version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their officers of the Tsarist regime. And the most interesting thing about this film is the organization of the shots. If Eisenstein would have reorganized these shots any other way he could have told a completely different story. But that's the beauty of the montage film editing, it allows the editors to bring the ""invisible art"" to life. It allows them to be the true artists and storytellers that editors can be."
"CoolReviewBro","6","1","3","3 February 2011"," ALL HANDS ON DECK - the borscht's gone bad
","While Battleship Potemkin is considered Soviet propaganda, the modern, westernized film viewer is unlikely to be so motivated by this film that they would consider taking up arms against our contemporary capitalist structures. However, the viewer will definitely experience a sense of compassion for the crewmen and the village people massacred at the hands of the ruthless Cossacks. In this regard, the film is highly efficient propaganda despite its revisionist take on the first failed revolution and the arguably larger ideological failures of Communism.<br/><br/>Eisenstien in this film uses vivid imagery and creative editing in line with the ""montage"" style of film making prevalent during the time of the film's production. Eisenstein's method of film making indeed elicits an intellectually engaging film experience that calls the viewer to question, sympathize with, and appreciate the crew-members' and peoples' political consciousness. By making the ""masses"" as the film's protagonist, the viewer will gain considerable insight into the collective mentality so pivotal to Communist ideology. One instance of this was the part where a random man in the film seems to mock the crowd's reverence for the fallen revolutionary seamen and their inspiration to fight back. ""Crush the Jews"" the man says, only to be crushed himself by the motivated crowd hell-bent on finishing what their revered comrade started (and unwilling to give in to tangential and irrelevant anti-Semitism). Indeed, the idea of the ""masses"" and ""revolution"" in this film seems to take on a climatic ""snowballing"" effect starting with the crew-members' meat inspired mutiny, spreading to the common workers in the street, and culminating with the solidarity with the Admiral's fleet.<br/><br/>While the viewer will indeed see the collective nature of the film, they will also see the ""us versus them"" mentality elicited by the film's antagonists (be it the naval officers or the ruthless Cossacks). All in all, the film is a piece of history that should be viewed and respected at a distance. If one is seeking greater insight into the Communist ideology and the implementation of propaganda, then this film is highly recommended."

The Odessa Steps sequence in which the boy is shot and trampled and his mother picks him up and carries him towards the Cossacks is an object lesson in how to cut a scene for maximum dramatic impact. It's hard I find to watch films as old as this and imagine what cinema was like in those days, when we live in an age where computers can airbrush the crow's feet from an actress' face. But the technical achievement of this film alone is immense, not even considering its artistic merit or propaganda value. When I see quite a lot of modern films which are very poorly or lazily edited (a recent example is The Invasion), directors really need to study the basics. Cinema is an art, but it is also fundamentally a technical craft which must be learned and continually re-appraised. Eisenstein's talent in creating this picture eighty-six years ago shines down that gulf of time and reminds us what good storytelling in movies is all about. All the more remarkable to me is that he was only twenty-seven when he made it - notably the same age as Spielberg when he made Jaws. Many directors have inserted references to it in their work (often the iconic baby-carriage image) - one I've always wondered about is the shot of Luke Skywalker dangling helplessly from the mast at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, which looks eerily similar to the shot of the wounded Vakulinchuk dangling from the hook at the end of the Drama On The Deck section. Purists please note - this movie exists in quite a few different versions with different scores and has been restored several times (notably a re-release in 2004); this review is of the 1976 print supervised by Sergei Youtkevitch. Even if you don't like silent movies, there are five I'd really recommend you should see - The General, The Lodger, Metropolis, Nosferatu and this film. English title - Battleship Potemkin."

","The Battleship Potemkin begins headed to Odessa in 1905. Aboard are many sailors returning from the war with Japan. Each scene is titled, and the first one is called ""Part 1: Men and Maggots"". This is a perfect title because it shows the men who look a little bit worn out, and then the food they are about to eat. It is a large piece of meat hanging in the dining hall with no refrigeration. The camera gets an up close shot to reveal that there are maggots crawling all over the piece of meat. This disgusts the sailors, but the doctor insists it is okay and nothing to worry about. The sailors disapprove and decide to rebel. This caused the officers (who were very well taken care of) to attempt to execute the sailors that had caused trouble. They were about to fire when a sailor named Vakulinchuk speaks up. He gives a motivational talk and asks everybody on board whose side they were on. As they lower their guns, an officer grabs it to try to fire, but this only caused chaos to break out. The only person that ended up getting shot was Vakulinchuk. Once they become docked and anchored at Odessa, the townspeople come out to give honor to Vakulinchuk. The shot shows streams of people and it seems never ending. This invokes a feeling of togetherness and pride. During this, a group of Czar soldiers appear and start firing on the crowd, including children, women, and the elderly. The sailors realize that this was going to turn into a bigger fight and turn the ship around to face opposing ships head-on. Once they get closer though, they realize it is fellow sailors. This film has some historical facts in it, and proves to be one of the great films of its time."

","Sergei Eisenstein's ""The Battleship Potemkin"" is one of the most important works in film history. Set in 1905 it tells of a mutiny aboard a Russian naval vessel. It is very obviously propaganda but it has a genuine power, which can partly be due to Eisenstein's theories on film editing (or ""montage"") and partly due to the mastery with which the large cast is directed. <br/><br/>The most startling sequence is the justifiably famous Odessa Steps massacre sequence, which has been referenced many times since. Here, if nowhere else in the film we see a master film-maker on top form. <br/><br/>Admittedly the film is often slow at times at the story-line is quite simplistic, as I said earlier the film is propaganda.

"jboothmillard","8","1","6","26 January 2012"," Battleship Potemkin
","From director Sergei M. Eisenstein (Strike, Ivan the Terrible Parts 1 and 2), I had heard about this Russian documentary style silent film, and obviously it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I had to watch it. Basically, set in 1905, we see the sailors on the battleship Potemkin protesting against having to eat meat that is rotten, and it eventually turns into rough mutiny, in which the leader Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) is killed. There is a big mourning for the commanding officer by the Odessa people, and not long after Tsarist soldiers show up to massacre the people on the Potemkin Stairs, i.e. the Odessa Staircase, many innocents including children and parents are killed. The final scene (of five) sees a squadron cheering on the rebellious Potemkin battleship instead of carrying out their mission to stop and engage it, and they wave their flags of friendship and brotherhood before parting ways. The most famous scene of the film is of course the staircase sequence, including the moment with the mother with glasses screaming with blood in her eye and down her face watching her child die in the massacre, and the famous moment of the baby in the pram going down the stairs, a moment recreated in films like The Untouchables. I will admit I did not understand the story all the way through, and this was not just because of the lack of sound, and this is only a fictionalised version of the 1905 Revolution, but for the iconic imagery and small gripping sequences it is a rather essential classic silent history drama. Very good!"

","Some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the steps in the ""Odessa staircase"" sequence. These men are not Cossacks but regular army troops.<br/><br/>The Cossacks arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men on horses slashing at the crowd with their sabers.<br/><br/>To experts on Russian history: Correct me on this if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>But there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently no one has commented on. After the takeover of the Potemkin, someone in the crowd on shore says, ""Kill the Jews!"" This is on screen for only a couple of seconds but it is there.<br/><br/>How cruelly typical of history, not just in Russia but in so many other countries, to immediately, unthinkingly and instinctively blame Jews for any domestic trouble!<br/><br/>Perhaps other parts of the movie are not historically factual but the outcry against the Jews is all too real. Comments, anyone?<br/><br/>Also, why can't speakers of English learn to pronounce the name as ""Potyomkin"" instead of as ""Potemkin""? There's a need in Russian to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of ""e"": as either ""ye"" or as ""yo."" Sometimes two dots are used to distinguish these two pronunciations but usually the difference simply has to be memorized."

","***spoiler alert*** Battleship Potemkin, directed by Sergi Eisenstein is a very powerful silent movie. The movie showcases man rising up against authority. This film has many props, and close ups that allow the audience to get emotionally involved. Many of these close-ups are disturbing and almost give the feeling like parts of this movie should be in a horror film. The director captures the coldness and machinery feeling of the battleship with other close-ups of the props. For example, the everyday routine of the semen is show cased and also read out in the card inputs. In addition, this film also showcases authority figures overseeing the semen and attempting to control their emotions and outburst. After a revolt, this movie continues to build on suspense showcasing the machinery of the boat with workers on deck along with a very serious and suspenseful score. Although, this film contains action and suspense it does have many slow points almost making this film dreadful to watch for the impatient. There are many scenes in particular that could be shortened such as the machinery scenes and the scene of morning for a lost comrade. However, there are many scenes that capture an immense amount of emotion from the audience. The assault on the public is almost too much to watch, and shows many acts of murder. Mostly gruesome and heart wrenching acts of violence are filmed while showing the slaughtering of the public. Making this movie one that an audience roots for the underdog to overtake the town and authority figures. Towards the end, the suspense is so intense that it is a seat clinching unavoidable hope for the town and its people. This movie is overall good, but does include many slow parts that almost make it a sleeper. I would recommend seeing this movie at least once as it does contain a very powerful message to the viewer."
"ljcjpjlj","7","1","7","17 February 2007"," Old propaganda
","I love battleships and all the stories about them. This film is hard to watch. Yes, Eisenstein made great filmatic beauty, lo these many years ago, with his play of the camera and his directorship. But it is hard to watch nevertheless, in light of the history that has passed in the 102 years since the events portrayed in the film, and in the 82 years since the film was first released, and in the 18 years since the final fall of the Soviet communist dictatorship that killed so many millions in Russia and in the territories that the Soviet Union dominated for so long. This is not to mention, of course, the nazi-fascist response to communism that killed so many millions more. No mention of this famous, much acclaimed, and truly artistic film can go without a mention of the millions who died as a consequence of the events portrayed here and which in 1917 began and continued for the next six decades until this brutal regime was finally put to rest by the efforts of the United States of American under the leadership of President Ronald Reagan. The scene with the peoples' sailing craft going to the famous Battleship Potemkin is beautifully dramatic, though little do they know the fate that awaits them. The famous and horrifying Odessa steps sequence, one of the most momentous and prescient cinematic displays in moviedom, portrays not only the response to the communist revolution but the communist revolution itself when viewed in the clearer air of the 21st century. Sad as it was that these hundreds were murdered by the ""White Russian"" soldiers, it pales to white in comparison to the millions killed by the ""Red Russians"" of the ""revolution"". The Odessa steps sequence, complete with the baby carriage and baby rolling down the steps is emblematic now not only of the horror of the Imperial Russian reaction to the ""revolution"" but of the effect of the ""revolution"" itself. The Battleship Potemkin for all of its supposed greatness, and Eisenstein's artistic genius, is merely another piece of propaganda for the murder and genocide for which the communist ""revolution"" and its evil spawn the nazi ""revolution"" were to use to compete with one another in the following decades. The Battleship Potemkin's ready accessibility to the gullible collegians of the 60's and 70's, was just another glorified piece of communist propaganda, so popular then, that has been enshrined into our present age as something we should treasure. Rather, in light of the millions and millions who have suffered and died as a consequence of communism and fascism, this film should be relegated to the ash heap of history along with the works of Mao, Hitler and Marx as mere curiosities, to be studied for what they are, aberrations in the progress of mankind."

","Eisenstein truly is a master of timeless visuals, greatly combining movement and stillness in his work. He uses both close-ups and long distance shots, quick cuts and long shots, the pacing is also great - the movie has a sort of a rhytm which lets you wonder but not long enough for you to get bored. It flows like water which often connects the still and the moving objects depicted.

"kristjanbuckingham","10","0","2","8 November 2019"," The Hauntingly Familiar Battleship Potemkin
","The screen has been used to showcase the brutal realities of war since the dawn of the medium, and Battleship Potemkin, directed by Sergei Eisenstein is one of the earliest examples, dating back to 1925. While grounded in realism, there are several stylistic elements that help to emphasize the emotions, utilizing the surreal to accentuate the reality of the events depicted.
Those events include the unease and revolt against the commanders of the ship, ultimately leading to the death of one the sailors ""over a spoonful of borscht!"" When the man's body is left in Odessa and news of the events reach the townspeople, crowds become frantic, drawing a military response. The governmental show of force by a government against its own people is depicted in a way that is eerily similar to the footage of the protests happening in Hong Kong today. Based on true events that took place in 1905, Battleship Potemkin depicts the mutiny of a Russian ship told over five acts.
For a silent film, it's incredible how much influence the sound design had on the tone. The orchestral compositions were well-timed and served well as the emotional guide, but impressively went beyond score to act as sound effects as well. As disorder ensues, a man steps on a piano, the sound breaking into the soundtrack, the fires a gunshot which is also audible. Shortly after, symbols crash as the men fall overboard and splash into the ocean. These ""real-life"" sounds are used sparingly and only during the height of the action, adding to the thrill of the chaos.
Another effective sound device is the impending doom of the ticking clock, gradually accelerating as the tension builds in the final act, the battleship hurtling toward certain disaster. This technique is still being used to great effect in modern war films, such as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk (2017), released nearly one hundred years later.
Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) and Frank Miller's Sin City (2005) also both iconically used a special effect that worked extremely well in Battleship Potemkin: the single colour in an otherwise black-and-white movie. Eisenstein, of course did not have the same technology available to him at the time, so the director hand-painted each frame himself in order to get the flag to appear red. Impossible to miss and eye-catching to say the least, one can only imagine how incredible the effect must have appeared at the original time of release.
Battleship Potemkin covers the full range of what a good war film should be and manages to achieve that in such a way that modern films aspire to match, inspiring rage and hope in equal measure, and allowing the audience an outlet to come to terms and cope with the atrocities of war."
"iquine","8","0","2","8 October 2019"," Overall Film Better Than The Famous Scene
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>For its time, this film is an editing masterpiece. It was a pioneer in stitching together and juxtaposing different scenes to generate strong emotional tension. Many scenes have quick back and forth edits as well as some noticeable and challenging tracking shots which were novel for this era. That combined with a great music score and dynamic shot framing with rich blacks and whites also make this very appealing to the senses. The film jumps right into regular sailors, on Battleship Potemkin, who are angered by the poor living conditions and the rotting food they are forced to eat as the officers don't respect them. A large and dramatic scuffle/mutiny ensues after the captain's dramatic threat. A sailor is killed and word spreads to the local town of Odessa who are outraged and come in droves to the port where the ship is located. This being a true story, what happens next is truly shocking. What happens on the steps of Odessa? Aside from the technically significant and memorable sequence referenced in film textbooks and film classes, even by today's standards the pacing and drama is still engrossing."
"Screen_O_Genic","8","0","1","29 August 2019"," Propaganda Made Watchable
","Based on the 1905 mutiny on the ship bearing the title's name, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is an energetic and highly active account of the uprising and the events that followed. Featuring the events inside the ship which led to the rebellion and what transpired with the crew afterwards the film is one moving narrative of constant action highlighted by the brisk herky-jerky motion of cinema during the time. A taut and bracing script, constantly functioning machinery, humanity in motion - the movie stirs to bigger life in the famous Odessa steps scene where one can still feel the tension and chill of the tragedy as it unfolds. Ironically, with all the activities mentioned the film is snagged by slow parts throughout which highlights the movies lack of depth and shows that a movie has to have more than action to leave a truly profound impact. Famed director Sergei Eisenstein's most well known flick and one of the more successful propaganda efforts made, this overrated product of its time is still one of the more watchable silents to hold up well."

","Of course it is still impressing after almost a hundred years, for its amazing sense of details, its tremendously dramatic impact, its highly strung pathos and its wonderful cinematography all through, but still there is room for some objections. It can't be helped, but it is tendentious, it glories in Soviet nationalism with the individual being effaced in the movement of the masses, it even says so in the text, and it is somewhat hysterical in its constant muddle of crowds amassing and running together in fanatic frenzy, which reminds me of the fanatic Christians massing together to massacre the poor Hypatia in the Agora film. It's a film about crowds for the masses, where individualism is completely run over and abolished, which it can't be for human reasons. It's a great film but with tendencies that must bring misgivings, as a prelude to the age of totalitarianism under Stalin and others."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","0","2","24 April 2019"," Hardly a silent film classic in my opinion
","""Bronenosets Potemkin"" is a Russian (or I should say Soviet) black-and-white silent film from 1925, so this one is not too far away anymore from its 100th anniversary. The director is Sergei M. Eisenstein and this is a relatively early filmmaking effort as he was considerably under 30 years at that point still. But nonetheless, this movie is generally considered one of his career-defining efforts, maybe even the number 1. The writer is Nina Agadzhanova, older than Eisenstein, but also still relatively young and this was her first film writing effort (according to imdb) of sadly not too many. It is a fairly short movie. There are several versions out there and the one I watched ran for under 70 minutes, so i think this was the DVD version. In any case, I got the chance to watch this film on a special screening in a movie theater that belonged to a museum here in Berlin. But why not. It says here on imdb this film is still winning awards in the 21st century, so why not show it. I don't want to comment too much on the cast here, actually not at all. I have no idea who these actors are and neither have I heard their names nor remembered them from other films. Maybe Russian film historians know some of them, but these are probably almost the only ones. Props if you do. Then again, this film is really the complete opposite of a movie defined by its actors. Sctually, it feels almost impossible to identify the actors again and keep up-to-date on who is who character-wise. And this is not a given, not even for films from the 1920s. A true weakness. Instead, it is all about the story and beyond that, about the historical event it elaborates on. This would be the Russian Revolution of 1905. You already see from my rating that I did not appreciate the film too much and maybe this is also partially due to personal and entirely subjective preferences as honestly my real interest in 20th century political history does not start before the 1930s, maybe slightly 1914-1918, but not 19005 unfortunately. Then again, you could also take the other perspective and say this film was not good enough to make me interested in this really tumultous era in the Soviet union back then.<br/><br/>With the title, of course a great deal of the film, almost the entire movie takes place on the battleship referenced in the title with the name Potemkin and what crucial role it played back then. The film is divided into several acts, some rather dramatic, others fairly slow, almost soothing (at least partially). It basically says it all that the one I liked the most took place not on the ship, but on land when the impact of a Kosak attack was depicted and a woman relentlessly fighting for the life of a child while many many rifles are pulled and people killed. But everything before that act/chapter left me mostly unimpressed. I try to ignore the music as of course it was added much later and in my opinion should not be considered when rating and revieweing a movie. The original silent version counts in this case. Still, there was one fairly funny moment involving drums. I will not say what they emphasized at that point to avoid spoilers, but yeah that was the only audible moment that stays memorable for me. And finally, at the end of my review, I would also like to say a few words about the end of the movie. It was surprisingly happy and positive. Honestly I did not see that coming at all. Happy ending were not a rarity back then in silent films, but frequently the ywent with pain and unhappiness, certainly more often than today, so I was definitely surprised. I must say I also liked the soundtrack that really made the watch better there. But enough about the music now. Overall, this film did not leave a lasting impression whatsoever and I am 99,9% sure I will never watch this one again. It's nowhere near the level of (what I consider) the classics of the silent film era. So my suggestion is here to skip the watch and I give it a thumbs-down. Another reason for that would be a common problem from silent films from all continents really: the lack in terms of quantity when it comes to intertitles. We see people talk on several occasions here. We have no idea what they are saying. Another negative deal breaker. Watch something else instead."

"TheMovieDoctorful","10","0","1","12 November 2018"," Possibly The Greatest Movie Of All Time
","Subjective opinions and personal value aside, Battleship Potemkin (Along with Leaving Las Vegas and Casablanca) is what I consider to be the greatest movie of all time and the closest example in the art of filmmaking to perfection. Eisenstein's appreciation for film as a visual medium, his visionary and creative means of using aesthetics rather than words to tell stories, convey themes and invest you in his narratives, is unparalleled by any filmmaker living or dead. Battleship Potekmin is his magnum opus, the crowning achievement of his career and the conclusive legitimization of filmmaking as a true artform beyond mere entertainment.<br/><br/>One of my favorite (And often most unsung) aspects of Eisensein's filmography is his talent for casting as a silent director. Despite not turning to professional actors (Or, alternatively, possibly because of it in part), Eisenstein has assembled an unforgettable cast of striking, memorable faces. From ghoulish, hysterical religious zealots to mustached, kind faced supermen, the performers who Eisenstein has chosen for their respective roles fully embody the themes and emotions of the characters they play on screen. No individual is the hero, no one man is made the star; success and emotional triumph depend entirely on cooperation of the collective of good men and women. It's not merely the themes of the film that represent Leftist values, it's the structure of the character development and the filmmaking itself.<br/><br/>Much has been spoken of Battleship Potemkin's radical use of montage to magnify the emotional power of its scenes. In my opinion, not nearly enough has been said. His framing of national tragedies through the eyes of the populous, the eyes of a collective, completely forces his audience from the role of bystander to active and compliant participant to the events of the film. This is what filmmaking is all about; sucking us into the world of your movie, sharing the importance of your thematic material through genuine empathy rather than listening to the hollow, recited words of cardboard cutouts telling us how to feel. Battleship Potemkin is one of the most singularly investing films I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing despite dialogue that may as well be absent from the picture entirely. Furthermore, Eisenstein's use of montage on its own is already a breathtaking and revolutionary filmmaking technique, but interweaving it with the themes of societal importance of the collective is a stroke of genius. Through this narrative decision, Sergei speaks to how the journeys and arcs of societies and communities themselves, not individuals, are what shape history. These are the narratives that benefit our world culture's the greatest, that show the legitimacy and importance of filmmaking to shaping the ideals and values of not just cult followings or a general ""film buff"" consensus, but entire nations.<br/><br/>Compared to its contemporaries released around the same time, Battleship Potemkin is a shockingly violent and brutal film. From the brutal murder of a protective and sheltering mother to the slaughtering of innocent civilians by mass to the abandonment (And possible death) of an innocent baby, Potemkin is a far cry from the ""bread and circus"" criticisms that could apply to many films of the era. This is brutal, harsh and dark filmmaking, but without any of the misplaced and childish ""nihilism"" displayed from ""artists"" in the filmmaking industry of future years. Unlike his unsuccessful imitators, Eisenstein uses violence out of a place of personal concern and dread. There is nothing artistic or stylized about his depiction, it's as mean and blunt and to the point as possible. Most of the best scenes of violence in film come from a place of rage, a place of impassioned and challenged personal ethics; every act of violence in Battleship Potemkin is treated for the tragedy it is, never forgetting the all-too important human element behind it. The images of helpless and vulnerable civilians futilely begging for their lives to hordes of Czarist Police, the shot of a woman's face being frozen in Horror as everything she ever was, everything she ever will be, ends at the sword of a corrupt soldier, are images of anger. Images that incite passion and fury. Eisenstein understood the power of violence in movies and uses it masterfully in Potemkin, with very minimal dialogue no less. Other smaller scenes like the monocle of the ship's surgeon (The very one used to unscrupulously validate the ethicacy of feeding sailors rotten and spoiled meat) dangling from the rigging after being tossed off of the boat, shots like the symbolic ""shooting of the lion"" representing the fall of lazy, unethical and monstrous tyrants, are just as staying in my memory as the infamous Odessa Steps for which the film is so heavily praised for.<br/><br/>It's not merely the images of brutal violence that give poignancy to the visual storytelling of Potemkin. The beginning imagery of a plate breaking with the words ""Give Us Your Daily Bread"" printed on it, as well as the synchronized swinging of the sailors hammocks with that of the galleys chains are wonderful and intensely subtle examples of foreshadowing that are a prime example of ""show, don't tell"" storytelling. (Take note, Michael Daugherty and Danny McBride)<br/><br/>Battleship Potemkin is a treasure. It is a triumph. It may very well be the best film of all time and anyone with a passion for the visual nature of storytelling, let alone film, owes it to themselves to watch it at least once. You're welcome in advance."

But just as the duplicitous honchos of Ronnie ""The Gypper"" Reagan's American Administration declared maggots to be suitable condiments for the USA's public school lunch population, POTEMKIN director Sergei Eisenstein accurately depicts these Death Worms as an impending staple of the Red Commie Oligarchical Fat Cat Paradise. While Putin and his fellow Trillionaires chow down on cake and caviar, Russia's 99 Per Centers are reduced to a POTEMKIN-like diet of ""borscht"" (aka, maggot stew).

","I've been waiting for a long time to see this so famous picture, even a silent movie that isn't my favorite kind, this picture is just communist propaganda unfortunately, has some impressive part as when they see the ghosts in the vessel's mast prior, they'll be (not) shooting, a fantastic scene when the leader was shot and felt in the ropes and finally the great sequence of the stairs of Odessa with strong suspense and horror, however the movie is about raising, revolution of the people, it's really happened in Russia and become a super state as URSS and this political system dropped many decades later, that's a message, why the communist didn't work out, to me the answers is simply, the men aren't mentally ready for such human endeavor to reach at the point, so Sergei Eisenstein was involved by Reds leadership to put this on screen, apart from that the movie is good piece for study of cinema only, masterpiece from this time is Metropolis!!!"

","A lot of people note that director Sergei Eisenstein was ahead of his time with his 'film montage' technique, used so effectively in the massacre scene on the steps of Odessa, but it should also be noted that he captures brilliant images throughout this movie. It's certainly worth watching as a result, and is probably a must for students of film. However, what undoubtedly stirred emotions in 1925 – possibly sympathy for the communist movement, or fear of inciting revolutionary thoughts given the mutiny that takes place on the Potemkin, or squeamishness at the moments of violence (all of which contributed to the film being banned in many countries, including the Soviet Union!) – is less impactful ninety years later. It also suffers for being a propaganda film, with less nuance in its characters and plot."

","A dramatized account of a great Russian naval mutiny and a resulting street demonstration which brought on a police massacre.<br/><br/>What can I say about this film? It has earned the rare 10 out of 10 from me. I have now rated over 1600 movies, and maybe five have earned a ten. That puts this film in an elite group, in the top 0.5% It is beautiful, and I have to thank the good people at Kino for that. They keep taking old films and making them like new. Every film they have restored has impressed me. This one even more so... it may be Soviet propaganda, but it is glorious propaganda (and allegedly Charlie Chaplin's favorite film).<br/><br/>Oddly, Ivan Butler wrote about this film in his history of horror book. This is not a horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but he mentions it for the ""macabre"" moments. An old woman whose eye is shot out, meat that is crawling with maggots (beating Lucio Fulci by many decades). It is real in its disturbing nature, which means something by 1920s standards.<br/><br/>Where does this fit in the history of cinema? It is the odd one out. Germany had some great silent films, as did America. We rarely hear of Russia in this context, and no Russian director is a household name like Buster Keaton or Fritz Lang. But ""Potemkin"" is that rare film that defied the bigger film industries of Hollywood and Ufa... and may be the greatest silent film ever made."
"kbunck","4","0","11","7 February 2011"," Communism
","So let's talk about the communist over tones in this film. The red flag that they hoist is only the most obvious so I believe I'll just skip that one. All right now communism has a few basic tenants that are shown in this movie. One of which is that the whole is more important than the individual. Now this is shown throughout the movie as rarely is a character named, in fact only a few characters in the entire movie are given names. Later when the dead sailor is laid out and almost all the people in the city walk past it may seem that they are paying undue respect to one person (going against communism), but I choose to interpret it as the dead sailor being a part if the whole (the whole being the people of Russia) and they are honoring him because they all feel his lose, because under the communist principle he's a part of all of them. Continuing communists don't pay much mind to religion, I forget why but I do remember that religion and communism don't really mix. This is shown in the film, first as the representation of Christianity, a priest on the ship is played by a man who basically looks like a hobo. We know from this time period in Russian directors would choose common people who looked the part to play the character. The fact that they chose and unkempt, unclean, man to play a man of god speaks to what they imagined a priest would look like. Later as one person suggests that they attack the Jew, the reaction of the other Russians (looks of surprise, and disgust) show their thoughts of religious squabbles. The current government is shown as a, too powerful entity that needs to be gotten rid of as the soldiers kill defenseless people and the sailors overthrow the captain and attack the other ships. It seems that the rest of the Russian agree with this because the other battleships eventually join in the rebellion."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","0","1","27 August 2008"," A corner stone of cinematographic art but too romantic a story
","EISENSTEIN  POTEMKINE Ir is a technical masterpiece. Eisenstein managed to do with the camera he had at the time things that no one else managed to even come close to. That's why this film must be watched and studied. The subject is romantic and it was done as pure propaganda, and the later Soviet period could not resist adding some good old narrow-minded commentary. But the film has some scenes that are so well done that we are wondering how it was possible. The baby perambulator going down the hundreds of steps in that staircase leading to the harbor is phenomenal. The way the actors are able to express thousands of emotions with no words, just body and face language is admirable. If you want to understand how humanity can see its future in a lighter color than the dark grey of today, Eisenstein is the man to demonstrate that creativity has no limits, no borders and that for these imaginative minds the sky and only the sky is the limit. But I have completely lost any sympathy for the romanticism of life and the world. No matter what we do there will always be some violence in human society and there are so many forms of violence that we can't even enumerate them all. Just ask the Ossetes who speak an Indo-Ruropean language and were called descendants of Iranians by some French paper lately: actually all Indo-European people and languages are descendants of the Indo-Iranian languages. So what? But to use that affiliation for the Ossetes right now and after the Russians have accepted their pledge for independence is an attempt to make them look like fanatics. That is violence. That is absurd. And compare the Ossetes and the Tibetans and then you see the difference in treatment. That is violence too. But that kind of violence is considered normal by the west.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","after viewing this film,i'm amazed at how much the director Sergei Eisenstein was able to get away with.many of the scenes must have been thought of as too brutal for audiences,and also as depicting the army in a negative lite.it depicts a revolution by the sailors on the battleship Potemkin in 1905,which spread beyond the ship to the street.there are some pretty impactful scenes in the movie,particularly during the demonstration in the street..i'm not a history buff,but i think the event actually did take place.this is silent film,so it's not for everyone.this is my 2nd viewing of the movie,the the first was over 10 years ago in a film studies class.i plan on watching it again soon.for me,the movie is well worth watching if you a classic film buff"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","2","9 April 2008"," Battleship Potemkin
","Battleship Potemkin, The (1925) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Eisenstein's masterpiece film tells the 1905 Russian naval mutiny in five parts. It goes without saying that this is one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most beautiful as well. The most famous thing about this movie is the Odessa Steps sequence, which is clearly one of the most memorable scenes in film history but the rest of the movie never really gets the credit it deserves. I think the second part of the film with the mutiny on board the ship is just as impressive and there are some of the most suspenseful scenes in film history here. The execution sequence is incredibly suspenseful as we get closer to the sailors execution after they are put under a tarp. As for the Odessa Steps sequence, I'm really not sure I could say anything that hasn't already been said countless times. This massacre sequence is so brutal and shocking that it hasn't lost any of its impact over the past eighty-years. How Eisenstein was able to get all these extras is something remarkable on its own and it's easy to see why this film was banned in several countries because government officials thought this sequence could lead to riots. The technical beauty of this film is unlike many others as every single shot is like great poetry right on the screen. The cinematography is top notch from start to finish and really makes this movie seem like a documentary of the events."

","#014.1 - Battleship Potemkin (1925) - released in Russia 12/21/25; viewed previously <br/><br/>DOUG: I'd like to say a quick word about this Eisenstein film which we watched in Film Expression class, and were shown it again more recently in our History of Silent Film class (I slept through most of it, as I did with nearly every film we watched in that class, no matter how good). Eisenstein was, of course, a pioneer of film montage, and this film contains one of his best sequences, the famous 'Odessa Steps' sequence which follows a baby carriage rolling down the stairs followed by the oppressive Tsarist soldiers. The subject of Soviet Montage is always a key topic in any Film History class, and while it was important, a lot of my classmates have come to hate it, and feel scarred from being subjected to this and other Eistenstein films (a friend of mine jokingly called Soviet Montage ""Throwing a bunch of random scenes together and calling it a film."") We decided we didn't need to re-watch this film for our Odyssey, since we would just be waiting for the Steps scene, and we've got plenty more Eisenstein to look forward to.<br/><br/>KEVIN: I watched Sergei Eisenstein's seminal masterpiece Potemkin freshmen year in college in our Development of Film Expression class. Eisenstein's films are certainly not for the squeamish. It wasn't ever enough for him just to get across what happened. He seemed to want the viewer to be completely immersed in the action and the drama, and he achieved this through an unparalleled use of camera-work, editing, and harrowing depictions of the most graphic imagery ever captured on film for years after. None of his films demonstrate his style as perfectly as Potemkin. It's been years since I watched this film, and most of it I've forgotten, except of course the unforgettable Odessa Steps sequence, which is often regarded as Eisenstein's crowning achievement of film-making. I watched it yet again in another film class, and I managed to sleep through most of it, waking up just in time to see the Odessa Steps. What I stayed awake for I still managed to forget.<br/><br/>Last film chronologically: The Big Parade (1925). Next film chronologically: The Black Pirate (1926)."

","Like Citizen Kane, this is an IMPORTANT film in the development of cinema. Both of these films usually show up in the ""Top Ten Films of all time lists"" and herein lies the confusion. What are the criteria? For modern sophisticated film viewers both films are laughable, but for film history buffs they are worthy films for their breaking of new ground: BP for its use of montage, and CK for its long shots and nonlinear plotting. Modern audiences have seen it all before. Being first is not necessarily equated with being the best, and subsequent films have probably managed to beat these two at their own game. Memento springs to mind as a worthy successor to CK. It doesn't matter if you liked it. It only matters that it did it first.<br/><br/>Reception is all"

","The photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period. Eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor's revolt and the massacre at the town. As much as the movie is a high point in the cinema, it is also an example of SZocialist Realism. by 1925 the Soviet government actively used the arts, including film, as a means to spread the message of the revolution. Eisensteins portrayal of the revolt on the Battleship Potempkin offers the viewer insight into the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society. Much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda."
"TheNorthernMonkee","9","0","1","12 April 2005"," the ultimate propaganda, and a key part of cinema history
","SPOILERS Every major regime uses the country's media to it's own ends. Whether the Nazi banning of certain leaflets, or the televised Chinese alternative of Tianamen Square, Governments have tried to influence the people through different mediums since the beginning of time. In 1925 though, celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905, the Russian Communist Government supported the creation of this film, Battleship Potempkin. A major piece of cinematic history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this very day.<br/><br/>Set aboard the Battleship Potempkin, the crew are unhappy. In miserable living conditions and with maggot infested food, they are angry at their upper class suppressors. Now though, after the rotten food, enough is enough. Led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew turn upon their masters and fight for their freedom.<br/><br/>As far as propaganda goes, ""Battleship Potempkin"" is perfect. Presenting a positive light on the first, unsuccessful, communist mutiny, the film was a useful Soviet tool. Eighty years after the films release though, and the USSR has disappeared completely off the map. The amazing thing about this film though is that whilst the country it's message was intended for has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. It is true, that it is far from what we would nowadays consider 'entertainment', but the film is a beautiful piece of art.<br/><br/>Whether it be the scenes aboard the boat or the often talked about scene on the steps of Odessa, everything about this film is perfectly made. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even the acting, whilst slightly overdone, is perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to fault this film's end product.<br/><br/>It's impossible to know how the Russian people received this film upon it's release. Praising a country which has not existed for fifteen years, it's difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires. As a piece of art though, it is magnificent. Beautiful from start to finish, it is far from an easy watch, but it is well worth the effort."
"morlocksandelois","9","0","1","14 February 2005"," the story of the mutiny on board battleship Potemkin at the port of Odessa
","This 1925 film narrates the story of the mutiny on board battleship Potemkin at the port of Odessa. The movie celebrated the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905, which was seen as a direct precursor to the October Revolution of 1917. Following his montage theory, Eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message, besides he uses different camera shot angles and revolutionary illumination techniques. The ""Odessa Steps"" sequence in Potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. The baby carriage coming loose down the steps after its mother has been shot was later recreated in Brian d' Palma's The Untouchables. It is clear that the film is one of the best ever made considering its time and how innovative it was though you need a little bit of patience and to be a real movie enthusiast to go through its 70 minutes."
