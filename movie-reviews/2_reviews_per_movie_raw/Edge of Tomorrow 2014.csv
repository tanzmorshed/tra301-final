"gogoschka-1","9","834","937","27 May 2014"," Clever, intense Sci-Fi spectacle; offers nearly as much humor as it does excitement along with a great, unexpected turn from Tom Cruise
","Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.<br/><br/>Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character – and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn't a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as ""full metal bitch"" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before. <br/><br/>As for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I'm glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can't make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first 'Matrix' was (it IS breathtaking, though).<br/><br/>So my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we've seen in years, 'Edge of Tomorrow' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"Tehmeh","9","576","672","4 June 2014"," This movie doesn't think you're an idiot.
","When I saw that Doug Liman was directing and McQuarrie penning, I was interested. I liked Liman's first Bourne film over Greengrass-directed nauseating shaky-cam sequels. McQuarrie is a wonderful screenwriter, and these two seemed like a perfect pair.<br/><br/>I got what I hoped: a movie that doesn't treat me like a 10-year old. ""Edge of tomorrow"" is smart, entertaining, exciting and fun. It's an original movie as well, not a sequel or a remake (although I hear it might be inspired by a novel or graphic novel).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise - who plays a slightly different character than usually - is good, he always brings his best. He cares about his projects and demands to do as much stunts as possible. His passion can be seen here too and he is again a joy to watch, but this isn't a movie for Cruise to carry. Liman and McQuarrie carry this movie with smart pacing, transitions and that certain magic good filmmakers seem to be able to harness at will.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt isn't a useless sidekick, but a strong and likable character. Not annoyingly strong on the surface like some feminist ball-busting fantasy, but a real character and deserves every minute of her screen time. Bill Paxton was fun to see as a hard-ass sergeant, and Brendan Gleeson was good as well - even though his screen time is limited. All the main actors work well together, if a scene is shared.<br/><br/>The movie flows in an interesting way and it likes to surprise you. I'm not talking about forced twists, I'm talking about that special situation where you don't know what happens next. I've missed that feeling. I didn't have to pretend to care about the movie, I was interested in every minute of it. This happens rarely. And when it ends, you're satisfied. No setting up sequels, no ambiguous crap, just a solid, fitting ending.<br/><br/>Unlike Cruise's last sci-fi film ""Oblivion"", this is definitely an action movie. At first glance it may look like a generic sci-fi action film - and granted, sometimes (suits, aliens) it does - but there's enough personality of its own. Action looks good and the camera doesn't shake around senselessly. Also, the action never goes into that overblown mode where your senses get tired and you just don't care anymore. Well done.<br/><br/>""Edge of tomorrow"" is a thoroughly entertaining film. It's ""just"" a summer movie, but it's a smart, fun and exciting summer movie. You don't have to make excuses for its shortcomings to enjoy it. It's quality filmmaking and certainly a positive surprise.<br/><br/>9/10, will buy on blu-ray. I recommend this to everyone. Avoid as much spoilers as you can."
"jan_kalina","10","292","352","3 June 2014"," ""You see this isn't the first time that we've had this conversation. ""
","Why do we go to the movies? To be entertained, to laugh, to be amused, to be pulled into situations that are far from ever happening to us. The only certainty in today's film world that the film that you pick to watch in cinema is Tom Cruise. If you go into cinema and see any of Cruise's films you can be damn sure that that film won't disappoint you. Tom Cruise sure picks great projects. Frankly, I have to say that I haven't seen a bad film starring Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is described by the director himself as ""Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers"". The former mentioned is actually quite important since the trailers made this film look pretty dark, which is not the case. This is fun action film with lots of humor. Humor that perfectly fits this film. The time-loop allows the Cruise's Colonel Cage to remember exactly the situation he repeats over and over, which is many times very funny. At films with time-loop I am alway worried that the film might get repetitive. Well you don't have to when Doug Liman is at helm. The film has no time to get repetitive when it is moving at such fast pace. An action scene follows an actions and the scope is just mind blowing. This film packs in so much in just two hours. Other films usually keep the best scenes for the big finale. In Edge of Tomorrow all the action scenes are the best scenes of the film.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise doesn't act as his usual self here, he plays against type. He always tries to come up with something new in his films. So in what role you haven't seen him yet? A wimpy coward. He once again shows what a versatile actor he is. Emily Blunt, as the kick ass Rita, has never been more likable in any of her films than here. she handles the action and the drama perfectly. Bill Paxton mostly just repeats his commands and lines about victory, but he is just so great at that he ends up as one of the funniest characters in the film <br/><br/>To me this comes as no surprise, that Edge of Tomorrow is yet another sci-fi Tom Cruise film, which kick ass from start to finish. What roller-coaster ride! This will be hard to top in the upcoming summer season. There is nothing wrong with this film. It's got everything. Even a helicopter crash!"
"lornloxor","10","560","688","28 May 2014"," Witty and thrilling summer blockbuster with Tom Cruise in top form
","You could describe this movie as a dizzying combination of Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, Source Code and The Butterfly Effect. Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. <br/><br/>You have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. <br/><br/>The tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun."
"Jonas8989","9","576","709","30 May 2014"," Hoped for a good movie .. got an amazing one instead (No Spoiler)
","After watching the trailer i was really hyped about the movie because of its theme and potential to be a really good movie. But on the other side i knew how bad the most potential good movies in the past ended up. I was scared that they screw it up and give us another Oblivion or Ilisium with much cgi-effects and bad story and no real story and/or characters. <br/><br/>So i took my girlfriend and went in the movie with mixed feelings. But then, right from the beginning, i knew this movie would be fantastic. The first minutes really hooked me and i found myself in a funny, filled with perfect action and intelligent movie. You had the feeling like you were directly in it and you really feel with Tom Cruise from the beginning to the end. I don't like Tom Cruise in general but this role just fits him. Nobody who sees this movie could deny this. From minute to minute i was more and more in this fantastic story and wanted to last forever. But eventually the movie ended and i was really satisfied with everything. <br/><br/>Two main characters who played perfectly, a fascinating story well told and really fast and good looking action made it for me the best movie i watched in a while (and i watch pretty much movies). Even though i don't like to recommend movies because of different tastes I really want to do this with this movie. The story is well told and there are no boring repeatings. Even my girlfriend who normally don't like movies with much action liked it a lot and added Emily Blunt to one of her favorite actresses of all time.<br/><br/>Oh well, 10/10"
"somersetboy","10","97","114","10 July 2016"," What a Fantastic Movie!
","Superb! I rarely get to go to a movie with my older son after his siblings came along. We did manage to go to this movie in the cinemas. Not only were we glad we chose this movie to watch, but two years later, we still recall the impact this movie had on both of us. <br/><br/>This science fiction story is deeply satisfying. The movie treats the viewers as intelligent people. It is not in the same league of a plethora of science fiction movies that hit the cinemas every year. For example this year we have Independence Day 2, a high budget sequel to a high budget b-movie from a long time ago. It is profoundly forgettable. That is in stark contrast to Edge of Tomorrow, which has stayed with me for so long and today motivated me to come here on IMDb to write a review after two years!<br/><br/>This movie is a must watch. Thanks for reading."
"CalRhys","Null","274","335","22 June 2014"," A Summer Blockbuster Not To Be Missed
","One of the most ingenious film concepts ever created, a cross between 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Groundhog Day', 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a gripping and clever blockbuster sci-fi thrill-ride accompanied with taut, fast-paced action and compelling direction. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt form a perfect chemistry that takes them from the training ground, to the battlefield through to the action-bound finale in Paris. The premise of the time-loop has been used many times before, but this time round there are enough exciting visuals and dynamic storytelling skills employed to make this one thrilling (and unexpectedly comedic) flick that is unpredictable and expertly designed. A model of cinematic craftsmanship."
"knyffeler","10","170","207","9 June 2014"," BETTER than I was expecting!
","I saw the trailer of this, but was expecting another campy ""Independence Day"" trying to be too funny, ""War of the Worlds"" that tried to be too serious or ""District 9"" that was FX for FX sake. I probably would have not gone, but my date said her daughter saw it and loved it.<br/><br/>Wow, was I surprised! The characters make the movie. Cruise's less-than-perfect, frustrated but determined ""Cage"" quickly got me rooting for him. Emily Blunt's serious ""Rita"" was a great mirror image protagonist.<br/><br/>The special effects were so clean and well integrated that they didn't overpower the story or become center stage. Instead, they added to bringing in me into making the unreal premise more real.<br/><br/>In the end, this is probably the coolest sci-fi love story I have ever seen. It is nice to see that Hollywood can still produce something other than the formulaic trash that usually keeps me away from the theaters. Warner Brothers, thanks for putting $178 million on the table to make this!"
"jigsaw-91","9","333","430","28 May 2014"," Tom Cruise meets his Groundhog Day with a surprising, well told story and energetic entertainment
","Edge of Tomorrow (EOT for me) will be the most surprising blockbuster of this year (maybe along with X-Men: Days of Future Past) for doing its job so well that beats every expectation about what it has to offer. A storyline about one man that is shown to us doing the ""same"" things every time could be dull. But EOT has a thoughtful script full of turns and fun that entertains and allows to Cruise to do new things inside that particular Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>I wont spoil anything because the movie is full of valuable twists, surprisingly good chemistry between Cruise and Emily Blunt (Full Metal B**ch) and it has an involving script aside of the spectacular action sequences. The first one in the movie is totally amazing. But the rest is as that good. The movie clearly develops in the action and the riveting pace. It offers what a great blockbuster should be and it reaches that superb goal.<br/><br/>Also Tom Cruise gives his best performance in so many time. Maybe, I'm not joking, this is his best performance ever. For the first time he is not doing an smiling hero. He is a coward. He is a scared and inexperienced soldier who has to learn to be more skillful (and to escape from his personal loop) every time he returns to the ""same"" day. And Cruise is wonderful in that role. You really don't recognize him. Forget his frequent smiling, his heroic or possible macho topics. This could be a new and groundbreaking role inside his career even if you are not a big fan of him (I'm not going as far as saying that this is his best movie or the most enjoyable one of all, but this movie could be one of his best ones too). And when a movie has a star doing his job properly and much better than expected, a great script and a riveting pace (the movie is never boring) the whole concept has the job done. And that's the case of EOT. Also the stellar performances from Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson are truly good.<br/><br/>In fact I'm glad that this one came after ""Oblivion"". That one was good, but this one is different and much better. Don't expect ""Oblivion 2"" or its same style because you will be wrong.<br/><br/>Please, trust me and go to the theater to enjoy this wonderful, original and surprising entertainment. It delivers much more than you could expect, delivers the best Cruise (in so many time that I personally think that this is Cruise at his best) and delivers a clever story with a good twist. Enjoy!"
"aldri-feb","8","241","317","28 May 2014"," This year's most surprising blockbuster movie so far
","With thrilling action sequences, clever sense of humor and surprisingly intellectual storyline, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" shows a real deal of summer blockbuster movie and proves itself beyond expectation especially after unconvincing trailers. Perhaps the theme and alien character looks familiar with some popular sci-fi movies but it's still combined perfectly as an entertainment. Doug Liman as director smartly exploited 're-setting the day' aspect without making it complicated and escaping it from being dull with some quality combat moments also inserting lovable drama that is commanded by memorable chemistry from Tom Cruise and Emilly Blunt have carried whole scenes in it. Overall ""Edge of Tomorrow"" feels more satisfying than it might have been in any ways and shows how the non-sequel-reboot blockbuster movie should be done. It's definitely much fun than I have ever imagined and pleasurable to re-watch it over and over again."
"andynaik","8","208","274","28 May 2014"," The definite blockbuster of this summer
","Another sci-fi movie starring Tom Cruise didn't interest me much. The trailer also didn't give me a clear idea of what this movie was about which made it even surprisingly good to experience it! The thing about movies like these is that there's a lot of potential to repeat the same things over and over and leave the viewer uninterested. However, every time there was something new so it didn't feel repetitive. There were also elements of humor that were refreshing. The editing should be admired.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, I'll say that Tom Cruise (Major Cage) is an absolute novice in warfare, who is involuntarily picked for an assault on aliens who have taken over Europe. To combat these aliens, the joint forces around the world have developed a armor suit laced with heavy weaponry. He is baffled as to why he was picked when he knows nothing about warfare. That part wasn't satisfactorily answered. The first day after combat, he begins to develop symptoms of living the same day over and over again. Baffled, he tries to explain the situation to others who disregard his views. In Rita, he finds someone who can understand his situation.<br/><br/>There on, it's a thrilling ride of finding out what's causing these repetitions and finding a means to put an end to it. The movie is fast paced so no mulling over. Little details of changes in the scenery, how Cage modifies his behavior both to convince others and to find an answer, and how events unfold are put forth excellently. I'm sure enthusiasts can find plot holes aplenty but I found this movie thoroughly entertaining. If you're in the mood for watching fast-paced action sci-fi, then I definitely recommend this movie!"
"mikemx321","10","36","44","25 March 2018"," The people calling this movie ""intelligent"" are correct
","Read the negative reviews, the people calling this movie stupid etc. etc. obviously weren't able to fully understand what they were seeing. This is the risk filmmakers take when they don't assume the audience is going to have the mentality of a 10-year-old, but thankfully most of us don't need every little aspect explained in full. <br/><br/>This movie hits on every level, it's fast, witty, action packed, and presents depth in surprising places. If you don't have ADHD and can stay focused so you don't fall behind, and possess the ability to perceive without your hand being held and walked through a plot, you are most definitely going to like this movie. I personally give this a ""10"" because I consider Edge of Tomorrow one of the best films I've ever seen But even if it's not your exact cup of tea, it should at least be a 6 or 7."
"nick-sultana","10","149","204","28 May 2014"," Better than I was expecting....
","I was lucky enough to watch an exclusive Premiere Screening in Sydney with a friend last night, I can honestly admit that it was better than I was originally expecting.<br/><br/>Storyline goes that William Cage (Tom Cruise), a military officer inexperienced in combat, is deployed into a combat mission against the aliens and even against his will. Though Cage is killed in minutes in a spectacular battle sequence that echoes the opening sequence in Saving Private Ryan, he finds himself starting over in a time loop, repeating the same mission and being killed. Each time, Cage discovers and remembers the timed events that he experienced and decides to learn better to fight the aliens, he teams up with Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) to defeat them but he will learn why as well he has this power and that he was not alone.<br/><br/>The storyline was strong all the way and it never loses itself or goes over-the-top, the acting from Cruise and Blunt is both epic and really a game changer for both (people have complained about the lack of emotion in the characters but I can admit it was not needed here much), casting as well includes Bill Paxton, Brendon Gleeson and even Australian actors Noah Taylor (Game of Thrones) and Kick Gurry (Speed Racer) and they all provided excellent performances.<br/><br/>The visual effects are really top notch and even at times remind me of Elysium and even Battle: Los Angeles. The action-set sequences are very well choreographed and are even tense in the opening minutes of the film. The aliens they fight are really incredible looking, scary and even remind me of something out of a Guillermo del Toro film (think Hellboy 1 and 2 or even Pacific Rim). The Exo-Skeleton suits are being more and more awesome whenever they are used in film, I just wish they had invented real ones by now.<br/><br/>Overall, EoT is a movie that will not only enlighten Sci-Fi fans but it will keep the action junkies glued to the screen and if you like or hate Tom Cruise, you may be in for a surprise"
"kshirad","9","216","304","28 May 2014"," Why bother on originality when the execution is so well-handed?
","There are multiple plot strands from other films gathered into a union. I won't give you any hint but you'll get it when you see it. Nowadays, movies are short on originality. But, in this case, you won't give a thing about it. <br/><br/>Premise: An inexperience military officer was sent to war to fight an alien race invading the earth. In the middle of the battlefield, he got into an accident which causes him to go into time- loop that repeats each moment when he dies.<br/><br/>The basis of the plot looks familiar... That could be a big problem. On the contrary, it succeeded to provide a big summer blockbuster satisfaction. The pacing is perfect, the acting is perfect. Oh, and did i mention the effects? It was ragin'!<br/><br/>See this movie with low expectations (2D or 3D doesn't matter)..."
"A_Different_Drummer","10","37","47","16 March 2015"," Great as a sci fi actioner -- perfect as a love story
","Took 3 viewings before this review because I wanted to get it right.<br/><br/>On its face this seems to be Groundhog Day with a sci fi twist but in fact it is much more.<br/><br/>It is nuanced, and I give the stars credit for making those nuances work.<br/><br/>The way Cruise's character changes and matures during the film is something you don't see too often.<br/><br/>The riffs on time travel set against the ""trope"" of being sent to a battle with no preparation is also rare -- you literally would have to go to Groundhog Day to to even come close.<br/><br/>The big difference of course is that Murray in GD never really knew what he wanted to do -- except wake up.<br/><br/>Here there is a ""mission"" and that gives this actioner a real shot of adrenalin. The viewer is hooked like a trout.<br/><br/>Three viewings so far and I expect to revisit it again.<br/><br/>Blount's possibly best role, she doesn't have a lot of dialog but her face is like a watermark on the various scenes, making them unforgettable.<br/><br/>As a sci-fi actioner, it's a ""9."" As possibly the most existentialist love story ever filmed it is a 10 - in the course of the entire film, he propositions her and gets turned down, he tries to chat her up in a car and gets turned down, and then she kisses him just before she dies.

"hegrim","9","7","7","2 April 2019"," Pleasantly surprised
","Going into watching this movie, I'll be honest, I didn't expect much. I figured it was probably just some usual sci-fi movie with crappy effects and a lack of an actually interesting and full plot. The only thing that gave me hope was that Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt were the stars of the movie. Soon enough, I realized I had seriously doubted this movie way more than I should have.<br/><br/>First off, I love Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise, and their acting in this was phenomenal. It was fun to see Cruise in a role where he was helpless and lost; out of place (in the beginning), while Blunt was the badass female who trained him and built him up. Speaking of Blunt, her character Rita was a truly incredible character in my opinion, and Blunt did an excellent job of portraying her.<br/><br/>Now onto the plot: this is where I was initially worried when I began the movie. However, I found myself really enjoying the movie very soon in, after catching onto some things. It made me think, which I liked, but also wasn't so unclear that I couldn't figure anything out. I thought that the time loop idea was very interesting and unique for a sci-fi movie, and even though things kept repeating, I was never bored or felt like there wasn't enough happening. I loved the action in this movie, and also the more tender moments between Rita and Cage. Movies that can make you cry and make you sit on the edge of your seat in suspense always intrigue me, and that's what this movie did for me. I just didn't want it to end.<br/><br/>Side notes: I've watched some behind the scenes footage of this movie, and either all or a majority of the action sequences that we see in the movie were filmed, not inserted using CGI, which is very impressive. But to me, not more impressive than the fact that Blunt and Cruise each did their own stunts. These actors are so amazing in my opinion.
The only reason that this movie is getting 9 and not 10 stars from me is that I felt towards the beginning of the movie, the whole time loop thing was being dragged out a bit too much, I wanted things to move a bit quicker.<br/><br/>*These are simply my opinions. I respect anyone and everyone's opinions, even if I don't agree with them, and I ask that you do the same with my review and others. Thank you.*"

"KissEnglishPasto","8","33","46","22 April 2015"," On the Edge of.Groundhog Day?????
","............................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL <br/><br/>This Review is dedicated to my student and friend Sebastian PortillaWho really likes this movie and specifically requested it!<br/><br/>As regards EDGE, sorry, but it is pretty much of an impossibility for me to sit down and write a completely unbiased review. In my case, this film will always be viewed through the lens of Groundhog Day, one of my all- time favorite movies, my favorite film to share with my English students and, most definitely, my #1 Romantic-Comedy of all time! But despite the fact that I have seen Groundhog Day, from beginning to end, at least 2 dozen times, this is supposed to be a review of EDGE, so let's turn our focus there:<br/><br/>It is easy to understand why so many IMDb-ers have awarded 9 or 10 stars to this ""EDGY"" Sci-Fi near classic, I suppose if it hadn't been for the reason so clearly spelled out above, I, undoubtedly, would have done the sameStill, EDGE possesses many standalone qualities that have motivated me to give it a well-deserved 8 Stars! FIRST: Here, Tom Cruise's character, Cage, is a die-hard desk jockey PR/Marketing mature-media- pretty-face type, who seems, at least initially, to have an anaphylactic shock reaction to any and all bellicose activities encoded in his DNA! I find this an extremely amusing tongue in cheek poke at himself in some of his earlier Mr. Invincible, Super Macho, Ethan Hunt and Jack Reacher type roles!<br/><br/>Another critical factor working in its favor: EDGE is anything BUT a ""leave your brain at the door"" mindless Action/Sci-Fi flick, unlike so many of your typical Hollywood ""Action/Sci-Fi"" counterparts! If your focus wanders, you could be asking yourself, ""OOPS! What just happened!?!?"" This film almost constantly challenges you to re-evaluate your opinions and the relevance of what has transpired on screen! But don't get me wrong, EDGE has enough mind-numbing action to satisfy even the most exigent of action movie junkies! At the same time, it also presents us with some rather inspired and original plot twists. (Don't worry, No Spoilers AHEAD!) Speaking of originality, perhaps this is the perfect moment to mention that despite that its driving force idea seems to be a blatant rip-off of Groundhog Day, at least EDGE manages to impart a good deal of fresh spin to the concept, so as to give it quite a life of its own. <br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, as is the case with most Hollywood big budget productions nowadays, Cinematography, sound, sound mixing, editing, effects, pretty much everything is extremely professionally done. Screenplay, three people with long names listed, is actually engrossing and quite engaging. For those of you who usually ""PASS"" on this genre, I would venture to say that quite a good number of you might find putting yourself on EDGE might be more than worth your while! <br/><br/>ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!<br/><br/>Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!"

","This is that rare thing, a blockbuster that does more than just deafen with noise of its machinery. More on this in a bit. But I'm also amazed at how well it deploys that machinery, I want to quickly note this deployment that shows we are at the hands of excellent practitioners.<br/><br/>It's set in the near future, about warring alien invaders, but the template is from the past; a WWII movie about landing to France and the final battle that blows back towards freedom. A simple choice that made a difference in immersion from Star Trek stuff.<br/><br/>Setting it in the future allows for wider room in the story. They chose time travel, normally cumbersome when it mechanically props a story, but here fresh because it's about loosening up limits of it. This way we escape the war movie trapping where we know that the hero must dodge every bullet and survive to the end, here he dies again and again, some funny deaths in place of heroics; seriousness goes, expectation goes, it all becomes more fluid.<br/><br/>And Tom Cruise is marvelously cast, just brilliant use of him that helps so much usher us in. He's cleverly made to be at first the preening jerk that he grates everyone as, cowardly trying to avoid battle, instead of right off the bat the noble action hero he would normally portray. He's laughed off, fails, fate as cosmic joke, and in this way slowly emerges redeemed in the crucible of war so that when he becomes the hero it feels earned and right.<br/><br/>This is all near perfect engagement to my mind, devices but so very well employed. The first is the draw-in, the other two ways of throwing the crank we'd like to; Cruise not a hero, thwarted heroics. Okay, now forget about aliens, gadgets, a war to save Earth.<br/><br/>The movie is about redemption, but consider this with more depth. A man who would not assume his place in life, cast down there anyway but now stripped of his precious self, no longer above others. Interested viewers can observe the karmic underpinning of being reborn an endless number of lives, the successive round as Buddhist samsara, a cycle of reincarnation powered by delusion and ego. That aspect of Buddhism which observes how present and future life is dictated by past action is the easiest to illustrate, so we see it often; Groundhog Day is the most known.<br/><br/>The more he pushes against the narrative, the harder it becomes, but just going along with what happens doesn't help either. He gets killed every time. No he will have to improvise a new self in the flow of endless lives, this is sparked by a woman he meets and tells him to find her when he wakes up again. Now comes the great part.<br/><br/>Along the way there's another shift, even more powerful; this is during the drive to Lyons when we suddenly notice that he's been further down the story than we have, able to anticipate events because he has been down there before.<br/><br/>Something great happens. Suddenly it's a countless number of lives he has spent with her improvising a path. Now he knows her as deeply as we can imagine. <br/><br/>It all builds up to a last mission, one last chance to get it right except this time they can both die. The filmmaker delivers the expected climax, doing it well, but also delivers something else that is completely marvelous.<br/><br/>She kisses him as action heroes do sometimes. But she kisses him for the first time, having known him for only a day, trusting it is much more. He watches her go, possibly for the last time, having spent with her an eternity.<br/><br/>He comes back of course at the beginning of the very first day, now redeemed, except no one knows he did it. It's her image being celebrated on the wall.<br/><br/>He goes to see her one last time, a first time for her (she remembers nothing), but now he knows her as more than an image in a story (an image he made famous as part of the publicity narrative that inspires at the start of the film).<br/><br/>She greets him, now her superior, with the same defiant tone as ever. Will he stay or go? Is it a first day in this affair, a last day, is it even one? It's all in Cruise's baffled laugh, both the first day and last and having spent a lifetime together.<br/><br/>This is absolutely breathtaking stuff; but something you'll deepen with love as deep as you've known or can imagine, the pieces perfectly arranged for you to do so. My first thought was that there must be no better film about love last year, unless it's Malick.<br/><br/>Something to meditate upon."

","To me this film was surprisingly enough, actually funnier than Cruises last comedy, Knight & Day. I didn't care much for that film at all, but Edge Of Tomorrow is a very welcome addition to the sci-fi genre. I enjoyed it so much, I felt like I didn't care if the end was going to come anytime soon. They could have made this film longer in my view, and it would have been just as good or maybe even better.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that Edge of Tomorrow ranks up there with the very best sci-fi films since the turn of the century. I did see it in 3D, and I felt the 3D didn't really add anything great to the film, but that really seems to be the case with all the newer 3D films. The only film I've ever seen in which the 3D actually did add something extra special to the film, was Avatar. Personally I think the 3D fad can mostly be chalked up as another Hollywood gimmick that really does nothing at all, except add extra cost to tickets, and extra in their pockets of course. This film itself however is not a gimmick, it's solid action sci-fi that even does have some real thought provoking moments. The writing here is good, far better than most Hollywood action films. There is even a nod to Mr.Kubrick in the film. Do yourself a favor and check this out.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"hisatog4","10","43","68","31 May 2014"," The movie delivers much more than i expected and i expected a lot.
","After watching this movie, i remembered last year's Now You See Me, which was an unexpected and entertaining movie.<br/><br/>This is very well paced and executed film. Tom Cruise seriously fits the character. I know the main character in the Japanese novel is a young man, but man i'm glad they cast Tom Cruise in this. I'm not a fan of Tom but to me he always give 120% in every film. If Hollywood wanted it to follow the original material, they would cast some pretty face teenagers that would have the same personality as the rest typical teenagers characters (Stupid, ignorant, selfish, arrogant for no reason). Thank God they didn't do that.<br/><br/>The story is excellent and it is nowhere similar to Groundhog Day except for the day loops. it is action packed and there are plenty of funny moments. You may expect the looping days would be boring after a while, but you'd be wrong.<br/><br/>I cannot comment on the CGI, because i think there is too much good CGI in every movies nowadays that i am not impressed anymore. But it does not mean the CGI int he movie is bad or anything. On the contrary it felt pretty real to me.<br/><br/>My recommendation : GO SEE THIS MOVIE. You will not regret it.<br/><br/>P/S : The only bad experience when i was watching this movie in cinema was the guy beside me who constantly open his brightly lit phone and even answered a call. another is a group of stupid teenagers behind me who keep commenting loudly on every scene, thinking they were funny. SO PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR PHONE OR TALK LOUDLY IN THE CINEMA DURING A MOVIE SCREENING. Thank you."

","Putting aside the fact people do not like Tom Cruise as an actor, this was a really good movie to watch. It is a Sci-Fi film about fighting extraterrestrial beings, but it deals with war on a deeper scale with Tom Cruise's character reliving the day over-and-over again!
Emily Blunt adds tremendous depth as a female co-lead to the movie taking on a different approach of being a solider. Tom Cruise gets closer to her reliving the day with her. However, seeing her KIA on the battle field takes a tremendous toll on him as a character.
What happens in the end? Recommend watching the movie to find out as this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next."
"burakemre134","8","8","10","17 July 2017"," Impeccable Example of Time Loop
","In the Edge of Tomorrow, there is a story of a ""nation that united against alienation"", that proceeds in militaristic structure as understood from its subject. The only difference that separates from other similar movies that they have put the time loop issue at the center of the story. At the same time, it is a film that interprets fate by presenting various possibilities in the logic of 'what would it be like if I did it like this?' In the Edge of Tomorrow, which engages in the question of the traditional conservative view, which prejudices man should not be able to oversee his destiny, and therefore he should accept it, he is trying to overcome this idea of decisiveness through the cycle of time. The quote which repeated twice in the film ""preparation and discipline make you the master of your fate"" is the proof of opinion.<br/><br/>According to Albert Camus, perhaps the deepest desire of man is to obtain what is not available. In other words, it is to know where the life that is likened to a river is born (birth) and where to cast it (death). Because, if he has the knowledge, he will be able to pull the set and direction as he wishes. In the Edge of Tomorrow, of course, it does not use this view to mean the attainment of an existential essence. On the contrary, ""I changed my destiny"". Even if you try to show that you are away from the logic of creating a war hero in similar films, the image created with the point of view (especially from final of film) reverses this unseen situation."

","I get the impression that EDGE OF TOMORROW is a film that most people will forget ever existed within a year of it's release. Despite being a big budget sci-fi action film with Tom Cruise in the lead, this movie went almost completely ignored by audiences. Including me. Unfortunately, I paid no attention to this movie during its theatrical run and contributed to its depressingly low box office haul. It's a high concept sci-fi action that's well written and populated with a strong cast; it should've done better than it did to encourage more interesting films out of the studios. Based on a Japanese novel (that I've never read), the story follows Major Cage (Cruise) in the midst of an alien invasion that has consumed Europe and threatens to soon spread across the rest of the globe. The aliens, dubbed Mimics, are an impossibly skilled species of killers that can seemingly predict humanity's every plan and prepare for it. Cage, an official with the military's public relations department, is assigned to be on the front line to record their invasion of Normandy for humanity's latest attempt, Operation: Downfall. Panicked, he tries to blackmail his way out and finds himself arrested and dropped on the front lines, no longer as a media specialist but as a deserter reassigned to an infantry unit. His first real taste of war ends as one would expect when he dies at the hands of one of the aliens' ""Alphas"" but not before introducing it to the business end of a claymore mine. He dies, covered in the Alpha's blood, and finds himself awakening moments later at the start of the day, reliving events. Cage is now on an endless loop of death on the frontlines and the only person who understands his plight is the ""Angel of Verdun"", a celebrated soldier named Rita (Emily Blunt) who has experienced the same phenomenon.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise once again proves that, while I'm baffled by his personal life, he is a solid actor. His character, Major Cage, has a full arc over the course of the film as he transforms from a cowardly media relations specialist into a killing machine who is willing to selflessly sacrifice himself if needed to end the Mimics' invasion. Despite Cruise's history of playing the near-invincible action hero, he is totally believable in the beginning of the film when Cage is so terrified of seeing combat that he's willing to attempt blackmail on a general. His counterpart in the film is Rita, played in a surprising turn by Emily Blunt. I'm only familiar with Blunt from comedies so her role of a decorated military alien murder machine is mind-blowing in how well she does. Blunt has gravitas and you never question her character's ability to slaughter hordes of enemies on the front lines. Best of all, the filmmakers never bother to cram a love story between Cage and Rita into the plot as most summer big-budget action movies would be prone to do. Cage and Rita keep their relationship professional (mostly) and keep their focus on winning the war. In order to defeat the Mimics, they will need to locate and destroy their Omega, an organism that essentially acts as the central brain for the species. Cage's ability to restart the day each time he dies comes from a direct connection to the Omega, so he is now humanity's final hope in defeating the alien threat.<br/><br/>I have never read the novel on which EDGE OF TOMORROW is adapted (""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazakaand arguably a way cooler title) so I don't know who all deserves the credit for crafting such an awesome story structure, whether it be Sakurazaka, screenwriters McQuarrie and the Butterworths, or director Doug Liman. Cage dies a lot in this film, in fun and creative ways, and we're exposed to a lot of the same material over and over. But it never becomes repetitive or gets old. Each trip back through the day only shows what we need to see and advances the plot. It's a creative plot device that sets it apart from the usual linear storytelling and cookie- cutter plot structures the theaters are inundated with during the summer months. EDGE OF TOMORROW will do down as 2014's most under-appreciated movie, as audiences didn't exactly flock to see it and the hype machine died down real fast (despite critic's praises). I recommend this to anyone in the market for some blockbuster entertainment that isn't the same old grind. If I were to lobby any complaint against EDGE OF TOMORROW (aside from that horrible ""Live, Die, Repeat"" tagline that became the movie's unofficial second title), it would be the alien design. The Mimics are masses of writing tentacles and do little to impress or frighten. But that's a minor complain for a movie that is otherwise incredibly solid with terrific performances from Cruise and Blunt. If you haven't seen EDGE OF TOMORROW, go do so and see if you agree."

"Prashast_Singh","10","6","7","6 August 2018"," A riveting, creative, refreshing masterpiece!
","The moment I read the synopsis of this movie, I made sure not to miss it at any cost. I got it on DVD today and I have to admit that this is one of the most creative and unique films of all time. The concept is fantastic; I had never seen or heard anything of this kind. It kept me engaged from beginning to the end and not for a moment did I take any break. <br/><br/>EDGE OF TOMORROW is a riveting masterpiece. It's another powerful action movie with a great science fiction setting which made it extremely enjoyable. The best thing is it wasn't long. Doug Liman's films have always impressed me and this one is no exception. He avoids subplots and by sticking only to the main plot, makes sure the viewer doesn't even feel the urge to take a break. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise...oh man! I've no words to say for him. He's my favorite Hollywood actor and in this film, you see him in his true, charming style. Be it the action or the story or even the moments which require him just to smile or chuckle, he delivers every bit of it. Emily Blunt gives a sharp performance even though it's technically Cruise whose presence takes the centre stage out of all. <br/><br/>A special mention to the film's VFX and action. As it's an out-and-out science fiction action movie, it's filled with loads of nonstop action and high quality visual effects. That just made me wish I had seen this movie on the big screen. It's not dramatic or dark by any means. It is a very intriguing story which keeps you awake throughout. Its unpredictability makes you think about how it's all gonna end, but the script is so tight that the very next moment you're offered solid action and thrill, eventually making you stop thinking.<br/><br/>I'd strongly recommend EDGE OF TOMORROW to anyone who likes movies in general. And if you're interested in SF/action movies, you're in for a highly enjoyable, memorable, exhilarating treat."
"haosstoposto","9","10","14","19 June 2014"," Excellent and funny movie
","I hoped this would be solid movie and I was not wrong. It is based on a Japanese novel which explains fresh approach in the time-travel concept. The premise of the movie is simple: Earth has been invaded by some alien life-form (called Mimics and remind of sentinels form Matrix) and the Humanity is losing. Almost all of Europe has been conquered and the United Defence Forces are preparing one final big offensive, something like landing in Normandy to reclaim European mainland. Our main protagonist, William Cole played by Tom Cruise, is some kind of military journalist/PR expert who is send to be embedded reporter in the front line. Being a complete coward, he tries to avoid being sent into the combat force but he gets arrested and forcefully drafted. The invasion itself is a total disaster and our hero"" dies within minutes. But before he dies, he accidentally manages to kill alien alpha soldier, which obviously has some kind of special ability, because he wakes up a day before the invasion and repeats the same day over and over. On the battlefield he meets a Hero of human forces Sgt.Rita Vrataski (played by Emily Blunt), the woman who managed to defeat the aliens in one battle and she recognizes what happened to him. The Mimics have a power to rewind time each time when some alpha soldier is killed, and after a contact with one Cole has acquired this ability. Rita had this power before, but she lost it after her winning battle. She wants to use Coles ability to train him so that they will be able to find Omega-alien, mind which controls the entire invasion. Training is brutal and difficult, because our protagonist is really not a soldier and we see why he doesn't want to go into battle. He dies time and again, many time funnily. He tries to reach that alien over-mind and at the same time to save Vrataski from a certain death, which is – as it seems – an impossible mission (no pun intended). The chemistry between Cole and Vrataski is superb, and never feels forced. Luckily, the director has chosen not to overdo the romantic relation between our heroes, everything is hinted at. The ending of the movie is somewhat weaker and not logical, but that's OK, it's a time-travel story and it's difficult to avoid paradoxes."
"TheMarwood","8","7","9","23 September 2014"," Very well done
","This is a welcome return to big budget form for Doug Liman after stumbling with the mess that was Jumper. This high concept screenplay is explored to its fullest potential and perhaps its greatest achievement is its sense of humor throughout. It's basically light gallows humor, watching Cruise die over and over again.<br/><br/>The film is very well made and it's a welcome change of pace to see a vfx film shot on 35mm giving some grain and texture to the effects. In an era of filmmaking where most effects sequences are pre- visualized to an almost sterilizing degree, the action filmed feels remarkably spontaneous - thanks to Liman's chaotic, figure it out on set style of filmmaking, that has been aptly named 'Limania.'<br/><br/>As Cruise gets caught in this time loop where he repeats the same day over and over, the script fleshes this scenario out where it never feels repetitive or predictable. A concept like this is prime for writing itself into a corner and forcing a last act to resolve everything, but Edge of Tomorrow avoids such last act problems. A minor gripe with the script would be that no one recognizes Cage as an officer, yet he is a prominent media figure that got millions of recruits to join the fight. That aside, Edge of Tomorrow is a hell of a lot of fun."
"Rage-Kage","8","7","9","26 June 2014"," Tom Cruise surprises me
","I've Never really been much of a fan of Tom Cruise. I don't really know why exactly I've just never been a fan and when I first saw the trailers for Edge of Tomorrow I assumed it would be just another generic action movie. Now that I have seen this movie I am definitely ready to give Tom Cruise another chance because Edge of Tomorrow was actually really cool. Tom Cruise dies in a war against aliens and then wakes up the morning of the battle he dies in and starts all over. Emily Blunt is one of the only people that believes him and helps him understand whats happening. This movie is based off of a manga apparently but I'd never heard of it before this movie's release so I don't know if it follows its source material at all or not.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has definitely made some bad movies in the past but he is still a good actor. His and Emily blunts characters worked pretty well together both as a tag team in war and even as sort of a couple at some points. Watching Tom Hanks dying over and over again is pretty entertaining. It's kind of like that episode of Supernatural where Dean dies over and over again but not as funny and with a lot more sci-fi explosions. I'm definitely not a professional film critic by any stretch of the imagination. I don't know all the ins and outs of movies like someone who is more professional would but I think I can pretty safely say that the writing, directing, and editing are all pretty well done in this movie without sounding like an idiot. I'm also having kind of a hard time remembering all of the details of exactly what happened in the end because it is kind of up for interpretation which has been something that happens in some great movies. That sort of thing I personally think is a sign of good writing when done well. Obviously the ending is no where near as mind bending as movie's like The Shining but it was still pretty good.<br/><br/>So overall even though the basic plot of Edge of Tomorrow has been done before this it is a pretty good example of it being done well. Edge of Tomorrow is a cool and entertaining science fiction movie.<br/><br/>I'm giving Edge of Tomorrow an 8/10"
"ben-798-604758","10","11","16","2 January 2015"," The Best Tom Cruise Movie In a LOOOOONG Time
","I'm not really a big Tom Cruise fan. Haven't been since the first mission impossible. I think he's generally pretty mediocre. However this film is freaking great. Its the only film i know with the plot structure it has and its probably his greatest character growth yet, and it also fits the impossibly perfect sci-fi action that you see on blockbusters as of yet into a realistic scenario. This isn't the world where the action hero just conveniently missed that hurtling bit of debris from the nearby explosion because it was convenient to the plot. This is the world where he got hit in the face with that debris the last time around and woke up the morning before and knew to dodge that piece of debris the next time around. Its a really cool concept that they really pushed the limits of the sci fi action with and artistically it makes a great watch especially with those freaky aliens, the ""mimics"" which are definitely in my top 10 most creative and disturbing aliens, probably one of the most badass ones yet. Just the way that they fight and some of the choreography is so well envisioned, the FX department really did a good job on this one.<br/><br/>In terms of character development it also does nicely. Major Cage is not even a good guy in the beginning, he's a total douche who pretty much bought his way into the position, and he's a giant coward. He's pretty much thrown under the bus by the military folk cause they see him for what he is and its only by sheer luck he gets caught in a time loop, but over the course of a film his fellow soldiers go from having him pegged as a spineless deserter to just reciting misinformed predictable assumptions about a completely different man then the man they expected. I think it subtly makes a good point about peoples reactions to someone they've never met, they don't stop treating him like the person he was even when he becomes that person, whether or not he's a hero was never something they could read on his face and it wasn't something anyone was ever going to know about him so it was more about an internal sense of fulfillment than recognition. Also stopping the alien apocalypse.<br/><br/>Anyway, i give it a 10/10, i might've pushed more towards a 9.5 but i'm rounding up because of the fantastic concept and great execution."

","Formerly known as "" All You Need Is Kill"" (I get why they changed the name, but damn, I wish they would have kept it), Edge of Tomorrow could be loosely described as big-budget, sci-fi ""Groundhog Day"". Tom Cruise plays ""William Cage"", a soldier who's far from combat-ready, but winds up on the front lines of a major invasion against an alien force known as ""Mimics"". Cage doesn't last very long once the battle begins, but just as he's being finished off, he wakes up in the previous day. Now caught in a time loop that brings him back to that same point every time he dies, Cage has to use this strange ability to help win the war.<br/><br/>Cruise crushes this role. No other way to look at it. You find yourself interested in Cage from the beginning, and become vested in Cage's unique growth through experience. He's funny, he nails the action scenes, and he brings some good weight to the emotional points. Emily Blunt Official also nails her role as the tough-as-nails soldier that teams up with Cage, and they work very well together.<br/><br/>Although the story makes several departures from the original novel, make no mistake – this movie is entertaining. The action is intense without having too much shaky-cam, and the story has a great pace to it. You'd worry that a movie that's caught in a time loop would involve repeating the same scenes over and over, but they manage to keep repeating scenes fresh, or simply plow forward while implying that they've done this before. You'll never get bored.<br/><br/>The visuals are GORGEOUS, and I'd fully recommend IMAX or 3D for this one. The beach battlefield scenes in particular are beautifully shot.<br/><br/>For my money, this is the best Tom Cruise film of the last decade, for sure, and it feels like he took great enjoyment in making this one.

We know there is an alien invasion coming but we just ""know"" it, we don't ""feel"" it. Probably because we don't really know what Cage (Again, not Nic, nice try) cares about, we don't see him care about anything, except wining the war (maybe at some point we feel that he loves Rita, but it was not very well developed, things happened a little bit rush in emotional development). <br/><br/>As a male audience, I wasn't stunned but still completely satisfied, maybe I just care about the plot and action more than the emotion (Just like Liman's first Bourne, emotional development was lacking while the plot and action are stunning).

","Lives up to expectations, Edge of Tomorrow is bold, brutal and a bloody good time with Tom Cruise as you've never seen him before. 2014 is shaping up to be a truly good year for film and this is a highlight, and also stands as Doug Liman's finest piece of work. <br/><br/>When Earth is invaded by a vicious alien race known as the ""Mimics"", the coast of France becomes the front line. On that front line is Lt. Bill Cage, an inexperienced coward who is De-ranked and forced to fight, and dies within five minutes. Then, he wakes. Cage has been in contact with the blood of the Mimics, he has the ability to reset the day upon dying. He lives, he dies and he repeats the day, getting stronger and more skilled along the way, now it's up to Cage and the ultimate warrior Rita Vrataski to stop the invasion. Some of my favourite films feature time loop scenarios, from Source Code to Triangle, and now Edge Of Tomorrow is among them, reinvigorating the repeat narrative adding a fresh twist and style to it. The back-story behind the resetting the day is superbly explained, the amount of times Cage comes back never gets boring, just more and more exciting, this is a fully fleshed out story. <br/><br/>I hate it when people say that they ""feel part of the film"", it gets annoying but I'm going to contradict that and say that I truly felt immersed into this movie, Edge Of Tomorrow's enormous and chaotic war scenes are so big and open, you feel like you're on the front line with Cage: Shocked, amazed and blown away. The build-up is tremendous, it sets up the anticipation and fear of going into battle, and when the drop ships rise into the sky and make their way to the beach you know you're in for a spectacle. The cinematography and camera-work is phenomenal, mostly consisting of wide shots and establishing shots, every angle of chaos is captured. The camera-work moves briskly, any moment the Mimics are going to hit, you are just waiting for something to go down and Doug Liman sets the action up with style. The explosions, the meteors, the gunfire, sand lifting up into the air, it's beautiful mess. Watching Tom Cruise run from a fireball in an Exo-Suit brought out the inner child in me, and when he dives into Rita, taking out two Mimics before the drop ships explodes left me gob-smacked. The action shots here are enough to make Michael Bay green with envy, and in 3D the experience is wholly enveloping and one of the best uses of the technology in a while. <br/><br/>The special effects are something to behold and the use of them is in most scenes, but the cast don't fall behind, they ignite the screen. Tom Cruise is not playing a tough, cool guy, he brings a sense of isolation to the screen, he's out of his comfort zone completely and I loved his ignorance in the earlier scenes, he develops however but still remains rather reserved but one hell of a fighter, Cruise's performance is excellent. Emily Blunt is one big factor for me seeing this movie, God she's talented and in this latest adventure, a total bad-ass. She plays Rita Vrataski, the poster girl for the war, but behind the hero is a emotionally cut off woman, watch her in other movies and you can see how extensive her range is. She looks ferocious in an robotic suit, and watching Blunt fight with a modified helicopter blade brought me joy! If anything, a cast has never looked so good before, the suits are the coolest and best designed pieces of kit I've seen in a film, and the turmoil the cast went through wearing these chunky suits is worth it, they look like proper fighters. <br/><br/>This is a proper blockbuster, filled with mind blowing special effects, jaw dropping 3D effects, tremendous storytelling and a whopper of a cast who really perform at their A- Game. Tom Cruise is a movie star that remains eminently watchable, as is Emily Blunt who continues to amaze, these two are a dream team, and Director Doug Liman utilises his big budget to perfection."

","I went into this movie with low expectations. I hadn't read the synopsis or watched the trailer but I am a sucker for Science Fiction, good or bad, I like to watch it. About 15 minutes in I found myself in an odd situation, because what I was seeing on screen was good, more than good, entertaining. My curiosity was peaked and I genuinely wanted to know what was going on and what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>When the loop began I didn't know this movie involved time travel so I started thinking, ""maybe it's a virtual training simulation? "", then I thought, ""no maybe he is stuck inside his head?"". It was fun not knowing, so I wish they hadn't given so much away in the trailers and synopsis. I have to go see this movie again it was really entertaining, really engaging, and I have tons to talk about with everyone who has seen it.<br/><br/>*Important Information * This movie is based on a Light Novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka written in 2004 entitled ""All you need is Kill"". You can find the credit under the Writers section of IMDb, click on ""2 more credits"" then the very last writing credit is for Hiroshi. I found more information on the wiki here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_You_Need_Is_Kill. I love Anime, most of which is based of Light Novel or Manga. I hope we see more adaptions like this, the movie proves Anime and Manga aren't just cartoons and comics geared toward children, they are diverse mediums and many are used to share deep and intense stories and characters."
"Nokitron","7","36","68","28 May 2014"," Like Groundhog Day with guns
","So Tom Cruise has been back again with the latest sci-fi, Edge of Tomorrow. After his great performance in Oblivion, he made it again in this comedy-filled tasty Twinkie. Not to say this film is all comedy,and there was too much action to categorize it as nice drama movie. What I was going to say is, this movie has all the movie needs to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>Private Cage is brought down to warfare against aliens, without reading ""Exoskeleton Suit for Dummies"" first. But oh my, he had this curse that Phil had in Punxsutawney that he had to die and respawn, and over and over and (over) again that he granted from an alien he killed.<br/><br/>I don't know, but apparently, the screenwriter was inspired by ""Groundhog Day"", which is a good thing. The pace really done well by describing Cage deals with time-loop. There are many possibilities of a man's mind could think to take advantage of a powerful curse, and I think they explore this well, just like Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>Good thing comes from the characters. They are lovable and some of them have great quotes. Emily Blunt really nailed the character of a hard-soldier that shared same fate with Cage in the past. She really balanced Tom Cruise's performance.<br/><br/>But enough exaggerating, shall I? There are minus-es too. Always. The first one is the lack of pre-invasion imaging of Earth(I am not really sure for this one, because I missed first five minutes of the movie). Damn, they should have made the detail about the mimic's purpose and maybe, a little twist in the credits that could open a gate for sequels (duh!). The second, well, I think there is no second minus.<br/><br/>Even it is not perfect, I believe they have exceeded the edge of making a sci-fi well-balanced, either from the storyline and action. Really worth to watch in cinema. And btw, forget Godzilla, the storyline sucks.(no h8 kaiju fans)"

"The_Strangeler","8","11","18","25 August 2014"," Not quite perfect, but darn close.
","The dialogue, direction and editing often leave something to be desired, as do a few of the supporting players. One in particular seems to think he's in a different movie. And the ending, while fitting and satisfying, could have benefited from better lighting. Most of these problems stem from inexperience rather than incompetence, and forgiveness is easy. Next time will be even better, right?<br/><br/>That aside, Edge of Tomorrow is by far the best ""blockbuster"" movie since the heyday of Spielberg. It is intelligent, clever, exciting and fascinating. This movie seems determined to treat its audience with respect, something that doesn't go unnoticed and unappreciated.<br/><br/>Cast-wise, the 50-something Tom Cruise amazes as the still utterly believable coward-turned-action man, Major Bill Cage. Emily Blunt's bitter war hero, Sergeant Rita Vrataski is simply superb. Brendan Gleeson's weary-but-determined General Brigham is unnerving yet sympathetic, and Bill Paxton's Master Sergeant Farell is a real hoot.<br/><br/>Cruise and Blunt realistically portray characters who are (and have become) tough and heroic only as a result of long and bitter experience. Anti-superheroes, you could say. The transformation of Cruise's Cage is particularly well-handled, but Blunt's Vrataski is his equal in every way.<br/><br/>They are all clearly having a lot of fun with the opportunity to constantly tweak the same lines, even when much of that dialogue ought to be better.<br/><br/>The production and art design does an marvelous job of evoking a genuinely anxious and desperate war time vibe, one too rarely seen and felt in modern cinema. All the London of this movie needs is a bit of Vera Lynn and some portraits of Winston Churchill for completeness.<br/><br/>It may be that this very obvious non-American focus is the reason Edge of Tomorrow failed to catch alight in the US market. Cruise is the sole American lead, and he spends much of the movie as a gibbering coward, confused and bewildered, while an international army laughs. This is not Captain America.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it could be just that this movie was lost in the usual seasonal deluge of big, loud, and mind-numbingly stupid blockbusters.<br/><br/>Whatever the reason, it's a shame, because Edge of Tomorrow is a genuine classic."

","With both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt I was fairly certain I would like the movie, but I actually loved it. The story keeps you guessing what is going to happen next - but I won't get into the details and ruin any of the many surprises. <br/><br/>Cruise and Blunt play their unusual characters very well, but we also have a great supporting cast including Brendan Gleeson and Bill Paxton and many lesser-known actors all delivering their lines well. <br/><br/>We saw the 3-D version because of the convenience of the start time, although I have never been a fan of 3-D. I'm fairly confident that the 2-D version would be just as entertaining because it's such a cool story. But the 3-D was enjoyable and helped the movie a bit - I think because it was not really an in-your-face 3-D despite this movie having a lot of action scenes.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a futuristic doomsday scenario (are you getting tired of them?), but this one is different and I found a lot of laugh-out-loud humor in it. <br/><br/>I highly recommend it!"

","Awesome, original and creative movie. Great action, awesome looking aliens, it was intense and had some BEASTLY scenes. Great acting and good character depth. (2 viewings)<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/>
I was not a huge fan of the ending. At first I thought it made no sense that he was able to reset even farther back in time than all prior resets. And also that what happened to the Omega would still apply but the humans get reset back to life. After reading some stuff online I found out that the reason he was reset to an earlier time is because the final battle happened the night before the beach invasion from when he got his original powers and timeline. I am also okay with the possible explanation that when the Alpha dies the Omega resets, but when the Omega dies it stays dead while still giving off one last reset. I now understand it better and it makes sense for the most part but still not entirely. And it just seemed like a conveniently happy ending when I thought him sacrificing himself would have been an awesome ending and a good completion to his character arch.<br/><br/>Here is something I read on screenrant that explains everything I am saying perfectly:<br/><br/>""There is not one clear-cut explanation for how the final reset could start hours earlier and incorporate the destruction of the mimics, but leave every other variable unchanged. Time travel logic is always a can of worms, meaning that viewers should have no problem coming up with their own ways of explaining the ending. Still, based on the limited information within the film, the end result is a paradox - one that ultimately provides the audience with a (semi-)happy ending at the expense of a more straightforward story of sacrifice that fits within the previously established rules"""
"cinematic_aficionado","7","17","33","30 May 2014"," Intelligent science fiction
","What if humanity faced an enemy that could control/manipulate time? What would the best response be? This is the main premise of this film. At first, the whole idea of an alien invasion sounded unappealing as it a used and abused theme. In this case however it has been intelligently reworked.<br/><br/>Initially, it appeared as just another Tom Cruise movie since the first 10 minutes were about his refusal to join a combat unit by being his usual charming self. Following this and having been forced into battle, he soon dies but that rather than being the end it was just the beginning.<br/><br/>As soon as he died, his final day restarted. Again and again. He encounters the same people and has the same conversations all over again. The initial shock and disbelief were followed by learning to use this to his advantage in order to help win the war. My favourite bit of this film is the smart way in which the main character's final day was rebooted without ever becoming tiresome.<br/><br/>So whilst it has all the elements of a blockbuster, it also shows that when you elegantly present the story it can really add to the experience."

","Take the 1993 classic Bill Murray flick and make the short furry guy the star minus the comedy and include lots of guns and you have Edge of Tomorrow. Interesting in theory except it completely throws the entire concept of linear time out the window with the 2nd or 3rd revival. If the actions of a single person do not change the outcome of everyone around them then this movie makes perfect sense. Why altering ones choices does not result in a completely different outcome is completely against the theory it is based on (but it is still entertaining to watch which is why it got a 6 instead of much lower). If looking for something intellectually stimulating this is not the answer. Want stuff that blows up and is loosely based off of sci-fi folk-lore this is the movie for you!!!"

","I went with my wife. She generally tolerates coming along to my go to genre as long as we get to go to an art house flick etc occasionally. She was very sceptical as the movie started out... thinking that this was just going to be another typical scifi/action, but from the moment the movie shifted into second gear she was enthralled. <br/><br/>It is an original piece with an excellent story and exquisite direction. The time travel/repeat concepts are handled superbly and it is thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining the whole way through... even quite funny at times. Tom cruise really nails the main character cage and you really get a feel for the psychological effects that he would likely be experiencing in the situation. It is slightly different start for him in that he is initially an unwilling hero... which I think makes it even cooler. Emily is also great in her role and definitely on par with Tom... not to mention smoking hot! There is a subtle line of romance between their characters which is just perfect. I think the emotional depth was incredible given the difficulty of the repeating day scenario, which doesn't even feel like a repeat... but you'll have to watch it to understand. <br/><br/>Kudos to the editors too!<br/><br/>My only criticism would be that the aliens seem little omnipotent at times but then they aren't at other times... presumably to suit the story.

"tedg","Null","7","12","25 February 2015"," Combat with Explicit Watchers
","Superficially, this has what it needs to be a financial success: novel aliens, lots of combat, competence all around and *the smile.*<br/><br/>But it also has advanced interesting, structure. This structure did not originate in the movie community, it should be noted. The source is a novel, later adapted to a comic.<br/><br/>Think of it this way, in film terms: traditional noir has an innocent man being plucked out of nowhere to be manipulated for our entertainment. We as watchers become complicit. Here, we have aliens doing the manipulation with us. They are aptly called *mimics,* with the capability of planting insights into humans to deceive them.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, the goal becomes to kill the master watcher/manipulator, thereby *winning.* The device is the accidental transfer of story replay from a mimic to our character.<br/><br/>We also meet a woman who was fooled in a previous episode (that we only hear about) and so becomes what we would call a movie celebrity.<br/><br/>And the insights our players get? They are not much different than movies, played over and over again, each time with our hapless hero becoming more in control. <br/><br/>Since Welles wrapped up the phase during which we had true noir, we have had an amazing variety of structural experiments that elaborate or use the device. This one is novel because it places avatars of the audience on screen as combatants and mixes the role of noir hero with their watcher capabilities.<br/><br/>Many viewers compare it to Groundhog Day, but the essentials are quite different. In that construction, it started as a movie (a TeeVee report), but quickly became a kind of coming of age story. Repeated second chances.<br/><br/>No one else on screen had insight into or control over what was going on. This film is profoundly different, having all those explicit in what we see.<br/><br/>This sophistication makes my case that the kinds of noir folds are innovating, evolving quickly. Would a mainstream audience of 15 years ago have accepted this movie? I suppose not, but it all makes sense today to even the most casual viewer."
"Josh_Friesen","7","7","12","20 June 2014"," More than a Sum of its Parts
","Weeks after release, I know something that Tom Cruise couldn't foresee; The Edge of Tomorrow would bomb in America. Costing an estimated $178 million, it only recovered $28 million opening weekend getting beat by a movie made for less than a tenth of its budget; The Fault in Our Stars. This failure could be attributed to Tom Cruise's falling star power (especially among teens), however I think it is due to the inability of the posters and trailers to capture how much fun the movie's formula is.<br/><br/>Based on the novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka (which would have been a better title) The Edge of Tomorrow combines a number of sci-fi concepts and devices with the time loop effect popularized by Groundhog Day. While nearly everything in the film is borrowed from other sources, the way the film combines them is never dull.<br/><br/>The film opens with Tom Cruise as Cage, a slimy war recruiter and military PR man, delivering lines of expository dialogue. We are efficiently brought up to speed with what is happening. The world is under attack by aliens, Europe has been taken over and the world is launching a unified last ditch effort to save mankind. It's the kind of background that is familiar to the genre and Doug Liman recognizes this and sends us immediately into the action.<br/><br/>The war effort appears to be headed by General Brigham (Brendon Gleeson) who sends Cage to the front lines. The scene feels forced. It's essentially a plot mechanic to get Cruise into the fight. After a brief introduction of some (very) flat supporting characters the battle begins. Cage manages to survive long enough to kill a large blue alien that melts acid over his face. This provides Cage with the Groundhog Day powers; every time he dies the day repeats. The twist is that he must die or else he loses them.<br/><br/>Cruise's performance works as he transitions from a rookie recruit to a killing machine with the help of macho Emily Blunt. The pair's chemistry is one of the reason's the film succeeds. The fight/die/repeat mechanic makes the incredible fight sequences more believable and at times surprisingly funny. <br/><br/>While the film reminds us it is a Hollywood production with a predictably cliché ending, when the action is going Tom Cruise shows us why he's one the best. While individual pieces are nothing original, the film adds up to more than a sum of its parts."
"FilmMuscle","8","7","12","11 June 2014"," The Must-See Blockbuster of the Summer
","Summer has been the staple season for the studios' uninspired, unoriginal, and money-driven projects, but that rare moment when a decent blockbuster comes along that completely contradicts all three of those points is the moment of unimaginable relief. Edge of Tomorrow is very much that rare moment for this year's summer, but that shouldn't be surprising considering the fact that Tom Cruise almost always chooses the best projects even when they're primarily action flicks. In this case, the movie starts off incredibly strong as you remain fascinated, trying to figure out what exactly is transpiring on-screen while being tossed into the very heat of the moment. <br/><br/>The spectacle benefits from the likable and charismatic presence of Tom Cruise, portraying a respected officer of the US army named (Major) William Cage who is suddenly commanded to enter the front lines of the most heated destination in the current war between men and alien: France. He is understandably frightened—very much so to the point where he desperately attempts to convince the General otherwise and avoid this disposition at all costs (even reaching the extent of blackmailing this General). Unfortunately, his persuasive skills falter, and thus, he wakes up at an army base soon thereafter, fully unprepared as he heads into combat in a robust exosuit with his fellow soldiers. Eventually, Cage discovers that he wields a terribly powerful, yet utterly outlandish, power that allows him to wake up at a particular point in the day every time he diesin any circumstance. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow features a refreshingly unique story and instead of simply duplicating Groundhog Day's style and structure like many accused it of doing before even seeing the film, it focuses on Tom Cruise's incessant string of deaths (presented more lightheartedly than it sounds) which undeniably helps keep the film fresh and interesting. The thrilling picture boasts a very tight and smart script that excellently guides the viewers through a complex and original plot without stumbling and bewildering us, cleverly maneuvering around any trap that might tire the audience due to the repetition that's infused in its concept. It does so by constantly and creatively finding new ways to continue amusing and intriguing the audience, including taking advantage of the witty humor that the ideas of such a story provoke. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt brings her extraordinary acting chops and newfound badassery to unite with Tom Cruise's character and fight this highly threatening enemy side-by-side. The pairing generates astonishing chemistry that results in some terrific, heartfelt, and hilarious moments between the two. In addition, the film also possesses a very impressive look to it through its filmic grayness and grit, featuring some truly exciting action sequences where all kinds of objects and beings fly past the camera while water and dirt is spattering the screen. In other words, this production is beautifully intense. The enemies of this narrative (called Mimics) are tremendously terrifying; their elastic, arachnid- like appearance already inspires sheer panic, but as soon as they start effortlessly swarming and killing every soldier in their sight, you perfectly realize that these are not just the standard summer blockbuster villains that are easily fought off by a heroic and honorable protagonist. <br/><br/>With that being said, after a slew of intelligent twists and turns, this Sci-fi extravaganza culminated unsatisfyingly, heavily compromising when it came time to wrap up. The reluctance to a darker finish is ridiculous and certainly didn't fit the confident and bleak direction the narrative promised. You could tell how unfitting it was just by glancing at its source material—a Japanese novel titled All You Need Is Kill, which contains a far darker ending, but obviously Hollywood thought it was too large of a risk since their mentality that every movie should end as a crowd-pleaser still remains. Even though its climax was delivered weakly and insecurely, Edge of Tomorrow—as a whole— is undoubtedly the best summer blockbuster so far, exceptionally balancing pure fun, humor, and a seriously thought-provoking story."

","...without being repetitive.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are amazing. It has the same concept as Groundhog Day, but then with much more guns, logic and action.<br/><br/>If you're looking for romance though, you wouldn't find it here. Eventually, there is a little chemistry between Cage and Rita, but the explosive action takes up the biggest part of the screen. And that's for the best, because to force a love story into a huge action movie would be a waste.<br/><br/>I just saw this in the cinema, en made an account to make sure I can't blame myself if this movie drops under 8 stars.<br/><br/>Great story, great actors, great VFX. That's all I can say. Go see it."
"rmax304823","6","14","29","31 October 2015"," Deja Vu.
","This is one of those movies where you either have to pay careful attention to the plot or forget about the details and allow yourself to be swept up in the extravagant CGis. The viewer gets the feeling that some higher-echelon personnel at the studio watched ""Groundhog Day"" again and thought it was, well, just a colossal movie except for three things: (1) No CGIs, (2) No action, and (3) Too full of ""character arc."" <br/><br/>So we have a futuristic movie about a deskbound Marine Corps officer (Cruise) who is ordered to take part in an maximum effort attack on the Mimics who have invaded earth and must be destroyed on a battlefield with the resonant name of Verdun. Don't worry about the Mimics. They don't mimic anybody. They're just lightning-fast CGIs that look like overgrown woolly viruses. They're all managed by a central time-controlling apparatus called Omega. Verdun, okay. It's deliberate. But I take it as a coincidence that the thing controlling time carries the name of a famous wrist watch.<br/><br/>Eons ago, the movie critics were disappointed in a film called ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" because they were promised computer-generated images and all they got were a few seconds of a choo-choo train plowing through the night. Even by 1975, in the first remake of ""King Kong,"" there was muttering in critical circles that the giant ape was supposed to be a CGI and instead he was almost always a man in a gorilla suit -- a very well done gorilla suit, but still a gorilla suit.<br/><br/>I get a feeling that the time may have come to reconsider the value of CGIs. They do miraculous things for a movie when they're judiciously used. But now they're becoming excuses to build a movie around.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad movie as far as that goes. Tom Cruise remains a lightweight but not irritating presence. Emily Blunt, wearing little make up and with her hair, now blond, tied back is hardly recognizable. She always looks serious too. When she tries to smile, one almost hears the creaking of long-unused facial muscles. The temporals groan in agony. However, I like Emily Blunt a lot. She has asymmetrical features, and anyway someone who looks as serious as often as she does can't possibly be that serious.<br/><br/>But, man, is the imagery tiresome. Does everybody in the future have to wear those bulky suits made of metal and plastic with weapons built into the forearms and tiny iPods stuck all over the outside? People are whipped around by blows and blast at such a speed that inertia would tear their heads off. And they can fall the height of the Sears Tower and land alive with no more than a plop. Really.<br/><br/>It has moments designed to be amusing. Death is taken very lightly. Cruise doesn't simply fall asleep to start the day over again, like Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day."" He has to be killed. His colleague Blunt knows this. So every time they get into hot water she takes out her automatic and dispassionately shoots him in the head. Over hundreds of new days, Cruise is both frightened and bored by being shot in the head by a friend.<br/><br/>It's kind of enjoyable in its own dumb way. Bill Murray had a goal in ""Groundhog Day"" -- to romance Andy MacDowell, and he finally succeeds. Cruise and Blunt have a goal too -- putting Omega out of business, and they succeed too. Best performance: Brendan Gleeson as the shabbiest Marine Corps general in creation, now and forever, and the most subtle actor in the cast."

","Tom Cruise has not up until this movie been accredited for his work in the sci-fi genre. This changes after Edge of tomorrow. Perhaps the best concept of any sci-fi movie in the last 10 years, it actually makes sense for the most part. Acting by Tom is spot on, he hits the right mimics all the time, his reactions predictable, yet still manage to impress and as the movie goes on, they only get better. Emily Blunt is incredible both in the beauty and in the acting department. The supporting cast is pretty good, the 'get on your feet maggot' scenes never fail to make you at least giggle if not laugh out loud. The quality is amazing, the CGI is done perfectly, really crisp. I believe this to be among the best Tom Cruise movies, but it is definitely his best sci-fi movie yet. It's always nice to see new blockbuster movies in the sci-fi department and Tom Cruise has done a splendid job with that. Why this movie grossed less than some other ones that weren't even close to being this good is beyond me. 10/10"
"MasterFantastic","9","6","10","25 June 2014"," Solidly suspenseful, funny, worth seeing
","I'll be honest. I am not a Tom Cruise fan. Never have been. Watching him self-destruct on talk shows is riveting in an embarrassing sort of way. Having said that, he can do no wrong in this movie. Think Groundhog Day meets the Apocalypse and you have Edge of Tomorrow.<br/><br/>Essentially, we have a bunch of nasty aliens that have invaded the Earth, we have to find their weak spot and kill them, and Tom Cruise is the guy who does just that. How he gets to the end result is where the fun begins. Playing somewhat against the heroic type, Cruise is Major Cage, a soldier who is afraid of conflict and has never known combat. He somehow gets caught in a time loop where he is forced to go through living and getting killed and being brought back all over again until he learns the skills, gains the proper mindset, and gets it right.<br/><br/>There's really nothing new here, but how it's handled makes it all fresh and new somehow. Doug Liman (director) and his editor makes the learning process funny, engaging, yet they never forget to show the audience how horrible war really is--aliens or not--and the horror of it all is that Cruise's character has to submit himself to the indignity of being crushed, shot, stabbed, or mutilated in some way before he figures out what must be done.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt matches him every step of the way as his trainer and possible future girlfriend. The rest of the cast is excellent, the music is solid, and of course, the special effects are solid and chilling. But Cruise is really the whole show, and he more than convincingly portrays, as his name suggests, a person caught in a cage not of his own making, yet somehow develops the courage and wherewithal to break out. Worth seeing, plot holes aside."

","I loved this movie. Clever, spectacular, moving, funny and violent. Loads of action. Flawless special effects. Huge battles. Hideous aliens. A platoon of totally convincing obnoxious British squaddies with shoulder mounted smart cannon.<br/><br/>The mind-bending narrative is gotten across fairly clearly but you do have to think hard, though thankfully not as hard as Twelve Monkeys which actually gave me a headache. Every performance is spot-on and I think Cruise is getting better as he gets older. Amidst all the gory hyper-violence his sense of humour is perfectly judged enough to make you believe in the character.<br/><br/>I think Tom Cruise is the only A-list actor who consistently picks good sci-fi scripts. This one is brilliant."

","I have been anticipating to see Edge of Tomorrow formerly known as All You Need is Kill and words cannot describe how much I loved every second of it and had to watch this incredible movie over and over again. It has the elements of a successful sci-fi film combined with action, humor and drama that can keep you on the edge of your seat thanks to its unique script about Major Bill Cage who finds himself resetting the day every time he dies in a battle against aliens. Edge of Tomorrow is the first Hollywood picture to be based on a Japanese Manga, and hats off to Tom Cruise who remains as the best movie star after three decades and still makes great movies while doing his own stunts and showing his talents in comedy along with Bill Paxton, Emily Blunt and Noah Taylor. I adore this movie and I've seen it at least six times and looking forward to own it forever on DVD. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow deserves 10 stars."
"brent_or","9","6","10","18 June 2014"," A Very Good Sci-Fi/Character/Action Film
","If you are on the fence about seeing Edge of Tomorrow in the theater, I encourage you to give it a chance. It's a very good film that successfully balances story, characters and action. The specific plot is unusual enough to transcend the clichés that many sci-fi films get stuck in and the lead performances by Cruise and Blunt are excellent. They have great chemistry together.<br/><br/>There is plenty of all-out action and the visual effects do a good job of mixing believably utilitarian designs with some very strange alien imagery. If you're looking for thrills, there are plenty of those. But the best thing about this film, in my opinion, is that the characters are engaging. I also appreciate how the story is specific and nuanced, even though the stakes themselves are set on a large scale. There is a nice sort of intimacy at work here.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, an easy way to describe Edge of Tomorrow would be as a mix of Groundhog Day with Starship Troopers/Aliens. If you are like me, that is a great hook. Anyway, this film makes good on its potential deserves much better at the box office than its opening weekend, and I hope that the positive word of mouth gives it some staying power. As far as this type of film goes, this is one of the better examples, and well worth seeing."
"invernessmovieclub","9","6","10","11 June 2014"," THIS is why we go to the movies!
","Why do we go to the movies? To be entertained, to laugh, to be thrilled and to be pulled into a situation that we will never experience ourselves. Edge of Tomorrow doesn't just meet the above criteria, it smashes it and is one of the best and most surprising movies of the year. <br/><br/>The introduction explains that humanity is battling an alien force known as the ""Mimics"" who have swiftly swallowed most of Europe and Russia. Tom Cruise plays William Cage, a wimpy PR strategist for the United Defence Force, who has never seen a day of combat in his life and is content to sit out as American troops pour into England to assist the fight as mankind gather for one last stand on the beaches of Normandy. After upsetting the top ranking officer, Cage finds himself cast into the frontline of battle in a metal exo-suit. Unfortunately for the troops it is a slaughter and cries of ""they shouldn't even know we were coming"" are heard among the soldiers. Within five minutes Cage is dead along with every other soldier on the beach. <br/><br/>Then he wakes up on the day before battle and is again thrust into action before swiftly being killed off again. And of course he wakes up again then dies and wakes up and dies and wakes up and so on and so on. Each time he re-visits the same battle he learns more about the enemy and figures out how to stay alive slightly longer. If you're looking for a comparison it is Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is excellent in the role – it is refreshing to see him as a smug pathetic coward who grows into an action hero – it is his best role in years. Cruise teams up with Emily Blunt – also excellent who clearly spent a lot of time in the gym whilst preparing for her character of battle hardened soldier Rita, nicknamed Full Metal B***h. She agrees to train Cage every day and soon discover they share a connection which just might win the war and save mankind. <br/><br/>The action scenes are fast paced and blistering – the Mimics are an unstoppable force of sci-fi cinema and the beach battles are brilliantly rendered by director Doug Liman who has adapted the story from an obscure Japanese story called All You Need is Kill. Although the body count is regularly high, it isn't a violent movie. To the contrary, it is a very entertaining and even laugh out loud funny in places as Rita often discovers the most efficient way to handle Cage is to kill him repeatedly and ""re-set"". <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow, although not totally original (What is these days?), it is entirely refreshing to see a big budget Hollywood blockbuster that isn't a sequel, re-boot or comic book adaption. It is one of the most enjoyable films you'll experience all year. In short, THIS is why we go to the movies!"

This is the kind of drama and has the kind of subtle comedy that I love to see in a movie. The action was good and paced nicely with the irony of the storyline. You see Tom Cruise's character change and grow as the movie progresses and that's good.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is spot on. I didn't see actors, I saw characters. Good fun. Enough said for me."

The very end is a bit weak and unsatisfying though not enough to wreck the film.

"TheFilmGuy1","8","9","17","28 September 2014"," This Is What The Hollywood Blockbuster Should Be
","In my eyes, Edge Of Tomorrow is an example of what a Hollywood blockbuster should be. It can be fun and full of action, but it also has an interesting plot that makes you think a little bit, and the acting is really good. This movie shows that just because there's action in the script, doesn't mean that all you include is big explosions in order to pull people into seeing it.<br/><br/>This movie has a simple premise. A man ends up obtaining the power to reset the day when he dies, giving him the chance to save the world from invading aliens. Yes, similar to Groundhog Day, but it's really well done. They establish certain events happening within this single day, allowing them to do some creative and often hilarious things when we first see Cruise' character relive those events. He will say things to people before they even say it themselves, try to save people in battle, and even train in order to become a better fighter. It also embraces a lot of humour, in one scene showing Cruise with epic music trying to learn from his mistakes, but constantly getting killed in slightly embarrassing ways, cutting the music, and then cutting back to the same scene but where he does it properly, the music starting up again. It made me laugh out loud many times. The film also occasionally has Cruise say things like ""we tried to do that before and it didn't work"", implying that he had experienced many failed attempts before that we as an audience didn't need to see but we now know. It's really smart about how much failure it shows us versus how much of his progression we see. There are a few twists and turns here that help make the plot more interesting as well. Also, a lot of people complain about the ending, but I think it works perfectly because of all we have been through with the characters.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. Tom Cruise starts off as a wimpy guy who really doesn't want to fight and doesn't seem like a hero. But as the film goes along, he becomes braver and more heroic, making you like him more and more. Emily Blunt is also extremely good. What I love about her character is that she is really bad-ass and strong, BUT it isn't done in a ham-fisted, ""girls can be tough too"" kind of way. She is a tough character that just happens to be a girl, and that's what modern movies need. Enough of those silly characters that try so hard to empower women that they seem laughable. Give us REAL strong and tough girl characters like this, and women will feel empower for real! There is also a bit of a love plot going on with Cruise and Blunts' characters, BUT it doesn't over take the film and doesn't feel unnecessary. <br/><br/>Perhaps my only complaint is that while the CGI is good and there can be some interesting things to look at, the movie has a bit of the typical Hollywood boring cinematography. Comparing this to Oblivion, another beautiful Tom Cruise sci-fi film that came out recently, it just feels slightly uninspired at time. But it does get the job done and has some really cool action sequences, like the caravan alien chase and a lot of the beach invasion scenes. <br/><br/>Overall I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes sci- fi, action, or anyone who wants to watch a good film that you will have fun with. It's highly enjoyable, well done, and easily accessible. It's exactly what a big budget Hollywood movie should be."
"cameraslie","9","9","17","28 May 2014"," Time travel and action combined perfectly!
","Everyday Cage wakes up and has to re earn the support and trust of his comrades, as well as remember what went wrong last time round on the battlefield. Similarly to 50 First Dates, we see how a first impression with a stranger can change a relationship, and with teamwork essential in battle, this is Cage's primary challenge. Rita (Emily Blunt) and Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton) are particularly unforgiving and difficult to win over.<br/><br/>Similarly to Butterfly Effect, each time he changes approach, the effect he wants carries the risk of side effects. <br/><br/>This film combines time travel and action more effectively than anything I've seen before. The 2 exist in perfect harmony, in contrast to say, the Terminator series, which will always pop up as an all-time great for time travel action films, but uses the time travel only in its openings, then leaves the rest of the films to be action films. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow sees Cage (Tom Cruise) repeatedly attempt to win a battle, during which, if he dies, he is re awakened and given another chance. It has right amount of humour to entertain briefly, then let us focus on the serious mission the characters are engaged in.<br/><br/>We are cleverly left wondering what we've missed, as the film isn't clear how many attempts at this day Cage makes - what happens on the days in between, has he tried this before, what happened last time he tried? All the while, we also see notable, gradual improvements to Cage's combat skills, thanks to the help of the film's other hero, arguably the ""real"" hero, Rita, in turn improving the film's action. We feel the film has done well to pace out his training along with the character's development.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's performance drives the film, her toughness and focus being a perfect match for her counterpart, a character who begins as a poor soldier. Her no- nonsense approach to Cage is somehow humorous, while simultaneously serious, in terms of achieving the mission objective. <br/><br/>Disappointment will be our lack of knowledge of the enemy - the humans don't tell us much about their enemy except that they are at war, and the name they have given them - mimics. The film opens with news reporting the attacks - I would rather have seen the mimic attacks myself than hear about it secondhand from the news reporters, and maybe seen them out of action more than we did.<br/><br/>We are also left feeling the character is at little risk - if Cage dies, he starts again, similar to a video game with infinite lives. Less risk can mean less reason to care if he gets it right this time.<br/><br/>Must watch movie!<br/><br/>Michael Newton<br/><br/>Cameras Lie"
"khalidabusamra","10","8","15","3 June 2014"," Edge Of Tomorrow is pure genius! MUST WATCH!!
","Excellent action movie, probably one of the best I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Cage has never seen any action and with Earth under attack from an alien invasion his job is to market hope and put a positive spin on human fatalities. He's a sort of Alastair Campbell of the future you could say, though it's unlikely that even he could have conjured up poster girl Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a tough-but-beautiful fighting legend. <br/><br/>Assuming his London trip to be just another PR go-see, Cage is horrified to discover he will be part of the first wave of troops on the beach (a timely nod to the D-Day landings) so he can report good news on the secret counter attack.<br/><br/>Refusing to accept dispatch orders from tough-talking General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson), Cage is arrested, demoted to private and sent to Heathrow for training, despite having the fighting aptitude of a BA flight attendant. Now things get really interesting for the ill-equipped soldier is sent off to France with other rejects as alien cannon fodder and he dies. Only he doesn't. <br/><br/>After ingesting the blood of the alpha alien he actually manages to kill, coward Cage is not only mentally connected to the invaders' ""hub"" but suddenly finds himself living the previous day all over again. And again... and again.<br/><br/>Think Groundhog Day with almost invincible angry seaweed aliens and you'll get the measure of this action-packed early summer blockbuster that puts Cruise back in poll position as the hero who can see off a heinous enemy while cracking jokes and smiling.<br/><br/>Just like Groundhog Day, a tight script and sharp editing allows us to see fresh versions of the same day in many ways as Cage turns into a highly-skilled soldier due to coaching from Rita, whom he meets on the battlefield. <br/><br/>Of course the day's repetition means he is always back where he started with the muscular miss in leaden combats, but Cruise and Blunt have good chemistry and the shtick never feels laboured. <br/><br/>On the contrary the whole film whizzes by and my only complaint is that forced into 3D glasses, the blasting alien shoot-outs left me feeling trapped in an Xbox game with pending nausea.<br/><br/>As this will be a recommendation for many, I advise fellow spec haters to seek out the 2D version in order not to miss this sharp, sassy, well- assembled piece of sci-fi that Tom stood in the rain to sell."

","Sometimes you just know which films aren't going to make their money back. Edge of Tomorrow is one of these films. Not because I thought it was going to be bad but because it is a high concept scifi film and audiences rarely connect to these kinds of films. The trailer didn't show much (apparently audiences hate that or find it confusing or they assume the whole movie is like that) but you can't give it all away, they already gave away too much. Idealy you should go see these films without any advance knowledge. Edge of Tomorrow is based on a Japanese graphic novel 'All you need is kill' (that was also going to be the original title of the film - a better one I think) and in essence is a combination of Groundhog day and Starship Troopers. The exoskeleton suits are actually very similar to the suits from the Starship Troopers book but weren't used in the 1997 film because it was too expensive. The time-loop concept is responsible for some great comedy (cfr Groundhog Day) and Cruise was certainly a perfect cast here. The film is very focused on the purpose of the time loop (that is what the film is about innit) but that doesn't always leave much room for sidetracking. That results in a very fast paced but incredibly well made film. The VFX are state of the art and there is plenty of action. I can highly recommend this film. It was very risky to make a 178m$ groundhog day film which unfortunately will fail at the box-office because audiences besides scifi aficionados aren't ready for it. If you want to see it in the theater (which I recommend) you'd better hurry coz it won't play long."

"gerry_barnaby","9","10","20","30 May 2014"," Amazing intense Groundhog day action sc-fi film
","Wow this film is amazing for a sc-fi action movie that full of valuable twists, surprisingly good chemistry between Cruise and Emily Blunt and it has an involving script aside of the spectacular action sequences special some of the beach scene in the battle if you could call it a battle it more like a slaughter. The movie clearly develops in the action and the riveting pace. It offers what a great blockbuster should be and it reaches that superb goal. The thing about this film as well is the Most unexpected of all , the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well which you don't expected in this type of film most of it is from Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey, but here you need to forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes role, as here he plays an entirely different character as he a reluctant hero force in to a situation he not prepared for. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also brilliant performance's to sell a great film, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real on screen this is why she a fantastic actress, here in this film she succeeds in portraying her character very well as a tough, seasoned soldier which other soldiers refer her to as ""full metal bitch"" (i'm not kidding you hear that twice!) As you see with her squad the have white skull painted on the helmets so they must be elite soldier.With her character not just being this hard ass soldier she come across with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable as the character she portraying.<br/><br/>Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great, character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before there kind of a cameo role in a way for the film. This basically is a Sc-fi film that is very fast paced & brutal with some stunning cinematography & amazing C.G.I effects on the alien design, with a Groundhog day concept that really work for the film as the whole Live ,die & repeat concept that give this film its humor & as-well as the edge this film needed. I know lot of people don't like tom cruise but this has to be his best performance to date in a film special for a blockbuster like this, it a film i can recommend watching.<br/><br/>Dislikes : I don't know if any one noticed this , but there was a flaw in the story-line at the very end of this film which didn't make scene with the way it ended it was nothing major to pull a film down because it was at the end of the film but still enough to notice it didn't make sense, other then that the whole film was brilliantly done."
"Dragonsouls","6","21","50","7 February 2015"," Overrated, but a fun film
","I've been waiting for HBO to broadcast this film for quite some time and I had high expectations based on the positive reviews this film has garnered. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed, and I'll tell you why without spoiling anything.<br/><br/>Now I won't go on and mention the lack of characterization or emotional depth. That's not why some stories are told--especially science fiction stories--which are usually always plot driven. Still, after the first twenty minutes, which happened to be contain the most engrossing moments in the film, I found myself wondering if this story would wind up as some mindless circus film and it wound up being the case.<br/><br/>The villains were very shallow things, with no motives whatsoever. And if science fiction is supposed to be plot driven, then, this film's plot could have had more depth. As a matter of fact, this wasn't even a science fiction movie at all, but rather an action movie. And so if the villain is shallow and without motives, chances are, that the hero will be shallow as well. A hero is defined by the degree of the antagonist's villainy after all. And the hero, Major Cage (played brilliantly by Tom Cruise) was just a soldier in a war, with a gift. His plight was simple. Save the world from evil robotic aliens.<br/><br/>The action was fun. I bet this looked great in the theaters. I just hoped for something more. Something more politically driven, conspiratorial, or philosophical. In the end, it's a fairly unique story, with some clever directing and cool action scenes--but that's it. I admire the script and the slow dramatic buildup that the time loop creates. Each new day that Major Cage experiences led to new discoveries and new ways for him to defeat his enemy. I may watch this again simply for Tom Cruise's excellent performance--and of course--the impressive fireworks."
"ferguson-6","6","7","13","8 June 2014"," Carpe Diem, Carpe Diem, Carpe Diem ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Doug Liman is best known for his fine work at the beginning of the ""Bourne"" franchise. His latest has so many obstacles to overcome, a tip of the cap is in order for a thriller that isn't altogether without merit.<br/><br/>These obstacles include such things the all too familiar sub-genre of alien-invasion, an overload of special effects, a familiar actress in an unfamiliar action-hero role, and above all others, the casting of the divisive Tom Cruise ... whose detractors will certainly get a kick out of the nearly endless stream of on screen deaths his character experiences. After all, what's more fun than bashing Cruise over and over and over again? On the plus side, the special effects are very well done; Emily Blunt (despite being the best tanned Brit ever) more than holds her own; and the role allows Tom Cruise to do the two things he does best: incredible stunts and action sequences, and transform from cocky d-bag to dependable, highly competent icon. Without much thought, it's pretty easy to see the similarities to his characters in Top Gun, Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men, and The Color of Money ... and of course, his recent outing in Oblivion. There is also a convenient excuse for Cruise to lose his battle helmet, an unnecessary segment of him riding his motorcycle, and of course, the patented Cruise sprint is on display.<br/><br/>The movie itself begs for the obvious comparison to Groundhog Day and Source Code, with elements of Aliens, District 9, and The Matrix. Despite all the familiarity, this one kind of works thanks to the screenplay of Christopher McQuarrie (3 other Cruise movies) based on the 2004 novel from Hiroshi Sakurazaka entitled ""All You Need is Kill"". Why the Producers chose this generic, daytime soap opera type title over the source material title is beyond me.<br/><br/>Cruise especially takes to the first half comedic moments, and that explains why the first half of the movie is much stronger than the second half. The phrase ""On your feet, Maggot"" takes on the the Sonny and Cher role from Groundhog Day, and to great effect. Supporting work from Noah Taylor, Brendan Gleeson, and (a scene chewing) Bill Paxton add sufficient distraction from the heavy action moments.<br/><br/>So whether you enjoy special effects, intense action scenes, or just watching Tom Cruise get killed time and time again, you will probably find this one entertaining enough ... even though not much will stick with you a day later."
"helmutty","8","7","13","31 May 2014"," A solid and fresh blockbuster that doesn't feel tired
","It is probably one of the freshest blockbuster for a while. Although its idea is from a Japanese novel, it does not feel bloated and tired like some franchises in this summer are suffering. The movie is what the trailers are suggesting; big-budget action-packed sci-fi movie. But what the trailers didn't reveal is its surprising sense of humour. It feels fresh because blockbusters nowadays take themselves too seriously and this doesn't. <br/><br/>The story: It surprisingly starts off without an action scene (many blockbusters like to start off with a big bang action scene). Tom Cruise plays William Cage who is suddenly put in the front line of a battle. The thing is that he is not used to combat. The action starts not long when he is plunged into the battle between alien and human. After he dies the first time, he is brought back to life again. And it goes on. That sums up the first act. Montage of big explosive action scenes and him dying over and over again. Surprisingly it doesn't feel tired and boring. I don't want spoil the second act as the truth is revealed. The third act rams up with an exciting climax. Doug Liman holds up the pacing well, things don't feel repetitive (due to different camera angles too). There is definitely a lot of action. There are times where there are explosions for the sake of a blockbuster movie. But what is nice in these action scenes, both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt have their different fighting styles. Acting wise is fine. It is nice seeing Tom acting out of his comfort zone. Emily does not have to act much except to act cool and swing into action when it is needed. Music wise is fine too.<br/><br/>Overall: So far, the blockbusters this year seem tired and rely on their own franchise to sell (Spider-Man, X-Men and upcoming Transformers etc). Edge of Tomorrow may be based on the Japanese novel but it proves to be something fresh on the big screen. It is worth a shot to watch it on big screen. It is a blockbuster that doesn't take itself too seriously and let the audience sit back and watch the action unfold without being overly complicated and bloated."

"billygoat1071","8","6","11","2 June 2014"," True Blockbuster
","Edge of Tomorrow has anything you could ask for in a Sci-Fi blockbuster. It has robots, aliens, big guns, car chases, and even Tom Cruise; mashed together into an exciting high concept story. While these elements aren't completely original, the film put these things together with plenty of personality, thus it is predictably all fun. It would have been nicer if it explored a little more deeper within its intriguing ideas to end up being a fully epic blockbuster, but Edge of Tomorrow is still quite the adventure that goes beyond the typical excess of explosions that the audience have been swallowing these days.<br/><br/>The main concept is pretty intriguing indeed. It definitely reminds you of Groundhog Day or Source Code, except it takes place in the middle of an alien invasion. This idea excellently works when it tries to make a joke out of it. The story doesn't really flesh out anything beyond the concept enough, so it's best to just play around with the repetition. When the film finally takes the logic of the loop seriously, the film lost a little of its enthusiasm and sometimes skims the details into quick montages. The mission doesn't make itself sound that interesting, and it helps that the movie fills it with gigantic weapons and car chases to gloss it over with large scale excitement. There is no denying how awesome the action scenes are, but no matter how indestructible the heroes look, there is still a sense when you don't want them to die and go back to the very start of their checkpoint again. Just the basic suspense these sequences needed. The direction moves consistently, even when the pacing has to go through several loops, its decent editing makes sure these scenes aren't as complex as they supposed to be. Witty screen writing also makes things absorbing.<br/><br/>Even the arc of the main characters aren't totally fresh. Cage is basically a man out of luck who is hooked up with various troubles then suddenly meets a much competent companion to develop a team which happens to be the only hope of mankind. In spite that it feels a little stale, how it depicts these misfits somehow becomes the special asset of the film. The actors have given everything these characters deserve. Tom Cruise hasn't been fun lately, his attempt of being a much gruff anti-hero mostly kills the momentum of his last two films. Here, he finally succeeds on what he was trying to do back then, by simply realizing the fact that he is just as ordinary as the people around him, who can get hurt and killed all of the sudden. He also bursts charisma which makes his connection with his co-stars a lot more likable.<br/><br/>There could be a larger universe behind the story that needs a deeper exploration, but it's a breath of fresh air seeing a blockbuster attaining more on story building than world building. Edge of Tomorrow is straightforwardly fun, although it's not exactly perfect, whatever the film has glossed over made the experience even better. Especially the ending which is ought to be a flaw, ends with something which turns out to be one of the greatest things I've see in a blockbuster this year. The movie is simply charming, a priceless kind of charm that seems to belong to another decade that we didn't know it hasn't wane out yet. If you don't know what I am talking about then it's alright. Just let me sum it all up for you already: Edge of Tomorrow is a good time at the movies."

","One would expect that at least few links of the plot to hold, but they are all so thin, that the whole thing falls apart. There are just so many things we have to accept ""because of reasons"", that there is nothing left to follow from logic. I can buy aliens that for some reason stick to ground, and prefer hand to hand combat, rather than projectiles or explosives, but I cannot figure out why don't the humans use more appropriate military hardware. Did they forget what a tank is? And what of intelligence? I guess we don't need to know our enemy - we just throw more people with guns at them. And apparently the whole command structure consists of one single general who worries about his public image being damaged by undertaking massive offensive against the aliens. I wont even talk about ""controlling"" time. I give it 2 only for the good visual effects."
"KuroSawWhat","5","20","50","28 May 2014"," Tomorrow, you will forget ""Edge of Tomorrow""
","If you've seen the trailers for ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" you are familiar with the basic concept. Tom Cruise's character is sent into a battle against aliens and gains the ability to re-live that day every time he dies. This quick description covers approximately 90% of what you see in ""Edge of Tomorrow.""<br/><br/>As some kind of recruiting agent, the military decides that it's a good idea to dump Tom on the front lines because...um, well that's never explained (maybe this is why humanity is losing?). Quite a lot is not explained in this movie, but let's forget about that for now, and talk about what you're supposed to concentrate on: the explosions. Over and over again, we get to see Tom run through the battlefield with Blondie McSoldier, his somewhat romantic interest and mentor in this affair. They kill aliens, he dies, and then...they kill aliens some more.<br/><br/>Over and over and over and over, explosions, shooting and Tom dying. A couple of these deaths are done in a humorous way, but overall it becomes a tiresome mechanic that long overstays its welcome. Somewhere along the way, we're told how they might possibly beat the aliens by, you guessed it, explosions, shooting and dying. Also, with the deus ex machina that they eventually use, which could have been used at any point along the way, because the film has to end eventually.<br/><br/>I don't know what else there is to say about this movie. None of the characters are developed beyond ""soldier,"" ""girl,"" drill sergeant,"" ""scientist,"" and the action becomes repetitious and boring about halfway through. To its credit, the aliens, mech armor, and battles all look very impressive. But with no background to the events, characters, or anything that's happening, I had a very difficult time becoming invested in any of it.<br/><br/>The ""Groundhog Day"" concept is not even the problem, as films such as ""Source Code"" have demonstrated. You can have action, repeating timelines, AND character development. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" falls into the usual Hollywood trap of simply throwing lots of CGI at the screen and hoping that it will be enough to carry the film. It's not. Audiences are more intelligent than this, and deserve better films."

"listofnames","8","5","9","26 June 2014"," Very entertaining sci-fi flick
","Very entertaining sci-fi flick. Starts on a slightly dodgy premise though. Basically, from out of nowhere Tom cruise's military Major is forced to fight in the front line of a major offensive against alien invaders. Even though he is a high ranking soldier who seems to have all but retired from duty in the field. He apparently has little to no active duty under his belt, at least not recently. And seems very very reticent about returning to combat. He even tries to blackmail the General to get out of it, who then attempts to arrest him but not before Cruise makes a run for it before being tazered and waking up handcuffed on an army base. All very implausible! But we can forgive and forget this as it sets us up for his recurring nightmare. <br/><br/>As you can expect Cruise's foray into onto the battlefield is disastrous and grizzly and he and many others die. Cruise is very fortunate though. He manages to luck into a very unique event which allows him to relive the previous 24 hours every time he dies. And he dies a lot, but each recurring day he lives he manages to learn a bit more and become more adept at staying alive during the battle. <br/><br/>Cruise joins forces with Emily Blunt's kick ass, sword wielding 'full metal bitch', a highly decorated war veteran. Blunts character had the same ability to relive her last 24 hours before death but has now lost it. Together they work together learning from Cruise's accumulated experiences to forge a plan to pinpoint the alien brain hiding somewhere in continental Europe! <br/><br/>Cruise slowly begins to get to know Blunt over the many recurring days they spend together. From Blunts point of view however she has only just met Cruise. Cruise of course falls in love but its believable (who wouldn't fall in love with her) and poignant, as it seems hopeless and doomed, the odds of survival seem insurmountable. <br/><br/>The journey of Cruise from inept coward to kick ass braveheart is believable and satisfying. The actions scenes are dirty and gritty and done in a realistic way, harrowing and tense. The aliens are sort of like the squiddies from the matrix only much faster and with more moving parts. Sort of like metallic shape shifting octopi. They do their menacing job well. Deadly and uncommunicative. Very unlike anything humans can understand or compare to. <br/><br/>The ending is a little Hollywood i.e. inexplicably everything turns out rosy for everyone, but without much explanation as to how. More time travel twistyness is afoot but there is no logical explanation as to why cruise appears to wake up days before anyone dies and the enemy defeated. Ah well, I cant say that it really annoyed me that much. Just left me scratching my head slightly. All in all a lot of fun."
"antoniohontoria","8","5","9","3 June 2014"," All the fun of a good video game without the grind
","Edge of Tomorrow is a ton of fun in both expected and refreshing ways. Of course, if you pay to watch a film that stars Tom Cruise as an exoskeleton-clad soldier fighting aliens in a time loop that resets the same battle over and over again; you'll surely expect to enjoy a fair amount of quality action and big explosions. You'll get tons of that, but you'll also get some pretty satisfactory intrigue and a generous side of delightfully dark humor.<br/><br/>It's no secret that this cinematic adaptation of the Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill draws inspiration from video games, not only in its concept of ""Live, Die, Repeat"", but also in its style. If you have played first person shooters the likes of Call of Duty you'll feel right at home with the immersive camera work that pulls you right into the battlefield (pun not intended). To be fair, I was also reminded of the legendary Normandy scene from Saving Private Ryan which in turn inspired Call of Duty back in the day (as much as I love video games, must give credit where credit is due).<br/><br/>The genius of director Doug Liman is how he takes only good things from these video games, while carefully avoiding all the bad bits. Only Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt (who plays a very Warhammer Space Marine-like badass, sword and everything) suffer the worst parts of replaying a level: unskippable intro cutscenes, excruciating trial an error to inch through overly difficult areas, and grinding to unlock better skills.<br/><br/>The audience, meanwhile, gets to enjoy the highlight reel of it all: spectacular set pieces and gripping revelations sandwiched with a healthy dose of humor that usually has to do with Tom Cruise resetting the time loop by dying. Even those who don't like the actor will probably enjoy Edge of Tomorrow if only because they'll get to see him die in several violent ways. All in all Tom Cruise carries the film effortlessly (he's almost 52 now, if he keeps going at this level he won't be old enough for the Expendables until he hits 90) and Emily Blunt gives a good performance too.<br/><br/>The movie is very well paced and never gets dull, but it does end up being a little disappointing in the plot department, with a couple of weak and extremely convenient plot devices and some underwhelming revelations. However, you'll more than likely forgive these problems when you get caught in the midst of Edge of Tomorrow's action-packed and surprisingly hilarious cycle of life and death.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Edge of Tomorrow is a science fiction film starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. It had a very clever plot and well-paced action scenes. What intrigued me about it was that it is based on a Japanese graphic novel (or manga) called ""All You Need Is Kill"".<br/><br/>The story is about an army officer named William Cage (Tom Cruise) who gets caught up in fighting a war against an elite alien race along side Special Forces soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). Shortly after dying the first time he is dropped into combat, he discovers that he is stuck in a time loop which repeats the same scenario over and over. Realising they can use this to their advantage, Cage and Vrataski hone their battle skills each time the loop occurs and hatch a plan to kill the aliens and win the war.<br/><br/>This concept was very cleverly executed. It was like Aliens meets Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day. When the movie wanted to be funny with jokes about deja vu, it was hilarious.

Both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt deliver outstanding, believable performances, keeping in line with the high bar This beats any sci-fi or action film released in 2014. Definitely worth your time."

"MovieAddict2016","9","4","7","23 November 2014"," Fantastic entertainment - sleek, witty, humorous, exciting.
","People really love to write off Tom Cruise in the press these days, and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" was getting all kinds of nasty publicity leading up to its release: rumours of re-shoots, bad screenings, etc. Whatever his personal beliefs may be, at the end of the day Cruise is just an actor on screen, and this movie is a firm reminder of what an enigmatic presence he is.<br/><br/>Now in his early 50s, Cruise is making some of the best action films around, and Edge of Tomorrow is no exception. Based on a manga novel published in Japan, the plot is essentially Groundhog Day by way of Starship Troopers or...something like that.<br/><br/>The movie's low point is when it tries to explain too heavily the process by which Cruise's character is able to relive the same day over and over again, because at the end of the day it's just a Macguffin to be able to explore the concept. But the movie's strength is that it places its human story first (as corny as that may sound), as Cruise's character undergoes an emotional and physical transformation. It also features a highly capable female lead, brought to life by the charismatic Emily Blunt. If this were a Michael Bay film, the role would have existed solely as a love interest, but this movie doesn't succumb to such banal (and frankly, sexist) tripe. She is a worthy presence alongside Cruise and is one of the strongest sci-fi heroines since Sigourney Weaver in Alien.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, that's the other movie this reminded me of: Aliens. Bill Paxton chewing up the scenery as a drill sergeant probably had something to do with that.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. I saw it three times. Despite the press writing it off as a colossal bomb upon release due to its modest opening, it had spectacular legs, and crossed $100 mil domestic. It ultimately wasn't the box office behemoth the studio may have wished for, but people using it as evidence of Cruise's 'failing career' may be wise to look at the full picture: its worldwide gross ranks it as one of his highest money- makers ever.<br/><br/>This movie will develop a following on home video and I wouldn't be surprised if they somehow attempt to revisit it one day, whether it's through a lower budget prequel or a spin-off or another manga. Who knows. They should probably leave well enough alone, because it's that rare sci-fi summer blockbuster that has it all: brains, wit and thrills. All the people who flocked to the latest Transformers movie would have been doing themselves a favor by seeing this instead."

","There's a scene in Edge of Tomorrow where people in a pub are talking about the possible motivations of the antagonist alien species might be, Tom Cruise responds to this by saying ""what difference does it make?"". This is obviously meant to be interepreted as a matter of factly statement about the business of fighting for your survival but I can't help but feel it's also a line put in there by the screenwriters addressed to the audience in which they're trying to tell you not to worry about the nitty gritty of plot details in a movie featuring time travel as its premise.<br/><br/>And of course, getting past the fact that time travel as a plot device doesn't hold up to any form of reasoned scrutiny it has to be said that what Edge of Tomorrow manages to do with this conceit is really enjoyable to behold. Bar a couple really tired clichés, the basic elements of plot progression and character interaction come together really nicely here. Pretty much my only major complaints about this film are the generic and utterly uninteresting enemies, a retread of the tired old mothership ending that grants our heroes an automatic victory upon its destruction, sorely lacking audio production and a miscast Brendan Gleeson who's completely out of place as a stern faced general (I have never seen him pull off a stern face).<br/><br/>It's fantastic too that practical effects are used to such a great degree and when CGI appears it rarely stands out."

","Try as one might, it is virtually impossible to discuss ""Edge of Tomorrow"" without making at least a passing reference to ""Groundhog Day,"" the 1993 comedy whose very name has become synonymous with - and, indeed, pop culture shorthand for - the act of living the same experience over and over again. <br/><br/>Directed with quirky inventiveness by Doug Liman, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" takes this concept into the realm of futuristic science fiction, using the novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka as its source of inspiration. Once again we find ourselves in the near-future, after an alien invasion has all but wiped out continental Europe. Now, it's time for the surviving nations to launch a new D-Day-type assault on the coast of France, this time with super-sophisticated weaponry and armor that may or may not stand up against this most formidable of enemies. Tom Cruise plays a glib and cowardly public relations officer who is only too eager to stand on the sidelines offering encouragement while other young men and women go off to do the fighting, but who is none too happy when he's ordered by one General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) to go take up arms himself. Things don't go too well for Major William Cage in his first foray into mortal combat - he's killed, actually - but through some inexplicable fluke of nature, he wakes up alive in the time before the battle, destined to relive the incident over and over again till he finally gets it right.<br/><br/>By far, the best element in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is the fun and lively performance by Tom Cruise, who gets to run the emotional gamut from paralyzing fear to swaggering bravado, from pleading desperation to raging cock-sureness all within the confines of a single role. In fact it's entertaining to watch how Cage's confidence grows in direct proportion to his knowledge each time he comes back from a trip to the future. Cruise has been at this sort of popcorn-entertainment gig for an awfully long time now, and it's clear he's lost none of his touch. Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton are additional standouts in an excellent cast.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as with even the better forays into big-budget movie-making, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" does eventually hit a point of diminishing returns, as we get flummoxed by the occasional plot hole and overwhelmed by a surfeit of special effects (though the CGI here is, indeed, very impressive). Still, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" has a sophistication and an intelligence rare to modern blockbusters, and it actually manages to mine a surprising amount of humor from its set-up. It doesn't insult its audience, which is saying quite a bit when it comes to the fare we're generally offered when it's summertime at the movies."

"neigenoirejz","2","18","50","18 September 2014"," Unoriginal and lazy
","In short, Edge of Tomorrow is a movie where one irrational thing happens after another with some spectacular CG in between, all of which is justified by very original concepts that we have never seen before - an alien invasion, a man reliving the same day over and over again, and Americans saving the world from destruction, which is done mostly by one guy who blows up the chief alien with some grenades. Epic stuff. There is very little back-story, very little explanation of why things happen, they just do, and we watch them happen because, well, they often involve spectacular explosions, otherworldly creatures and cool exoskeletons with built-in machine guns (awesome!). The writing and dialogues are poor (with a few exceptions) you mostly hear lines like ""we must kill the Omega"" or ""the world expects us to win"" etc. There is actually one very brief scene where our protagonist discusses the possible reasons of the alien invasion with a group of elderly people. Sadly it fell short of delivering any answers at all, and all we got from that scene was that the aliens are there, it doesn't matter why, all that matters is we must kill them. Can it get more simplistic than that?<br/><br/>Also, apparently the most powerful types of aliens (Alphas and the Omega) are physically present on Earth and in the case of Alphas - they physically take part in combat against humans. This makes little sense since if an Alpha gets killed, the killer absorbs the alien's power and can ""control the time"". The killer will also have visions that will reveal the location of the Omega. So why would they risk being killed and giving away that power? Especially since even the smaller aliens completely wreck humans, why is there need for Alphas to be present on the battlefield at all? Perhaps there is a reason for that, but the lazy writing does not help us find out. This is just one of the many plot holes in this movie.<br/><br/>TLDR: The movie has cool visual effects, ideas and concepts we've already seen many times before (even the visual style of aliens is a blatant copy-pasta), poor writing, plot holes and poor dialogues. 2/10 would not watch this crap again."

I was glued for the whole film. Quick to move into the action and establish the ground rules. I was also pleasantly surprised by the sense of humour present throughout. I'm not one for writing give-aways. Just know that Tom Cruse and Emily Blunt are great in their respective roles, killer in the action and form an easy chemistry.

","In a not so distant future, Earth has been invaded by an alien race called the Mimics. The occupiers are - of course - menacing and crazy scary, resembling the offspring of octopuses who mated with some vicious space insects, with anger management issues. <br/><br/>Humans have looked past each other's racial, religious and socio-economic differences by fighting together an up hill battle against their common enemy, and failing at it royally.<br/><br/>It seems that, no army in the world or its arsenal of weapons can match the lightning speed or ruthlessness of the Mimic forces. <br/><br/>Lt. Col. Bill Cage (Tom Cruise) has been spared from combat during most of his career however, after his sudden drop in rank, he is forced to embark on suicide mission alongside more experienced soldiers, in a last ditch effort to defend the globe against its alien invaders. Unfortunately, within a few minutes of on the ground fighting, Cage is killed.<br/><br/>For reasons unbeknown to him, Cage immediately wakes up in the previous day, reliving every single detail again, and again... and again. If this sounds like Groundhog Day, where Bill Murray's character re-lives the same day over and over until he has learned to be a better human being, thankfully that's where the similarities end.<br/><br/>Upon coming back to the last day he lived before going off into battle, Cage finds himself able to change his own reality. During one of his repeated visits to the battlefield he crosses paths with Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who upon realizing that Cage is ""special"" demands that he find her the next time he wakes up form death. <br/><br/>He does as he is told, and Vrataski takes it upon herself to mentor Cage by pushing him to his limits through intense and grueling training. After countless deaths and awakenings, Cage becomes an almost superhuman fighting machine, and they both begin to believe that he may just be the key to man's salvation.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow could have taken a turn down boring street very early on in the storyline, but director Doug Liman's ability to narrate the story via a collage of sorts, cutting and splicing the repeated days together in short story snippets, make for a fast-paced and very engaging film. <br/><br/>Incorporating humorous one liners, laking the cheesiness of sci-fi films of time gone by, helped break up the otherwise dark and helpless feeling conveyed by the plot. <br/><br/>Though Tom Cruise is the lead actor in Edge of Tomorrow, but Emily Blunt is presented as his equal in the film. Blunt is no damsel in distress, on the contrary, she ""saves"" Cruise's character and builds him up to the hero who he needs to be. Even the film's poster shows the two actors very much on the par with each other.<br/><br/>To stress on the special effects and the action sequences, is like saying that four star Michelin restaurant is a good place to eat, it would be stating the obvious, but what can be said about it is that, for the first time in a long while, the role of the CGI and the stunts make for a good marriage with the plot, without overpowering it and relying solely on the smoke and mirrors's ability to impress audiences.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is a movie which can be appreciated by die-hard sci-fi buffs, who will recognize actors from other films of the genre, i.e.: Bill Paxton, from Aliens and The Terminator, among others. Actually, the film is sure to appeal to a wide audience, as it does not pigeonhole itself into only one demographic. Edge of Tomorrow manages to check all the boxes:<br/><br/>1. Chick flick - Yup. It stars Tom Cruise, whose slight sexual tension with Emily Blunt's character brings a bit of romance in the movie's equation. Blunt is a positive female role model. 2. Action film - Yes. There are fast cars, airplanes, martial arts, explosions, blood, and oodles of flips and body slams. 3. Sci-fi - Of course. Ah... alien invasion of Earth. Need not say more. 4. Comedy - Maybe just a tiny bit... but just enough.<br/><br/>Is Edge of Tomorrow a movie which will change the world? I hardly think that the producers intend it to do that, so why even go down this path? Edge of Tomorrow great flick, and it's a very good 113 minutes spent in a dark room, and like me, you'll probably want to experience it more than once, to then be able to discuss the endless possibilities of plot twists and alternative endings with your sci-fi compatriots over a beer and a bag of pretzels."

","I imagine pitching Edge of Tomorrow to Warner Bros was the easiest thing in the world. With a juicy high-concept like ""Groundhog Day meets Aliens and Saving Private Ryan"", executives were probably excited to throw money at it. Turns out it wasn't such a good deal for them, as the movie reportedly under-performed. A pity: apart for a glaring flaw (the ending), it's a slick, clever sci-fi blockbuster; Liman is a fine action director whose set-pieces here - apart for the somewhat lackluster last battle - are fluid and kinetic.<br/><br/>Enough with the premise, which you either already know or should learn nothing more about before watching. Cruise gets to play a more compelling character than his usual stoic protagonist and has a fairly interesting arc. Bill Paxton as a marine sarge (Hudson got promoted!) and Brendan Gleeson as an icy general provide solid supporting turns. Stealing the movie, however, is gorgeous Emily Blunt as one of the most convincing action heroines in years, finding the perfect balance between being tough as nails and haunted by her ordeal.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, the conclusion doesn't work. It breaks all previously established rules and triggers the kind of ""ehhh, whatever, it was all space magic anyway"" sheepish epitaph which is never a good sign; the stench of last-minute rewrite is almost toxic. Given how much Edge of Tomorrow appears to be inspired by video games in terms of structure and general feel, I was almost expecting the message ""Achievement unlocked: bad ending!"". <br/><br/>Still enjoyable, but joining Minority Report, War of the Worlds and Oblivion in the club of fine sci-fi movies - curiously all starring Tom Cruise - damaged by their epilogues.<br/><br/>6,5/10"

In time, he learns his only way out is to work with Vrataski, and with each re-run they learn what needs to be done to defeat the Mimics.<br/><br/>This is another classic Cruise Sci-Fi movie and no matter what you think of him, he has a knack lately for starring in really enjoyable, exciting films. Edge of Tomorrow, while not perfect (what movie is?), is an excellent, edge of your seat Sci-Fi/Action film that definitely delivers on all fronts...action, suspense, and a touch of comedy.<br/><br/>This film is huge and it's not hard to see where a lot of the estimated $178m budget went as the visual & special effects, along with the massive battle scenes, are absolutely fantastic. The story is pretty complex and you need to pay close attention to what is happening because if you don't you'll become lost pretty easily.<br/><br/>There is a very obvious Groundhog Day element to part of the story with scenes even containing some pretty good moments of humour, especially parts involving the members of J-Squad, and just when you feel that the story it's starting to get TOO repetitive, it changes direction to keep your interest.<br/><br/>The cast also do a fantastic job, especially Cruise and Blunt, who work on-screen well together.

","I put off seeing ""Edge of Tomorrow"" for a long time, the main reason being that I am not exactly a fan of Tom Cruise. But after hearing one good report after another about the movie for a long time, I finally broke down and rented the Blu-ray. And I'm very glad that I did. This is one big budget sci-fi movie that's very well done for the most part. The basic plot isn't completely original - you'll see some small touches of ""Groundhog Day"" here and there - but it is handled with intelligence. The character played by Tom Cruise (who I must admit is good in this role) may be a coward (at first), but he's not stupid - he soon catches on to what's happening and does what you'd probably do in the same position. You'll probably guess what happens at the end before it actually happens, but all the same you won't feel your intelligence is insulted. As a bonus, the action sequences are also well handled, being very exciting while having the feeling things may not go according to anyone's plan. If I have a complaint about the movie, it's that some of the special effects - mainly the depiction of the aliens - don't quite convince, coming across as obvious CGI creations.

It was actually enjoyable, even at the beginning when Cruise is playing his douche self. That said the pace of the movie really begins to pick up at about the 20-25 minute mark. It was interesting to watch the character develop (as if he really had a choice), the skills he needed to fight the summers alien enemy. There was a surprising amount of humor in the movie & it is easy to see where they could have made subtle changes to the script & just made it a lot darker, but they wisely remembered that it is supposed to be a fun summer alien movie & people don't really care for depression with their sci-fi.

","As a big fan of these time travel/repeat days over and over again stories, I really thought this would be one of the better movies of the year. Sadly my expectations fell short of that because of a overlong final forty minutes or so. The first part of the film runs smoothly and nice, even with a lot of repeating, however oddly enough when the story starts adding more aspects into the film, it slows down to almost a complete stand still.<br/><br/>Directed by Doug Liman, director of The Bourne Identity and Mr. & Mrs. Smith, brings us a really nicely shot film. There is a good bit of high powered action and the scenes look fantastic, even with all the CG involved in the shots. Liman is able to get the most out of his top stars like Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. Blunt really steals the show here and proves she is more than just a beautiful actress. The secondary actors such as Bill Pullman and Brendan Gleeson are acting professionals and deliver another great performance in this film, even with their limited roles.<br/><br/>The film was written by Christopher McQuarrie(Jack Reacher), Jez Butterworth(Fair Game), and John-Henry Butterworth(Fair Game), and based on the novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. McQuarrie is truly a great writer, and I saw that after watching Jack Reacher, which is another amazing Tom Cruise film that is a must see. However this film felt almost flat for a good chunk of the film. I'm not saying it completely ruins the film, but when you start the film out with a great one hour run of the story and characters, and fall flat in the final forty minutes or so, that is a problem. With a story like this with a lot of repeating for a good chunk of the film, it can be tiring to the audience, however the writers handle that amazingly overall. Sadly when different aspects of the film start to break out in the final forty minutes of the film, it really seems like the last forty minutes was longer than the first hour of the film. The end of the film was a nice touch in an overall pretty good job from these three writers.<br/><br/>The film was composed by Christophe Beck, who recently scored the hit film Frozen. Overall Beck does a fantastic job scoring this film. The action scenes are key to deliver amazing music, and I feel he did an amazing job with it. Not one of my favorites scores overall, but he still deserves much credit scoring this film.<br/><br/>Overall while this film fell short of my expectations, it is still a must see film without a doubt. The action and overall great story, with amazing acting by the way, puts this film in a nice spot for some of the better films of this year when it is all said and done.<br/><br/>Side note for those wondering about the 3D/IMAX. I went to an IMAX 3D showing of this film and thought it was well worth it. Sure the 3D is post converted, meaning not shot using 3D cameras, but the added depth the 3D adds is very nice. IMAX, while so much better if a film is shot using IMAX cameras, was still a great experience. The amazing surround sound and the massive screen does make for a fun experience with this film. So again, if you are wondering if this film deserves the extra money for IMAX 3D, the answer is, without a doubt yes.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

The actor is just boring and as featureless and cheesy as a frozen pizza and as cocky as he was back in Top Gun. I'm guessing if Arnold was the choice of great action movies for his accent, overly masculine features and brutality of character then Tom Cruise is like the quirky idiot, like Jim Carry just that he does understand that he is not funny in any way and should just quit showbiz once and for all. As far as the movie goes - don't really want to waste words: classic rivalry, an antihero woman and a love affair, a stock ""scary horrible super-alien"" with a twist, and the whole movie just wreaked of Groundhog Day and some indiscernible hints of Starship Troopers and Terminator V. And of course one-liners and almost toilet-humor level jokes.

"ghost_dog86","9","4","8","9 June 2014"," Tom Cruise vs. Bill Murray
","At first I thought maybe (just maybe) being an outspoken mouthpiece for the Scientology movement predisposes an actor to star in high caliber sci-fi films, but I think John Travolta would have something to say about that. <br/><br/>Synopsis: When an alien race attacks Earth, a cowardly military officer (Tom Cruise) is put on the front line in order to participate in a futuristic end-of-days, Normandy-esque battle. And to top it off, after he dies on the battlefield (not a spoiler) he soon discovers that he is somehow being forced to live that same day over and over again; which by default, forces him to find a way out of his Twilight Zone worthy predicament. Basically, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is an action genre version of ""Groundhog Day"", set in a dystopian future. <br/><br/>Side Note: Whatever you think of the man and his religious beliefs, Tom Cruise does know his way around a Hollywood action blockbuster.<br/><br/>The most surprisingly pleasant aspect about ""Edge of Tomorrow"" has to be the dark humor throughout. In fact, with all the humor this film has to offer and a plot which loosely mimics one of Bill Murray's most beloved comedies, some may question the idea to cast Cruise as the lead. Yet, those who saw ""Tropic Thunder"" know that he has a sense of humor. And the fact that he displays a more than competent level of comedic timing, without coming off as annoying, desperate or forced, does deserve kudos.<br/><br/>But Cruise's performance isn't the main reason as to why ""Edge of Tomorrow"" works as well as it does. Some stand-out supporting work from Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton (who nearly steals the show at times) and the smartly constructed script from Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth, help as well. But above all, it's the fantastic direction from Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith) which allows ""Edge of Tomorrow"" to be far better than it had any right to be. In fact, he single-handedly transforms the repetitive nature of the story structure, which (in lesser hands) could have come off as excruciatingly boring, into something that is edge-of-your-seat entertainment.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Even though the third Act sees a more generic Mission Impossible, save the world Tom Cruise, as the film becomes more reliant on the action aspect rather than creative storytelling, and the plot inevitably stumbles into a sci-fi pitfall sequence drowning in over-complex explanation, AND the ending doesn't make a whole lot of sense, at the end of the day, none of that matters. And do you know why? Because, as a whole ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is supremely entertaining on every level, with an originality which will assuredly play to today's audiences the same way ""Groundhog Day"" played to audiences in 1993."
"Tokyographer","8","4","8","9 June 2014"," A different take on Tom Cruise's omnipotence
","We love Tom Cruise because he has always played that egotistical and omnipotent character we love. But up to this movie he had never had the power to reincarnate, with the exception of Oblivion where he was cloned in an industrial scale. Cruise's movies so far only gave him the privilege of having one life therefore he had very little room to screw up, so basically in those 2 hours of movie everything he did had to be perfect. Mission Impossible for example had no room for mistakes, and if he died it was over. The problem with this is that in order to be consistent with this omnipotence his character was built upon an aura of excessive over- confidence and cockiness. This is not bad up to the first Mission Impossible, after that it has all been movie after movie the same perfect character that beats everyone and figures everything out. The Edge of Tomorrow on the other hand makes room for mistakes, insecurities and human flaws. Before Cruise gains the power to reincarnate he was just a regular human being afraid to go to war and with terrible fight skills. However as the story unveils and thanks to his gained ability to screw up, die and start again the character starts to evolve into the hero we are used to. Reincarnation made room for mistakes and for the human element. The good thing about this story is that we had a chance to see a more human Tom Cruise, one that we had never seen before. Although it was just for the beginning of the movie, it was enough time to proof that TC can also play regular human beings."
"thesar-2","8","4","8","7 June 2014"," Tomorrow Always Dies
","I know the sad truth that Tom Cruise isn't a box office draw and hasn't been for a good decade or so. It is sad because he consistently brings his A-game and above average films to the screen. Last year was the enjoyable Oblivion and before that, I thoroughly enjoyed his fourth Mission: Impossible film and romantic-action Knight and Day.<br/><br/>Even with that said, I was hesitant – actually a tad more than that, on seeing Edge of Tomorrow, a movie that I already pegged as Groundhog Day 2: Source Codes and I thought he was stuck on the futuristic, heavy metal genre that I was getting tired of. Mercifully, a friend briefly tempted me to go see it with him and I abruptly made the correct choice to join him.<br/><br/>Immediately into the feature, I felt Director Doug Liman's presence and was pleased. Of course, I am a huge fan of his films, mainly The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith and Go, but to me, even the best directors rarely hit home runs the majority of the time. Hereyeah, even with knowing the very basic concept of the film, I knew I was in a quality made film and one I would enjoy even when the ""big reveal"" came to fruition that was completely foretold in both the trailers and posters.<br/><br/>And since it was not hidden, it's no spoiler for me to say, the film's about a cowardly, non-soldier military officer who keeps waking up the same day-before-battle (once he dies) only to attempt to both figure out why it's happening and how to deal with the literal day-in/day-out monotony. <br/><br/>Luckily for him, he all-but immediately finds his biggest clue with super soldier, Rita, and together they'll work on the winless battle they are in against unfriendly alien invaders.<br/><br/>The performances were pretty good, mainly with Emily Blunt as Rita, and I always favor Cruise in his films. The action was fun and the side jokes, or mostly one-liners from Cruise, were often hilarious. And as much as CGI, big Sci-Fi alien action and blow'em up! films aren't a draw for me, this one worked for me and reminded me of a much better version of The Matrix Revolutions.<br/><br/>Now, the only real downsides were the unimaginative alien race (again, SEE: The Matrix films) and the script wasn't fully there yet. Normally, I would mark down on the initial and somewhat unoriginal concept, but this did its own take on that and added more than enough to get past my preliminary fears of seeing Groundhog Day/Source Code all over again.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a definite recommendation with a largely fun, funny and enjoyable first two acts and a completely satisfying and refreshing conclusion – one we rarely see any more and I mostly yearn for. <br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Once again, Liemax and 3D has disappointed me. First off, we all know, or should, that the majority of ""IMAX"" screens are mini-versions of the true IMAX experience. AMC is notorious for these. I accept that since there are only two (that I know of) true IMAX screens in the state I live in and the closest doesn't usually play motion pictures as well as it's kinda far. In the case of Edge of Tomorrow, it didn't even fit the full Liemax screen causing a hilarious, but disappointing, letterboxed version on the big screen. Secondary, the 3D was eh, as usual. <br/><br/>I truly wish there was an alternative IMAX, ah-hem, even Liemax screen, that showed the 2D version. I could just go see them in the normal screen, but even with these problems, it's still slightly better than normal. <br/><br/>My plea is that they show some standards and not settle for this mediocre attempt just to get a couple of extra dollars out of us. And, with the low box office so far – even on day 2 of release, hopefully, they'll try and do better because this is not encouraging me to give any positive word of mouth for the Liemax ""experience."""

","Since so many movies that don't deserve even 7 stars are getting 10 stars on IMDb I'm afraid that IMDb is no more a source of objective value of a movie.<br/><br/>Edge of tomorrow is just another overrated movie. Borrowing or better say stealing the concept from Groundhog day ( IMHO - one truly great movie) and mixing it with bad scifi plot, and ""omnipresent"" tom cruise couldn't produce anything good. I gave it a try , again relying on IMDb score, but what a disappointment. nothing works in this movie. In fact it is a shame that they even tried to borrow the concept from the groundhog cause this way they've ruined experience of all those that'll watch groundhog after this crap.

","To be honest, i only expected a mediocre action movie going in, but i had to change my mind on that. Even with its flaws, it's still a very entertaining movie that i quite enjoyed.<br/><br/>I certainly did not expect the movie to subvert some action movie tropes in the way it did, which is one of the main reasons i enjoyed this movie so much. In particular, how merciless war was being portrayed, that is something you don't see very often to this extent. The time loop mechanic certainly helped making that possible and was used well in that regard.<br/><br/>However, towards the end the movie takes just about everything it did well, and simply throws it out of the window. The movie was perfectly fine without the female character (who, thanks to the time shenanigans, only knows the protagonist like less than a day) throwing herself at the protagonist. It was perfectly fine without forcing a happy ending, i thought the moment where the heroes were just dead was perfect and is was extremely disappointed to see they didn't just stop there.<br/><br/>And the movie also just had to stop being sensible about how dangerous war is for some reason towards the end, and forget that surviving took the protagonist countless attempts and lots of training. Suddenly they can just handle ridiculously bad odds without second chances. It nullifies what the rest of the movie stood for and what made it interesting, and i honestly recommend simply skipping the ending. I wish i could forget it.<br/><br/>Up until that point, it was thoroughly enjoyable though and i definitely recommend it, it's an action movie that stands out."

","The first of what's a reigniting in the ""time loop"" film Edge of Tomorrow has arguably more charm than any of the others that have succeeded it. Marvellously this film avoids to ever become repetitive which is a remarkable achievement given the scale of the film in comparison to more smaller plotted 'loopers' such as Source Code or Happy Death Day which too are fantastic films. Anyway, Cruise is surprisingly charming as a lead for someone who personally struggles to really enjoy any of his work outside of Mission Impossible he carries the film well though one could argue it's fairly balanced if not more on Blunt's shoulders as a more significant fisher to the plot with the constant reminder at the start (or restart if you will) of the day that she's the 'Full Metal Bitch'. Impressive action that always seems to develop and a well handled plot which further condenses time to skip along and add a grandness to the nature of the plot without holding the hand of the audience lead to a brilliant film that honestly has so much rewatch value regardless of the cast that are relatively nobodies and are recognisable to a British audience who've consumed various cult TV programmes. A neat little Sci-fi outing thats well worth your time"

","In the near future, aliens are taking over the planet Earth. A recently demoted military officer (Tom Cruise) is forced into a mission to fight against the aliens. After various failures and deaths, he is ""reborn"" at the point of joining the mission and this cycle is repeated with new knowledge.<br/><br/>Using this other-worldly plot device is often fun and fascinating. It's almost like the philosophy behind reincarnation - that we have to repeat the life-death cycle until we've learned all lessons. Treating the live-die-repeat cycle with humour is also enjoyable.<br/><br/>For an action film, the most enjoyment is expected to come from the film's conclusion and its build-up. Sadly, this film's climax is rather anti-climactic giving the movie an overall mixed result."

","Major Cage (Tom Cruise) has been sent to Britain from America to chronicle and film the battles against an alien enemy, the Mimics, who have overtaken Europe. As England fears the huge, insect-like aliens will soon cross the Channel, they are preparing another D-Day invasion. Astonishingly, Cage has never been trained in battle, despite his rank, as he is an information specialist. Yet, the General in charge of the invasion expects Cage to lead soldiers on the field. He can't, he explains. Soon, the General orders Cage's arrest, the American is stripped down to the rank of private, and ordered to a squadron of paratroopers. The invasion is the next day and Cage, in an elaborate suit of armor he knows nothing about, will take part. The result is ghastly, Cage is overcome with fright and sees the fearsome aliens mow down one soldier after another. But, there's a twist. As Cage fires on an exceptionally large alien, called an Alpha, the human is covered in Alpha blood as they both die. In the next moment, Cage is back in time to the point of his discovering himself to be a private and hauled off to meet the squadron. Again. Along the way, he meets an exceptional soldier, Rita (Emily Blunt), who has destroyed many of the Mimics by herself. She explains why. IF you receive alien blood, even on the surface, you are part of Einstein's fourth dimension, time. Therefore, you now have the ability to ""loop back"" indefinitely and learn from each encounter on how to fight the Mimics and take them down. As Cage and Rita live, die, and repeat, will they be successful in freeing the Earth of these hideous Mimics? What a thrill ride this movie is! No, the concepts aren't totally original but borrowed and embellished very well and the visuals of the movie are majestic. How terrifyingly real are these aliens and how epic each battle is. Cruise has rarely been better, from scared civilian to strong fighter and Blunt is equally fine and regal. Even a casual sci-fi fan will be enthralled by this one!"

He and Emily Blunt lack even the slightest ounce of chemistry and give zero effort into creating characters we actually care about throughout the countless mayhem involving alines and explosions. Visually, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is strong. There's high quality visual effects and editing throiuhgoiut, yet that's solely what holds this film together. There's no depth to back up the visuals.

","Edge of Tomorrow is directed by Doug Liman and collectively written by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth. It stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, with music by Christophe Beck and cinematography by Dion Beebe.<br/><br/>It has proved to be a great decade for sci-f, it seems that for every misfire there are three great genre films to off set the disappointments. Sitting at the top end of the table is Edge of Tomorrow (AKA: Live Die Repeat). Adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel ""All You Need Is Kill"", the story has Cruise as William Cage, an American army Major who upon being thrust into combat against an alien race decimating Earth, finds he awakens to the same day after being killed in action. Seeking out Rita (Blunt), the most decorated soldier of the time, Cage must understand what is happening to him and hopefully save the future of mankind.<br/><br/>So far so Groundhog Day/Source Code then, but Liman's film never lets up from the get go, frenetic with its action, funny into the bargain, and also sexy, it manages to blend audience pleasing conventions with clever thought and process. There's nothing new in the philosophy on show, and there are regular sci-fi tropes for familiarity of genre, but if you are going to recycle formula then do it with verve and swagger, which this most assuredly does. Boosted by Cruise turning in a good one as an unlikable character who develops into a protag to shout for, and Blunt as a super sexy bad-ass poster girl for the war effort, Edge of Tomorrow ultimately rocks. The science will obviously infuriate those who take such things way too seriously, but as the terror of this particular war unfolds on screen (nifty effects), and we have been bought wholesale into our heroes and their quest, its small failings are hardly worth cocking a snook at. 8/10"

This boils down to a shoot-em-up! I'd go for Source Code any day---as the real thinking man's SF movie.<br/><br/>Doug Liman's action movie, with its anti-chemistry between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, is based on a 2004 novel by Japanese SF author Hiroshi Sakurazaka. Earth is fighting an alien invasion and Cruise plays William Cage, a PR guy who starts off as a chicken ------but is forced into combat after trying to bribe a general. There are eerie overtones of World War One with mentions of Verdun as one of the battlefields--then a reprise of a dam on a German lake---<br/><br/>Playing the same plot over again may be Liman's tribute to the Harold Ramis's matchless comedy masterpiece Groundhog Day, but when Bill Murray repeatedly lived out the same ridiculously banal day, it was entertaining, and had a real plot. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is in a time loop. He fights. He is awesome. That's it. It's supposed to be exciting, but it is a drudge. The film lacks any edge, there is no love interest.....All you have is action...with slight variations each time round.....Like those Spot the Difference cartoons---which are so dull that they don't even put them in Punch magazine any more.

","I get the impression that EDGE OF TOMORROW is a film that most people will forget ever existed within a year of it's release. Despite being a big budget sci-fi action film with Tom Cruise in the lead, this movie went almost completely ignored by audiences. Including me. Unfortunately, I paid no attention to this movie during its theatrical run and contributed to its depressingly low box office haul. It's a high concept sci-fi action that's well written and populated with a strong cast; it should've done better than it did to encourage more interesting films out of the studios. Based on a Japanese novel (that I've never read), the story follows Major Cage (Tom Cruise) in the midst of an alien invasion that has consumed Europe and threatens to soon spread across the rest of the globe. The aliens, dubbed Mimics, are an impossibly skilled species of killers that can seemingly predict humanity's every plan and prepare for it. Cage, an official with the military's public relations department, is assigned to be on the front line to record their invasion of Normandy for humanity's latest attempt, Operation: Downfall. Panicked, he tries to blackmail his way out and finds himself arrested and dropped on the front lines, no longer as a media specialist but as a deserter reassigned to an infantry unit. His first real taste of war ends as one would expect when he dies at the hands of one of the aliens' ""Alphas"" but not before introducing it to the business end of a claymore mine. He dies, covered in the Alpha's blood, and finds himself awakening moments later at the start of the day, reliving events. Cage is now on an endless time loop of death on the frontlines and the only person who understands his plight is the ""Angel of Verdun"", a celebrated soldier named Rita (Emily Blunt) who has experienced the same phenomenon.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise once again proves that, while I'm baffled by his personal life, he is a solid actor. His character, Major Cage, has a full arc over the course of the film as he transforms from a cowardly media relations specialist into a killing machine who is willing to selflessly sacrifice himself if needed to end the Mimics' invasion. Despite Cruise's history of playing the near-invincible action hero, he is totally believable in the beginning of the film when Cage is so terrified of seeing combat that he's willing to attempt blackmail on a general. His counterpart in the film is Rita, played in a surprising turn by Emily Blunt. I'm only familiar with Blunt from comedies so her role of a decorated military alien murder machine is mind-blowing in how well she does. Blunt has gravitas and you never question her character's ability to slaughter hordes of enemies on the front lines. Best of all, the filmmakers never bother to cram a love story between Cage and Rita into the plot as most summer big-budget action movies would be prone to do. Cage and Rita keep their relationship professional (mostly) and keep their focus on winning the war. In order to defeat the Mimics, they will need to locate and destroy their Omega, an organism that essentially acts as the central brain for the species. Cage's ability to restart the day each time he dies comes from a direct connection to the Omega, so he is now humanity's final hope in defeating the alien threat.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is surprisingly good. I didnt expect much from it but it resulted in a very interesting sci fi action flick. The use of time loop in this movie is the best i've ever seen in a film"

"Aylmer","7","1","1","15 October 2019"," Groundhog D-Day
","For a film so on-the-nose featuring a modern day Normandy Invasion against MATRIX-like robot squid aliens who have taken over central Europe, this film works surprisingly well due to its fun hard scifi premise of reliving a time period over and over again until getting things ""right"". It's basically a send-up of the strange reality of video games, where the key to winning is not so much based on skill, but on memorization after hours and hours of trial and error. Ever seen an amazing speed-run of Super Mario or Battletoads online and wondered what it took to get there? This movie answers your questions, depicting it with a semi-plausible real-world scenario.<br/><br/>The editor for the film certainly gave life to a concept that could easily become tiring. In fact, I would say this has to be one of the better-edited films I've seen in years. Things move along briskly and snappily and it was difficult to look away up until the climax of the film which unfortunately gets a little formulaic and stretchy to make things ultimately satisfying.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt feels miscast as some battle-hardened veteran with perfect makeup, hair, and nary a scar from all her hand-to-hand combat. Sure the film would have been more realistic to have someone like Sam Elliot in her part as a shepherding mentor character, but wouldn't have the eye candy, and let's not kid ourselves there.<br/><br/>Cruise does a good job playing a fish-out-of-water everyman type hero, but he's starting to get a little old to play this sort of character believably in such an action-heavy film. Action-wise, there are plenty of amazing stunts largely buried under a heavy torrent of VFX and CGI but thankfully not as obnoxiously as we've come to expect in films such as this."

Emily Blunt is a great actress and brings a freshness to the role of the lead female. The special effects aren't heavy, but they are used well and assist the story instead of the other way around.

","What a way to end a semester of good science fiction by watching Edge of Tomorrow. I remember seeing the trailer for this film during a Godzilla IMAX 3D screening, thinking it looked too much like a video game and that it looked so cliche. I didn't grasp the fact that it was like Groundhog Day meets Terminator, and the result was a great deal of fun.<br/><br/>First of all, this film has a good casting of leads/important characters, such as Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt (who I had not seen much of before this film) and Brendan Gleeson (who I LOVE in In Bruges). Some people hate Tom Cruise, and to that I say give the guy a chance with great roles under his belt such as the lead in Rain Man and a role in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia which rightfully earned him an Oscar nomination. Emily Blunt is amazing as the ""full metal b****"" who does not give a damn, knocking out a soldier who nearly calls her by this name. And as for Gleeson, I guess he doesn't really do much, but I like him.<br/><br/>Going back to Tom Cruise, he plays an iconic spokesperson who has a high military rank, though he is more involved with advertising and wants little to do with actual battle. He is a coward who is sent on a journey to prove himself to be a very brave soldier.<br/><br/>The Groundhog Day aspect to this film provides a lot of laughs, focusing on funny ways that he dies early in the film and the way Emily Blunt's character kills him over and over again.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is kind of a stretch to believe, but then again this is science fiction; you either buy it or you don't. Cage is lucky enough to kill an ""Alpha"" with a claymore before dying, and the alpha's blood is splattered onto him and gives him the ""ability"" to reset the day as he dies. These aliens are unlike any we have seen before in alien invasion movies, looking like giant sea creatures with a type of ""hair"" that looks like the features of an anemone. Alphas are very rare amongst them, which are the ones that can reset the day, and their motivations are unknown, but they are a force that the world is fighting against. This is a very ""us vs them"" film promoting global unity to fight a threat.<br/><br/>You'll be pleasantly surprised with this gem; watch this film.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>*This review is from 2015."

If you've seen the Bill Murray comedy the plot will seem awfully familiar. The main character keeps repeating the same day until he sets things right. Both films transcend their genre, since while the problems they face definitely exist in the physical world, the solution is most definitely grounded in the metaphysical world.

"Minus_The_Beer","7","1","1","14 May 2017"," Tomorrow Never Dies
","Live, die, repeat. Or more appropriately: lather, rinse, repeat. So is the basic premise for Doug Liman's ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Not your average Tom Cruise vehicle, the film is built on the premise of a solider who, by some form of luck -- good or bad -- has attained the power to hit refresh on the same day. The catch is, he must die in order to do so. But in repeating the same day over and over again, he gains the edge over the Mimics -- robotic/insect aliens -- that have invaded his planet and eventually wins the trust (and, yes, affection) of his tough-as-nails partner, played by Emily Blunt.<br/><br/>That's right, this is basically a sci-fi ""Groundhog Day"" with a video-game twist. Cruise's character re-spawns over and over again until he can learn from his mistakes and make progress. Naturally, this lends itself to a few humorous brushes with fate and a potential for fatigue as the audience is treated to the same action sequence over and over again for most of the first half of the film. No matter, though, as the film is never as dull as its limited premise would suggest. Liman, who directed the exceedingly entertaining and refreshing first ""Bourne Identity"" flick, is right at home with the material. The action is tempered with humor and flickers of humanity, with a surprisingly tolerable turn from Cruise, though Blunt is the real shining star of the movie. Stone- faced and focused, her character is the backbone and the heart of the movie, undercut only when the film sees fit to pull her into an unneeded romantic side-plot with Cruise (who is, incidentally, old enough to be her father). Elsewhere in the cast, we are treated to the always wonderful Bill Paxton as Cruise's increasingly befuddled sergeant. While he misses the perfect opportunity for a reprisal of his ""Game over, man, GAME OVER!"" line from ""Aliens,"" he is another bright-spot in the film. But then again, a little Paxton always went a long way in making any film better (R.I.P.).<br/><br/>The film admittedly gets a little soggy in the final act, as the aforementioned romantic subplot is tacked on and the film strains to find a satisfying conclusion. The action ultimately becomes a bit of a blur, and the cinematography gets a little sloppy during the final face-off between Cruise and the Mimics. It doesn't completely undo the goodwill generated by the first half or so, but one can't help but sniff a little bit of last-minute studio-meddling and re- shooting here. Regardless, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a more than satisfactory and unique sci-fi film. Flawed, yes, but most assuredly a solid way to pass a rainy Sunday afternoon."
"zkonedog","8","1","1","4 March 2017"," Solid Science-Fiction
","For some reason, this film really didn't ""catch on"" in its advertising stages. First billed as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and touted as an action shoot-em-up (I remember seeing the trailer in theaters), it then morphed into ""Live, Die, Repeat"" and was re-branded as a time-travel escapade. Though the film deserved a more coherent approach to garner some box office success, its dual- personality is shown within the movie as well.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" sees Cage (Tom Cruise), a military man, sent to the front lines of combat against an alien threat against the planet. Almost immediately after parachuting into enemy territory, the entire mission goes awry and everyone dies. And then Cage wakes up at the beginning of that same day. With only a vague reference to female fighting hero Rita (Emily Blunt) to guide him, Cage must simultaneously find out what the heck is happening to him while also trying to win the battle for his country.<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a solid movie. Cruise is great (as usual), the plot is mind-bending, and the action is top-notch. I was entertained throughout and never felt bored or confused.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that this is an all-time classic. There is no context given for the alien invasion (which is very disappointing from a plot standpoint), and the ending (IMHO) leaves a bit to be desired. Also, I was very disappointed in Blunt's performance as the female lead. Her character is an integral part of the story, and it comes across as very weak and ultimately useless. I think that she was cast wrong for this role, as a more likable/approachable presence would have played much better to interact with Cruise's character. I know she is supposed to be ""tough"", but that toughness doesn't end up meaning much if the character falls flat.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a solid science fiction effort. It's very entertaining, but fails to truly be great because of a few major flaws. Like the advertising for the film, director Doug Liman doesn't quite seem to know exactly what he wants the picture to be. Very comparable to another Cruise sci-fi flick ""Oblivion""."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","1","5 April 2016"," Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers
","As the story of EDGE OF TOMORROW unfolded before me, I couldn't help but notice the similarities to two minor classics of 1990s cinema: GROUNDHOG DAY, in which Bill Murray is forced to re-live the same day over and over again, and STARSHIP TROOPERS, in which humans battled aliens to the death. It's fair to say that the writers behind this one mined both films for inspiration and came up with a watchable, if light, concoction.<br/><br/>The problem with EDGE OF TOMORROW really is its familiarity, but saying that, it still works as a worthwhile Hollywood blockbuster. The action scenes are intensive and impressive, bringing to mind the hectic and war-torn countryside of WW1, with which there are many similarities. Doug Liman, who handled THE BOURNE IDENTITY all those years ago, still has a handle on delivering well-paced and exciting action, so that's something.<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan around, but you can see why he liked this role: he gets a chance to play a kook, a dummy, for a change. I still think Emily Blunt keeps getting miscast in action-orientated roles, but she's acceptable here, and the supporting cast includes welcome turns from Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson, and the like. The sci-fi storyline is filled with twists and turns and it doesn't make much sense if you think about it too deeply, and the CGI isn't all that, but nonetheless EDGE OF TOMORROW is one of those films where you switch your brain off and just sit back and enjoy."

I'm still looking for the smart that some reviewers see. Summer action thriller, late-night TV fodder -- it's found its niche.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise keeps at it, more power to him, and Emily Blunt proves herself surprisingly versatile. Brendan Gleeson always good, but he has a chump's role here. Bill Paxton proves that the less time he is on the screen, the better he does.

The first battle scene where they landed on the beach was crazy scary. I felt like I was right there with Cruise. Filled with terror at having to fight these creatures with an armored suit that I have no idea how it works. Blunt was so bad ass as the full metal bitch. She looked and played the part completely and I was invested in the film 100 percent and was even about to shed a tear close to the end of the movie, but then it didn't end there. Oh no the director had to take a perfectly good ending and turn it into your typical Hollywood fairy tale.<br/><br/>So the second ending left me a little dumbfounded. So Cruise killed an alpha male and got covered in its plasma which caused him to have some kind of link with the Omega. The Omega caused Cruise to repeat each day in order to stay one step ahead. OK so in the end Cruise sustains a fatal injury but manages to discharge several grenades which kill both the alpha male and the Omega. So if the alpha male and the Omega cease to exist how in the world was Cruise able to repeat the day? If the omega is the sole reason his days are being repeated and the omega is dead then how can his day repeat? Did the director forget that small detail or was he too busy sucking up to Hollywood execs? That small detail took the movie from a solid 8 to a 5."

"ironhorse_iv","7","4","9","7 June 2014"," This movie was edge of your seat, entertaining. Cheesy, but fun!
","Directed by Doug Liman, Edge of Tomorrow is an interesting movie to say the least. Based on the Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. The movie took the manga and rewrote it for American audiences. In the near future, an alien race nicknamed 'Mimic' has invaded Earth, nearly overtaken most of Western Europe. The mimics have the ability to mimic and counter Earth military combat strategies with efficiency, thus making them nearly unbeatable. A final surprise assault is planned on the beaches of France, as a last depth attempt to stop the alien invasion of England. The assault goes horrible wrong, as Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is forced to relive the day, time after time, after being expose to the alien time loop, DNA. With each day, he gains the combat experience needed to find a way to defeat the alien beings. You can clearly see, a lot of things from previous films, influencing this movie's direction. Films like the Matrix trilogy, 2011's Sourcecode, and even 1993's comedy, Groundhog Day. It really felt like the movie was paying homage to them, but as well, trying to create something new, out of their concepts. I wouldn't say, this movie is cutting edge, as it does follows a lot of establish tropes from both video games and Sci-fiction novels. The time loop thing is a pretty interested concept that isn't really explore or explain much in the film. The movie opens more plot-holes paradoxes, than solutions. Movies like that, are not worth, getting a headache, trying find logic. It's better to just ignored it, and watch it simple-minded. Still, I can't help, wanting the film to establish the concept more. I wish they had kept the original explanation of Servers, backups, and antennae from the novel, 'All You Need is Kill' for the time loop idea rather than change it to the whole Alpha and Omega thing. It makes more sense, because antennae (Alpha) broadcasting memories back in time to a server (the Omega). It really do helped explain what was going on with William Cage. He wasn't actually teleporting through time. It was just his collected memories. The movie never show the aliens honestly using the time loop. Makes me wonder, how Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) could had a victory at the Battle of Verdun. I would have thought, the aliens would find a way to reset that day. Also, how is the ending of this movie even possible? You would think that the aliens would only sent Alphas to try to take his reset powers. It's not like, he being expose every time, he loops. Wouldn't the aliens figure a way to stop him by giving him a blood transfusion or something? I mean, they all connected through the same mind. Are they really that clueless of the human's plans and how their power truly works? The movie make it seem like they are able to adapt quickly, but rarely show it. Another thing about the film that sucks is the lack of suspense. When you think about it, there is nothing for stalk, here. What made 2011's Source Code, a superior film to this, was because the protagonist had a time limited, to find the enemy's identify, because if not, another bomb would go off. In this film, the protagonist has unlimited times to try to get something right. It felt like it pretty much guaranteed that he find a way to defeat the aliens. The film was bit predictable and repetition, but at less, the movie gave us a number of entertaining different scenarios, so it didn't get too boring. The only time, there were any suspense, was the last couple of minutes, due to him, not having his alien blood, anymore. It was only time, I felt invested in what the results. The movie felt more like a comedy, than a thriller. The way, the combat jackets perform are just over the top ridiculousness. The multiply ways, characters dies, are just hilarious to watch. The film truly felt like it was better off, being animation as an anime or a video game than live action film. The movie felt so cartoony and over the top with the acting. Tom Cruise comes across as a pretty good action star, who grow more mature and combat ready throughout the film. Still, I do find him, playing a younger character, a bit odd and out of place. It kinda hurts that his character wasn't play by an Asian-American actor. The whole Asian concept in the novel is nearly gone in this film. Emily Blunt really shines in this film. She really came across as one tough girl, not to mess with. The backstory of Rita's character is also missing in the film which the book established. The supporting cast are just one-dimensional stereotypes that giving little to care about. Jeremy Piven is in the film, but most of his scenes were cut out. The title was changed from All You Need Is Kill to Edge of Tomorrow because the ""negative chatter"" about the word ""kill"" in the title. Despite the movie being PG-13, with a lot of violent and characters dying. In my opinion, Edge of Tomorrow works better, as it gives the movie, a more Sci-Fi feel. The movie had this eerily metaphor of World War 1 & 2 in it, as if, telling us that history repeating itself, if nothing new is done. The whole idea of the aliens taking over Germany, like the Nazis. Then taking over Europe. The whole idea of coastal battles scenes remind me of the Invasion of Normandy. Even the date of release, June 6, 2014 is 70 years since D-Day landings is chilling. Overall: The movie is repeat watch. I doubt, I ever get bored, watching it. It's not a smart Sci-Fi movie. It's just popcorn fun."

","""They say we're young and we don't know. Won't find out unit-ii-l we grow."" This line of Sonny and Cher immediately takes me back to Bill Murray waking up over and over again in the classic ""Groundhog Day"". Similarly the words ""On your feet, maggot!"" gouge themselves into your brain in Tom Cruise's latest blockbuster Edge of Tomorrow.<br/><br/>Based on the novel ""All you need is kill"", which was the original shooting title of the film, Cruise plays a really interesting character - William Cage - who begins the film as a cowardly and conniving army media man before circumstances force him to progressively step up find the hero inside himself. The Europe of the not too distant future has been invaded by a bizarre alien life form - the Mimics: a hive like being that breeds like rabbits and quickly overruns the whole of mainland Europe. Clearly UKIP must have got into power by then and shut the Channel Tunnel, since the alien invaders have not yet conquered Britain which stands alone against the enemy.<br/><br/>The infantry of the allied forces fight in well-armed mechanised suits, and Cage - much against his will - is strapped into one of these devices and 'parachuted' into the front line on the Normandy beaches: It is rather ironic that I watched this film on the 70th anniversary of when our brave troops did the same thing.<br/><br/>Why an aerial invasion would choose to land on the open beaches rather than some nice leafy field more inland is a question perhaps best not dwelt on, but it wouldn't make any difference anyway: unfortunately, the Mimics can manipulate time and they already know the allied forces are coming, resulting in a massacre. Cruise is killed and the film ends. Or rather no, actually it doesn't. From the result of a nice plot twist (no spoilers), Cruise reawakens at the start of the same day and can escape the death that befell him, at least for a little while longer. And so it goes on living up for once to the movie's catchy tag-line - ""Live, Die, Repeat"". As this proceeds, Cage appears, to his fellow comrades, to have almost God-like powers of combat through stunning demonstrations of intuition. I was reminded again of what Bill Murray's Phil Connor's says in ""Groundhog Day"": ""Well maybe the *real* God uses tricks, you know? Maybe he's not omnipotent. He's just been around so long he knows everything."" Cage teams up with legendary fighter Rita, also known as the Angel of Verdun, played by the wonderful Emily Blunt. Rita is the only person to believe in Cage's powers, the reason being (already unnecessarily pre-spoiled via the trailer) that she used to have the same power but lost it. Together they must find a way to dual-handedly end the war.<br/><br/>This is a great, albeit not flawless, film. Directed by Doug Limon, of the Bourne films, the pace is non-stop and the story infused with enough thrills, action and humour to thoroughly entertain over its running time, which (and a common complaint from this critic) is pleasingly under 2 hours. Cruise is a star that drives Marmite-like love and hate reactions. And so this is a film that has something for everyone: for the lovers of the diminutive action figure, Cruise is in great form and revels in the chance to step up to what must have been a physically exhausting shoot. For haters of the guy, they get to see him die on stage - - repeatedly! Emily Blunt also shines in her role, and the fledgling, almost reluctant, romance that builds between the two characters is well played. All of the supporting cast, especially the assorted grizzled characters of Cage's J-troop, add variety and depth to the story.<br/><br/>The special effects are first rate, with the evil Mimics appearing truly threatening as they emerge suddenly from hiding places under the ground: something perhaps to bear in mind and pre-brief on if you have younger children you want to take.<br/><br/>This is very nearly a ten-star film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. As with any time-travel related film, there are some plot holes that appear when you pick under the skin of the story. This is particularly true of Emily Blunt's character. And the Hollywood ending of the film is rather unsatisfactory and not terribly logical in keeping with the excellence of the rest of the story. But overall this is a film worth you catching at the cinema. A thoroughly good night out.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive of other reviews at bobmann447.wordpress.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad""!)."

","watched it on 1st of June 2014. It's an amazing movie. I'm still shocked that this whitewashed blockbuster, made by committee, worked at all. But it does it works all day long, it even takes some work home, and the next day comes with lattes for the whole office. <br/><br/>Don't know who was responsible for making this as fun as it turned to be, probably editors, or screenwriters, I'm pretty sure based on their track record, it wasn't the producers or the director. Maybe its just a case of 100 Monkeys typing Shakespeare. The fact is I was at the edge of my seat the whole movie, just terrified that they would drop the ball and make a stupid twist that would make the whole thing fall apart (*ehem* oblivion).

","""Edge of Tomorrow"" shows us a different Tom Cruise. In contrast with his past heroic characters, all valiant and unafraid, his character here Major William Cage is a big coward, trying to weasel his way out of an order to be in the front line of battle against the Mimics, an unstoppable alien race about to take over the whole world.<br/><br/>However, as Cage kills and gets killed by another sort of alien creature called the Alpha, he wakes up to relive this day of battle and die over and over again, only to live another day. However, with every return engagement, Cage would meet and work together with war heroine Rita Vrataski, gaining more and more combat skills and cunning, to seek out and destroy the main alien creature called the Omega.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gets to flex his comedic charms which we do not see often enough. His playing a coward at first was so unlikely of him, it was fresh and funny. Of course, his action and fight sequences were naturally looked good for him, even though these scenes did come later on in the film. This was a very good performance from him, so natural and charming. Cruise has still got that movie star charisma and he certainly knows how to choose these projects which would ensure his career longevity in the A-list.<br/><br/>This is the first time I have seen Emily Blunt in an action film, and she surprised me. She is both sexy and formidable as Rita. She has a palpable chemistry with Cruise, which was entertaining. This girl can really stand her own with the best of them.<br/><br/>This film comes right at the heels of last year's excellent ""Oblivion"", also a futuristic sci-fi film starring Tom Cruise and a British leading lady. Both are entertaining in their own way, but the story and the treatment are from being the same. Where ""Oblivion"" is all white and sterile-looking with a very serious style of story-telling, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is dirty, gritty and fun, with a sharp sense of humor."
"quincytheodore","8","4","9","29 May 2014"," Best mind trip since Looper
","It's been a long time since Tom Cruise plays the role of a rookie, after Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher, it's acceptable that he's uber awesome from the start, and it's been even longer since Hollywood produces a great adaptation of Japanese popular literature. Edge of Tomorrow, despite spawning from the grimly titled light novel All You Need Is Kill and the poster's morbid catchphrase, is actually rather light hearted, playful and humorous. With gritty near apocalypse backdrop, the movie uses more mass appealing screenplay and, to its credit, manages to make what could be a redundant concept into an entertaining spectacle.<br/><br/>The movie's mind bending premise is actually an old one, but it's presented differently in sci-fi thriller, and thankfully it has made the transition to cinema pretty well. Tom Cruise plays William Cage, a military PR officer who is ungracefully demoted and literally dumped on battlefield. It's a fresh look for Cruise as he has always played the role of veteran badass for about a decade now. After his fateful first day, Cage is looped in a vicious cycle; he will unwittingly team up with the actual veteran badass, Rita Vrataski, played by Emily Blunt. Contrasting to the bleak situation, Cruise adds a touch of humor to his character. He is certainly proved as an action star, but the on-screen charisma is more prevalent when he tries to overcome the hardship and fails many times around.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt, who has experience in sci-fi genre from her role in Looper, is good choice for Rita. She has a bit of rugged nature from countless battles and she's attractive in her own way. The repeated clip of her doing push-up can also serve as a fitness video thumbnail. Chemistry for these two works for most part as Cage is frantically trying to find answer and Rita has been tempered by battlefield until the point of indifference. Although there could be room for the characters to develop further, they share some good moments and mature attraction. What's really surprising is how director Doug Liman presents the movie in humorous manner, it's consistently funny without being too slapstick. Pacing is really well done, editing helps getting the stagnant premise moves along rapidly. There's also a bit dark humor in recycling death and it's fascinating to see apocalypse concept taken without steroid of grittiness.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is a visual beast, there's more than enough action to rival its blockbuster peers. The motion is fluid and fast, yet it stays focused without spamming slow motion shots. Its extraterrestrial adversaries are looking organically menacing, a mix of liquid tentacle and rabies canine. Overall color tone is bluish gray, a recent trend in this sort of movie. Futuristic equipment are showcased with more plausible technology, but they also incorporate the grandiose blazing aspect one expects from Japanese animation. Everything looks amazing, and fortunately, especially so in 3D.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the final act doesn't carry the same impact as the rest of the movie. It's nowhere near horrible, but it does feel underwhelming and far fetch. Not to mention, the action looks a bit murky compared to the flashy bits of the first half. It could also spend a little more time to establish the relationships between characters, but understandably the narrative requires more time to progress. It's not perfect, but Edge of Tomorrow is an excellent movie that respectfully takes its source and creates an alternate version which is more amusing, thrilling and, I'm going to say it, edgy."

","Have you ever played a FPS video game? You get better as you play the same scenario over and over, figuring out ways to survive longer than the previous iteration. That is what this movie felt like. Cage taps into Omega, the central nervous system for aliens (aka ""mimics"") invading the planet. Among other things, this gives him the power to ""reset"" the day and start over when he dies or is killed. This is an interesting concept and lends itself naturally to some comical situations. The movie is a good mix of action, humor, sci-fi, while still promoting some thinking on the part of the viewer. I thought the first 10% and last 15% of the movie was a little dull, but the rest is edge-of-your-seat exciting. Surprisingly there is humor throughout, and it is well timed and works."

","There is a lot to like in the ""Edge of Tomorrow"" science fiction thriller about the alien invasion with surprising comedic undertone. Pre-production on""Edge of Tomorrow"" started exactly one week after Tom Cruise wrapped up the work on ""Oblivion"" another S/F alien invasion movie which as the ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is definitely return to the form by Tom Cruise. The easiest way to describe this film is to imagine a cross between the comedy ""Groundhog Day"", the robotic body armor of ""Pacific Rim"" and moments reminding us of Matrix as this film is based on of manga and novel 'All you need is kill' by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. Epic action of Edge of Tomorrow unfolds in a near future in which an alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Lt. Col. Bill Cage (Tome Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop- forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski. And, as Cage and Rita take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy. Aliens control time therefor they always know about the moves of the human soldiers. A lots of comedy comes from the sense of confusion and repetitiveness of whats happening with Cruise's character. Even though we see one day from perspective of many angles it never gets repetitive due to the like ability of Cruise's performance from totally inexperience coward to seasoned military leader. Emily Blunt deliver equally enjoyable performance even though the romantic chemistry between them is not quite there. Her name would suggest that she has Polish roots with a surname like Vrataski. At some point Bérénice Bejo was considered for the role but I think the choice of Blunt was the right one. She possesses the right amount of feistiness and strength/sensitivity the military leader of the resistance should have. The action partnership between the two is very well developed though. The alien creature design might not have been the best, relaying more on super fast CGI animations of the creature that does not aloud us to see much of them in the beginning which is rather good.The body armor that the soldiers are using as a strength and weapon support is looking very futuristic, but also very cumbersome in the amount of movement the soldier can do, in fact similar type suits are reality now and are developed as TALOS (Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit) in USA. The action scenes are breathtaking, the movie works on all the necessary levels to experience it as a big summer Hollywood blockbuster. I will definitely see it again it was that enjoyable. See it in IMAX 3D if you can. The sound design was brilliant with a lot of reverb used enhancing the overall experience.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"

","While you maybe can't quite call this one original, it WAS different. It is clearly evocative of ""Groundhog Day' and ""Star Trek"" among others. It is also a great deal like a video game, where you get killed and have to start at the first level again over and over. The movie was very skilled in setting that tone, and then letting it go, just being understood, before that got boring. And, interestingly, it went the other way, too, where it became clear that Cage had been further into it than we have. There is plenty to mock about Tom Cruise, his diminutive stature, his loopy religion, etc., but he clearly has that ""it"" factor that makes him a movie star, and he is always easy to watch on-screen. I was quite impressed with Emily Blunt with whom I am unfamiliar.<br/><br/>If you like the science-fiction genre, you'll have to check this out."

","""Edge of Tomorrow"" is easily sold as Tom Cruise's sci-fi ""Groundhog Day"", which feels kinda cynical, but there's also some ""Aliens"" and ""Starship Troopers"" thrown in. But in the end, that doesn't really matter, because this movie hits it out of the park. It blazes as an action movie, and the sci-fi hook is a nice touch. Cruise can laugh at himself getting killed every few minutes, which adds to the guy's likability. And he's great in the action role. Same for Blunt, who's just one gorgeous militaristic badass. And there's just enough emotional substance to make for a happy ending to this thing. It's exhilarating, funny, sometimes even heartfelt. It's a well-done movie, all around.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Scarecrow-88","9","3","6","2 November 2014"," Edge of Tomorrow
","Underrated sci-fi opus from Doug Liman provides Cruise with a nifty part as this cowardly ""Military PR Propagandist"" and Emily Blunt as this heroic soldier who represents a brave icon for the war against an alien threat that could very well wipe out the human race from existence of the world. When Cruise is placed on the front lines of a ground attack, against his wishes (he tries to flee from the office where Brendan Gleeson's general informed him of his trip on the front lines!), he somehow watches as the battle around him destroys ships and men without harm, his mechanical body weapon suit stuck on safety (!), and only after he gets his arm guns to fire does ""mimic blood"" fuse with his own causing him to ""rest"" every day after he is killed! Liman takes the story arc and cleverly uses it to the hilt. Think Groundhog Day Meets The Terminator with a little Matrix Revolutions mixed in. There's an Alpha alien that, if destroyed, could be the key for humankind winning the war. Repeating everyday is also familiar to Blunt's Rita as Cruise's Cage soon discovers. The two of them will reset each day, trying to determine how to defeat the alien scourge. Playing with the conventions of time within sci-fi is nothing new, but how Liman is able to use Cruise to recruit the J-troop into helping him is rather neat as is Blunt's developing relationship with him. Blunt, to her credit, has reached that pinnacle in her career where she can share the screen with a real bonafide movie star like Cruise and hold her own. The war scenes with the military and the alien mimics are a real visual feast as are the special effects involving the weaponized military body suits mechanized to kill the mimics from all directions. Cruise, no surprise, anchors the film as this man who develops from absolute spineless weasel to full-fledged soldier of valor and courage. If anything the novelty of Cruise dying over and over gives those non-fans who dislike him a reason to giggle. The only disappointment to me was the night sequences because little can really be seen and they happen at the crucial points of the film. How Bill Paxton's Kentucky drill sergeant is used in the film when Cruise continues to awaken over and over is a hoot. Thankfully Liman knows how to keep the film from feeling repetitive and dull, with an editing style that is specifically designed to accentuate Cruise's dilemma and make him credible when trying to convince others that he actually resets after death over and over without grounding the film to a halt."

As an actor he plays the same character in all his movies, but somehow it seems to work. This is a movie I would pay to see again and perhaps purchase, so I'm giving it an 8.

","""Edge of Tomorrow"" was a very well done action movie, that played things safe as far as generic action and sci-fi go. In doing so, it did a very good job and even added a few new things to the genre.<br/><br/>This movie bears a strong resemblance to Groundhog day, and has a lot of good humor in it along with great action sequences and effects. Interestingly enough, this movie also slightly resembles the movie ""The Notebook."" One will likely not come to this conclusion until after finishing the movie, though.<br/><br/>While everything was done very well, one can not help be annoyed with the background premise of the movie, as it is pretty well one huge multiplying plot hole. With sci-fi movies, it is a requirement that one lets down there logical mind to an extent in order to enjoy the fictional story being told, but with this movie in particular, one cannot help but become lost in what exactly the implications truly are of all the happenings on the screen.<br/><br/>Just focusing on the movie, and enjoying it without putting a great deal into the ""reality"" of what is coming to pass, one will get a movie that awakens emotions of romance and what it is to be human, all the while, being wildly entertained with seamless action sequences and witty humor.<br/><br/>A very enjoyable, feel good movie.

","This films is strange from its inception. The idea of repeating one day over and over is something that isn't inherently original even though it is technically an adaption, but somehow this film makes it work. This film stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt and is directed by Doug Liman. The story is about Tom Cruise's character, William Cage, being put into this D-Day type attack against these alien creatures that are invading earth. During this battle he gains the ability to relive this day over and over again. So he embarks on this journey to stop this threat and save the world from it. So how well does this work.<br/><br/>I thought that Tom Cruise didn't seem like the perfect person at all to play this kind of role. I mean who would believe this guy as somebody who gets off the boat fresh and ready to battle, but the play on that aspect a bit and he isn't a fresh faced because he was just put into the fray of this war either. You also see how he changes through going back and back in time and you can see how it affects him as a person and how it changes. Emily Blunt plays a character who helps him along this crazy journey and knows what is going on for a couple of reasons that I don't want to go into. She is just so good in this role and her character isn't written as a week character, but a strong woman who knows what she is doing and seems to be a lot smarter than our protagonist. It just seems like a nice change of pace.<br/><br/>I was also surprised to see Bill Paxton in a supporting role. His character was hilarious as his commanding officer and really gives a great performance. He is just so funny and I just love his character. Brendan Gleeson is also in this film as the general and he gives a really good performance that really has some great screen presence. And he needs it when he has to show how commanding he can be as a general.<br/><br/>This film is also hilarious. The live, die, repeat aspect to me didn't get old at all. They really play up him waking and knowing what people are going to say and do and Tom Cruise handles it so well. He also dies a lot and there are a couple kills that are hilarious and you can't help, but chuckle when you see him get shot by Emily Blunt when he breaks his leg while training.<br/><br/>The action is also really well done. I was surprised on how much it felt like D-Day. In the trailers I was imagining something similar to the opening D-Day scene in Saving Private Ryan and really has that effect. You watch people getting slaughtered on this beach and it holds a lot of weight. And with the amazing special effects this film really stands out. You can tell that a lot of money did get put into this thing and every buck is seen on screen. The mechanical suits they where are really cool as well.<br/><br/>I don't think every joke hit and the beginning also starts slow, but the performances are so good from not only Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, but the surrounding cast members as well. It also has some great action that is so similar to D-Day that it carries a lot of weight. I am giving this film an 3.5 out of 4 stars."
"ace_nair","9","3","6","23 June 2014"," Watch. Rewind. Repeat.
","Edge of Tomorrow has been the movie I have been waiting for from this summer's list of releases. And boy, does it deliver!<br/><br/>This is one Cruise's finest performances yet. There is no cockiness, holier-than-thou, smart-ass attitude which his characters usually are. The design of the mimics is literally out of this world - a cross between the sentinels from 'The Matrix' and the aliens from 'Alien' and quite terrifying. This is director Doug Liman's best work since 'The Bourne Identity' with his tight direction from the beach landing (nod to Saving Private Ryan?), the alien attacks, keeping the time loop events interesting and keeping romance largely out of the narration. <br/><br/>The time-loop, or day repeating itself didn't wear itself it out as new events were depicted. The humor between these loops was in good taste and connected the watcher to the events in the movie.<br/><br/>I would have preferred a more action oriented ending (like 'The Avengers') instead of the slightly tame one in the movie. For that reason alone, I have shaved the rating of 1 point from 10. Otherwise this movie strikes cinematic gold.<br/><br/>This is the action movie that audience have been complaining that they don't get to see. And it's quite unfortunate that when a movie like this is made, the viewer-ship and fan-fare is abysmal. Especially in the USA where the audience I guess has been dumbed down thanks to the Marvel and Disney movies of the past decade.<br/><br/>I guess that this movie will be 'The Shawshank Redemption' of Sci-Fi Action. Excellent critical rating, but poor box-office."

","Probably the last movie watched in 35mm because of the digitalization of the cinema I usually go. The sound and image quality in a good 35mm copy and has nothing to envy to digital projections. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise offers to us a lot of entertainment as usual. Again this time with a science fiction movie, the edge of tomorrow is a mix between any alien invasion movie and the Groundhog Day in a computer game format.<br/><br/>The movie is about the official Cage who has to deal with the defeat of his army against an alien race again and again with no success. On the contrary, those repetitions make him stronger and capable of preventing the future events and live quite more. When he meets Rita, both are able to discover who to act in order to achieve the final goal.<br/><br/>Faster in its development than Oblivion, in every repetition you will feel excited because you'll discover a new thing of the history and you will need more and more until the end. From my point of view the only problem is the final. I felt confused; I would change it if I could.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite the bad final and the bad results on the box office in the states I think it will be one of the best blockbusters of the year."
"hellocookie","9","3","6","18 June 2014"," Perfect summer popcorn action flick
","Edge of Tomorrow is one of my new favorite action sci-fi movies. Ever. Last year had brought a movie that topped my list and that was Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim. For those of you who know me and for those of you who don't, I love the crap out of that movie, so please note what a big freaking deal it is when I say that I might love Edge of Tomorrow even more. They're different movies and Pacific Rim falls under a more fun, hokey and mindless kind of action movie, but they're both in the same general sci-fi action genre.<br/><br/>We're given action almost right away and the film doesn't let up for a second in its 113-minute clock time. The film stars Tom Cruise who proves that he's still a Hollywood A-lister that can bring it. I feel like I haven't loved him in anything for a while and that may largely be due to me not loving films like Oblivion and Jack Reacher, but he did kick some serious ass in the last Mission: Impossible film. I love those movies and it should also say something that I think Edge of Tomorrow is Tom Cruise's best work in a while and maybe ever. This role feels like it was written for Cruise and he fits into it wonderfully well alongside Emily Blunt who I straight up know I have never loved more until now. Anyone leaving this movie without a crush on Emily Blunt, man or woman, is not actually watching the movie. Without Blunt in this role, I don't honestly know if Cruise would've been as effective. Blunt brings it as Rita Vrataski aka the ""Full Metal Bitch"" (you guys just watch that become a trending hashtag as soon as the film is out) and proved to me that skinny, beautiful actresses can get just gritty and badass as any actor in the industry. She's like a mix of Marcus Fenix, Squall Leonhart and maybe even Calhoun from Wreck-It Ralph.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow almost feels like a mashup of Gears of War meets Groundhog Day meets Final Fantasy meets The Matrix. You would think that a sci-fi action flick like this would be pretty serious and dark, but it has honest-to-goodness great bits of comedy in it that give you a break from constantly being on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Getting back to some of the actors and actresses in the film though, aside from stellar performances from Blunt and Cruise, Bill Paxton surprised the heck out of me in the film and also Brendan Gleeson, despite not being in it for very long. However, I doubt that any of you are surprised to find out that Gleeson was awesome in something. Jonas Armstrong, Tony Way, Kick Gurry, Franz Drameh, Dragomir Mrsic and Charlotte Riley are perfect as J-Squad and Noah Taylor an excellent addition to the movie too. Honestly, just a super big ol' well done to the casting team for this one.<br/><br/>There are incredible action sequences that are paired with stunning special effects (I saw the film in UltraAVX 3D). The 3D is very much in your face with bullet, shrapnel and explosions coming at you throughout the film. I didn't care for this so much as it makes me super jumpy, but this might honestly be my biggest nitpick about the film. Whether you see it in 3D or not, Edge of Tomorrow will be one of those movies that you should see in theaters to get the complete package. It's no secret that there are aliens in the film as it's an alien invasion movie and the bad guys are done pretty spectacularly. They aren't overly done and in fact, the design for them is seemingly fairly simple and straightforward, not unlike the design for the sentinels in The Matrix. Their movements and behaviorisms are so effective though and genuinely strike terror into you in the moments that they're meant to.<br/><br/>Where Pacific Rim has many holes in its story that become really apparent if picked at, Edge of Tomorrow holds up pretty nicely in that department. It's a tight story that is so jam-packed with all the right things that even if there were blatant plot holes, I can't imagine many people wanting to poke at them. The tagline for the film is Live. Die. Repeat. and you might think that the premise would make the film repetitive and boring, but I assure you that that's not the case. Unlike a film like Vantage Point where you're perpetually living the exact same moments over and over again but from different perspectives, the only thing that remains the same in Edge of Tomorrow is the day. Each scenario vastly changes and each one offers something relevant to the plot and entertaining to audiences.<br/><br/>I haven't even gotten to the part where I say stuff about Doug Liman as a director for this film, but I feel like by now you know that I adored every minute of the film. I didn't have super high hopes for the film going into it, but once I saw Liman's name attached to it, I started to really get my hopes up. You may recall Liman as a director from Mr. & Mrs. Smith and The Bourne Identity (and more, of course), but the latter of those two was what really made me feel like Edge of Tomorrow could be a great success.<br/><br/>If you haven't deduced that you need to see this film by now, I don't know how much clearer I can make things. This is THE must see movie of the summer that might not have been on your radar previously. Great story, special effects, cast and pacing has skyrocketed Edge of Tomorrow to the top of my favorite movies list. Don't miss it."
"p-stepien","9","3","6","12 June 2014"," Best Flop EVER!
","It what seems to be the most spectacular big budget flop of the season, comes ""Edge of Tomorrow"", a sci-fi action extravaganza that is one of the best genre movies of the decade. With home sales losing out to teen bromance, overseas return seems to be doing very well, which brings all sorts of questions as to why the Cruise-led alien invasion flick got pummelled so hard in the United States. Word of mouth must be immensely positive, as this is obviously the must see movie for all true sci-fi lovers, and critic's feedback has been verging on unanimous praise, so obviously something else is awry.<br/><br/>Two films immediately come to mind when watching ""Edge of Tomorrow"", a correlation so obvious that probably every other review pinpoints the influences, namely comedy classic ""Groundhog Day"" and Verhoeven's vastly underrated ""Starship Troopers"". Stuck between these two concept movies evolves a surprisingly original and fresh story, which manages to successfully warp expectations.<br/><br/>All out war with an alien invasion brings together humanity, when an asteroid crash-lands into central Europe, carrying with it a scourge of otherworldly twirling dervishes called the mimics. As they quickly conquer most of Europe, the counterattack is initiated by a victory under Verdun, where the Full Metal B... Rita (Emily Blunt) singlehandedly kills over a hundred mimics with the newly designed exoskeletons.<br/><br/>Cage (Tom Cruise) is the head of PR for the army, a whimpering coward so terrified of the front-line he attempt to blackmail his superior to avoid participating in the fight. With an imminent Normandy type assault planned the following day, Cage finds himself stripped of rank and thrown into a unit heading for the front-lines. The mass landing ends in slaughter with Cage killed in action... only for himself to be inexplicably captured within a time loop.<br/><br/>Within a mix of exceptional features and poor contrivances, this summer has been one of the most successful. Following ""Captain America 2"" and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", the blockbuster season seemed to have peaked. And apparently so did the audience, leaving out ""Edge of Tomorrow"" from their 'to-watch' list. Nonetheless as far as movies goes Liman (a hit-and-miss director of ""Jumper"", ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr and Mrs Smith"") blows his predecessors out of contention in terms of a stunning mix of style and substance. Whereas other features had their flaws and ""Godzilla"" was an outright disappointment, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" comes good from the get-go, the only jagged moment coming late on with a jarring out-of-tone ending. Successfully mixing drama, comedy, bleak atmosphere with moments of emotional tension functioning hand-by-hand with ice-breakers and comedic jumps, the scriptwriters truly nailed it. And who would have thought given how uninspired some of Christpher McQuarrie's and the Butterworth brother's previous endeavors were: ranging from ""Jack Reacher"" and ""The Tourist"" to ""The Last Legion"" (although it must be said McQuarrie also has ""The Usual Suspects"" credited to him).<br/><br/>Unlike many features of its kind, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" manage to avoid being solely testosterone driven, albeit the movie does feature a rag-tag squad of misfit soldiers in the Aliens mode, together with Bill Paxton. Albeit action-packed there is a lot of heart flowing, especially with the notion of death being such a frivolous thing and the concept of constantly reliving your beloved one die. Naturally a lot is taken tongue-in-cheek, even these intruguing issues are primarily utilised for their dramatic effect, not for their philosophical options. Issues are skin-deep, tooled and geared so that the video-game premise of immortality isn't the sole pull of the story. Thus the movie is nowhere near ""Groundhog Day"" in terms of underlying contextual commentaries. In essence this is a popcorn movie. Just one of the damn finest there is."
"RevRonster","10","3","6","11 June 2014"," Watch, enjoy, repeat
","As more and more trailers came out for ""Edge of Tomorrow"" the more excited I became and, after watching it, I'm soooo glad I spent the money needed to see it in the theater because it is EXACTLY how a summer blockbuster should be! <br/><br/>Since I'm a gamer, I really enjoyed the story because this is the closest a movie will come to actually showing off the feeling of playing a video game. The whole ""live, die, repeat"" was broadcast perfectly and we really get a feeling that Cage (Tom Cruise) is growing with each reboot—just like when you play a particularly hard level in a video game and keep dying but you get to learn the tricks to surviving with each passing life and refusal to enter in the Konami Code. Cruise was just awesome in the film as he perfectly plays a guy who is doing everything he can to not serve in the war against the aliens to a guy who finally learns how to master his exoskeleton Jacket and transforms himself into an alien killing machine to a guy who realizes the weight of all humanity is on his shoulders and must do what is right for the future of the human race to continue. Cruise nails all these attributes and is capable of being very amusing all the way through, as well.<br/><br/>Now, this shouldn't come as a surprise, but (are you ready for this?) Emily Blunt was fantastic in her role as Rita, the alien tail-kicking, make Ripley cry because she can't compete with her epicness and armed with a sword stolen from Cloud from ""Final Fantasy VII"" soldier. It's a fact of life that Blunt is a great actress. You can't deny it. To do so would be like saying that chocolate and peanut butter aren't perfect for each other, the sky isn't blue, and that crazy doesn't belong on Fox News. Not only was she intense, tough, and determined in her role, she was also capable of being hard as a rock and a genuine hero without having her sexuality thrown into the mix. It's a rare sight to see a female protagonist that isn't all about being eye candy or sex drive driven. Instead, the moment she steps into the film, in all her exosuit, gigantic sword glory, you know that she isn't her to be the damsel in distress or get doughy eyed around the men-folk (or being portrayed in wearing next to nothingand if this movie was based on a video game, you know the developers would have designed her with a large chest and a thong underneath that suit. The video game industry is sad a lot of the times).<br/><br/>Blunt and Cruise (which sounds like a buddy cop sitcom coming to FX this fall) were not the only strong aspects of the cast. In fact, everyone involved is great! The only downside is that a lot of the side characters—who all look like a fun, colorful bunch—aren't as developed as the Cage and Rita characters. This is kind of a bummer but not something that destroyed the film for me. While some characters, like Bill Paxton's (who is just plain fun) may not need extra development because you know what you're getting with him thanks to a fun, great performance from an established actor but many of the members of Cage's squad seem like they would be interesting but the most we learn about them is from gags about how Cage keeps living the same day over and over again and knows all about them when he ""first"" meets the crew. This is a downside to the film but not an entertainment killer for me.<br/><br/>One thing I wasn't prepared for with ""Edge of Tomorrow"" was just how funny the film was. I knew it was going to be a cool Sci-Fi story (and it lived up to that) and I expected awesome action (and I got that) but never did I expect the film to be as funny as it was. Sure, I predicted there would be a couple of chuckle moments here and there but what I got was a film that was, flat-out, hilarious and capable of being so without creating constantly shifting and jarring moves in tones that stepped on the feet of the more serious portions of the film. This film had the balance that so many stories often fail at getting right and that is being a killer story that is filled with drama, tension, excitement, jaw-dropping moments and spectacularly hilarious all at the same time.<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" is exactly what a summer blockbuster is suppose to be. The cast is great, the story is just fantastic, the action is more than enough to satisfy the action portion of your brain and it has the perfect blend of human drama and comedy. I can't wait for this film to come out on Blu-Ray because I plan on watching it over and over againkinda like Cage in this story only more sitting on my bum and more Cheetos eating."

","10 June 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Edge of Tomorrow. The tag line of this film is Live, Die, Repeat - which although completely sums up the plot in three words, could easily be Groundhog Day Meets just about any Alien/ War Film you've ever seen. It was good, I liked it a lot. Cruise is cast as Lt Col Bill Cage who is forced into combat and having been infected by his alien foe finds himself reawakening every time he is killed. He uses this to learn how to defeat the enemy and teams up with Rita, a Special Forces Warrior played by Emily Blunt. Tip of the day......do not attempt a toilet break in the middle of the film, you will completely lose your way, but don't fret either, you will not need to move out of your seat. This film was completely captivating, in the sense that you just couldn't work out how Tom Cruise was going to change things for the positive each time he woke up. He's getting better and better with age and I personally find each project he undertakes to be thoroughly entertaining and it's easy to see that he is passionate about his work. I am also a big fan of Emily Blunt and this film casts her as someone who is a million years away from the character of Emily in The Devil Wears Prada. A little concentration is needed to keep up with the fast pace of the 'Live, Die, Repeat' scenario but worth the effort. An interesting view of Heathrow Airport."

"richardzmoore","10","3","6","9 June 2014"," The Best Movie of 2014... So Far!
","""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a science fiction masterpiece and is easily the best movie I have seen in the last two years. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. There was not a slow spot in the entire thing. I am 48 and I was as giddy as a schoolboy throughout the entire spectacle. I saw it on opening night, and I actually took a group of friends to see it again last night (my friends all loved it too). It definitely held up with my second viewing.<br/><br/>I have been a Tom Cruise fan for many years. He continually puts his all into his action scenes and it shows. He seems to get a lot of bad press over the last few years (some of it deserved), but he rarely fails to give the material his all. This movie is possibly his finest hour. In my opinion, it's his best work (and his best film) since 2002's excellent ""Minority Report."" Emily Blunt rocks and kicks lots of booty too. I had never seen her in too much before, but I will definitely keep an eye out for her in the future.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a stylish, exciting, and intelligent science fiction/action thriller, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is definitely the ticket. A strong 10 out of 10 from this Texas boy. I would give it a strong 11 or 12 if I could. We need more movies like this one!"
"gndecastro","9","3","6","9 June 2014"," Shooter Video Game meets Ground Hog Day
","If you like Sci-Fi Action, then you'll love this movie. Considering this movie has the main character repeating the same day over and over again, the director shows just enough of the repetition to help you understand whats going on without repeating whole scenes. It was very well done. It has just enough story to be watchable but very light on the plot. The aliens' CGI could have been better. Tom Cruise portrays his character perfectly as an unlikely hero. This makes for a character that develops over the course of the film. At first, you might be thinking how could a woman wielding a heavy melee weapon be the hero of humanity? In the great tradition of Sci-Fi this is made believable due to the exo-skeleton suits and her ability to 'reset the day'. If you knew exactly when death was coming, would it not be easy for anyone to avoid it? Overall, a great action movie and lovers of Sci-Fi will want to see this on the big screen."

","Why Edge Of Tomorrow is the best movie of the year? First of all Edge Of Tomorrow's script is not original. We all know that but the writers of this film are incredible. They are make a better script with lots of action, special effects with great music. Also I really enjoyed Emily Blunt's performance and action scenes. Like it. And I can honestly say this movie is Tom Cruise's best action movie. Now this movie why best movie of the year? Lets see... I want to start with X-Men. The latest X-Men movie was great but little low of my expectations. Godzilla's action scenes are awesome but the script was too bad. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a great teenage movie but action scenes are not like I expected. I saying if you're a action and sci-fi lover or not, you are going to love this movie. Don't miss this movie, It was great! 9/10"
"brijester","9","3","6","9 June 2014"," An Awesome movieDefinitely one of the BEST movies I have ever seen!
","When I had seen the trailer of this movie, it looked like an OK movie, something just for timepass. But when I saw this movie (first day, first show) , it was just mind-blowing!! I had never thought it would be this good! It's a post-apocalyptic kind-of world where some aliens called as mimics have invaded the world and he humans seem to be on the losing side. I won't tell more about the story as the less you know, the more you can enjoy! The actors have done a great job, though only two actors have the main roles, others are barely noticeable. The direction is brilliant. Special effects are fantastic. But the story is the winner here. It's very creative and appealing. It's based on the book ""All You Need Is Kill"". I'm not a Tom Cruise fan and I've not seen much of his movies. But after seeing this, I've reminded of the fact that what a great actor he is! Though he looks old in this movie, his acting skills seem to improve with age! He has played his role to perfection. When the movie starts, he's a coward who will do anything to avoid going to war. But as time progresses he slowly transforms into a soldier /hero who ultimately goes on to save the world! And the transformation, from a coward to hero is done brilliantly and flawlessly. It never looks forced. And it won't be fair on my part not to mention Emily Blunt. I don't think I had even heard of her before this movie. And she has also done a terrific job. She's a tough soldier and also Cruise's motivation and support in the film. Kudos to her acting. After a long time, I'm seeing a heroine do a great job where movies are generally dominated by heroes. The aliens have also been depicted quite well. Very menacing-looking. Also, a very creative design. Don't' look similar to any alien that I've seen before, meaning it's a good thing. The film is a visual delight. The post-apocalyptic look of the world is very convincing and very well done. Photography also shines in a lot of the scenes. The exo-suit for the soldiers is designed well. And the fight sequences are pretty good. To wrap up, this is definitely one of the BEST movies I've ever seen! It's got CLASSsomething which most movies don't have. Believe me you wouldn't want to miss this one. I'm gonna go watch it again.."
"ashokvnair","9","3","6","8 June 2014"," Watch. Rewind. Repeat.
","Edge of Tomorrow has been the movie I have been waiting for from this summer's list of releases. And boy, does it deliver!<br/><br/>This is one Cruise's finest performances yet. There is no cockiness, holier-than-thou, smart-ass attitude which his characters usually are. The design of the mimics is literally out of this world - a cross between the sentinels from 'The Matrix' and the aliens from 'Alien' and quite terrifying. This is director Doug Liman's best work since 'The Bourne Identity' with his tight direction from the beach landing (nod to Saving Private Ryan?), the alien attacks, keeping the time loop events interesting and keeping romance largely out of the narration. <br/><br/>The time-loop, or day repeating itself didn't wear itself it out as new events were depicted. The humor between these loops was in good taste and connected the watcher to the events in the movie.<br/><br/>I would have preferred a more action oriented ending (like 'The Avengers') instead of the slightly tame one in the movie. For that reason alone, I have shaved the rating of 1 point from 10. Otherwise this movie strikes cinematic gold.<br/><br/>This is the action movie that audience have been complaining that they don't get to see. And it's quite unfortunate that when a movie like this is made, the viewer-ship and fan-fare is abysmal. Especially in the USA where the audience I guess has been dumbed down thanks to the Marvel and Disney movies of the past decade.<br/><br/>I guess that this movie will be 'The Shawshank Redemption' of Sci-Fi Action. Excellent critical rating, but poor box-office."
"CorumJI","9","3","6","8 June 2014"," Groundhog Day Meets Alien Invasion Action Pic
","That summary pretty much tells you the whole general plot, but it does a great job of making an interesting story out of it, nonetheless. It's not the classic that GHD was, but it's a very effective, very competent SF thriller... and for Hollywood, the fact that I said it's good SF and not merely Sci Fi says a lot. I use SF in a fairly restricted way, unlike most. This is not some deep thinking picture, though it can and could elicit some good college dorm BS sessions as can any time-travel sort of film. I would liken it in quality to another pretty good Tom Cruise pic, ""Minority Report"". I can recommend this as both an entertaining movie as well as a movie worth seeing on the big screen."
"aakinz","10","3","6","8 June 2014"," Well executed and acted fiction film
","After watching the trailer I thought this film is going to be very similar to 'Source code'. Then I questioned myself why would Tom Cruise star in a film which is similar to a popular cult film. So I've have decide to watch it. Oh boy, I was surprised. It's nothing like anything before.<br/><br/>It's a simple storyline or not so simple. A coward major with no combat skills thrown in to a most brutal battle. With no combat skills what so ever he dies there brutally. Then shockingly he wakes up a day before(watch the film to understand why). He realises situation that that war is impossible to win, and he had to die every time, wake up a day before, go to war again and die again until it's won. <br/><br/>What I like about this movie is the plot which was the biggest sea landing in WW2, D-day. Everything has been put together perfectly well in to this plot. The emotional depth, humour and the performance from the cast were amazing. Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton probably at their best. Though its the same day again and again, the things slowly starting change every time he restarts the day. The flow and progress is really well put together by the Director. Doug Liman back to his 'Bourne Identity' best. <br/><br/>Overall a satisfying edge of the seat action/science fiction film after a while. A must watch."

","I have to say I was pretty excited about seeing this movie because it is an original story and contains Emily Blunt. What I was not expecting was how incredible it ended up being! Tom Cruise was simply perfect in his role and its the best acting I have seen from him since Jerry Maguire. In essence the movie just flat out rocked!<br/><br/>I would say it was the best movie I have seen hands down in quite some years. GO SEE IT and see it in IMAX 3D if you can. It's worth the extra dough! The story is suspenseful, action packed and not too complicated but not boring either. Oh and did I mention Emily Blunt? She holds her own in this movie as just an incredible actress."
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","7","3","6","3 June 2014"," Edge of Tomorrow Review
","My Thoughts: Watching this movie reminded me of a few other movies such as Groundhog Day and the Matrix. I shouldn't have to explain why this movie reminds me of Groundhog Day but the reason that this movie has me thinking of the Matrix is due to the Aliens that the human race are fighting; they have the look of the robots that we see in the Matrix movies. This is not to say this is a bad thing at all. This movie is a true sci-fi movie that any sci-fi fan will appreciate. Why do I say that? First, you have the futuristic mechanized armor, which, at first glance, I thought looked like it was uncomfortable to wear, but it doesn't seem that way to the actors on the screen at least. It is cool to watch them in this power armor, and they give you different variations of it as well: there is the basic grunt armor all the way up to something that looks like Heavy Infantry armor. Second, is these aliens that come to take over the earth. Yes, they look like the Matrix robots, but they are pretty cool to look at and they have better action scenes than those other pesky robots. Plus, you have at least three different kinds, though we really only see the other two a handful of the time. And third, you have this crazy time loop that Cage (Tom Cruise) is in.<br/><br/>The quick premise of the movie is these aliens have invaded Earth; we don't know why, we just know that its a fight for survival and it isn't really looking good for the human race. Cage is a Major in the United States Army and is a Public Relations Officer. Pretty much, it is his job to give the war a good spin, and he is really good at his job. For some reason though, General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) who is in charge of the United Defense Force wants to put Cage on the front lines to video tape the big push to take back Europe (think WWII D-Day-type attack). Of course, Cage doesn't want to do this as he is a PR man and not really a solider, but for some reason, the General has it in his mind that one way or another, Cage will be on the front line come morning. Arrested and called a deserter, he is sent to the front line to fight instead of video tape.<br/><br/>Now, I will have to say, if you do not like montages or a lot of repeatable scenes, then you are not going to like this movie. It is not just the same scene over and over again, though; you do get the first kind of experience for awhile, but when the plot flushes out more, we start moving along to other areas, and we see that scene a few times. I have to say, they do a good job to give you different takes on the same scene. And regardless of what your personal opinion of Tom Cruise is, he does a good job in this movie. Another take they give you is that you do not always know if you are watching a virgin scene or one where they have repeated it before.<br/><br/>Another actor that I think gives us a good performance is Bill Paxton, Master Dergeant Farell, who has the distinguished job of making sure Cage doesn't run off and desert; his personality is just great to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>My Recommendation: If you are looking for a good sci-fi movie, then this is going to be your movie as long as you don't mind the repeatable scenes, but you should already be expecting that for this type of movie. It tells you that in the tagline: Live, Die, Repeat."
"AdrenalinDragon","9","3","6","31 May 2014"," Alien Sci-Fi action mixed with Groundhog Day creates a surprising gem
","It's always great to see movies pull off already used concepts and blend them together as a new fresh coat of paint. In this case, a superb Sci- Fi action movie combined with Groundhog Day's main gimmick. Many movies fail to deliver in both special effects and a well structured story. Edge of Tomorrow is one of those which delivers both superbly, and will surprise many viewers where it cleverly repeats the same day over without feeling tired, as well as keeping you hooked to see how the story slowly progresses through each repeating day. There's also quite a bit of humour in there too, which was kind of unexpected and gave me a few good laughs.<br/><br/>The plot is about an alien invasion on Earth and Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) forced to battle against the aliens, despite never being trained for combat at all. After dying in battle, he finds himself repeating the same day over and over (with nobody else seemingly remembering but him), but realises there may be a link to the time loop and defeating the aliens.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are very well done, reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan and Starship Troopers. The CGI is top quality, and the 12/PG-13 violence is used effectively without feeling toned down. The director did a great job of using London as it's main setting, but there are also other surprise locations throughout the movie. Tom Cruise continues to prove he can still pull off action movies without a problem, and his developing chemistry with Emily Blunt feels natural here. Overall, one of my favourite movies of 2014. It really surprised me how good it was."

"ka-adams","1","24","92","8 July 2014"," Not Impressed
","I'm honestly not sure how this film has had such good reviews. I found many issues with it and I wanted my money back by the end.<br/><br/>First off, the characters aren't likable. At all. Every character had a lack of emotion that is essential for audiences to enjoy watching them. Cage was annoying and Rita just seemed angry. They didn't seem like actual people.<br/><br/>Second off, there is almost no explanation of what is going on. The mystery that I think they are going for is taken too far. It took way too long for them to even show what a ""mimic"" is, let alone explain ANYTHING about it. There is almost no back story for any of the characters and I, as a viewer, found this very frustrating.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the humor wasn't funny. I think that they tried to make Tom Cruise's character somewhat likable with a few jokes here and there but they really weren't successful. They were misplaced and tasteless. I really didn't find the one guy fighting naked very funny. Come on.<br/><br/>Most importantly, IT WAS SOOOOOOOO REPETITIOUS!!! I understand that he kept going back in time and it would have been a decent story line had I not been forced to watch the same scene over and over again. The first few times it repeated I thought it was okay, but I don't need to see Tom Cruise get yelled at repeatedly or fight machinery and fail repeatedly. It was supposed to further the storyline in a unique way, but instead made me very annoyed. The repetition made a story that had potential to be interesting, be incredibly boring.<br/><br/>The redeeming quality is that Tom Cruise did okay with what he was given. It just wasn't enough to win me over.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film is not worth sitting through. It is slow, uninteresting and unlikable. No thank you."

"maligor5","4","5","13","1 September 2014"," Not a science fiction film
","Had big expectations for Edge of Tomorrow, but at its heart is just another dumb, loud, alien invasion summer crash grab. There are some very light science fiction elements such as the mechanized suits and Cruise's special power that reset time upon death. There is no intelligence or motive given behind the aliens invasion, and not even a generic explanation of how time and space might warp space and time to allow it to happen. <br/><br/>Cruise and Blunt put in solid performances. Blunt is stoic and plays an awesome soldier. Cruise is a little more erratic, flashing his million dollar smile a little too liberally given the situation. There are no other real noteworthy characters in this film. One of the problems I had was just when Cruise and Blunt were developing some on screen chemistry, the ""gimmick"" kicked in meaning Cruise meant an unfortunate demise resetting everything. <br/><br/>The film works as a generic action summer outing. It will never be remembered as a science fiction great. I probably enjoyed Oblivion more. Even though its not original and becomes convoluted , the first hour alone of Oblivion is more thought provoking and entertaining than Edge ever is. Would be interested to know how many rating Edge 10 ever feel the need to watch it again....maybe 10% ?"
"xatian11968","4","6","17","24 June 2014"," Left desiring a lot more with a film budget like this, more about Cage than aliens
","I had hopes for ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" because Tom Cruise was rumored to have actually done a decent job for the film. The plot started out even enough, and of course got interesting when the main battle sequence got started. Then it all fell apart, and the entire film amounted to a repeat of the last 10 minutes of the first 20 minutes of the film for the entire 113 minute running time. <br/><br/>The alien storyline was great, different, and had legs before you knew their weaknesses. But those legs were cut off in the mundane replay of watching the leads' hunt down the real reason behind their adversary's success which had little to do with the aliens themselves and more to do with watching Tom Cruises race through the same old paces. This, in the totality of the film, completely stopped the involvement of the actual aliens in the storyline action; and shifted the entire storyline to watching Tom Cruise repeat himself. Over. Over. Over and Over again.<br/><br/>On Tom Cruise's character, viewers got a little background, as the apt ""Groundhog Day"" story style comparison truncated this development because the time-line jumped back so many times, that viewers had an opportunity to cease caring about the character. Tom Cruise did a great job on not being Tom Cruise. Sadly though, the script left him with little to work with. Now had the story kept pace - without the always questionable suggestion that time could be meddled with, merely by a single alien intelligence â€“ we would have gone on to find a serious story about alien technology or some other interesting creation. Alas not though. <br/><br/>The one world paradigm of the film's society glimpse was dull too, and didn't do much to convey the story; the film didn't have the community ownership as in the way ""Twenty-eight Days Later"" offered British connection to the Island, and its landmarks. In fact it was a distraction as you never knew anything about the type of society Tom Cruise's character was coming from, except to know it was in the future and that the Eiffel Tower & I.M. Pei's Pyramid lasted long enough in history to be destroyed in the film (though the prize of the film was not located in the same place as the Holy Grail is in ""Da Vinci Code""). Aliens, yes. Relatable humans, no. The military themselves seemed pretty much a transfer of the crew from Sigourney Weaver's ""Alien"", right down to the stereotypical 'Latina' character, and of course the obligatory half-naked-eight-packed ""sexy white guy"" in the thread of Casper Van Dien's ""Starship troopers."" <br/><br/>The success of the story is that you are never given a chance to know anything more about the alien intelligence, except that they really don't like humans. Much in the same way of ""War of the Worlds."" We get the ""all powerful alien, with glaring weaknesses"" fit into a 113 minute time-line; but this is to a viewer-ship that never gets a detailed film/story about aliens, like we get a detailed ""Mission Impossible"" story of conspiracy in other Cruise films - we are left to wonder whether a good alien take-over film can be done in 113 minutes. There also seemed to be some ""Scientology"" rhetoric thrown into the story line for good measure as well, especially in the tone of ""past-lives"". <br/><br/>At any rate, the film was great going in, but petered out twenty minutes after the story rolled. I'll be blunt and say, Emily Blunt was awesome carrying the film, though I could have waited for the Red-Box debut!"

","I have read hundreds of reviews and explanations but haven't yet read one that made mention of what could open up a lot more possibilities.<br/><br/>Nobody has seemed to notice that when Cage first meets the general on Day 1 he says: ""General, I would prefer not to be filming acts of heroism and valor on that beach tomorrow"" to which, the General stands up, walks over to him, and with a knowing grin slyly says ... ""you won't be""... like he already knows because HE (the general) is somehow in his own time loop resetting the day. <br/><br/>And when Cage shows up in his office to get the device (and see the Omega is at the Louvre) this time the general gives it to him (after hundreds of times before saying NO) indicating at this point he (the general) knows Cage is now ready to take the next step to destroy the Mimics. <br/><br/>This could explain why the general arrested and tasered Cage and set him up to go the front - like he knew that getting Cage sent to the front would essentially end the war - why else would the general send a non combat high level adman USA Major into this situation?"

","With this new decade making numerous Science Fiction films, which at times are either seemingly good but turn out to be unexpectedly bad, like Michael Bay's Transformers films, or ones that some would think would turn out to suck just cause the filmmakers only focus on the concept and action of the film, rather than the movie's actual plot, but turn out to be unexpectedly good. I mean when you look at movies with extremely iconic and eye-catching concepts, like Bay's sequels (as I mentioned) or the prequel Star Wars Trilogy, you'd anticipate them for pure greatness, but instead just turned out to be a mess in the end. But in Edge of Tomorrow's case, it's one where you'd think in the exact opposite way. But when you think about it that way, you'd be wrong. So basically this one just turned out to be an unexpectedly GOOD one.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow's plot centers on Tom Cruise's Major William Cage who's been forced by superiors to fight off an alien race, known as the Mimics, after losing his rank in the United Defense Force (UDF). Although he starts off with no real experience in combat whatsoever, Cage becomes part of a time loop where every time he dies on the next day, he repeatedly starts the whole time-being over in a certain spot at an airport of the UDF's military soldiers on the previous day before he died. And with his ability to learn from his experiences in the next day (before and) after dying numerously to repeat the whole day over and over again, it's now up to him to destroy the alien race of the Mimics, with the help of Emily Blunt's Sergeant Rita Vrataski, as well as many other soldiers in the UDF and help restore his life back to normal by finding and destroying the source to his continuous death loops.<br/><br/>With well-paced action, along with a brilliantly written script and clever originally, Edge of Tomorrow certainly knows how to balance all of these aspects of itself properly. Despite being a blockbuster that wasn't successful at the box office, EoT certainly was by no means not worth watching just cause some might think it would become a disaster for how unoriginal a concept like this might be. But if you look past those thoughts, Edge of Tomorrow offers a gripping storyline what with it's considerably perfect pacing, an awesome (and original) concept of mechanized robotic suits, the cleverly designed aliens, and all of the iconic (and eye-catching) machinery. Think of it like a Mechanized Tom Cruise fighting off aliens version of Groundhog Day, or a combination of Groundhog Day and Independence Day. Even if you're not a fan of Cruise's films, still give this a watch. The end result is not only one of 2014's finest flicks, but arguably Tom Cruise's best film to date.<br/><br/>(Thank you, Liman.)"

","Bloodless violence and lack of character development. If you're going to make a war movie, even a Sci-Fi war movie, please watch Saving Private Ryan first.<br/><br/>Blood, tears, terrified faces, severed limbs, bodies blowing up--none of those are in the movie. Tom Cruise's character, Bill Cage, never shows the suffering of the Cassandra Complex: knowing people are going to die, but being absolutely unable to prevent it. Groundhog Day had tons more character development, and that was a comedy. We saw Bill Murray's character's rage and pain, repeating the same day over, and over, and over again. <br/><br/>All the background characters--the other soldiers, including Emily Blunt's Rita, are one-dimensional. They are all just Gung Ho. There is a black guy. There is a fat guy. There is a woman. Why? It doesn't matter.

We never get those scenes, like in The Matrix, where for 10 minutes between action sets we can dive into who the characters are. The dialogue, for everyone except Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, is just so on the nose.<br/><br/>Most critics praised this movie, so I expected to be blown away. Instead I got a video game.

"gerrythree","5","5","15","7 June 2014"," Edge Of Tomorrow Senselessly Violent Science Fiction Film
","Watching ""Edge Of Tomorrow,"" you realize the contempt Hollywood media conglomerates have for their audience. The central character of this movie, Major Cage, spends most of his time getting killed. According to the idiotic premise of this movie, because he was dowsed with an alien creature's blood the first time he died in battle, Cage will now time loop back to an earlier time whenever he is killed. So, like a gamer playing a video shooter game, Cage goes back to the start of the game if the enemy finishes him off. On and on, Cage gets killed, getting more proficient at avoiding wipe out as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The reason Cage is in battle is bizarre. He is an American major handling PR who tells a UDF general that he is an American officer and he will he not follow UDF orders to land with soldiers attacking the Micmics, the alien enemies. When Cage says he will make life hard on the general if he tries to send Cage into battle, naturally, the UDF general reduces Cage's rank to private, falsifies records to show Cage is an attempted deserter, kidnaps Cage and sends Cage into battle as cannon fodder.<br/><br/>Co-star Emily Blount plays a character called the ""Angel of Verdun."" That's it for her character development. J squad, the unit Cage joins just before the attack, is made up of the necessary social representatives: a woman, a black guy, a fat guy, some whites including one who looks Hispanic. The less said about Bill Paxton's Master Sergeant Farell, the better. All put on spiffy mechanical exo-skeletons before being sent to battle.<br/><br/>Comparing this movie to 1997's ""Starship Troopers"" shows how far Hollywood has sunk in its creative abilities. True, Edge's director Doug Liman doesn't hold a candle to Starship's director, Paul Verhoeven. More than that, though, is how ""Starship Troopers"" showed a team effort, no single character being Superman, and how Verhoeven and his writers threw in an anti-military subtext.<br/><br/>""Edge Of Tomorrow"" is an ugly and unreal movie that glorifies fictional soldiers getting obliterated in battle, repeatedly. This movie has no heart and it makes no sense. I've read that Brad Pitt turned down an offer to star in Edge. After starring in ""World War Z,"" a really ugly and stupid movie, I can understand why Pitt did not want to double down with another junk science fiction movie. Tom Cruise's previous movie ""Oblivion"" is Shakespeare compared to ""Edge of Tomorrow."" As you may have guessed, I am no fan of ""Edge of Tomorrow."""

","This is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. It easily features the best performance Tom Cruise has ever given, perhaps because it offers him a chance to reprise every character he has played. We get to see action, romance, and obnoxious pretty boy behavior all rolled into one. I'm not kidding! TC fits like a glove into this character and the supporting cast (Emily Blunt!) is similarly entertaining. I don't rewatch many films but this is a keeper - well cast, well-directed and superbly edited. Seriously - this film features time loops so not being too repetitive is really important to keeping things rolling. And the editing team did a fantastic job here, even making things a bit comical by keeping it brisk. Very well done special effects which make the film highly watchable even as time goes by."
"one-nine-eighty","8","2","4","24 May 2016"," Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers meets Saving Private Ryan - but it was great
","This film is ""Groundhog Day"" crossed with ""Starship Troopers"" and maybe ""Saving Private Ryan"". An alien race has attacked Earth and on the surface of things is winning, humanity is mounting a final push hoping that they can turn things around and hopefully get some success - if not win. Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage, he's screwed over and put in a front line squad of grunts who will be fighting on the beaches of France. Things go wrong and Cage is killed in action. Instead of fading away into death he wakes as if it was all a really vivid dream. Cage repeats the day numerous times, changing events ever so slightly but each time he dies and wakes up in the same day again. From here he tries to figure out what is happening and how to escape it while keeping his life. Step forward battle hardened Emily Blunt, a random encounter with her (one of the times she doesn't die) Cage tells her what is going on and she advises him to find her when he wakes up again. She seems to know what is going on with Cage and tries to coach him and get him and humanity through the day and the war. <br/><br/>Despite the parallels this obviously has to ""Groundhog Day"" I quite enjoyed this. The film wasn't one which invokes lots of thinking or emotion but it was a good old yarn to keep me entertained for the duration. The cast is really good, all players play their parts really well and are believable. The chemistry on film is tight and even silences seem to invoke a narrative conversation. The effects and CGI is tastefully done and works well to compliment the film. The story isn't original by any stretch of the imagination (I've read reviews that say it is but it really isn't something new, sorry) but it is an original delivery of the story which makes up for it not being 100% original. The film doesn't treat its audience like idiots by over explaining things and this is a refreshing approach. The science used and mentioned in the film seems believable enough despite being immersed in fiction. The action is great although there are times were wired stunts are used a lot, but I guess with a mecha-suit enhancing the wearers actions this is a likely hood. All in all I am going to give this a meaty 8 out of 10, definitely worth a watch and suitable for a wide range of audiences."
"buckjohnsonus","9","2","4","17 May 2016"," A surprisingly good movie
","Contains spoilers.<br/><br/>So I just watched this film for about the fifth time and decided it deserved a review.<br/><br/>Part of what made this movie so good for me was that I never expected it to be as good as it was. I think many people felt this way and as a result it didn't do exceptionally well in the box office. Having said that, it's this unexpected nature that is making it a cult classic. I've seen very few people disappointed with it. Many movies oversell in the trailers and often I expect too much and I'm disappointed. With this movie I expected very little and was blown away.<br/><br/>Let's start from the beginning. When I first saw the TV trailer, I was unimpressed. The aliens reminded me vaguely of the sentinels from the Matrix. The story line seemed to mimic Groundhog Day. The CGI felt unimpressive in the TV trailer that I saw and I just wasn't interested. I just felt like I'd been there and done that.<br/><br/>When I first saw the movie I was a little buzzed. I'd just come from the bar with my friend and he suggested the movie and I thought ...whatever. It was my first time in the local AMC, which since I'd been there years before, had installed wide, comfortable recliners. This didn't hurt the experience.<br/><br/>From the beginning this movie took me in, immersed me and not for one second was my concentration on anything else...from beginning to end. It was in one word engaging.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent. Bill Paxton was a little too stereotypical along with the lines he delivered. The same could be said of a couple of the troops, but it gave the cast variety and for me didn't break the bounds of being too excessive. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt were impressive. Cruise delivered on his character, a sheltered soldier and a former ad man who sold over-polished BS for a living. Cruise's progression from coward to a serious, battle tested soldier was seamless. He delivered in everything from dark comedy to tragic love. Blunt equaled his performance and this movie wouldn't have been the same without her. The best romantic movies work only because the characters possess the ability to make you fall in love with them and it's hard not to fall for her. Beautiful, fit, adept and focused, yet allowing glimpses of pain, femininity and fragility to occasionally slip through the cracks to the surface. This was the brilliance of her acting.<br/><br/>The comedy is dark and mixes into a film that is dark, but it's subtle and well done. Although there are some small CGI parts that could be cut in my opinion, the aliens were well done and were more original than the trailer I saw led me to believe. The mood of this film is somber and the often clouded skies complement the mood. The battle scenes were epic in magnitude and there was so much to be seen beyond the trailer I first viewed on TV. <br/><br/>Although the film was generally well done there were three aspects that I really loved about this film. <br/><br/>First, the effects weren't often your typical CGI. The director mixed the CGI with life. When a tentacle would hit the ground there would be a very real feeling because dirt would fly realistically into the air. This grounded a lot of the effects and gave them a reality that pure CGI just can't do yet. Yes, there were some scenes that were not as well done, but in general the effects felt more intertwined with reality than the typical CGI film of today.<br/><br/>Second, this film did an excellent job of telling the story of a repeating day without feeling boring or repetitive and sometimes it was executed with extraordinary creativity. ""bang...on your feet maggot...bang...maggot...bang...maggot."" As I said this film has a satisfying dark feel I really liked and even the comedy came woven with death.<br/><br/>Third, and this is probably my favorite aspect to the film, was that in a way, it was a very tragic love story that was creatively hinted at, rather than being blatantly overt. It doesn't gratuitously throw sex and nudity in your face to sell itself as Game of Thrones does. Instead, it is subtle and more complex. It's the tragedy of falling in love with someone that barely knows you. It's the tragedy of watching this person you've grown to love die over and over. It's the tragedy of knowing this person you love has gone through the same thing before with someone else. She's aware you might be going through the same and she puts distance in between you with purpose. It's a longing for more that keeps you wanting. It almost forces you to imagine your own happy ending. In my mind the next words are: Cruise: ""Can I take you out when you have a free moment."" Blunt: ""Are you seriously hitting on me right now?"" ::she turns away in disgust:: Cruise: ""I have what you had and I have a story I think you'll want to hear. ::Blunt turns around:: Cruise: Can I buy you a cup of coffee?"" Sure, maybe that's roughly implied in the movie, but I still need to hear that extra step in my own mind. <br/><br/>After five times, I still am very much a fan of this movie. His and her battle suits have crossed my mind every Halloween since seeing it. Sure, perhaps the end time jump doesn't make sense. Being a programmer as a hobby since I was 15 got me creating theories regarding embedded loops to explain it, but in the end, I really don't care. I love this movie. Even with some flaws. Here's to hoping my now high expectations are exceeded in number 2."

He meets Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), and together they search for a way to beat the alien invaders.<br/><br/>Scenes repeat as Cage relives each day. Watching Cruise play against type is part of the fun, but the film finds plenty of humour in the situation, and we witness Cage learning to face danger despite his fear. His journey from an abject coward to a hero is plotted beautifully, and Cruise gives a wonderful performance never losing sight of the levity that adds much to the films appeal. He is ably supported by Emily Blunt as Vrataski, who matches his eventual grit and heroics. Bill Paxton features in the role of Master Sergeant Farell, in some of the funniest scenes.<br/><br/>Doug Liman creates a visual treat. The invasion scenes are hugely dramatic and expertly constructed, creating a sense of reality, chaos and danger into which the leads are thrown. The action is breathtaking and the special effects entirely convincing. The film moves at breakneck pace towards it's exciting conclusion, and not a moment is wasted. Liman packs so much into less than two hours that many other films can't match with much more run time.<br/><br/>The best thing Tom Cruise has done for some time and very highly recommended.

","Director Doug Liman's ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is ""Groundhog Day"" on steroids with some mean looking aliens. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Lt. Colonel Cage, who is sent into battle against mimic aliens who have destroyed much of the world. Cage is not really programmed for battle, probably because he was caged too much in military offices instead of the battlefield. Cage is scared out of wits, but then something miraculous happens; he dies in battle, and then relives the same day repeatedly. Why that happens? Let me not spoil if for you, but let's say that he became a blood brother of the Omega alien mimic fraternity; they have that? The stunning Emily Blunt co-stars as Rita, a fierce warrior who was pivotal in destroying many of these mimic aliens in a past war. Cage groundhogs into Rita's world and the two team to destroy the Omega mimic plan to destroy mankind. The first two acts of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" kept me on the edge of my seat with its inventiveness in a futuristic action movie. However, the third act of ""mimic aliens vs. human soldiers"" action unfortunately mimicked many other formulaic battle-oriented action flicks. I did like Cruise and Blunt in their performances; and to be blunt with you it was refreshing to see Cruise as a coward character and not cruising with the same old ""machoman saving the world"" typecast character he has played many times before, while Blunt cruised with another bravado performance. So let me finish this review before it ends on the edge of tomorrow. But if you got nothing going on tomorrow, it's not a bad idea to live & relive the ""Edge of Tomorrow"". **** Good"

","I usually think sci-fi movies have too many plot holes, and this one has some, but for the most part it makes sense. Of course, they are using the plot of groundhog day set in an alien invasion. One big plot hole is why didn't Rita leave herself notes so she wouldn't have to repeatedly meet Cage over and over. And the whole part where she and the scientist dude figured out some aliens are Alpha protecting an entity called Omega, was very far fetching. But anyway it was cool to see how Cage improved day to day to get further on the battlefield. Considering we are talking about invading aliens, why did others, like the general, find it so hard to believe Cage and Rita about time travel.<br/><br/>Anyway, it ended how it should with Cage waking up again except this time, things are different.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good sci-fi with cool special effects. Definitely one of Cruise's better films in the past 10 years."

","In the not too distant future the world is engulfed in battle with aliens. Tom Cruise plays Cage, a military media liaison, sent to Europe to talk with top military officials about their current success in pushing back the alien invasion. Europe has developed recently developed an armor type suit that has proved effective. Cage's meeting with General Birgham goes sour and while attempting to resist arrest Cage is knocked out. Upon waking up he finds himself stripped of all identification and credentials, now placed in the military effort framed as a deserter. Despite his attempt to explain his situation he is geared up and sent off to the front lines to fight the alien insurgence. He is air dropped in a futuristic invasion of Normandy like beach advance. During what is a very violent and merciless slaughter of human troops Cage manages to kill one of the larger aliens. When covered in the alien's blood it inadvertently transfers its special time manipulating powers over to him. So now when killed, his day is reset back to his first moment from when he comes through as an infantry recruit having been stripped of all his identification. After several runs of the same day over and over again, Cage meets up with the military's star solider Rita played by Emily Blunt. Cage finds out that part of her success as a solider stems from the fact that she too had once experienced the same phenomena. Together they attempt to use Cage's power of time rest to unravel the enemy alien inner workings and save the world. This is a great new Tom Cruise classic. Its Star Ship Troopers (1997) meets Groundhog Day (1993), in an edge of your seat non-stop fun, sci-fi adventure. Tom Cruise has totally redeemed for his recent lack luster box office offerings. Emily Blunt adds herself to the ranks of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley and Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor. Not often do strong female roles come along in films like this and she nails it; tough, strong willed and ready to kick ass. A much better role model for young girls who envy Disney princesses, who wait for their prince to come save the day. This movie is a refreshing alternative to todays, comic book, teen novel, sequels and reboots that seem to dominate the box office. I am not sure how well this movie would function as a sequel and quite honestly it doesn't matter. We can do without its mediocre sequel, this film by itself is awesome high octane action.

"rooprect","Null","2","4","9 November 2014"," Best World War II film that never was
","""Edge of Tomorrow"" has a whole lot going on. It's not just another scifi action flick, which is what I had thought and almost passed it by because of that. Instead, it's a very interesting mix of genres: scifi action (like ""Aliens""), World War II drama (like ""The Longest Day"") and comedy-philosophical mindbender (like ""Groundhog Day"").<br/><br/>First the philosophical part. The premise is this: a less-than-honorable officer (Tom Cruise) gets shanghai'd and sent to the front lines in a war against an alien race. He bungles his mission almost immediately. But then an interesting thing happens: he gets sent back to do it again. And again. And again. I call this philosophical because you can immediately see the metaphor for reincarnation. And oddly enough, I got an interesting taste of existentialism here, too: Tom Cruise plays a character whose life has inherently no meaning. However it is through his determination and force of will that he finds an opportunity to try to make meaning for his life. Yes, it is a bit like ""Groundhog Day"" (where the main character similarly repeats a day over & over), but I stress the existentialist vibe in ""Edge"" vs. the more Buddhist vibe of ""Groundhog"" a film more about enlightenment rather than taking control of fate as we see here.<br/><br/>Enough of that; I'll leave you to consider the deeper implications of this film after you see it. The next major point I really enjoyed about this film was the playful sense of humor. First of all, Tom Cruise doesn't play some hotshot soldier who can kill 1000s of enemies on a single magazine of bullets. Instead, he is introduced as something of a pretentious pencil-pusher, an idiot who doesn't even know how to unlock the safety on a firearm let alone fire it. So immediately his character has an added dimension and more room for a dynamic transformation. He's one of the most human soldier characters I've seen in a while. The film is peppered with timely bits of humor that keep things fresh. Director Doug Liman got his start doing comedy (""Getting In"", ""Swingers"", ""Go"") before he became known for action/thrillers like his ""Bourne"" films and ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (which also have great spots of humor).<br/><br/>And last, there's that bit I alluded to about World War II. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" plays out very much like a WWII flick, in particular a film about Normandy on D-Day. Thus, the action scenes are not some over-the-top cgi extravaganza in some surreal setting, but rather, they took great pains to recreate an authentic Normandy-type beach setting with tons of live props, explosions, stunts, and very sparing use of cgi effects. So if you're somewhat numbed by computerized visuals, have no fear, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a throwback to the old war flicks our parents grew up on. It does carry a modern, gritty feel to it. But it's still a very classic approach.<br/><br/>When they do resort to computerized special effects, it's fabulous. The aliens that they're fighting are very creative and sinister, more like giant viruses than anything comic booky like Martians with helmets & ray guns. There's no point in describing the aliens, you just gotta see them for yourself.<br/><br/>I also wanted to mention something I didn't notice until almost 45 minutes into the film, but there is an interesting LACK of profanity which makes this a pretty family-friendly flick. If you're like me, maybe you're tired of action flicks where characters drop the f-bomb every 10 words. Well here, we get tough, imposing, mean & dirty characters without them having to cuss like sailors to seem tough. Yes, this is PG-13, but it feels every bit as tense & heavy as an NC-17 or R film.<br/><br/>Thumbs up from someone who rarely watches action flicks. If you end up liking this film, here are a few other gems worth tracking down: ""The Host"" - an action/comedy/satire monster flick about a sea monster attacking Korea (it is said that the sea monster is a metaphor for Western imperialism), ""Robocop"" the original 1987 version - a cynical, nightmarish look at the future with spots of great deadpan comedy, and ""Starship Troopers"" - a very satirical look at war and the mindless mob-mentality violence that often accompanies war, by the same director who did Robocop. It's always fun to find a heart-pounding action flick that has deeper meaning below the surface."
"Rickting","8","2","4","3 November 2014"," I didn't see this one coming
","Edge Of Tomorrow was looking like it was going to be one of 2014's big blockbuster flops. Tom Cruise (Not a fan) in what seemed to be the most generic movie ever made. Generic science fiction shoot em up meets Groundhog Day. Really? Yet it's a genuine must see blockbuster with Tom Cruise managing to not be boring for once. A cowardly soldier is stuck in a time loop and replays the same battle over and over again, trying to defeat an alien attack. Ironically, despite being about a time loop, it never feels repetitive and is fun and inventive throughout. It's a bit long, the ending although still great fun feels more generic and at first the film appears to be about to fulfil the expectations of pretty much everyone but aside from that this box office smashing triumph is one of the best blockbusters in a year full of quality science fiction epics. Alongside the better than usual Tom Cruise is Emily Blunt, who's excellent and an awesome action heroine, while none of the other actors fall flat.<br/><br/>Doug Liman proves himself very capable of handling a big budget blockbuster and the action sequences are suspenseful, well crafted and full of believable special effects. The script sparkles with wit and intelligence and while not deep the film is a very entertaining and subtle commentary on the repetitive nature of most blockbusters and how almost all of them are like video games. It repeats itself with the battle, but it's not a repetitive movie otherwise and actually goes in many different directions. Although the Paris finale isn't as inventive as the rest of the movie it's still fun and it's got so much more soul and swagger than anyone would have predicted. This is likely to either be in my 2014 top ten or be an honourable mention. I recommend this to anyone who likes these kinds of movies as it doesn't actually feel like a video game at all and leaves The Amazing Spider-Man 2 cowering in its shadow. An awesome science fiction movie overall, and one I would be happy to rewatch despite its over length.<br/><br/>8/10"
"camsimpson","9","2","4","2 November 2014"," Groundhog Day in Sci-Fi mode
","Tuned in to watch this on a plane trip - expected a Tom Cruise sci-fi of the likes of Oblivion (which I enjoyed) but perhaps a poor cousin, as I hadn't seen much preview material. I guess I expected a lower budget flick. <br/><br/>This isn't low budget. It's not a poor cousin. It's a step up in all departments.<br/><br/>This is Oblivion, plus Groundhog Day (with the humor), plus Tom Cruise in a role I cannot imagine anyone else pulling off with this degree of aplomb. Hilarious, action-packed, puzzle-solving brilliance.<br/><br/>I believed all the characters in this movie. The special effects are perfect. All involved in the making of this flick should be proud."

","I was fully prepared to be frustrated with wasted time during the repeats in this movie given the premise. I have to admit, though, it was handled well. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise was cast perfectly at the beginning of the movie as the soft, bureaucratic military officer and his growth into a hardened soldier was realistic and well-acted. <br/><br/>With apologies to Keira Knightley, Emily Blunt may be the most beautiful woman in Hollywood sans makeup. She was rarely portrayed as vulnerable in the movie, and that was a nice refresher from the standard woman-in-power's perceived weakness.<br/><br/>Bill Paxton brings the score down in this movie, as he remains one of the worst actors in show biz in my opinion."

","I'v got to like Tom Cruise in sci-fi movies lately which I wouldn't have said ten years ago' the thing about this movie is the humour for me' every time he dies I just found it so funny for some reason. The movie is based on an alien invasion on earth and cruise plays major Cage who is trying to sell the war to the public and is thrown into the lions den by his commanding officer (played by brendan gleeson' who takes an instant dislike to cage) where he comes across a platoon of soldiers and their commanding officer (bill Paxton) where he quickly finds out that the war is basically a slaughter and he has to relive the nightmare time after time against an enemy that knows their every move, step in' Rita Vrstaski (Emily blunt) who is the poster girl special forces hero, and gives cage some startling news that he's totally unprepared for. this is one of the best sci-fi movies Iv'e seen for a long time carried of by Cruise and blunt very well' the ending is a bit predictable but there's enough going on in the rest of the movie to keep us all entertained for a couple of hours."

This movie; despite the fact that it is made of multiple concepts already seen separately in other movies, is something completely new that hopefully no one will try to imitate without talent. It could actually open a new gender, between video game and movie. A movie to be seen by everyone. Actors are great, special effects are awesome, and the plot is really original. I do not usually recommend movie on IMDb but this one does merit it. Tom cruise, Emily Blunt and the entire cast at their best.

"tomgillespie2002","6","2","4","7 October 2014"," Wildly entertaining first two-thirds makes way for a generic climax
","Despite his questionable religious beliefs, cringe-worthy talk show appearances, and all-round general creepiness, one cannot deny the raw star power of Tom Cruise, even a shocking 28 years since his breakthrough in Top Gun (1986). Here, he brings charm to an instantly dislikeable character - a cowardly, smarmy PR major who hasn't seen a second of combat in a world battling invading alien forces. His performance - possibly one of the best in his long career - shows his true range as his character goes through a highly convincing arc from pathetic rookie to fully-fledged action hero. It's easy to forget that Cruise is a highly accomplished actor, and there is no-one better out there to spear-head a blockbuster.<br/><br/>As humanity prepares for a surprise attack on an alien force called Mimics who have devastated many of the large cities on Earth, General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders public affairs officer Major William Cage (Cruise) to cove r the combat from the front lines during the assault. Objecting that his life will be placed in danger, Cage is arrested, labelled as a deserter, and wakes up handcuffed in the hands of Master Sergeant Farrell (Bill Paxton), a Southern drill instructor with a strange sense of humour. Cage is suited and booted with hi- tech armour and dropped into the battle, which turns out to be a disaster for the humans and they are overrun by the Mimics, who decimate their forces. Cage manages to kill a rare large Mimic, and is killed in return when the Mimic's acid-like blood dissolves his face.<br/><br/>He then wakes up handcuffed, and again meets Master Sergeant Farrell, who appears to have never met him. The day plays out like it did before, and once again Cage is dropped into the battlefield only to be killed again, this time surviving a little longer. It's on the battlefield that he meets famous soldier Rita 'Full Metal B***h' Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who seems to recognise his ability to anticipate events and tells him to seek her out, before they are both killed again. Cage tracks her down on the base, and Rita informs him that he is stuck in a time-loop, something she experienced after a previous battle with the Mimics but has since lost due to a blood transfusion. The two start to work together, with Cage training to survive a little bit more every time he dies.<br/><br/>Adapted from the Japanese light novel All You Need is Kill (a title the film adopted before it changed to the generic Edge of Tomorrow - something that may have been the cause for it's underwhelming box- office performance), the film clearly takes inspiration from video games. Every time your character dies, it starts again from the beginning of the level or checkpoint, where you can use your experience to gain the skill required to complete the level. While this can be frustrating and monotonous when bashing a game controller, Edge of Tomorrow doesn't linger on the repetitiveness of Cage's day, and instead moves the story along to the point where you don't even know how many times Cage has lived the same day.<br/><br/>Each time, Cage learns to duck here, fire there, take a different route; and director Doug Liman revels in killing off his hero in a variety of ways to an often comedic effect. The first two-thirds of the movie are delightfully entertaining, with the Mimics proving to be inventive creations, resembling giant, tentacled tumbleweeds, and the movie wisely choosing not to get bogged down in time-loop mumbo- jumbo. Emily Blunt, one of the most charismatic and beautiful actresses working at the moment, is excellent, portraying a female lead who, for once, isn't there simply for the male hero to rescue and fall in love with, but is the key to any hopes of success. Which is all the more disappointing when the movie begins to bow to convention during the final third, as Vrataski starts to fall for our vertically- challenged protagonist.<br/><br/>As with most recent blockbusters, Edge of Tomorrow also struggles at the climax. The inventiveness of the Groundhog Day approach (I almost made it through the entire review without mentioning the Bill Murray classic) makes way for a familiar, simplistic climax and a roll-your-eyes bittersweet final scene, It's sad, because this could have been one of the best blockbusters in the past couple of years; a twist on the usual crash-bang-wallop alien invasion flick. It does, however, offer plenty of great action, bolstered by a fine sense of humour, and proves that Tom Cruise can still convincingly anchor a big-budget action movie, even at the ripe old age of 52.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"sushant0406","8","2","4","28 September 2014"," Way beyond my expectations...Bravo!!!
","I really do respect Tom Cruise a lot as an actor because of the amount of hardwork he puts into his films,but, had not enjoyed any of his previous ventures post MI4. To add to that I'm not a fan of Sci-Fi cinema. Despite that, I braved to watch this movie, as I had heard rave reviews about it, and boy, it was a treat!!<br/><br/>Europe is attacked by an ET species and their only hope is an officer with absolutely no prior experience in combat,who is stuck in a time loop,after accidentally killing one of the aliens and having it's blood transfused. Even though,dying repeatedly and going back in time to go through the same routine,like in Groundhog Day, seemed to be predictable and I expected to get bored. But, every time , Cruise presented his character in a different fashion and was able to emote almost all the feelings a human possibly can with ease. His comic timing was right on the money. <br/><br/>Director Doug Liman did a great job behind the camera. The story was innovative and almost all the loose ends were tied by the time the film ended.The special effects and BG score were good. Of the cast, Emily Blunt was brilliant; so was Bill Paxton. But, the film belonged to Tom Cruise, who was absolutely perfect. It was easily his best performance in the last decade or so. Sheer delight."
"priyantha-bandara","8","2","4","20 September 2014"," Rocks the foundations of sci fi that came out lately
","Tom Cruise movies sell. I mean they really sell. But when the movie is equally good as Tom himself and it can pull some really mind blowing stunts without making the viewers to worry about the huge plot holes it is definitely a blockbuster. Edge of Tomorrow is a fresh look at the age old sci fi genre that based on alien invasions and courage's humans who defeat them. And it's the modern day Independence Day movie and it seriously rocks the foundations of sci fi that came out lately. Huge production, staggering CG and awesome acting makes Edge of Tomorrow one of the best action sci fi's lately. I wish I can say the same about the plot but though it is amazing at a glance there are plenty of places it fails. But it doesn't matter when you start to watch because it's so entertaining that some of your senses get instantly freeze.<br/><br/>In not so distant future the world is invaded by an alien race known as Mimics. The world is at war and seems like the humans are capable of defeating them. Major Cage (Tom Cruise) who is a publicity agent for the ARMY than a real soldier is sent to the front line of the crucial battle against Mimics without his will. Cage finds himself terrified and helpless when the battle becomes bloodier and a massacre of humans than expected. But coincidentally he discovers a way to manipulate time and relive the same battle and perfect it to realize that the aliens can be defeated using a different strategy. Rita (Emily Blunt) a fellow soldier joins him for the ride.<br/><br/>The plot here is very creative. When the real time travel or time loop hits the center stage the whole phase and the feel of the movie quickly changes. This is where it gets the true edge against other similar alien invasion movies and the tight grip remains till the very end. While some viewers can be utterly confused by the fact of this time loop and the repeating scenes I'm sure no one would lose interest of the movie because of it. The element of surprise is very good and movie throws in some real candy for the viewers without delays. The flow and the phase is indeed appealing and the peaks and off peaks are well balanced. However as mentioned earlier the plot has many weak points and as a sci fi that makes sense Edge of Tomorrow is far behind.<br/><br/>Tom has a history of alien invasion movies such as War of the Worlds (2005) and one of my personal favorite Oblivion (2013). Edge of Tomorrow is another jewel for his collection proving that he is still hot as he used to be decades back. Emily Blunt is sharp and very well fit for her role. The duo does a perfect job on the set and they spark while the aliens bleed.<br/><br/>What makes Edge of Tomorrow is so good is its action and animation. They hit you very unexpectedly and some scenes are so majestic and detailed that you might feel that one viewing is not good enough. Starting from the production to the finishing touch of sound this movie is a true action flick and no one can say otherwise."
"peterp-450-298716","8","2","4","18 September 2014"," Action packed scenes. A dazzling spectacle. Even Cruise didn't irritate me ...
","""What do we do now? I don't know. We've never gotten this far.""<br/><br/>Frankly, thus far I am very disappointed about the movies I was looking forward to for so long. In ""Godzilla"" the infamous monster was totally absent, ""Transcendence"" was too ordinary and meaningless, ""Divergent"" was just another SF Fantasy tale for teenage girls, ""300 Rise of an Empire"" was just like ""300"", ""The Expendables 3"" looked exhausted and are in need of a replacement and ""Pompeii"" was a storm in a teacup. Only ""Robocop"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"",""Maleficent"" and ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" could surprise and enchant me. I wasn't expecting much from ""Edge of Tomorrow"". Partly due to the fact that Mr. Cruise probably would be shining on the screen again the way he always does. That's what I thought! What a big mistake that was. For me ""Edge of Tomorrow"", a film based on the Japanese comic book ""All you need is kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, is already THE summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Imagine an invasion on a vast coastline in France as in ""Saving Privat Ryan,"" but this time in a more futuristic perspective. High-tech helicopters flying through the sky and dropping ""Robocop""-like soldiers on the beach, who immediately start a massive battle against fierce aliens, called Mimics, who look as if they appeared in ""The Matrix"". You get an adrenaline boost while watching this battlefield with advancing forces being massacred. And in between is a pity looking Colonel Cage (Tom Cruise) who in an inexplicable way got promoted from Colonel to an ordinary soldier with an indelible stain. He turns out to be a deserter, so to speak. He gets an ultra modern combat equipment and he's ordered to be part of the first platoon which will lead the invasion and will throw itself in the middle of this bloody war. Ironically, he has no idea how to turn off the safety of his Japanese speaking equipment, and so he's killed almost instantly. Due to circumstances however, he ends up in a sort of time-cycle like Bill Murray experienced in ""Groundhog Day"". He goes back in time again and again to the moment when he wakes up at the base from where the invasion is coordinated.<br/><br/>Only some questions remained. Why exactly was it that particular point in time ? Was it Bill Cage who determined this ? Maybe I've overlooked the answer or I misunderstood something. But don't let this spoil the fun because it's a fascinating, action-packed, exciting and sometimes humorous stunner of a movie. Even the presence of Cruise didn't bother me. Normally Cruise is such an actor who has such an ego and pretentiousness that the screen is filled with his personality anyway. This was better than expected. Even his room wide dazzling smile shrank perceptibly. And to be honest, this film is fun for all moviegoers. Those who can't stand Cruise may rejoice about the fact that Cruise gets exterminated numerous times. Those who idolize Cruise can be thrilled because he comes back to live over and over again so he can restart the mission as a true hero.<br/><br/>Doug Liman created a heart-pounding raging SF. It's something like ""The Bourne Identity"". A successful concept and probably because of the extremely devious put together script. Despite the fact that the same event is repeated a few times, this isn't really disturbing, because Bill Cage attempts to tackle the situation each time in a different way. And this leads sometimes to hilarious moments.<br/><br/>As said before, the rather timid Tom Cruise played an enjoyable role as Colonel Cage. But the moment Emily Blunt appears on the scene as Rita Vrataski, ""The Angel of Verdun"", everything speeds up and the interactions and fragments become humorous and entertaining. She's the perfect choice as the fierce female soldier who's also extremely attractive at the same time. I remembered the days when I sat at home before my monitor for hours struggling with an extremely difficult mission in ""Call of Duty"". Frustrated I always started over again trying in a different way till I succeeded to fight my way through it. The same principle is used in ""Edge of Tomorrow"". Also, there were two noteworthy supporting roles. Brendan Gleeson played the ruthless General Brigham and you can see Bill Paxton in a very amusing role as the drill sergeant Farell.<br/><br/>It's obvious I'm really enthusiastic about this movie and had a great time watching this highly entertaining movie. It's certainly a candidate for the title of ""Best action movie"" of the year 2014. The other candidate competing for this title is for me ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"". And right now it's a tie. Despite the end being a bit illogical, this SF is highly recommended. A lot of action packed scenes in a furious pace. A dazzling spectacle with some contagious humor and surprising plot twists. Fortunately a corny romance was omitted. And finally, Tom Cruise effacing himself in relation to the whole picture. All this makes this film a must-see. And I'm going to do something I rarely do: I'm going to re-watch it ! <br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be"

At one point, I thought it's was going to be really difficult for the writer(s) to resolve the dilemma of the protagonist without it seeming cheesy, but it was resolved without losing any of the film's integrity. That's good writing.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does a great job of adding to the experience.

","This is one of those movies that as I was watching it I was finding it a little hard to get into it however after walking away from it I began to appreciate it a lot more and am on the verge of suggesting that it, so far, is one of the best films that I have seen this year (particularly since many of the other ones have simply been a part of a long running series). As I was watching it I was thinking of giving it a 4/10 however I have now definitely settled on an 8 because, well, I guess I am really glad that I saw it and really would like to see it again.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie is that you can pretty much work out what it is about by watching the trailer, and as such there are actually not all that many surprises when you end up watching it. Maybe that is why I was so hoo-hum about it, because I knew what to expect and I got what I expected, and little more. Okay, I was really keen on seeing it as I approach it, and am really glad that I saw it now, however maybe it was because I went into the film anticipating huge things when in the end I simply got what I expected, or maybe it was just that the aliens were not as good as they could have been (though even now I think that they were actually pretty good).<br/><br/>There isn't really all that much that I can say beyond that because, well, everything that I can say about this film, about living the same day over and over again, caught in an endless cycle, I have probably already said in Groundhog Day. The difference is that Groundhog Day does not have marauding aliens, a massive battle scene over a beach that could be (but may not be) Normandy, and Tom Cruise running around an an exo-skeleton (or should I say Bill Murray). However, one could consider that the whole idea of 'Live, Die, Repeat' is that we, as humans, are doomed to continue to live in an endless cycle, being brought back to that point because we do not see how we can escape. Maybe the whole idea of the battle at Normandy is a warning that war is not necessarily going to go away, and if we remain stubborn and refuse to listen to reason (as the army does in this film) then we are only going to find ourselves back at that point again, storming the beaches of Normandy against another enemy that does not necessarily have a face, and returning to Paris to liberate it again (or to once again blow up that dam that the dambusters blew up)."

","Edge of Tomorrow is a fantastic spectacle! While it's been a banner year for great action movies such as Captain America and Days of Future Past, this has to be the surprise hit of the summer to date. From start to finish, not only does this live up to the trailers, it surpasses them. I really liked this well paced, engaging sci-fi film. <br/><br/>It's one of those movies where you feel you've seen it before, but just not quite in this way and that's what makes feel fresh and new. Part The Matrix Revolutions, District 9 and a few time travel movies I can't quite put my finger on, yet the sum of the parts feels like something completely unique and wholly entertaining. I think the last time I felt a movie was such a great mishmash of different movies was Inception.<br/><br/>This is also vintage Tom Cruise. He commands the screen with his wit, charm and emotion; for me this is his best movie since Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. If you thought Cruise couldn't carry a blockbuster anymore, Exhibit A. Admittedly, what makes this movie work well however is Emily Blunt; she is excellent! Together they had surprisingly great chemistry and are the backbone of the movie. They provided a few genuine, moving moments (always appreciated in an action movie) that elevate the film. <br/><br/>There's plenty of action, the special effects are solid and there's more than enough humour to balance it all out.

","What I found so enjoyable about Edge of Tomorrow is that very little time is wasted on explaining the concepts on which the movie is based. This allows it to be a smart, taut and riveting action movie, pared down to its bare essentials. The basic premise of the movie is this - what if you were given multiple chances to ""re-set"" your life. Would you learn from your experiences and improve the direction of your life, or would you just live it over and over? Make no mistake, the movie doesn't spend time pondering this question; it just jumps right into the middle of answering it, and does so with a minimum of fuss and backstory.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays William Cage, an ad executive who's working as the media relations officer in the war between invading aliens and us earthlings. Cruise is in superb physical form in the movie, endowed with unfairly high levels of energy and charisma. He is unwillingly thrust into the battlefield (for reasons I couldn't quite grasp) and is killed off by an Alpha alien within the first 20 minutes of the movie. <br/><br/>Due to some of the alien blood having entered his bloodstream, Cage is now able to repeat his life...starting from the point where he is kicked awake by his soon to be commanding officer. It is to the movie's credit that this does not become repetitive, especially as we see Cage resetting and repeating more than 10-12 times, each time getting closer to understanding how to get rid of the aliens. <br/><br/>In the course of the resetting, he meets Rita Vartakis, played by an unbelievably muscled Emily Blunt. Rita is the army's poster girl, killer of hundreds of aliens. Having gone through the same arduous resetting process as Cage, she becomes his ally in the fight against the invaders.<br/><br/>The training sequences and the resetting scenes are tightly edited and are probably the best parts of the movie. There isn't much chemistry between the lead actors, although this may have been intentional. Shoehorning a romance into this movie would have killed the flow.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, once the resetting scenes are done, and the actual task of finding and killing the aliens is taken up, the movie starts to flag. It's almost like the movie changes directors, since the tough parts are over! It moves from smart thriller with an innovative concept, to a generic action movie. But that's just the last few minutes.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is great to watch, with fine performances from Cruise and Blunt. Bill Paxton also makes an appearance as a scenery-chewing commanding officer. The battle scenes and the final showdown are executed so well, you just might stop believing in the existence of CGI! And oh, for a change, it's not an American landmark that gets decimated in the movie :)"

","I just saw this movie, and I was surprised in a good way. I was expecting this to be another okay alien movie, but as I was watching, I realized that this movie was more about the plot and the story, rather than just action and scary scenes. I liked the humor in the movie. One of my favorite scenes, was when Cage was doing the push ups and then he rolled under the car and got smashed. I found that scene very funny. The battle scenes in this movie were absolutely spectacular. I enjoyed watching all of the humans fight the really cool looking aliens in the really cool suits. Rita was pretty cool with her sword. She took down those aliens like it was the easiest thing in the world. Cage was pretty funny when he couldn't figure out how to take of the safety. There are only two things that I didn't like about Edge of Tomorrow was how many times that Cage starts the day over in this film. I think they went a little overboard on that one. The movie was the same thing until he gets to the farmhouse. I thought that they could have done a little more with the ending. I won't spoil it. I let you guys think about yourselves. There was something else that the director could have done. Thanks for reading, and think about what you thought should have been the ending."

","I saw ""Edge of Tomorrow"", starring Tom Cruise-The Mission:Impossible movies, with a fifth one coming out in 2015, Tropic Thunder; Emily Blunt-Looper, The Devil Wears Prada; Bill Paxton-Haywire, Apollo 13 and Brendan Gleeson-Safe House.<br/><br/>This is a sci-fi version of Groundhog Day. It is based on a Japanese manga novel called 'All You Need is Kill'. Besides the sci-fi video game elements, there is a good story, as well as some very funny scenes. The story takes place in the not too distant future, when the Earth has been attacked by Aliens. Tom plays a military public relations reporter that has never been in any actual combat. Emily plays the macho battlefield commander that has become famous for killing lots of the spidery-looking aliens in fierce hand-to-hand combat. They even have her face plastered all over posters promoting her victories. Tom, under protest, gets sent in to cover a big offensive attack-kind of like a D-Day type invasion- and gets killed within ten minutes of hitting the beach. Just after he is killed-and it is explained exactly how this happens-Tom wakes up the day before and relives the day. Every time he is killed, this happens again and he learns more from each time. Plus, there are lots of funny moments as he learns. Brendan plays the General in command of Earth's forces that are based in London and Bill plays Tom's squad commander. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"peter-wilson","9","2","4","6 June 2014"," I'm not a Cruise fan, but this is a very good movie
","Minor spoiler alert.<br/><br/>I have not been a Tom Cruise fan for many years as he frequently and awkwardly casts himself as our confident and defiant hero, although in this film he starts as a slimy anti-hero and grows to become a genuine reluctant hero. The storyline is well-framed and believable, while the story and character development is excellent with a well-written script and top-notch CGI. In my opinion, the commanding General Brigham character lacks sufficient military authority and assertiveness, although all other supporting characters are excellent, however the Hollywood feel good ending lacks some credibility, but otherwise this movie is a leader in all its genres, and very worthy of any action or sci-fi fan.<br/><br/>I might even see this movie again, and it's been quite a while since I have had that thought."
"burlesonjesse5","8","2","4","5 June 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Edge of Tomorrow
","Tom Cruise's character dies a lot in his newest science fiction endeavor, Edge of Tomorrow. In fact, about halfway through this 2014 release, I started to lose count (let's just say that it's anywhere between 50-60 times). Regardless, ""Tomorrow"" is intelligent, sophisticated film making and it stakes its claim as the best thing to hit theaters this year. It makes you think (but not too incredibly hard), it heightens your senses (just like a summer blockbuster should), and it reminds you the audience, why Cruise became a movie star in the first place.<br/><br/>Now as I've just mentioned, there is a Groundhog Day element in which someone relives the same 24 hour period over and over again. This radical tactic brought to life in a non-comedic fashion by director Doug Liman, works diligently until it somehow becomes a little repetitive and overwrought in the 3rd act. Regardless, in the director's chair he does a bravado job and that is evident by ""Tomorrow's"" ingenious plotting and capable editing (there might be a scene or two left out as a puzzle piece but I'll let it slide). In terms of staging action, Liman takes a page out of Alfonso Cauron's playbook (the guy who shot Gravity and Children of Men). He films some of the most stupendous combat scenes you'll ever see. He works with a large canvas consisting of thousands of extras (futuristic soldiers) and the chaotic bullet-ridden sequences featured, seem incredibly complex with a host of neat panoramic views.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of James Cameron's Aliens, featuring slinky, terrifying creatures that seem to be lifted from the Matrix movies, and containing the omission of opening title credits (I'm a huge fan of this), Edge of Tomorrow follows the back story free tribulations of one William Cage. He's a Major but his expertise is strictly in advertising. He's never fired a gun, never killed any type of extraterrestrial, but here he is ordered by an unreasonable General (General Brigham played by Brendan Gleeson in a standard Brendan Gleeson role) to go to Europe and fight a war against evil caricatures called Mimics (think mechanical zombies who hightail it fast and furious). Here's the kicker: every time Cruise's Cage gets killed in the war, he wakes up and finds himself in the same spot he was in when he first came to the army camp (for basic training). He's getting a do-over or a chance to fight again and again until the alien invasion has been conquered by humans. Over the course of the first initial deaths, Cage encounters a fellow soldier who had a similar experience. Emily Blunt is said soldier and she plays Special Forces killer Rita Vrataski. Tom Cruise and Blunt work well together as actors. Their relationship is strictly business as their characters both die again intentionally to try to reset the game plan and strategize their war tactics efficiently.<br/><br/>The performances in ""Tomorrow"" are mostly disciplined. There is a dose of mild humor but it doesn't register as much as other critics have noted. The Cruise character is initially seen as cowardly but unintentionally becomes a soldier transformed. The film seems like a personal journey for him and you feel the most sympathy for his plight. As for the other members of the cast, they aren't as likable. They actually seem aloof and off-putting (especially the combat fighters in Cage's battalion). Same goes for Emily Blunt. She has good intentions, excels as a sword wielding warrior, but comes off as very reserved. Her Rita Vrataski is distant and borderline unfriendly. Cruise's Cage starts to feel something for her, a sort of mulled over connection if you will. You as the viewer however, will be pain staked at trying to figure out why.<br/><br/>Anyway, the tag line for this film's poster reads, ""LIVE DIE REPEAT."" Based on my review and recommendation, I believe that this might be the current career path under which Tom Cruise is headed for in modern day Hollywood. Clearly on a science fiction kick, he bounces back this time after appearing in 2013's unoriginal Oblivion.<br/><br/>Overall, a bogged down final half hour doesn't keep Edge of Tomorrow from possessing the power to entertain. It has a fresh premise and it's its own movie even though residue from other science fiction fare sometimes seeps in. Will you be enticed to see it multiple times? Probably not. The effect if you're not patient, would be the equivalent of what Major Cage goes through time and time again (count me out, I've got other movies to see). But know this: compared to a lot of other summer flicks that have filtered in and out of multiplexes, Edge of Tomorrow teeters much further along the ""edge"" of greatness."
"achyutaghosh","9","2","4","5 June 2014"," Loved it!
","Summer blockbusters have a degree of sameness to them. They are big, loud, comic book sourced, star studded, and graphic heavy, with billions of dollars of marketing muscle ensuring audience interest. But now and then, something like the Edge of Tomorrow comes, reaffirming Hollywood's creativity, intelligence, wit and above all- ability to give the audience a good time. <br/><br/>Live. Die. Repeat.<br/><br/>These three words beautifully sum up the time twisting plot of Edge of Tomorrow. You die, you wake up, relive the same day, only to die again and repeat the cycle. In this Groundhog Day meeting Starship Troopers adaptation, the world has been invaded by a race of seemingly unstoppable spidery aliens called mimics (their look lifted straight from the Matrix). They are an intelligent breed, being called mimics because of their ability to learn and copy human actions, but for destructive convenience, they are shown to have a hive mentality with a central brain that processes their actions. After being at the receiving end for a long time, earth forces score a victory at Verdun. The enemy seems to be on the defensive as human forces aim for a final offensive D-Day style at Normandy. Is it our endgame or theirs?<br/><br/>""I died within five minutes of landing at that beach, along with every other soldier.""<br/><br/>Cruise is center stage to yet another war of the worlds, initially as a PR spin doctor, William Cage, who incurs the wrath of a commanding officer to end up in the battle front-line. The offensive, it seems is doomed as the aliens seem to have been expecting them. Moments after landing Cruise dies, but not before being sprayed by some alien blue blood. This action forces him to go into a time loop, and much like a video game character, he keeps reliving the same day again and again. Each time though, he is able to use his memories of the battle to survive longer. No one believes his story though, except ace solder Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who has also been affected in the same way earlier. Together Cage and Rita must locate and destroy the alien brain to end the war.<br/><br/>Repetition is the worst thing a movie can have. Watching the same scene, with minor variations over and over is a tedious affair. Director Doug Liman addresses this by showing just enough of a scene to establish the loop, and then moves ahead to scenes where the story begins to change, thus ensuring a rapid pace to the story, and plenty of action, which despite the fact being repeated, does not feel repetitive . It also allows for oodles of macabre humor. People who complain than Tom Cruise always lives will have a field day here. Cruise dies hundreds of times, each one more unexpected, and even funnier than the previous one. At the same time, his budding romantic relationship with Rita is treated with subtlety and thought. For him, it is a growing connection, but for her every day is a new day, like Drew Barrymore in Fifty First Dates, and so she herself kills him many times over. The visual effects are fantastic, and the ending, though generic, is still satisfactory. <br/><br/>Humanity owes its existence to Tom Cruise, or so it seems. Once an actor who used to try out diverse roles, today is reduced to just an action hero. It is really hard to keep a count of the number of times he has saved the world. In Edge of Tomorrow though, Cruise is in top form, and for once not taking himself too seriously, but for a change lacing his still charming personality with loads of hilarity. Emily Blunt, Brendon Gleeson and Bill Paxton play great supporting acts. <br/><br/>I like any movie that can make me laugh. Edge of Tomorrow did, despite its oh so serious doomsday scenario. it treads the fine line between entertainment and intelligence oh so very well, for that it gets my recommendation. Go on, watch it- 9/10"
"edgereviews","9","2","4","4 June 2014"," Edge Of Tomorrow Review
","For some reason, during the marketing of 'Edge Of Tomorrow' this film seemed to have a lot of scepticism surrounding it, but I was excited for this movie from the moment I first heard about it. You know why? Because I really like Tom Cruise. I couldn't care less about his personal beliefs; he's a good actor so I can separate who he is from the roles he plays. Unfortunately, there are some people who can't do that and will refuse to see this movie just because of Tom Cruise. Those people don't know what they're missing out on, because 'Edge Of Tomorrow' is one of the best original sci-fi movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It's abundantly clear that Tom Cruise is passionate about sci-fi movies, and he definitely gives some great performances in them. Last year we saw him in 'Oblivion', and now we have him playing Major William Cage, a solider fighting in a war against aliens. Cage soon realises that he's stuck in a time loop of his last day in battle, and whenever he dies he wakes up at the beginning of the day again. This immediately draws comparisons to 'Groundhog Day', but there are also several other movies that 'Edge Of Tomorrow' seems to take inspiration from, with 'Aliens' being one that felt like a huge influence. This film even has Pvt. Hudson himself, Bill Paxton, who gives a very entertaining performance as Master Sergeant Farell. Another reason I was excited for this movie is because of Emily Blunt, and she did not disappoint. I'm always happy to see strong female characters in film, so it's great to see that Emily Blunt has her fair share of badass moments in this movie.<br/><br/>Even though 'Edge Of Tomorrow' obviously draws inspiration from many other movies, it never feels like a rip-off. Although its highly generic title may suggest otherwise, 'Edge Of Tomorrow' is actually a very original movie. It's incredibly unpredictable, and unlike other movies within the genre I wasn't picking out plot holes as I was watching. Even though a lot of the movie involves the story going back on itself and repeating events, it never feels boring and is constantly engaging.<br/><br/>Doug Liman gives excellent direction, creating a world that feels alive and interesting. The action scenes are especially well directed, they don't rely on shaky cam and the mech-like suits that characters wear create interesting new dynamics in the battlefield and they're a lot of fun to watch. The VFX are stunning as well, there were no moments where there was any noticeable bad CGI.<br/><br/>This year had already been a great year for big summer blockbusters, but 'Edge Of Tomorrow' just supports that statement even further. It's an incredibly memorable sci-fi experience that I would strongly recommend."
"ersinkdotcom","8","2","4","2 June 2014"," Although the concept has been re-visited a few times, the movie succeeds in creating something entertaining
","There are a few things you can gather from a list of Tom Cruise's films. Obviously, he likes being the lead man and hero who saves the day. Second, he loves doing his own stunts and getting in on the serious action. Thirdly, the guy seems to hold an affinity for science fiction.<br/><br/>Sprinkled throughout his career, you'll find films like ""Minority Report,"" ""War of the Worlds,"" ""Oblivion,"" and even ""Vanilla Sky"" which touch on sci-fi and fantasy elements. The only butt he seems to like kicking more than those of international spies and government traitors are aliens. He returns to the screen right after saving the world from otherworldly invaders in ""Oblivion"" to meeting them on the battlefield in ""Edge of Tomorrow.""<br/><br/>Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is a military spokesman talking up the public during a world war against alien invaders. After being literally dropped into the middle of combat, he is killed almost instantaneously. Cage awakens to the harsh realization that he is trapped in a time loop and forced to die over and over again. Each time he returns from the dead, his skills are increasingly sharpened and he is one step closer to saving the world with the help of a Special Forces soldier named Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt).<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") does a great job taking Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth's action-packed script and bringing it to the big-screen with all the intensity and excitement you would expect from a sci-fi / action flick. It's well-paced and takes itself seriously while injecting elements of dark humor into the equation.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is his usual lovable self and delivers a performance that reflects his love for these types of roles and movies. You can sense his enthusiasm for his work every day when he hits the set. He's a guy that acts for a living and doesn't hate a single second of it. I know many people can't stand Cruise, but you can't deny the guy's a good actor and seems to genuinely love what he does.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is perfect in the role of tough-as-nails Special Forces soldier Rita Vrataski. She's the Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in the ""Alien"" movies) or Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff in ""Battlestar Galactica"") character for ""Edge of Tomorrow."" She definitely holds her own next to Cruise as they partner up and make their way through packs of deadly aliens.<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive material. Cruise drops an ""F"" bomb, although I'm pretty sure the ""ck"" is cut off by an explosion. The rest of the language is pretty much what you would expect from a film that takes place in the military and on the battlefield. The battle scenes are pretty intense and I'd suggest leaving younger kids at home.<br/><br/>If you're thinking ""Edge of Tomorrow"" sounds like a science fiction mash-up of ""Groundhog Day"" with ""Starship Troopers,"" you're not far off- base. Although the concept has been re-visited a few times, the movie succeeds in creating something entertaining. This is accomplished through a great cast, some humorous moments, and action that keeps the story moving forward at a smooth stride."
"mnoraznan","9","2","4","31 May 2014"," This movie hits the spot! Watch without worry...
","I liked oblivion and so this should come as a no surprise.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ABOUNDS. Read at your own risk. <br/><br/>At first, the design of the armor irks me, it looked bare and not what one would imagine a powered exoskeleton would look like. Too many exposed sections, lacking the sense of cool and menace, and so on and so forth. However, this is not a commercial and any more intricate, the design would have hindered the focus of this movie, its actors. So i made my peace and resolve to enjoy the movie for what it is. The trailers prepared me for the type of action but I'm surprised they were able to inject elements of humor it.<br/><br/>To be honest, i know the movie deviated from its source material and totally transform it into an-all American ensemble. To me, that's artistic license, and the movie and the novel are both different beasts. The producers made a judgment call based on the market and I'm perfectly fine with it. It turned out well, so there.<br/><br/>I like the intensity that Cruise brings to his role. It definitely a new turn to have him be a coward, who then redeems himself. We have been too familiar with his action hero persona that this, seems a bit more personal and heartfelt. Cue his zero to hero montage, but wait, its not what we expected. He's making progress but the enormity of it made him give up. Its heart-rending to watch him powers through even when he feels that there's no hope. Then, his developing feelings for Rita, our co-lead makes it all the more harder. Thankfully, her habit in rushing his death cycle, which seems to be her solution for every snag, brings humor to the movie. Emily Blunt, is a revelation, she is believable in the role of renowned war-hero. She once shared Cage's predilections and watching them both try to choreograph and weave order and pattern in an inherently chaotic occasion is entertaining. <br/><br/>All in all, i understood the ending and dare i say it, liked the outcome. I'm a sucker for happy endings. The dying omega's blood saves him and rewind it all to the beginning, albeit in the transformed future. He gets to save the world and enjoyed its new and improved future as well. Perhaps with a certain Angel of Verdun..."
"omargamal-52905","10","0","0","18 May 2020"," Genius
","One of the amazing movies i have ever seen.
To the people who may not understand the ending.. Here u go ✌
In the first I'm really so tired of hearing everyone complaining about the ending. It isn't confusing at all, and you don't need a diagram with different colors representing different planes of existence, or other crap. I've heard people mention Omega blood being more potent so Cage jumps back further. I've heard people saying ridiculousness about them existing in different times or something. I've even heard people saying it was all a dream that Cage had while he was in the helicopter. There are many other ideas out there, and I disagree with all of them. Yes, I even disagree that the studio changed the ending from the books ending so they can make sequels, or just quickly finished it without thought. This angers me the most. I LOVED this movie, and after I watched it last night I spent the whole drive home explaining the ending to my wife and she finally gets it....SO here it goes, for your reading pleasure:<br/><br/>There are 2 things that you need to understand before I write this:
#1. THIS IS WHY EVERYONE IS CONFUSED WITH THE ENDING...When a person is tased they are not unconscious for 24 hours...They are only unconscious for 2-3 hours at best. REMEMBER THIS, it's common sense!!!
#2. When an Alpha/Omega is killed and their blood is transferred to a human that Alpha/Omega ceases to exist because the human takes that beings place. This is why the Alpha that Cage killed never returns to the battlefield, AND why the Omega never returns...But I'll get to that later. Cage is now that Alpha and when he dies the Omega resets time 24 hours (1 day) FROM WHEN THE ALPHA WAS ORIGINALLY KILLED.<br/><br/>I will now give you a timeline of events. This will make it much easier for everyone to understand. Please note that exact times are not mentioned in the movie, so I will be giving the times listed:
7:00AM (Day 1) - Cage wakes up in the helicopter on the way to meet the General
8:00AM (Day 1) - Cage is tased and labeled a deserter following his meeting with the General
10:00AM (Day 1) - Cage is awoken on the base by being kicked and called a maggot (PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THIS IS STILL THE SAME DAY)
9:00AM (Day 2) - THIS IS THE NEXT DAY. Cage is dropped from the plane and lands on the beach
9:05AM (Day 2) - Cage stated ""I die within 5 minutes of landing on that beach"" so this is when he kills the Alpha, and dies in the process<br/><br/>Now every time Cage dies time is reset 24 hours FROM WHEN THE ALPHA ORIGINALLY DIED. This is why when he dies during PT by being ran over he is reset to 9:05AM (DAY 1) AND when he dies much later at the German Dam due to drowning himself he is still reset to 9:05AM (DAY 1). Also notice that 9:05AM is while he is unconscious due to being tased, and rather than the movie showing us Cage sleeping for 55 minutes they just skip to where he is awoken by being kicked and called a maggot.<br/><br/>Now I will explain the ending for all of you:
10:00AM (DAY 1) - Cage is awoken on the base by being kicked and called a maggot
2:00PM (Day 1) - Cage and Rita meet with the General and get the device that Cage shoves into his leg
5:00PM (Day 1) - Cage wakes up after receiving a blood transfusion and losing his ability to reset time
10:00PM (DAY 1) - Cage and Rita convince J-Squad to help them
6:00AM (DAY 2) - Cage kills the Omega, and all of the Mimics die along with it. The Omega's blood is transferred to him and he becomes the Omega, resetting time 24 hours because the Alphas died
6:00AM (DAY 1) - Cage is now sleeping on the helicopter but just like before, rather than the movie show us 1 hour of him sleeping they just skip to where he wakes up on the helicopter. NOTE that at this time the Omega ceases to exist because its blood was transferred to Cage
7:00AM (Day 1) - Cage wakes up. When the helicopter lands he realizes everything has been reset and his friends are all alive once again. Instead of meeting with the General at 8:00AM he sees on the television that the General no longer requires his assistance because all of the Mimics are being easily handled. The ""Disturbance"" that the General is referring to that happened under the Louvre in Paris is the Omega ceasing to exist because Cage now has his blood.<br/><br/>Once you understand that the end is NOT resetting time 2 days, and it's actually only resetting it a few hours prior to when it was previously resetting, AND when Cage resets the Alpha/Omega that he got his ability from ceases to exist it's pretty easy to wrap your head around everything.<br/><br/>They can now easily do a sequel (Cage is the Omega/There is more than one Omega/Another asteroid brings more aliens/Whatever), or easily not do a sequel (They live happily ever after)"

"jaredkjacoby","10","0","0","15 May 2020"," A Summer Blockbuster Masterpiece From 2014
","Edge of Tomorrow is a prime example of an action film that does not need the audience to turn their brains off to enjoy the action. It tells the story of Major William Cage, who gains the ability to reset the day after getting some of the omega's blood. This movie is like a sci-fi twist on Groundhog Day, but instead of the main character just sleeping and waking up to the same day, Cage goes back to the same day every time he is killed. The premise for the movie is awesome and the writers execute this idea perfectly. Every time Cage wakes up, he gains new knowledge about the invasion and he reacts differently to the process of being recruited every single time. The same scene and lines of dialogue play again and again but it feels fresh every single time because of the way Cage reacts. This also helps him improve in combat. Every time he dies (most of the time actually), Cage gets a little further and slowly figured out the enemy's strategies. The plot progression feels organic and intense every time Cage seems to get closer to figuring out what to do. It feels like solving a puzzle. One thing that makes the script stand out is the gut-busting humor. This movie has made me laugh more than pretty much any comedy movie I have ever watched. It takes the ridiculous premise of the film to the max and does a great job with dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, it is some of the sharpest I have ever heard in a film. It kind of gives the feeling that everyone that Cage interacts with is an NPC of a video game. In fact, that is kind of what I get the feeling that the movie was going for: Poking fun of the fact that this could be a game. The other characters repeat their lines and Cage interacts with them differently each time. There is even an excellent montage where Cage and Vrataski plan how to get to the Omega and destroy it and every time they die, they create a new step for the next attempt. This could have been a monotonous experience that could make it feel more like a game more than a movie, but director Doug Liman and the writers make it to where it is fresh and exciting to watch. The world-building is terrific as well. The futuristic world looks cool but apocalyptic, the suits are interesting, and the ability to reset the day as well as losing the ability is well realized. There is a sense of dread throughout. This feels like a genuine apocalypse and it is hard to predict how it will end, nor would I want it to end. The tone is perfect. For the most part, it takes itself humorously, but it is also not overly cartoonish. It knows when it is time to take itself seriously when the plot gets progressively more intense. The climax gets some criticism, but it is intense because after Cage loses his power, he cannot die again or else the mission fails and he and everyone else are dead for good. The tonal change is earned. The story hooks you in with its great premise and it delivers in just about every way.<br/><br/>The characters and performances are also phenomenal. Tom Cruise plays William Cage who is without a doubt, one of the most developed characters in a blockbuster film. He starts off as a coward who tries to escape the war in any way possible and has no idea how to even use the suit, which is called the ExoSuit, properly. Each time he wakes up, he reacts differently and gains more knowledge about fighting the mimics. However, he not invincible in the slightest due to the fact of dying throughout the film, so this movie does away with invincible hero cliché. It takes him a while to thrive in combat and he is more of strategic fighter than one who uses brute strength. Even when he gets better, he is still not invincible because the mimics are strong, fast and smart. They can kill the protagonists within seconds. His character has a fantastic arc and it is boosted by an outstanding performance by Tom Cruise. He shows so much range with this character and his reactions to his new ability and each reset are perfect. His freak outs are hilarious and relatable. What makes this performance work so well though is the fact that Cruise sells his role as a coward who is not good at combat at all. He starts out incompetent at combat and Cruise does a great job showing how his character needs training to stop the invasion. Rita Vrataski is just as great of a character. She is one of the most badass women in an action film of last decade. She trains Cage to improve in combat and she kicks plenty of ass in the role. One thing that I noticed this time that I never noticed beforehand is why her character was so prominent in this world. It dawned on me that her character, having the same ability as Cage at one point, and she improved her skills each time she died and she figured out some of the enemy's weaknesses before she lost it. It is a great detail that shows why she is so cold towards the people she interacts. Oh, and Emily Blunt's performance as Vrataski is perfect. She has such a commanding presence every time she is on screen. Blunt's performance shows that Vrataski is not someone you want to mess with. Cruise and Blunt also share great chemistry as their characters have perfect interactions with each other. The best part, they both help each other out and contribute equally to the plot. Vrataski trains Cage while he informs her of all the moves that the mimics will make and what they both need to do take out the Omega. They make a fantastic team. These two protagonists are awesome and well-developed. The side characters are great too. The J-squad is made up of funny soldiers who seem to not take the invasion as seriously as they should, but they are fun to be around. Sergeant Farrell played by Bill Paxton is one of the funniest side characters out there. Paxton delivers his lines perfectly he got so many laughs out of me. Even the man who walks up to Cage to say, ""ON YOUR FEET MAGGOT!"" is memorable. That is how good the characters are in this film.<br/><br/>But as a blockbuster film, does it deliver on the spectacle? Hell yes! The set designs are terrific as they are creative with the battleground and the training rooms being the standouts. The scope of the war is grand as it feels like an apocalypse with little hope. What I adore about this movie visually is the design of the aliens or mimics. They look so creepy, but they do not look like stereotypical aliens at all. They are these octopus-like creatures that move very quickly and their abilities are menacing. They are terrifying because they kill the protagonist multiple times and they pose a real threat. The effects on the creatures just look so good as do the designs of ExoSuits and the weapons inside the suits. I wonder how it would feel wearing the suit to be honest and if they are practical or not. Now we come to the action. This movie is fast-paced and filled to the brim with action and every bit of it looks glorious. There is not a single frame of action in this film that looks bad. It is done with more frenetic camera work, but it works perfectly and the action is just so fun to watch. One thing that makes the action so fun to watch is seeing Cage learn from his mistakes each time and improving. Even though the we see the characters on the battlefield multiple times, no sequence ever feels the same. Also, it is established that these creatures can kill easily so it makes it a lot harder for Cage and Vrataski to defeat them and it becomes just a bit more satisfying when they reach their goal. In the climax, the intensity ramps up because Cage can no longer reset the day and knowing how the aliens can kill them, it is stressful to watch them get to the hideout and seeing the mimics come closer and closer to them, destroying their ship, taking out their crew and trying to kill them before they reach the Omega. It is intense as hell. It may not look as flashy as other blockbusters, but it shows that they do not need to be flashy to provide beautiful visuals and exhilarating set pieces. There is not a dull moment in these action scenes, or really, in this film for that matter. I still remember how much fun I have watching the action unfold in the theater, especially when they first hit the beach. The cinematography is gorgeous in the film. There are some stunning shots in this film and it helps make the action in the movie look great. Even when the lighting in the film gets a bit thin, there were some spectacular shots near the end of the movie. The soundtrack is the only thing that I think is a nitpick I have with production.<br/><br/>We have amazing fleshed-out characters, terrific performances, a beautifully written story, stunning visual effects and awesome action scenes that are both entertaining and nail-biting. What more could you ask here? Edge of Tomorrow is an action blockbuster masterpiece. Yes, it might not be the deepest film, but it knows exactly what it is, and it does it perfectly. Every time I watch this film, I find more and more things to love about and more details I did not catch beforehand. Even the climax which gets criticized, I found a lot more intense on rewatch because the stakes rise in the third act. There is not a single movie that I had more fun with or that I grow to love more each watch than Edge of Tomorrow, and it has been that way since I saw it in theaters nearly six years ago. Edge of Tomorrow is not only easily my favorite film of the last decade and it is also my favorite action film of all time.<br/><br/>This movie makes up the quickest hour and 53 minutes of my life, especially the first time that I saw it."

The film follows an incredible character arc from Tom Cruise with a creative concept for an alien enemy.

"Darkside-Reviewer","8","0","0","20 November 2019"," A Science Fiction Groundhog Day
","At first glance this seems like just another Tom Cruise movie your typical action movie with a few stunts and Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise but surprisingly it goes beyond that and exceeds expectations with an interesting storyline great action scenes and likable characters you feel invested in this is a surprisingly good movie.<br/><br/>The storyline follows Lt. Col. William Cage (Tom Cruise) a public relations officer for the United Defence Force an army made up of different nations come together as one force to fight alien invaders known as mimics who came to via an asteroid crash landing on earth the mimics have taken most of continental Europe and are now heading for England Cage goes on TV and inspires people to join the army and help push back the mimics in a final push but after doing so is told he will be put on the front line aswell with no combat experience or courage Cage refuses and is made a deserter having his rank stripped and put on the front line of the attack when on the Battlefield he is quickly killed by a mimic that he kills by blowing them both up but the blood of this special mimic fuses with his melting his body and Cage wakes up at the start of the previous day as a deserter in the army barracks before the attack he tries to warn everyone but is dismissed as being crazy but when on the Battlefield he knows what will happen and begins to learn how to fight the mimics after saving one of the elite force fighters Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) he discovers he is not the first to obtain this power and with it he must learn how to fight and become a soldier and use his new found power to find the hive mind that controls the mimics and kill it to destroy them all armed with the ability to reset time he learns to fight and find the head mimic with only one condition if things go wrong he must reset the day over again by dieing anyway possible.<br/><br/>Cruise and Blunt work well together and have great on screen chemistry the camera work and CGI looks great with real stunts and thrown in and despite the movie being a serious science fiction action movie it does have some comedic elements that are genuinely funny creative and smart.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen this movie I recommend giving it a watch its basically a science fiction groundhog day worth watching if you enjoy action movies and science fiction."

Quite thrilling, however ridiculous it may sound at first...<br/><br/>It starts out a bit silly, with Tom Cruise being portrayed as an INexperienced fighter.

But other than in ""real Life"", this time Tom Cruise can repeat the same fight with these aliens over and over again and learn from earlier mistakes he made, just as in a computergame. He becomes a better fighter at every step of the way, but will he be able to conquer the aliens in the end?<br/><br/>Any bad? Well, of course it is a cheap story, targetted at teenage gamers I guess. But the reason why I (as an adult) still award it with 8 stars is because of the great adrenalin rush it gave me. Many computer games might be silly, but they still can get me very excited. Edge of Tommorow has that same kind of quality. Definitely recommended for action fans."

","""Edge of Tomorrow"" is an unique installment on the list of the Top Sci-Fi movies of all time. As every movie it consists of 4 stages. The First Act (Introduction, Preparation for the story), the Second Act (Action Scenes), the Third Act (Final Climax) and the Final Act (Resolution, Ending). The director, Doug Liman did a brilliant work with the First and Second act of this film. However, the Third Act is a bit different and not as climatic as I would wanted it to be. Moreover, I expected it to be a boring movie, beacause of the fact and we would be watching the same day over and over again. Thankfully, I was wrong. Every loop and repetition of this day was different than the others in an unique way. This made the movie very interesting to see how Doug Liman managed to acomplish this director-challenge. All in all it is an awesome movie with a brilliant plot and good actors. I hope there is a sequel, which keeps all of the advantages and turns the disadvantages into more advantages and I am sure, that Doug Liman will do so. To sum up it is a worth watching movie with clever characteristics in it. Every frame feels like a loop worth sitting in. Must see movie. However, be as always cautious, not to have very high expectations, in order not to ruin a good-movie."

","10 March 2017. To describe this movie as a military action thriller as a version of the Ground Hog Day comedy is to underestimate the number of days this movie involves. In a way, it's also a coming of age movie, especially for Tom Cruise's character who must really suffer through the movie in a good movie way, almost to the point of humorous tedium. Mostly this is an action thriller as most military movie are along with the typical sci fi monster alien twist. After a slow build up, the pacing quickens and never let's go. The audience gets to observe the physical pain, the mental anguish of loss and sacrifice, even blind faith. Using the time twist, this movie takes its action in an exciting, different way even though it doesn't really break through as a totally different, brilliant creative innovation, it nevertheless brings forth the great use of existing movie formulas in an exciting, entertaining way."

After the awful Oblivion, I dismissed this as another Cruise saves the world movie, which I'd become bored with. For a long time, I actually thought it was called Live. Die. Repeat. As that is how I constantly seen it advertised. <br/><br/>Watching it today, I actually enjoyed it. It was pretty fun and not as repetitive as I feared it would be. Crusie is very good in all versions of his role.

","""Edge of Tomorrow"", starring Tom Cruise (Cage) and Emily Blunt (Rita), is a mind-bending science-fiction, action film, which was, surprisingly, quite good. After reading the manga adaptation of ""All You Need Is Kill"" (which was renamed ""Edge of Tomorrow""), I was interested to see what the film adaptation was like, with low hopes, due to how most manga adaptations turn out. Saying that, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" was high above my expectations, with a great performance from Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film begins with some, frankly, cliché, stereotypical, dialogue, which is, thankfully, only used at the beginning but later returns. The film, from there, is great, with a 4/5 first half melding action and science-fiction beautifully. But, the film once more resorted to the use of high-paced action scenes, in the second half, with cuts left right and centre, completely disregarding its science-fiction origins for a small portion of this half; a mistake being the switch of location constantly occurring. The characters are unlikeable (excluding Cage), which is a downside, because they are either stereotypical soldiers speaking cliché dialogue, or an ex-alpha-alien killing woman constantly performing sensual push-ups due to the power Cage possesses. The film tries too hard to create a non-existent rapport with Luke and Rita, which seems stagnant, and should be mellifluous and free-flowing and this halts the progression of the actual story."

","A lot of film fans deplore or criticize Tom Cruise's latest choice of roles. They all seem to be focusing on action movies, with the 55 (!) years old actor cast in roles where the ration between fights, high-speed chases and use of advance weaponry on one side and meaningful story and dialogues on the other is dangerously unbalanced in the favor of the first. His role in the 2014 'Edge of Tomorrow' apparently falls in the same category. However, the film directed by Doug Liman is much more than this. It is actually one of the smartest science-fiction films in the last few years.<br/><br/>Time looping is one of the most intriguing themes in science fiction, and has a huge number of variation and derived paradoxes. The authors of the script of this film have taken the idea and introduced it into a 'War of the Worlds' kind of film and actually cinematography and even the evil alien's appearances look quite similar to the one in the films inspired by H. G. Wells classic novel. What is different is that the superiority of the alien race is not based only on physical abilities but on the capability of controlling and resetting time. Luckily, at least some of the humans will be contaminated and use the trick to fight the invasion. I will stop here in order to avoid spoiling too much, with the promise that there are many more surprises, and that the solution and ending combines action and fine sci-fi.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise does what he best does (and likes it) in the last decade, with Emily Blunt a good and fit companion to his deeds. Well-paced action combines with smart writing for a film that needs no excuses to be liked."

","Starship Troopers meets Source Code meets Groundhog Day meets Mass Effect, with the Hollywood action treatment and gloss of a Tom Cruise piloted blockbuster. The film plays out like an incredibly challenging video game where the viewer is confronted by continuous 'game over' scenarios where the whole scene is repeated again from the perspective of Cruise's character Cage, this allows the film to be unpredictable and thus more entertaining.<br/><br/>It was surprising how engrossed I was by a film that appeared to be lacking originality and unpredictability after viewing the formulaic trailer. However, the pace of the film combined with the trial-and-error existence of Cage in the unforgiving alien war zone is intriguing and allows the film to shake off the formulaic predictability of the other high testosterone films in the Hollywood action genre.<br/><br/>The entire plot hinges on the magical, time-controlling powers of blue alien blood from the Alpha Mimic alien behemoths which infects protagonist Cage. This is essential to allow the plot to travel to its conclusion with the connection to the alien hive via the blood allowing Cage to see visions through the alien consciousness and locate the alien armies' Achilles heel. This enables the human army to win the war,when it appears that the human race is doomed to extinction by a far superior foe. The climax of the action is satisfying and hits the levels promised at the beginning of the film. The chemistry between Cage and Rita, played by the intense Emily Brunt is pitched correctly and their relationship has sufficient enough authenticity to propel the slower more reflective moments during the middle of the film until the climactic, Parisian crescendo. <br/><br/>Overall the film is an entertaining yarn, with enjoyable thrills, alien blood spills and unpredictable twists to keep the audience entertained until the curtain falls. It's a good Saturday night blockbuster with alien brains and even a bearded appearance from Locke from Game of Thrones!<br/><br/>Read my full review at: Wafflecast.wordpress.com"

The whole story could also be considered as suspense, but not a very interesting one. 6. Watch it when you are bored, otherwise if you are fan of serious movies, I think this is not for you.

","It's unfortunate that this didn't come out a year earlier than it did. Had it been released in 2013, what I felt to be a pretty weak movie year, rather than coming out in 2014, arguably the best movie year of the decade so far, its financial success might have been much higher. Not only that, it was released in June, a major movie month. <br/><br/>At its core, it is a pretty cookie cutter sci-fi movie, but it does a lot of things pretty well. I feel like it only falls short because everything in it has been done before; the work that went into it is pretty impressive. The most obvious movie that it is similar to is Groundhog Day, and the way that the time loop is handled here certainly takes a few pages out of Groundhog Day's book. This made the first few days of the time loop a little annoying to watch because I was like ""Alright, I've seen this before. Let's just skip this part."" However, once the second act starts, the movie starts exploring some new territory of the time loop dynamic.<br/><br/>Two things that I think it did particularly well with were 1. bringing an interesting emotional element to the plot and 2. constructing the rules of the time loop. It added a lot to the stakes of the plot by making Cage fall in love with Rita after having known her for perhaps several months or years, whereas she only knew him for the one or two days. Then to have him not be able to preserve her forever made for decent emotional access to Cage. The rules of the time loop made for a somewhat more interesting climax as well. With Cage having lost his ""spawning"" ability, there was now a major dramatic clock ticking. Since he had died hundreds of times before, something different had to be done in order to finally destroy the Omega. However, it didn't raise the stakes so much in my mind because the world that the movie created indicated to me that there was very little chance of the humans losing the war. Also, I'm not sure that I really believe they could have destroyed the Omega in the end.<br/><br/>Smaller details: the action was pretty cool with the way the aliens fought and the visual effects were pretty impressive. The minor characters, namely the other soldiers that Cage interacted with, were rather annoying and standard. Yes, they had personality, but all their personality amounted to was making them come off like poorly written teenagers. A couple of the time loop rules could have been explained better. For the most part, I was able to understand how it worked, but there were two or three details that I had to puzzle out. Some of that is just me missing the explanation, but it's also partly because such rules were not revealed at the proper time or in the best way.<br/><br/>I don't know that this deserves as high of a rating as it has. Not to say that it's bad, but to have it hovering just below the top 250 list seems too high to me. Tom Cruise is in his typical element here, though it may not seem so at first. Emily Blunt plays her part decently, but could have been played by someone else. Fortunately, she isn't sexualized as one might expect, though she is a love interest for Cage. I don't recommend it too highly, but it's a better pick than say Transformers, Independence Day, or Ender's game for alien sci-fi action. One thing I can say for sure in praise of it: there need to be more movies that are executed and written with as much care as was put into this one. Overall Rating: 8/10."
"dierregi","8","0","0","9 March 2017"," Fighting the aliens with a grin
","One would hardly think of Tom Cruise having a lighter side, but in Edge of Tomorrow his character is actually flawed and funny.<br/><br/>The plot is sort of Groundhog Day plus alien invasion. Cruise plays Cage, a liaison officer forced to fight against the aliens. Trouble is, he is a coward and has no real military training.<br/><br/>Without mentioning any spoiler, Cage gets in trouble from day one, but he also gets a chance to re-live the same day, improve his fighting skills and getting to know female war hero Rita (AKA ""full metal bit*h""). Rita and Cage together are the only chance to win the alien invasion. They are not a good match, but their imperfections work well together.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt plays Rita convincingly as a tough fighter and she has a lot of chemistry with Cruise. Despite the violence of some scenes, the movie has some funny parts and it is very entertaining. Bill Paxton is also in it, regrettably one of his last movies."

","One thing first: how did Rita know that if you get blood into your veins you will loose the power, I mean shouldn't she have died and not woken up again to realise that? How did she know? Other than this the movie was great. <br/><br/>Real-life lessons:poor in this regard. The only think that I could pick up is that practice makes you great whatever that is. Everything can be mastered when practised and once you get used to the idea. Cage, a hysterical coward scared of war, becomes the best soldier because he trains everyday and goes through the experience a lot of times. <br/><br/>Plausibility: I liked that they implied that Rita had become the angel of that previous battle because she had the power to reset the day. She was great because she got to the same thing over and over again so a lot of practice. A kind of cheating method, she wasn't this born great warrior. She became this warrior because she could rest time and do the same things hundreds of times. This gives it great points to plausibility. <br/><br/>Character development: Cage develops slightly but i think it could have gone further and the same with Rita. We don't know Rita's motives for volunteering and we know very little about her.<br/><br/>Acting/ Casting: both leads are great. I was pleasantly surprised by Emily Blunt. <br/><br/>Storytelling: Brilliantly done. It makes the movie very interesting. I loved how some scenes were happening for the fist time and some had happened a hundred times before maybe but you just never knew which was which. Twists and surprises in the storyline were also done great. Humour mainly in Cage's character at the beginning was amusing and done to the right extent. <br/><br/>Overall, great movie."

The prisoner is delivered nice and easy and left to sleep on a pile of luggage.
2. The prisoner is delivered in full officer uniform, minus the trinkets and ornaments.
3. He is a new recruit, so he is going in action.

5. Although a mission is prepared and everybody is busy, there is not one, but three NCOs to introduce him to his new life.

","Wow. This summer blockbuster unexpectedly turned out to be a brilliant, thrilling, witty film and a model of cinematic craftsmanship! Definitely one of the most ingenious film concepts ever created.<br/><br/>The film's time loop premise is similar in a way to Bill Murray's classic 'Groundhog Day', as the main character gains an alien ability to reset the same day simply by dying. To break up the monotony of repetition director Doug Liman addressed this in such a clever way. The fast pacing is absolutely relentless and beautifully shows the progression Cage goes through with every reset, injected with a lot of wit, humor and excitement.<br/><br/>The cinematography is phenomenal, battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated, visual effects are fantastic and the design of the aliens is incredibly well done.<br/><br/>Cruise's performance is excellent, the best I've seen in years. Not the typical poster boy, but the unlikely hero that starts off as unskilled coward and transforms to be a bad ass fighter. Co starring is the gorgeous and extraordinary actress Emily Blunt. She plays such an interesting character, a war hero that had the power and lost it, now finding a way to win again by training Cage. Both have perfect chemistry and their character's relationship is treated with subtlety as Cage's connection to her keeps growing but she's starting each day as a new day, learning everything from scratch.<br/><br/>Doug Liman's finest piece of work if you ask me. Beautifully done. Script (adapted) is inventive and unique. Definitely one of the most enjoyable films I've ever got to experience. Watch it now! Repeat!"
"zardoz-13","8","3","8","16 June 2014"," Cruise Still Has An Edge!!!
","The soldier that Tom Cruise plays in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" gets his butt kicked all over creation. ""Bourne Identity"" director Doug Limon's supercharged, imaginative, science fiction time-loop thriller synthesizes elements of ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Source Code."" Surpassing Cruise's earlier desolation Earth outing ""Oblivion,"" ""Edge of Tomorrow"" differs chiefly in terms of story and setting. Although ""Oblivion"" occurred on post-apocalyptic planet Earth, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" takes place before the apocalypse, with mankind desperately pitted against aggressive extraterrestrials with no compassion. Lightning-fast, squid-like creatures called 'Mimics' have invaded Earth. These invincible whirling dervishes with tentacles have been on the warpath now for the last five years, blitzing their way across the European continent, and advancing toward England without any sign of slowing down. Predictably, Cruise lands on his feet in the middle of this catastrophic, life and death mayhem. He doesn't play the usual heroic character that he played in ""Top Gun."" This represents the first time Cruise has portrayed a yellow-livered skunk. He goes from being a coward to a hero in an arc that is as entertaining as the film is exciting. You can differentiate Tom Cruise movies by how often he gets his butt kicked. Remember ""The Last Samurai?"" Cruise had to grovel in that splendid fish-out-of-water spectacle set in Japan. Usually Cruise doesn't grovel. His groveling, however, makes his subsequent acts of heroism all the more convincing. Mind you, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" would still qualify as a good, solid movie even if Cruise weren't getting kicked all over creation. Mankind is poised on the brink of extinction as these insatiable aliens decimate populations. The futuristic, 80-pound, exoskeleton combat suits that the soldiers wear looks as cool as the aliens are imitating. Everything about ""Edge of Tomorrow"" looks great. This isn't a shiny, chrome-plated, sci-fi epic, but a tarnished, grungy-looking one. Some of the performances stand out. As Master Sergeant Farrell, Bill Paxton steals every scene that he has with his Southern-fried drawl, while Brendan Gleeson makes a curt supreme army commander and reminded me of Norman Schwarzkopf. Last but not least, lean-muscled Emily Blunt is pretty hard-nosed and business-like as the pugnacious 'Angel of Verdun.' Alongside these fine performers, Cruise holds his own as a disgraced officer who redeems himself in the crucible of combat.<br/><br/>Oscar winning ""Usual Suspects"" scenarist Christopher McQuarrie and ""Fair Game"" co-scribes Jez and John-Henry Butterworth have adapted Japanese author Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel ""All You Need is Kill,"" which came out in December 2004. As a military public relations officer for the United Defense Force, Major William Cage (Tom Cruise of ""War of the Worlds"") has never fired a shot in combat, but he does a commendable job as long as he is stationed far behind the lines. Imagine Cage's horror when UDF General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson of ""Braveheart"") decides to embed him with ground troops as they storm the French beaches in a last ditch effort to thwart the Mimics. Cage flatly refuses Brigham's orders to follow the troops into battle. Not only does Brigham order Cage arrested and demoted to buck private, but he also assigns him to join a first wave combat unit. Although ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a sci-fi saga, the beachhead scenes where Cage and his unit are flown into action against the Mimics is reminiscent of Spielberg's classic ""Saving Private Ryan."" Like ""Starship Troopers,"" the soldiers are flown into combat and dropped from helicopter-style planes. Once on the ground, the troops rely on their heavily armed battle suits to shred the Mimics with fusillades of gunfire. The Mimics are slaughtering soldiers left and right until one of them smashes headlong into Cage. Our terrified protagonist uses a mine to kill one. When Cage kills a large 'Alpha' Mimic, the slimy critter douses him with its blood. Incredibly enough, despite dying from the Mimic's blood, Cage discovers that he gets another chance to live and fight again! Essentially, like the Jake Gyllenhaal character in ""Source Code,"" Cage relives the first day over and over until he encounters another soldier, Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt of ""Loopers""), who experienced the same sensation when a large 'Alpha' Mimic killed her. Before he meets Rita, Cage is killed several times in combat. Meantime, each time that he dies, Cage awakens just as suddenly to find himself back at Camp Heathrow alive and well. Director Doug Limon displays quite a bit of flair in handling the same scene over and over again. Each time that Cage reawakens from his death, he devises new ways to contend with the Mimics. Sergeant Rita explains to Cage that the same thing occurred to her at Verdun until she received a blood transfusion. Eventually, as he relives the same day over and over again ad nauseam, Cage becomes so familiar with the turbulent events of that day that he can anticipate when and where the Mimics will strike. Before long, Rita trains Cage so that they become a dynamic duo, and they discover that the Mimics have a secret that makes them invincible. When they try to convince their superiors, especially General Brigham, that they can destroy the Mimics, they are treated as deserters.<br/><br/>Although it boasts some fascinating as well as formidable alien adversaries, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" doesn't emphasize horror so much as tension and suspense. Meaning, you can watch it and not worry about leaving your lights on when you sleep for fear of nightmares. Basically, it boils down to a crackerjack mission movie with Cruise and Blunt assembling up their own crew of misfits to destroy the aliens and save the day. Director Doug Limon and his writers steer clear of romance in any way, shape, or form. The single drawback to this otherwise atmospheric, first-rate actioneer is that the filmmakers don't provide enough details about the invaders from space. Nevertheless, watching Tom Cruise get killed dozens of times until he knows what to do is as stimulating as it is amusing."

","I went into this film not really knowing what to expect, after watching the trailer several times however, I came to the conclusion that it was going to be another film focusing solely on the action scenes.<br/><br/>After watching the film though, I take back my early conclusion. This film has a decent story line, where Tom Cruise as the main character actually conveys the characters emotions across extremely well and the relationship with the supporting actress, Emily Blunt, isn't forced and flows well. <br/><br/>However I was able to predict what was going to happen next at different stages in the film which is why I only say the story line is decent (satisfactory) and not good. The story line is enough to capture you for the majority of the film, apart from the couple irrelevant scenes but not so good that it leaves you amazed. <br/><br/>The action scenes were good, which boosts this rating as everyone likes the explosions and the well detailed close combat scenes but not enough to raise my rating above 7. I would say this film is a good one to watch currently, but not one that i suggest is a must see.<br/><br/>This is my first review, so if you found this unhelpful or not well presented, I apologies and hope to write better entries in the near future."
"Laakbaar","8","3","8","31 May 2014"," Cruise and Blunt shine in this SF thriller with a time-loop twist -- but with some tips for screen writers about writing about the military
","I really enjoyed this alien-invasion movie. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are both truly fantastic. The enemy is suitably terrifying. The story (each day relived over and over again) is quite interesting and well done, although of course not at all original. It's the kind of movie where you don't want to leave your seat because you might miss something.<br/><br/>I'd give the move about an 8.5, but I'm going to round it down for the reasons explained below. Also, the movie didn't actually move me (except a bit at the very end). Another problem was that the shooting of the fast-moving spider thingies was getting a little tedious. An obvious sop for the video-game generation.<br/><br/>I would definitely see this one if I were you! I saw it in 2-D, and it was fine. No need to pay extra.<br/><br/>OK, script writers, listen up! <br/><br/>There is a difference between recruit units and regular military units. Please stop writing dialogue and scenarios for regular military units that make them look like they are still in recruit training. For example, an NCO wouldn't and probably couldn't order regular soldiers (especially elite soldiers) to eat playing cards. They would think he had gone bonkers. Maybe in the Russian infantry...<br/><br/>Another example: an overweight guy might appear in recruit training, but not afterwards and certainly not in an elite unit. There are very few overweight people in the kind of unit depicted in this movie. How would an overweight guy have been able to manhandle the exoskeletal suit and the rigorous combat training shown in this movie?<br/><br/>I know ragtag soldiers are entertaining, but the real military (certainly in the US) doesn't tolerate it. Please stop making it look in movie after movie like military units are routinely filled with wisecracking, independent mavericks. Some odd behavior is tolerated in elite units, but this is based on a bedrock of professionalism. It's not ragtag.<br/><br/>NCOs do not routinely refer to privates as ""maggots"". These are people the NCOs lead and work with every day. Why would they demean them in this way? This cliché misrepresents the nature of an NCO's leadership over private soldiers. A word like this might be used at a certain stage in basic training, but even then the word would be used carefully and only in the right context. It works partly because the training NCO doesn't see the private again after the recruit training is finished.<br/><br/>In the military, it would be unusual, unprofessional, pointless and borderline abusive for an NCO to seriously address a complete stranger (even a lowly private convicted of desertion) as ""maggot"". Apart from that, surely as a professional writer you can see that ""maggot"" is hopelessly cliché.<br/><br/>On the eve of a major d-day, an NCO would not reprimand soldiers for mere gambling, especially elite soldiers. It wouldn't happen because tension and stress relief would be a major issue at that point. Nor would they do PT. The risk of injury would be too great. There would be equipment checks, forced rest, final briefings, special meetings, religious services, and so on.<br/><br/>In the military, a deserter is not simply dumped into another military unit, especially an elite unit about to go into a d-day situation. No, a deserter goes to prison or gets some other suitable punishment. There is a difference between prison and the military. (Hard to see the difference from your mansion in Hollywood, I know.) <br/><br/>If you were going to have an airborne assault like the one depicted in this movie, the DZ wouldn't be at the beach. No, that would make no sense."

Why would an advanced civilisation that can manipulate time have such an Achilles heel that allows a puny enemy to overcome it through the endeavours of one single human being? <br/><br/>Wheras Groundhog Days repetitive scenes work because of its simplicity, the same is not true of EOT.

","Edge of Tomorrow is supposed to be based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's light novel, All You Need is Kill.<br/><br/>The book was mainly about two young adults barely out of childhood fighting a nearly invincible foe with the assistance of older individuals who were devoted to helping them succeed.

The soldier that survived was prosecuted for the effort made on the battlefield and ended up nearly alone as the result of the mass casualties in the single battle.<br/><br/>None of this made it into the script which managed to feature Tom Cruise in every scene. Anyone who is a feminist will note that Rita (the Full Metal Bitch) carries a 200 kilogram battle axe in crimson armor while answering to hardy anyone in or out of battle. In the movie she was remade into a damsel in distress with very little of the original back story.<br/><br/>What we get is a Tom Cruise action flick that changes (whitewashes and ages) or eliminates characters to ensure that Cruise gets maximum screen time. Kiriya is aged to his late 40's and changed from Japanese to Caucasian. Rita is changed from a 19 year old short flat-chested redhead to the tall blonde 30 year old portrayed by Emily blunt.<br/><br/>Instead of the tragic ending of the book we get a dorky feel good Hollywood ending which looks like it was copied from Kevin Smith's Dogma."

I didn't found any part of the movie boring. Every single dollar invested to this flick was seen in every part. I didn't get the end so much, but I think that's the thing, that the film makers intended. <br/><br/>In conlusion, it was the best sci-fi I seen since The Matrix.<br/><br/>I 1000% recomend to anyone to see this extra-class movie!"
"tracytucciarone","4","2","5","24 July 2017"," Badass and Boring
","The plot's basic idea is a good one -- basically ""Groundhog Day"" for the martial set. The special effects are good as well -- top-notch, as was most of the acting. But it played as extremely boring for me, and some of the tropes just ticked me off, especially The Badass Chick meme. The Badass Chick is tough, man. She's the least female creature around, able to kick any and all butt, never emotionally expressing anything other than, ""Check me out; I'm A Badass Chick! I'm cynical and tough! Been hurt, but won't talk about it; instead, I'll just kick yer ass and defy gravity!"" I loathe characters who are supposed to be human, but have no human characteristics. And I guess I'm not into movies filled what that sort of thing. If watching someone playing a shoot-'em-up video game is your thing, you might dig this flick. Not my cuppa."
"nejclozarslo","10","2","5","6 December 2016"," Nearly no movies came out since it's release that surpassed this sci-fi action adrenaline thrill ride
","When I originally saw this film when it got released I got obsessed with it for months. By the end I had a near high. To this day there has only been a couple if any films that surpassed Edge of Tomorrow. This is one of the best of these action and sci-fi combined movies of all time and quite possibly the best alien invasion movie...ever, honestly. So what makes it that way.<br/><br/>First let me say this... This film never, ever, thinks of it's audience as a bunch of idiots, there is never that unnecessary scene that tells you everything you already know. The exposition is kept to a bear minimum and when it does happen, you wanted it to happen, because it's simply the best way to explain some way to complex concepts. Plus, let us not forget that we are watching a summer action blockbuster here, not Mulhollad Drive.<br/><br/>Next, in terms of action, this is one of the best action movies of this decade. Doug Liman does not use his shaky Bourne's style for this flick. There are many beautiful long wide shots of practical and gritty action with some jaw-dropping stunt work.<br/><br/>But really what elevates this film to it's glory is not the spectacular action, nor it's bizarrely original idea of reliving the same day over and over again, but masterfully written characters.<br/><br/>Best characters are those that you can look at the beginning and at the end of the film and they are completely different. That's the definition of Tom Cruise's character of Cage. Emily Blunt's character, Rita Vrataski is to this day my favorite 2014's female character. She is not in this film just so Tom Crusie can save her every two minutes (if anything it's the opposite). She never appears as an object, she has a clear role, she has to be there. The chemistry between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt is excellent. You need to keep in mind that Tom knows her for days weeks, but for her it's the first time every time. There is also no unnecessary romance between them. It's very subtle and when it does occur it only furthermore improves the film.<br/><br/>Another thing that could hinder this film but ended up being utilized brilliantly is the fact that the entire movie is just a repetition of the same day, but because they went to the comedic aspect of the situation it works wonderfully for the movie.<br/><br/>And without spoiling anything, the third act, while different from the rest of the movie, made me sweat harder than any other film I can remember.<br/><br/>I do not have a single flaw with Edge of Tomorrow. Because of it's unparalleled originality and pristinly written character by Christopher McQuarrie and other writers, this is a perfect sci-fi action flick in every way possible. Edge of Tomorrow absolutely deserves the highest rating in 10 out of 10. It's one of the all time greatest sci-fi films."

","This was a totally pointless exercise and a terrible waste of the talents of Emily Blunt.<br/><br/>We've seen too many of these existential nightmare type scenarios and this wasn't even an interesting or amusing variation on the theme. If all you care about are glitzy special effects and a bad light show with no story to offer then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>The idea that someone thought that it was a good idea to charge people money to see this piece of garbage highlights how desperate Hollyweird is for new ideas. This isn't one of them.<br/><br/>I am not a Tom Cruise fan and came to this film because of my interest in Emily Blunt and Brendan Gleeson. I am heartily sorry that I wasted my time watching this piece of junk. I should have known better. Cruise has been a disappointment since Top Gun. Why should I have been silly enough to expect anything else."
"rizwanaug","10","2","5","10 April 2015"," excellent concept
","You could describe this movie as a dizzying combination of Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, Source Code and The Butterfly Effect. Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreaking original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself.<br/><br/>You have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically bad ass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film.<br/><br/>The tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun. 1. Story-line is perfect. Its a brand new story. No copycat 2. Almost No Detail miss 3. Best expression from main character Cage (Tom). He can make us understand by silence 4. Good science put in it and its logical 5. nice visual effect and sound effect, good action 6. U just can't simply predict whats up next. Believe me, U can't 7. Repeat-Repeat But no bored cause he innovate his(Tom) movement every time he dead 8. Nice chemistry between Cage(Tom) and Emily(Rita) 9. No stupid Sex and unnecessary romance. Only One nice short kiss at the right time 10. Nice ending OK 10 stars"

","This movie combine everything a good action\sci-fi movie need. From great computer generated to great sound effect to awesome shooting and acting. All this with good humour and a lot of sense. Yes this movie make a lot of sense and work great. I found only one minor mistake at the first view and it should be not a problem for most people I guess. I think that if a movie require a lot of work and experience, this kind require even more. And it is very surprising to see how well they made it work and entertain from the beginnings to the end.

","Let me first say that if you're looking for another review talking about how this is a militarized version of Groundhog Day, I refer you to half the other reviews written. If instead you're interested to hear an honest take on another Tom Cruise shoot-em-up I thought I could never love, continue reading.<br/><br/>This movie is the right mix of action and thought provoking plot twists. Getting the chance to follow Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt as they navigate their way through an unchanging scenario where mistakes lead to death and death simply means ""try again"" is incredibly rewarding. I was skeptical that the film might come off as repetitive but Cruise's changing reaction to the same situations coupled with the slight changes in scenery and outcome keep the film feeling new and engaging the whole way through.<br/><br/>Would recommend"
"BeneCumb","8","2","5","19 January 2015"," Military action flick with a difference
","This century, evidently thanks to advanced digital technology, has seen dozens of futuristic movies where the world is to be saved from alien invasion. Most of them have both the plain plot and ending, and all action in focused on visual effects. The latter plays also an important role in Edge of Tomorrow, but, fortunately, a new angle - in the form on recurrent time loop - and twisted humor make this movie an entertainment distinct from other of the kind, perhaps as the screenplay is adapted from a Japanese light novel. The very ending has a pleasant ""dodge"" as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, you have to concentrate and ponder, as things get intertwined, repeated scenes are combined with new elements, and the chemistry between Tom Cruise as Major William Cage and Emily Blunt as Sergeant Rita Vrataski is good as well; besides, Bill Paxton as Master Sergeant Farell and Brendan Gleeson as General Brigham provide small, yet memorable performances. As for the effects, the enemy's look is different, and the likeness of the equipment/technology used by the ""good guys"" with the ones used in related movies is not annoying as they are not means for torpid destruction. The creators have taken all with ease, sometimes it seems that they laugh even at themselves."

","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>What do you get when you mix the plot ideas of two classic films, the romantic comedy, Groundhog Day, and an old sci-fi thriller, Starship Troopers? You get its illegitimate offspring, Edge of Tomorrow (or the renamed: Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow, to be exact), a well-made sci-fi film that surprisingly failed at the box office in the States and Europe but earned far larger profits in the Asian markets abroad. It has now been resurrected in its DVD, Blu-Ray format under its new title. Will the film now have a longer shelf life and finally become a modest hit? Only time will tell.<br/><br/>Starring the forever young Tom Cruise, chalking up yet another action figure to add to his resume, and the forever talented Emily Blunt, Edge of Tomorrow deserved a better fate. What it lacks in originality, it more that makes up in its thrilling action sequences and plot turns.<br/><br/>The plot involves a military mission to stop an alien invasion by getting to the Omega, the source of power for the aliens and destroying it. The creatures (called Mimics?) are multi- tentacled spinning dervishes that dispatch their prey (meaning us) in mega seconds. Cruise plays William Cage, a soldier caught in a continuous time loop that creates the exact same moments  leading to his death by one of these monsters. Due to his untimely death and some sort of blood infusion, he discovers that he can control his fate with different outcomes every cycle.  With more practice training and guidance from a commanding officer Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), Cage becomes a better and more agile soldier, finally ready for combat. <br/><br/>The film's plot structure gets a bit weary but Doug Liman directs the action scenes with much skill, even if the characters remain one dimensional. The film is well edited by James Herbert and Laura Jennings, with quick cuts and extreme close-ups to maintain the tension and fast pacing. At times, the film resembles a video game in its sharp hyper-kinetic movements and shoot-to-kill violence. The CGI are strong throughout even if the film's conceit grows monotonous.<br/><br/>Cruise and Blunt have a nice chemistry, although the hints of their romantic relationship seems forced. Bill Paxton adds some comic touches as Cage's gruff boss, but Brendan Gleeson is wasted in his underwritten cliché of a character. Anyway, gamers and fan-boys are the film's target audience and they will enjoy the adrenaline rush of the endless war sequences in Edge of Tomorrow.

A demoted Cage finds himself caught in a time loop forcing him to relive his last day over and over again. His skills actually increase as he faces the same sequence of battle continuously. Cage meets a Special Forces warrior, Rita Vrataski(Emily Blunt), who also has experienced the same type of time warp; and she brings him closer to understanding the enemy and together they vanquish the alien forces.

","This dash of cinematic junk food boasts a crisp, chocolatey effects extravaganza for an outer shell and a wash of sticky, creamy sci-fi curiosity at its core. The concept is tricky but fascinating, a bit stretched but not so far that it completely shatters the illusion. It's basically Groundhog Day meets Independence Day, with Tom Cruise wearing a great big suit of mechanized armor as its showpiece. Go into battle, kill some aliens, meet a grisly demise, respawn at the checkpoint and try it all over again; that's basically the plot. It's best when Cruise is relegated to mere rapid-fire cannon fodder, trying like hell to make the most of his chances and failing miserably. The ride gets markedly less entertaining, and more humdrum, as it slides into sentimentality and finality. The ending is a real whiff, too, and undoubtedly colors my memory of the better bits that I'd enjoyed previously. It smacks of a last-minute rewrite, something that's utterly at-odds with the dashes of smart, dark material that had spiced things earlier in the ride. A film that wants to be flashy and ballsy, but instead finds itself tamed and neutered."

","Greetings all, Since Minority Report and Oblivion I have been of the belief that Tom Cruise is perfectly suited for science fiction action roles, this film further validates that point.<br/><br/>To start with, there is a myriad of nuances which makes this film a truly enjoyable experience. Firstly, a few news clips provide brief exposition and history to save us from an overdrawn introduction.<br/><br/>Secondly, the way in which Cruise lives, dies and repeats (see what I did there?)never becomes stagnant and full compliment must go to the cinematography here, with clever transitions and nice cuts from one scene to the next.<br/><br/>Thirdly, as stated by director Doug Liman, he approached this first and foremost as a WWII-esque film, this is noticeable through great shots that hearken back to familiar historical moments of that era. Another point mention would be that each exoskeleton armour set differs ever so slightly from the next, which to me is very reminiscent of the seminal Aliens in which the cast were given free reign to customise their gear, a very nice touch.<br/><br/>We're greeted with an excellent action/war film that manages to maintain the right balance between humour and seriousness, often is the case where this aspect is misjudged but not here, no way.<br/><br/>The score is of particular note to me as the themes and motifs definitely resonated throughout and, perhaps more importantly, did so after the film had finished. Very well done indeed.<br/><br/>One of the beauties of this film, it must be said, is the realism, I would attribute a portion of this praise to the prop department, with tangible suits that look both stunning and deadly at the same time.<br/><br/>Edge of tomorrow delivers a special effects showcase with second to none quality. When there's aliens involved it is always a tricky thing to achieve a well rounded concept. I found myself loving their movement and nature, although they could be described as a little bit standard I would say to thee nay! Needles to mention the cast is perfect, with Tom Cruise giving his all as he usually does and a wonderful on screen chemistry with Emily Blunt who does a superb job of becoming a believable, strong, leading female, much like a one Ellen Ripley. I was most surprised by Bill Paxton's lovable performance which was a departure from his usual characters, but this just shows a great range.<br/><br/>I do apologise for gushing terribly about pretty much every facet of this film but that is just how much I love it, and frankly I have heard very few complaints about anything. The time travel and certain aspects of it could possibly be criticised as being convoluted in some areas but that hardly takes away from the experience. There is very little I don't like about this film, and I believe, very little you won't like either.<br/><br/>For, me this is one of the best films I have seen in recent years and is a must in my top ten of all time, coincidentally, just like Oblivion, but I digress. Watch it. Love it. Watch it again. And again...."

Cage doesn't want to go and even threatens the General who then strips Cage of rank, demoting him to private. Afterwards Cage is taken in handcuffs to Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton) who gets him familiar with his new squad. The next day they mobilize for a massive operation, in which Cage is killed, but Cage doesn't stay dead, instead he wakes up being introduced to Master Sergeant Farell all over again. The next time Cage finds himself on the battlefield he meets Rita (Emily Blunt) who had the same problem. Together they compare notes and find a new way to strike at the enemy.<br/><br/>Character Development<br/><br/>Cage generally makes a complete turn to who he was at the beginning of the picture to where he ends up, yet the emotional reward is just not there with the Cage (Tom Cruise) like it was with Phil (Bill Murray) in ""Groundhog Day"" (1993). I think the character General Brigham was right when he called what was happening all around him ""one big trick"".<br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>Though there were a few tender moments, this wasn't the place for much in the way of acting and much more time was utilized in reacting and stunt work. The points in this story were it slowed to lay some emotion was in my opinion a mistake where the two leads were made to touch lips, which seemed out of character and out of place on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>At times this story was very entertaining. There is no getting around that fact though that this was another version of ""Groundhog Day"" (1993). The only difference was in this movie the story here tried to find a rational explanation to why the protagonist was reliving the same day over and over again. And like ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) Tom Cruise's character demonstrates his godlike powers of knowing everything about everyone around him. What I found disappointed about this film was how it seemed to get stuck switching gears. One minute it a series of living and dying and the next it tea time in the farmhouse. The pace was definitely off at times. Yet the action and special effects seemed to be working well, only I thought the alien moved with such incredible speed it just didn't appear to be realistic. Out of all the thought and planning that went into the production of this film the designs of the alien race had to be the weakest element. All the world's nations unite to fight them and there is nothing to see. Just a bunch of downed human aircraft and soldiers. What is the enemy using to knock our stuff out of the sky? They are like a bunch of snipers you cannot spot."

","9/10 I implore you to go see this movie, it literally blew me away. Everything, everything here is about excellence in filmaking: what a pleasant surprise! I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing except that it was a sci-fi and it truly delivered awesomeness! I will start by saying that Tom Cruise is just a powerhouse: if by now, after all of his movies, he still manages to disappear from the screen and make me see only his character there must be something special going on. Other than that I truly cared for him because of a surprising character arc, he pulled off every scene he was in adding all of the necessary ingredients: drama, comedy and most importantly his action scenes are as always top-notch. Amongst this, Emily Blunt manages to stand her own ground and gives a performance that is just as good as Cruise's in all of her own aspects too, plus the pair have amazing chemistry and keep a honest and involving emotional core to the movie. They are definitely helped by really well written characters in the background of such a clever, witty, multi-layered, brilliant screenplay adapted from a story which clearly has its roots in sci-fi classics, but still manages to do something really, really original and truly unforgettable. I cannot speak highly enough of this screenplay, it flows out so smoothly, leaving nothing behind, keeping fantastic character and story coherence and does so much more with the comedic and dramatic elements of the plot. Furthermore the cast built around the two main stars is cleverly put together: the inclusion of Bill Paxton is genius and gives a nod to Aliens, to him you add a cast of talented unknowns contributing to add a very deep character connection. The premise here is something that has both great potential for being easily messed up, but at the same time has potential for a director to play around and offers him many scenarios to pull off clever transitions. Well I can safely say that Liman didn't do one single thing wrong: his direction here is something really rare: brilliance is painted everywhere. The action scenes are filmed flawlessly, the balance of Cgi and practical effects is seamless and the storytelling is some of the best you can find out there. Not even one element is left hanging around and every single event and action is perfectly believable and grounded, plus he makes you truly love and feel for the people you're watching. The suspension of disbelief here is maintained for every frame. He clearly has a great relationship with his crew because every aspect of the movie is executed perfectly: cinematography, music, perfect Cgi and most importantly the editing which has a very difficult job to do in regards to the premise, yet manages to truly succeed highly. The movie keeps going on and on with a fantastic pace, which never lost my interest, bringing to the screen a truly thrilling experience and never giving you a moment to breathe. The suspense in the last act is close to unbearable and nothing ever happens that takes you out of it. There isn't really any negatives I can think of off the top of my head: this movie is amazing and sophisticated, I beg you all to go see it, it delivered true greateness and ended on a perfect note, even the credits' song was spot on!"

Emily Blunt co stars as ""Full Metal Bitch"" the best fighter in the war and does a great job. This movie is also helped by a hilariously southern Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson as a Prominent General. The Battle suits or ""Jackets"" used in the war are incredible to look at when they show what they can do with their weaponry.

Yes, it is a video game on the big screen - hero gets killed but gets another life every time fighting an alien race with killer instincts, so that he can learn how to defeat them. The film bangs along after a slowish start to establish the character and the situations which he, and we, will return to with growing irony and knowingness. There is the spectacular landing in Normandy to rout the aliens that turns into a massacre, and gives Cruise his apparent immortality - no drones visible so this is not controversial in the States!!! Thereafter, with the help of a former soldier, who experienced similar re-settings of the day, the hero grows into a true warrior from a PR wimp. The script is sharp, if somewhat incidental - certainly does not spend too much time on explanation - and the direction cleverly understated with masses of CGI. And, yes, Tom pulls it off to carry the film in that all-American solid way that no longer seems to get the crowds cheering. Ah well, go and see on the big screen and enjoy the spectacle without all the hype and very predictable dross surrounding 'X Men' and other comic bores this summer."
"HaveWisdomWillTravel","9","2","5","15 June 2014"," Most Original Big Budget SF Since Inception
","Original not just in terms of idea, but how they deliver the story in 2 hours. I hate the 2 hours format by the way - so constricting, so ancient, so arbitrary and stupid. But they did it. The editing is just CLASSY.<br/><br/>Am not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, but I would go out to watch a big budget movie because Tom Cruise is in it. In spite of my dislike for the totally-lame-premise-and-ending of War of The Worlds, I still trust him to deliver entertaining-enough mainstream products. Still, I never expected a Tom Cruise produced SF to make my SF list though. My idea of of great SF are Blade Runner, The Matrix, Battlestar Galactica TV remake. This one will go onto my top 10 list, which is saying something...<br/><br/>Surprisingly, again, Tom Cruise managed to look believable as a physical fighter. Emily Blunt is an interesting casting choice - not the most menacing female soldier, more a sexy-bicep pouty poser kind of fighter, but well we can't put Katee Sackhoff next to Tom Cruise can we? She will make him look like a wimpy auntie instantly...<br/><br/>The visual design and CGI are simply stunning, even in a world saturated with over-produced SF visual works. Alien design...well...seems like the trend is leaning towards slimy creepy crawlies non-bipeds...thanks to Spielberg. Also, ""borg"" or group mind ET is becoming a cliché, for me anyway. I hope the next SF will bring us even more interesting Alien ideas.<br/><br/>It's a relief that big superstars still produce good work they star in. Shows that big ego can co-exist with big brain in the same body. Pheewww.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bored moment. Highly recommended."

","I went to see this movie last weekend, it blew my mind. When I left the theater, I thought ""Wow, this has got to be the best movie I have seen this year"" (and I am a big Si-Fi fan, I have seen all blockbusters this summer). I am, however, hugely surprised by its under-performing box office, to me, there is no way on earth the teen movie (The Fault in Our Stars) is better than this. Considering all the positive reviews Edge got, I felt it definitely deserves a much bigger opening.<br/><br/>Both Tom and Emily put on first-class acting in Edge. The story-line is not original - alien invasion, and hero/heroine with time traveling ability save the human race. What make the Edge special is the acting, action scenes, and special effects - all are amazing. Directing was superb. I didn't get the same tense feeling when I watched Godzilla or X-Men DFP (both are very good though), but with Edge, it definitely put me on Edge. I felt for Cage and Rita, I was hoping they would fall in love sooner. <br/><br/>And man, Emily Blunt is hot !"

","No capes. No rubber suits. No endless and pointless montages of citywide destruction. No teaser at the end for the inevitable sequel. Just a fantastic story, adapted into an excellent screenplay, wonderfully acted and well directed. The Edge of Tomorrow was, in my opinion, the best film of the year so far. Tom Cruise is pretty much the only Big Movie Star who is doing what big movie stars are supposed to do - finding great stories and using their charisma and talent and fan base to get those stories told. And he is great in this, likable, funny, physical and convincing. In short, everything a big movie star should be. I won't go into the story, as I feel it's best discovered as you go along - but I absolutely recommend that people should see this film, and support original and clever film making."

","Aliens meets Groundhog Day! The protagonist gets to live the same day over and over, doing a better job of finding the enemy strong hold each time. It would have worked better as a straight up comedy. Solid acting and directing, great special effects, some good characters but lacking IMHO in a few areas.<br/><br/>The major flaw was the inability of the plot to get out of it's own way, i.e. how can a love affair progress with only one person out of two building up experiences day to day? I guess that is bittersweet romance or unrequited love as the best we can hope for. Not a great supporting cast either so no good sub-plots to add anything.<br/><br/>I would not even compare this movie to any sci-fi classics. It just does not stand up to T2 (8.5) or Aliens (8.5) which I can watch over and over again and still enjoy.<br/><br/>Here's how to make this movie 100% better - have several of the characters reset the day as a group with Cage(protagonist,) become better soldiers, get to know each other better, fall in love, etc and then confront the ""Omega"" together, share a mind-meld with it, learn why the aliens are attacking Earth, realize they were here before 10,000 years ago to build the pyramids and teach mankind how to fish, find a diplomatic solution and present it to the world for a vote to let them live in peace somewhere on a remote island, then write a sequel.

I have seen IMAX things before but not an action movie and it really did add a new dimension to the movie experience. The whole movie experience had my adrenaline pumping. It is well worth watching no matter which version you choose. Lots of action and I have to say that Tom Cruise made you feel his journey. And Emily Blunt made you feel her determination. There is lots of violence without having to listen to every other word being vulgar. I recommend it highly and if you have the option of IMAX, costs more, but well worth it."

","This is an very enjoyable well written and entertaining sci fi action movie that works.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays a reluctant soldier thrown into combat against alien forces in Europe.<br/><br/>The story is clever and comes together well. The Groundhog day formula works - it provides laughs and keeps you interested for details. It has in intelligent feel because things add up without unnecessary red herrings. Yet it isn't confusing at all like other time travel shows. You don't feel like you wasted your time watching the different scenarios. Liked the homage to D Day landing beaches theme. Liked the European setting.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise does a good job. He doesn't look too aged like some other action movie actors who are past their prime. He can still do the action convincingly and only flashes his trademark grin once. His charm helps make the character likable. Emily Blunt is believable as the soldier. She has a sincere look that is likable. I at first thought she didn't have the appeal to lead a major blockbuster but she is actually very suited to the role. It isn't a romantic movie after all. The fight scenes are well done. With enough variety of scenery and not dizzying like some others.<br/><br/>Found this more enjoyable than X Men. Worth watching on the big screen."

No doubt that this movie sets an example of how to give different kinds of movies in a particular genre when we are experiencing the same types of those for a decade.

","Watched Edge of Tomorrow with my friend recently it was an interesting film. I liked the sci-fi background of the story. It was very interesting and definitely not what I expected to be at all. Watching this movie in a way does remind me of another recent Sci-fi film that Tom Cruise acted, Oblivion<br/><br/>The cast was great. Tom demonstrates again why he's perfect for these kind of roles. He portrays his seriousness and funny side both together very well. Emily Blunt was great beside Cruise but her character didn't really interest me that much. I can't believe I saw Bill Paxton again. The last time I saw him was in 'Thunderbirds R Go'. He was great to watch and I really liked his sergeant bullying attitude. The rest of the cast did a good job and the movie really made me glued to my seat<br/><br/>However, there were some minor complains though. What I find a bit disturbing was the reset and start all over again button part(for those who do not understand what I'm talking about, you'll know when you watch the movie). Although it was an interesting concept, it got a bit annoying to me as the movie progressed. The story was not that interesting in my opinion but it did leave me intriguing to find out what would happen next in most parts but I did felt kind of bored during the movie as well<br/><br/>Overall, a decent film but maybe not one which I would watch again since I'm not a huge Sci-fy and Tom Cruise fan. However, die-hard fans of Sci- fy and Tom Cruise I think will like this movie a lot so go give a try. To sum it up, Edge of Tomorrow was good but Oblivion in my opinion was better"
"moviexclusive","8","2","5","31 May 2014"," Smart, intense, thrilling and gripping, this 'Groundhog Day' meets 'Starship Troopers' sci-fi is immensely entertaining stuff that you won't want to be left out of its loop of
","Never has a film more closely resembled a computer game than the latest Tom Cruise sci-fi action thriller 'Edge of Tomorrow', which in its cycle of 'live, die and repeat' mimics both its form and structure. And yet, this high-concept movie isn't just a video game substitute - on the contrary, it uses that template to become quite something on its own, a brilliantly-executed piece of summer entertainment that is surprisingly witty, clever, thrilling and oh, one of Tom Cruise's best movies in recent years. <br/><br/>Adapted by Cruise's regular screen writing muse Christopher McQuarrie and brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth from the 2004 Hiroshi Sakurazaka novel 'All You Need Is Kill', Cruise plays Major Bill Cage, the U.S. Army's PR man who leverages on his role in the propaganda corps to avoid being sent to the front line. The war in question is laid out in a rapid-fire montage of news reports, which tell of an invasion by a nearly indestructible alien race known as Mimics that has levelled pretty much most of Europe and now threatens to decimate London - unless the international coalition known as the United Defense Force can successfully establish a beachhead against the extra-terrestrials on a French beach that immediately evokes comparisons of Normandy.<br/><br/>Cage is baffled when the leader of the Force, General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) insists on sending him right into the heart of battle, going to the extent of arresting him as a deserter and inserting him into the ragtag J Squad under the command of a rah-rah bellowing Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton). The very next day, Cage is strapped into the military's new exo-skeleton armour and dropped onto the beach where the fiery battle is taking place. Turns out it is more of a massacre - not only are the humans outnumbered, they also find themselves ill-equipped to deal with a far superior enemy, and even their one hope, the Force's star soldier Rita (Emily Blunt), is killed in the onslaught.<br/><br/>Due to sheer dumb luck, Cage manages to kill one of them bigger alien lifeforms. Unfortunately, he isn't quite able to escape getting killed after, though his death only resets the clock to when he wakes up at Heathrow and meets Farell for the first time. As the trailer suggests, Rita becomes a crucial piece of the puzzle, and Cage's ability to reset the sequence of events ultimately turning him into a key weapon against the Mimics' critical advantage of manipulating time. It all sounds a little confusing we know, so kudos to director Doug Liman and his scribes for keeping the narrative tight and engaging.<br/><br/>Most crucially, Liman ensures that the repetitiveness of his character's predicament never becomes a quality of his film. Each replay of Cage's journey from Heathrow to the battlefield never feels tired or even familiar, differentiated either by a small touch of tongue-in-cheek levity or by small but significant variations that get Cage closer to his ultimate mission of finding the nerve centre of the alien intelligence. <br/><br/>Another reason why the time-loop concept doesn't ever get weary despite the repetition is the wit with which Liman and his scribes build into the material. It may not occur to you the first time, but repeated, such lines as ""Battle is a true redeemer; tomorrow morning you will be baptised. Born again."" and ""I think there's something wrong with your suit... Yeah, there's a dead man in it!"" acquire newfound meaning. Once Rita starts training Cage, one recurring - but somehow effective all the same each time - joke is her willingness to press the restart button every time he doesn't seem to be up to her mark. And then of course, there is Cruise, who injects dry wit into the 'rinse-repeat' premise with his refreshingly guileless delivery and is probably the closest you'll get to see the actor in a comedy.<br/><br/>Yes, Cruise is at his most charismatic in a role which doesn't require him to put on any Hollywood vanity. Playing the anti-hero after a string of characters in 'Mission: Impossible', 'Jack Reacher' and 'Oblivion' fashioned out of the same heroic mould, Cruise seems to be having as much fun playing the coward who never wanted to be a saviour in the first place but stumbles into the part out of plain coincidence. Next to Cruise's nicely underplayed performance, Blunt comes off less engaged than we would expect of the actress' cast-against-type as a Sigourney Weaver-like character, going about the film in a steely poise that portrays athleticism and determination but little else.<br/><br/>She does however look perfectly suited for the high-octane action, which Liman directs with boldness and imagination not seen since 'The Bourne Identity'. Cage's beach landing unfolds in eye-popping combat spectacle, the gunfire, mud and panic of war depicted with realism, urgency and immediacy, i.e. like 'Saving Private Ryan' but with aliens. Even with the same battle repeated over and over again, Liman finds new action within it every time, adding new outcomes and reinventing old ones that keeps things fresh and gripping. Through inventive backdrops that evoke the Battle of Britain or the occupation of Paris, Liman keeps the adrenaline pumping, culminating in a grim showdown right in the heart of the French capital.<br/><br/>Sure, you may recognise elements of 'Edge of Tomorrow' from other movies like 'Groundhog Day', 'Starship Troopers' and 'Source Code', but the point is still how Liman uses the narrative device from the former in a smart and satisfying piece of science fiction that works as an immensely entertaining summer star vehicle. It might not seem much against the pantheon of Marvel superheroes this summer, but this is truly one of this season's best, a blockbuster with brains which you won't mind being caught in a time loop seeing it again and again."

","Director - Doug Liman Starring - Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt Take one part Groundhog Day, one part Matrix, even a pinch of G.I. Joe, and you end up with Tom Cruise's latest movie. But don't let the sound of this unique mash up fool you, this is an entertaining sci-fi, action movie.<br/><br/>For some reason, there are people in this world that do not like Tom Cruise. Actually, they detest him, believe him to be the spawn of Satan, etc, etc, etc... However, I have no problem with the diminutive super star. I actually enjoy his films; Mission Impossible, The Last Samurai and that cameo in Tropic Thunder. I like him and, in this film, I still like him. He is well suited as William Cage, a smooth talking mouth piece for the military who is 'drafted' into a fight against the Mimics, aliens who have invaded earth. The audience isn't told why they're here but, as a scene mid way through the film explains, it doesn't matter why they're here, they're here and that's all that matters. So there isn't any convoluted explanations to get in the way of the action.<br/><br/>Cruise is joined by Emily Blunt who is quite believable in her role as fellow soldier Rita, aka The Full Metal Bitch. Blunt obviously worked hard for this role and just the sight of her biceps made me want to weep into my bag of maltesers.<br/><br/>Together they share a secret; the ability to re-live the same day over and over again which could be the key to ending the alien invasion.<br/><br/>The two stars definitely share a chemistry, although at times you're not sure if it is romance or just comradery. There are also some real comedic moments; Tom Cruise can be a funny guy.<br/><br/>The film does well to keep interest considering how many times you see the same thing or have to guess if the scene is for the first time or a do-over. There were a couple of times when I thought 'enough already' and maybe the final part could have been brought forward by about 15 minutes but that might say more for my attention span than Liman's direction.<br/><br/>I have to say that there is something magical about seeing London on the big screen; the capital is displayed in all her glory at several points. It's nice to know that the aliens invade countries other than America every now and then.<br/><br/>This is based on the short novel 'All You Need is Kill' and I'm sure some fans of that will complain about Cruise's role in the film (much the same as when he took on the part of Jack Reacher). But for the uninitiated, such as myself, this movie is a fine enough reason to go to the cinema."

","There's something that feels repetitive about this movie, but it's not the content.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars as ""Cage"", a soldier who has the power to return from the dead to repeat the past day. He gets this power from magical alien blood, and off we go! Starting to sound familiar? It should.<br/><br/>This ""original"" concept was actually ripped from a 2002 classic. Instead of Cruise, we had Wow. Instead of Blunt, we had Song. I'm talking, of course, about John Schultz's masterpiece Like Mike.<br/><br/>Don't believe me? You're an idiot. They're basically the same movie. In Edge of Tomorrow, Cage gets a miraculous ability early on and becomes a phenomenon for the army. Like Mike's Calvin uses a pair of lightning-struck Jordans and lights up the NBA. Starting to see the connection?<br/><br/>Let's look at the characters a bit more. Cage is a down-on-his-luck soldier, who just can't catch a break when it comes to armying. Calvin Cambridge is a 13-year-old orphan who couldn't sink a jumper if it meant his parents coming back. Then their powers swoop in and save the day.<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, there comes the climax. For Edge of Tomorrow, it's Cage's last attempt at saving humanity. In Like Mike, it's Calvin trying to get the Los Angeles Knights into a playoff spot. I know what you're thinkingwas notable plagiarist Shia Lebouef writing this flick? It only gets better.<br/><br/>Shortly before the climax, each protagonist loses their respective power. Cage and Calvin are back to their old, schlubby selves. But *spoiler alert* somehow they're able to cope. Cage kills off the alien race, saving the world. Calvin dribbles in between Vince Carter's legs and the Knights win the game, making the playoffs.<br/><br/>Even though they've lost their powers, both guys get the ""girl"". Cruise's character meets back up with Blunt's character, and we're only left to assume they hook up later (probably while wearing a pair of Jordans). Lil Bow Wow gets adopted because he used to be sick at basketball and was able to catch the eye of his adoptee.<br/><br/>Aside from the seven ""Mikes"" working on-set as underwater lighting technicians, photo technicians etc., there's clear allusions to the 2002 Oscar snub.

","I've always loved movies since childhood, and over the years, have developed a taste for quality, regardless of genre. Sci-Fi happens to be my favorite, for I crave the thrill of the unknown and a desire for the imagination to be stimulated by new worlds, action, special-effects and suspense. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" thrilled the senses, dominated my full attention and maintained suspenseful anticipation from start to finish.<br/><br/>This is a complex plot, but so well written and directed that I never felt lost or confused. Tom Cruise continues to command my respect as an actor, and Emily Blunt is outstanding in her role, revealing her ability to portray a myriad of diverse characters. I'll be looking for her future movies with relish.<br/><br/>The most favorable aspect of this movie, to me, was the inclusion of quantum physics, specifically the dimension of time, as an element of the plot. The ethereal element of time was central to the entire theme, very similar in its use in last year's top-rated movie, ""Lucy"" – another exceptional must-see movie.<br/><br/>Not quite in the league with such classics as Alien, Predator, Contact and such, this action-packed, riveting movie is thoroughly entertaining, well-acted, and will surely please fans of Sci-Fi, drama, humor, thrillers, and mystery and suspense.

"MUFCOK","8","2","6","19 February 2015"," A Sci-Fi film with fantastic pacing and breathtaking CGI
","Tom Cruise plays Cage, a military officer who is forced to be a solider and thrown into the front line to help the human race end the alien invasion of earth. Some of the rare, more powerful aliens have abilities to reverse time and reset the day when they die, Cage develops this same power when he kills one of those aliens in battle and is burnt alive with the extra-terrestrial being. Cage now has the ability to return to the moment he awoke prior to the battle and restart the day again, offering him countless attempts to try and end the war.<br/><br/>On paper it doesn't sound like anything ground-breaking and sounds like it would have many unoriginal Sci-Fi elements we have seen many times before. While it does have its faults it certainly excels in other aspects and delivers an extremely effective Sci-Fi/action flick.<br/><br/>Visually this film is absolutely stunning. Every aspect of the CGI is perfect and you really feel immersed into the environment. The action scenes are sometimes a little shaky and up-close but the camera work is very well done that it blends in different angles to ensure you see the majority of the action clearly. There is a scene with a car and a caravan which stands out to me, look out for it! The Alien creatures also look good with really impressive movement and features. The weapons and battle gear that the soldiers wear are created with a futuristic look but not too far-fetched, they look quite realistic and believable.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie is perfect. A problem with plenty of Sci-Fi films is when they delve into the scientific jargon, taking 30 minutes to tell the viewer irrelevant bits of information, over complicating matters. This is what usually puts me off Sci-Fi movies and the fact that Edge of Tomorrow decided to keep the science talk to a minimum was very much welcomed by myself! It keeps it to a minimum and only reveals key info, keeping the pacing of the film very well. Tom Cruise dies dozens of times in this movie and has to relive his previous hours many times. The directors did a great job in editing this so the viewer doesn't get bored, the fact Cage dies many times and relives the same hours 20+ times but doesn't feel repetitive is a brilliant achievement. The movie is just under 2 hours and I didn't get bored once.<br/><br/>I do however have a couple of negatives with Edge of Tomorrow. There are a few plot holes which I won't go into as to not ruin any of the story. The plot holes aren't major but do seem very simple and a little baffling as to why they weren't explained. Emily Blunts gives a great performance but her character appears clichéd with cheesy one liners and predictable actions. The love element is also something that I wouldn't welcome but it is something I have come to expect and accept from Hollywood blockbusters so I can't criticise the movie for this! I feel the start has a few too many cheesy one liners and poorly delivered jokes which takes away from the seriousness of the story.<br/><br/>Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is a very fun, well-choreographed, well-acted Sci Fi action flick which exceeded my expectations by quite some way.

","Edge of Tomorrow is the super sleeper hit of the year! Yeah, when I saw the trailer before the opening credits of another movie I didn't really take to it at all. I wasn't a fan of the bland alien species, or the fact that we're warring with them having seen it all before (Starship Troopers, War of the Worlds, Independence Day), and I could do without a movie where Tom Cruise has to be phoning it in...<br/><br/>... I was wrong. Edge of Tomorrow warrants a rare 8 star rating from me, which is a MUST SEE, DEFINITE RENTAL with OPTION TO OWN. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a rare moment in time where I'm actually content with a recent sci-fi movie! Tom Cruise leads as Major William Cage, who is bestowed the unique power to reset the day of the final battle following his death; a sort of time loop. With the help of a solider who was affected the same way, Sargent Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), he uses this power in an effort to win the war against aliens.<br/><br/>That premise is what sets it apart from every other alien movie in the last 10 years, and director Doug Liman presents it perfectly with all of its humorous and tragic complications. At first Cage is overwhelmed by the power, and inexperienced in combat, but by the end of the movie he's nearly omnipotent. However, one would also expect this alien species to operate with this same level of omnipotence having traveled across the galaxy and taken many worlds. The conflict in this movie is unbelievably fun!<br/><br/>Tom Cruise nails this role down perfectly! He plays a vulnerable, fragile character in the beginning but gradually turns into a hardened elite trooper. His delivery is classic Cruise; no punch is pulled, no stone unturned. His presence and confidence are supreme throughout the entire movie and his performance NEVER lets up. Strong performance by Cruise...<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is also there, but her character has a different dynamic of having lost the power to reset. The tragedy is written all over her face as she let herself down and lost loved ones, and is now a hollowed killing machine. She's all business, and the movie only merely flirts with the idea of Blunt's character Rita falling in love with Cruise's Cage; but that tension is masterfully portrayed by both actors.<br/><br/>A couple of other faces pop up unexpectedly, such as Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson. For whatever reasons, I find both these actors equally refreshing because I know that whatever they're in HAS to be good. Seeing them both in this movie is a no-brainer, the ultimate foreshadowing.<br/><br/>The special effects are decent, and the alien designs are passable. Their origins aren't really understood and a lot of the back story and exposition is brief if not slightly obscure. I'm still not a fan of the clunky exo-suits, or whatever you'd call them, but the movie has sequences where they don't look completely inconvenient.<br/><br/>What can I say... the old adage is certainly true; never judge a book by its cover. So to that, I'd say Rent. Watch. Repeat. Its basically Starship Troopers meets The Matrix meets Memento; how can you argue with that?"

"tieman64","Null","2","6","27 August 2014"," Come find me when you wake up
","""Groundhog Day"" meets ""Starship Troopers"" meets ""Saving Private Ryan"" in ""Edge of Tomorrow"". Directed by Doug Liman, the film stars Tom Cruise as Major William Cage, a public-relations officer within the ranks of the United Defence Force. A cowardly military man whose main function is to give pep talks at press conferences, Cage suddenly finds himself incessantly repeating the same day. This day takes place during a terrifying alien invasion.<br/><br/>What would you do if you were a coward forced to repeat, at the height of an alien invasion, the same day? Probably hide under a bed. But Cage is played by TOM FRICKIN' CRUISE, a ten inch matinée idol whose annual pass-time is SAVING THE PLANET. As such, Cage begins using his gift of immortality to kick alien butt. Like a video game avatar, Cage gains in skills and experience as he repeatedly dies, re-spawns and re-embarks out into his game world. His objective? Reach that big ""bonus level"" which, when conquered, ends the game and so the invasion.<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" pretends to be science fiction, but isn't really. The film's aliens are mostly unimaginative, and its action derivative. Because Cruise and Liman play things for laughs, though, the film works well. Like Cruise's best vehicles, ""Edge"" is self-depreciating, Cage emasculated and ridiculed for much of the movie. Even when Cage becomes superhuman, Liman is busy acknowledging the ridiculousness of the usual Hollywood heroics. Elsewhere the film draws from other fictional and historical sources. A character played by Brendan Gleeson evokes Winston Churchill, for example, the film's central battle recalls WW2's Operation Overlord, and various characters recall ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". Bill Paxton even shows up as a soldier, recalling his role in James Cameron's ""Aliens"".<br/><br/>Whilst ""Edge of Tomorrow's"" aliens are wholly generic, Liman does manage one interesting idea. His aliens are feigning a weakness so as to sucker Earth into launching a single offensive operation (a bit like the Emperor's plan in ""Return of the Jedi""). Once all of humanity's forces are committed, and in the same location, the aliens then spring their trap. This United Defence Force operation, which Cage participates in, mostly consists of humans bouncing about in (Heinlein/anime inspired) exo-suits.<br/><br/>Like ""Groundhog Day"", ""Edge of Tomorrow's"" second half revolves around an odd romance. Here Emily Blunt plays Sergeant Vrataski, a svelte woman who helps Cage slay xenomorphs. One touching moment finds Cage admitting to Vrataski that he's ""never been able to get further in the game"" and ""have her survive as well"". This is an interesting piece of drama - Cage forced to choose between saving the planet and saving his sultry co-star – which a better director would have milked, but nope. Liman ditches the idea and quickly moves on to his next set piece. As a result, the film's attempts at romance are mostly ineffectual. Based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's ""All You Need is Kill."" <br/><br/>7.9/10 – Worth two viewings."
"tavm","8","2","6","1 July 2014"," My and my friend liked Edge of Tomorrow perhaps despite its weirdness
","Just watched this-a Tom Cruise film about his reliving a certain event again and again to possibly defeat some alien foes capable of mass destruction-with my movie theatre-working friend. We both found it pretty weird but enjoyable enough. Emily Blunt is a fellow grunt who knows what he's going through since she's already experienced it plenty herself. Full of some humor and plenty of awesome action, we both managed to stay awake the whole time despite both of us yawning some of the time. So that's a good way to say this wasn't boring, that's for sure! Oh, and I recognized Bill Paxton as one of the officers who orders Cruise and the other men around, so that was another plus. So on that note, I recommend Edge of Tomorrow."
"view_and_review","9","2","6","23 June 2014"," The Matrix Meets Groundhog Day
","Maybe I'm too easy (that's not true) but I really liked this movie. This movie was surprisingly good. As much as I don't want to like Tom Cruise, he does great action movies. I don't even have a good reason for not wanting to like him; maybe it was the tom/kate thing or the scientology or something else. Regardless of all that I was impressed.<br/><br/>I expected Edge of Tomorrow to be a big budget movie high on action and low on substance... i.e. weak story. Weak, it was not. The action was there and there was plenty of it. Think The Matrix meets Groundhog Day. The special effects and the CGI was nice. You could almost say it was too much because there was a lot going on. And the story... it was awesome.<br/><br/>Mankind is fighting against an alien foe, ala sooooo many other movies. But this alien has the ability to reset time to some degree to avoid losses and to conquer its enemy: humans. Cruise's character, Cage, attains the same ability. The movie becomes a high stakes chess match between Cage, Rita (Emily Blunt) and the aliens.<br/><br/>I thought the story was superbly done. The movie offered many white knuckle and edge-of-your-seat moments. It was almost a thrill a minute. There was no wasted time; almost instantly you're thrust into the thick of things. The story in separate pieces may not be all that unique, but together it is very unique and very good."
"JPfanatic93","6","2","6","15 June 2014"," Watch Tom Cruise die, again and again and again
","Remember Oblivion? Chances are you don't. It was a poor Sci-Fi blockbuster released last year, in which mankind has left the planet after a war with aliens, and now Tom Cruise is harvesting the last natural resources. Or so he thinks, as things are not what they appear to be. Apart from Cruise, the movie co-starred Tom Cruise as several clones of the protagonist. A cynic might be inclined to think Edge of Tomorrow repeats Oblivion's mistakes, and he would not be fully wrong. Edge of Tomorrow, too, has a messy plot involving aliens in which Cruise dies multiple times, at which point Cruise takes over. However, Edge of Tomorrow utilizes a more tongue-in-cheek approach to its overall plot to underscore the absurdity of the situation. Good thing too, as it is indeed all quite laughable. Too bad such a tone does creep in eventually, to the film's detriment.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is set in a future where a strange extraterrestrial enemy has conquered all of Europe and threatens to do likewise to the rest of the globe. Earth's nations have banded together in an attempt to fight off the adversary. All their battles were lost, save for one, where metal armoured female soldier Rita Vrataski made the difference. By applying similar combat harnesses to every soldier and sending them en masse to invade France, humanity hopes to retake the continent and annihilate the enemy. Of course, things are not as simple as they seem, and the aliens have a few tricks up their sleeve yet. For one thing, time loops.<br/><br/>Enter Cruise, who does an unusual thing here: he plays against character. Cruise is not starring as the monotonously brave action hero, but instead as a cowardly marketing agent for the military, who finds himself accused of desertion when he makes it clear he doesn't feel like covering the invasion to a stern general's face. Thrown in with a bunch of ragtag recruits, Cruise is dragged off to battle and left to fend for himself. He quickly kicks the bucket in a close skirmish with one of the vicious aliens. Then he wakes up back at base, and everything starts over again, much to his dismay as he doesn't do better the second time. Or the third. Try convincing your commanding officer of being stuck in a time loop ad infinitum. Needless to say he doesn't, so Cruise must find a way to discover what has happened to him and how to use it to his advantage, instead of continue dying without end.<br/><br/>So far so good, as the notion of time looping is handled with enough confidence and fun not to feel repetitive. In fact, repetition is cleverly avoided after the first few loops, as Cruise's character tries to alter events in different ways so as not to get boring. This approach too causes problems in the long run, as Cruise dies so many times (hundreds, if not thousands, it is suggested) that the plot soon trots along and seemingly ignores the whole concept, just to further the intricate story. The reason behind the time loops and the method of fighting its cause start to become so convoluted and ridiculous that the ingredient of fun which at first characterized it is ever more lost. What's worse, Cruise resorts to playing a more typical heroic role as the film progresses, while it's the sleaze bag aspect that initially made him interesting to watch. At least his chemistry with the tough but unapproachable Rita is watchable enough as long as the Hollywood romance looming in the background is kept at bay. In terms of acting, Paxton's cocky performance suits the tone of the film best, which makes it all the more regrettable that when he's out of the picture, Edge of Tomorrow schizophrenically feels the need to get serious. Naturally it includes an all too predictable 'what the F!' type ending that suggests you need to think things over, but doesn't make you care enough to do so.<br/><br/>Until that time there's enough to make the viewing experience passable at best. Aside from Paxton, Blunt does her bit with plenty of pizazz, rife with entertainingly flamboyant demeanour. Nevertheless, it's the grandiose battle scenes that demand the most attention, as Edge of Tomorrow makes it progressively clear it intends to be an action movie more than the self aware comedy it initially appeared, until the comic elements are just discarded entirely. The notion of a futuristic landing on the beach of Normandy where men in armour fight weird creatures, proves hard to resist, but its execution is flawed. Often it's not easy to make out what is transpiring, mostly due to the chaotic camera work, which does make the fights seem more realistic. The design of the aliens doesn't help, as they keep moving about which makes it hard to see them as something other than a shapeless bunch of tentacles rolling around. It enhances the sense of battle immersion, but makes it difficult to appreciate the craftsmanship that went into designing what might have been epic war scenes.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is a definite step up from the forgetful Oblivion, but still a far cry from, say, Minority Report, which also starred Cruise. The movie sadly switches tones halfway through, without securing the audience's allegiance to accept this. Worse, the more the plot progresses, the harder it is for the audience to remain focused, as things have to be taken with too big a grain of salt, while the good humoured use of loops ultimately gets lost in an overly incoherent plot. Cruise pleasantly surprises the spectator at first, before reverting to his standard performance. You could state his career is caught in a similar loop; minor variations do occur, but he always reverts to his established routine."

","Went and saw this movie with many reservations due to thinking Oblivion was just okay. Lights go black, sound comes on, and then Im blown away in less then 10 minutes. This amazing movie throws you into the fray of its plot and its so well done that you learn things as the protagonist does. Wont spoil anything but i will tell you this may be Tom Cruise's best performance since he was Les Grossman in Tropic thunder. In that movie though he was nowhere near as amazing as in EOT (Edge of Tomorrow). The visuals in this movie were stunning, the acting flawless, and the overall story fantastic. I will tell you the only reason this movie doesn't get a 10 out of 10 is because there wasn't enough Emily Blunt for me....(she is now my new celeb crush...you'll see what i mean when you go see this movie.) I did not see this movie in 3D mainly due to the fact that unless I'm told in a review by someone else (Jeremy Jahns) I don't feel the need to shell out that kind of money. But i will tell you this movie is amazing and you need to go experience the rush that is Edge of Tomorrow."
"pinkled5","7","2","6","6 June 2014"," Heavy on Plot, Light on Heart
","THE GOOD: Engaging and interesting plot. Great action scenes. Top notch visual effects. The movie delivers on intensity and excitement.<br/><br/>THE BAD: Almost no character development. Really, the main character is not even developed. We know he's an officer who gets shanghai'd into active duty on the front line. We also know he has the power to reset the day when he dies. We never learn anything else about him. Zero, zilch, nada. Equally undeveloped is his ""relationship"" with the secondary character played by Emily Blunt. There was some awesome potential for an excellent character there, but all we got was a companion he could run around with completing their missions. There was one brief farmhouse scene where they spent like two minutes trying to show that there was a relationship developing, but it wasn't enough.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie I haven't been made to care about these characters, only what happens in the story. That is a HUGE script writing mistake, IMHO. This movie could have been spectacular if it had deep, interesting characters but as it turns out, it was only an above average action flick."

","This really shouldn't have happened. Edge of Tomorrow started out as All You Need is Kill, and the first anyone saw of it was a fairly ridiculous-looking shot of Tom Cruise running towards the camera with a giant explosion in the background. The director didn't inspire confidence either (Doug Liman's prior big-budget film was Jumper. The less said, the better), and the premise (Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers) seemed domed to fail from the beginning. But it didn't, and what we got instead is a funny, uncommonly intellignt sci fi-action film that tells an engrossing story while never taking itself too seriously. The time-loop concept is used extremely well, never repeating footage. It knows that we've gotten the gist already, and to only show what we need to see. It's the rare blockbuster that gives its audience's intelligence the credit it deserves."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","1","2","12 July 2019"," It covers familiar ground and is a bit gimmicky, but it still very much succeeds on its own merits
","Soldier Cage (Tom Cruise) is forced to fight on the frontline (very much against his will) in a war against an alien race. Cage gets killed during the battle, but also discovers that he is able to reset the day every time he dies. Cage struggles to convince his fellow soldiers of what has happened to him and what he knows, but manages to find an ally in another soldier Rita (Emily Blunt). With their different skill sets they set to work in trying to defeat the alien race once and for all...<br/><br/>Edge Of Tomorrow has clearly lifted its central concept from Groundhog Day and set it in a post apocalyptic era where humans are fighting aliens (which again is nothing new). Aside from the gimmicky nature of the plot, I think what makes the film work is mainly down to the way the story is constructed and how it all unfolds; at first we're in the same boat as Cage - confused about what is happening and searching for answers. It soon starts to become like a puzzle and each time Cage dies and resets the day we are gradually able to start piecing things together and more and more of the story starts to unravel and step by step Rita and Cage get closer to achieving their goal.<br/><br/>One thing I did find interesting about this film was the way Cruise's character is written; usually when watching Cruise's films he usually has leading man status and generally plays characters with a degree of heroism. At the start of the film, he is something of a pacifist and is very much against violence (which is not something we're used to seeing from Cruise in a lot of his action films). Of course, he becomes skilled later in the film, but it was interesting to see Cruise play a character that had been written in such a manner. On the other hand, Emily Blunt's character is the opposite; tough as nails and rather no nonsense in approach - she remains this way throughout which was something of a blessing as I was worried that we might have had another 'sappy romance' on our hands.<br/><br/>Edge Of Tomorrow is a good looking film with some neat special effects and director Doug Liman keeps everything tight and focused; naturally it's a rinse and repeat approach, but new developments to the story are realised on each repeated day so it never becomes dull (this was part of the reason that Groundhog Day worked as well). Out of the supporting cast then it's only Bill Paxton who's really given anything to do and he once again puts in a very strong performance.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this is Groundhog Day set against the backdrop of war with an alien race, Edge Of Tomorrow still manages to hold its own and is an entertaining film with a decent story and enough elements for it to be able to stand up to scrutiny on its own merits. Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but an enjoyable film nonetheless."

It's a long time since I visited Paris, but isn't I.M. Pei's glass pyramid in the Louvre courtyard, so the crippled aircraft crossing the Seine would have had to crash through the main building in order to reach the omega?"
"manuelwinchester","8","1","2","30 October 2016"," A living video game
","There are so many sci-fi movies nowadays, all trying to make a difference in a really chaotic genre. Well, the difference from now on has a name and it's called ''Edge of Tomorrow''. The innovative script is combining hardcore sci-fi with groundhog's day plot. After considering as a deserter, Cage (Tom Cruise), is poured in the ongoing battle with aliens. The battle against aliens goes wrong, but after his death, he notices that he's living the same day again and again. Groundhog day. The script is brilliantly clever and this makes Doug's Liman job an easy task. The director is constructing the film like a video game. Every time you lose, you have a new try to achieve game's purpose. The whole movie is reminding a video game with its spectacular meaning. You can follow the hero searching every possible aspect, changing the smallest detail, just to reach his goal and win this battle. Additionally, the sci-fi element is magnificent. Aliens are mimics which look like fast android transformers. On the other hand, humans have super robotic suits in order to fight these expeditious and powerful creatures. What else do you want? I repeat, in the whole movie, you feel like you're watching a video game, processing stage by stage. Only a few movies have done something similar successfully. Also, the plot is so intriguing that retains the suspense until the last minute. Not only the director is doing a great job, but the cast is similarly pretty qualitative. Tom Cruise never gets old giving one more absolute action performance. But the biggest surprise is called Emily Blunt, who is delightful in each appearance and we expect glorious things from her in the future. So if you love sci-fi and especially if you enjoy video games you should definitely watch Edge of Tomorrow, but the fact is that this movie is far more interesting than anyone would believe, thus it's a must-watch."

","Overall: This movie has stunning visuals, impeccable acting and is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Good: Once more, the visuals are stunning are well put together. The premise is great despite the whole 'Relive the Day' concept has been done once or twice before. Lack of music develops an uneasy and a more tenser atmosphere which bodes well for the movie.<br/><br/>Bad: Personally, I just couldn't get behind Tom Cruise's character and just plain didn't like him. Not to say his acting was poor, it wasn't; I just don't think he was well written. Most of the supporting cast felt useless and unimportant except perhaps one or two and the top military professionals are morons. Numerous plot holes and inconsistencies here and there with some sloppy editing that should go unnoticed unless paying very close attention. Could have opted for a more deadly and threatening looking alien race. They aren't that interesting or creative other than their general design which is quite cool. The ending is just not satisfying for me and feels packed together to make it all happy and fun.<br/><br/>Best Part: The 'Day' were Tom Cruise just doesn't care and just wants to finish his mission.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This movie is far underrated and didn't reach the box office success that it should have. I believe this was one of 2014's better movies. The story line is decent and original (with the possible exception that they stole a bit from Groundhog's Day), there is an element of mystery to it, solid character development, great action sequences, the CGI is well done, and it all ends up being very engaging. It's goes from fun to gritty and you can really feel it. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt really connect and do a good job acting, nothing stellar but far from awful. The only issue with this movie that I can find is that it gets a little slow towards the middle but then picks up again at the end. This movie is a solid sci-fi action experience and will leave you wanting to come back to it."

There are too many competing ideas and the movie goes past in a blur of information. At one point I found myself questioning what this movie was really about and the point of it.

","Edge of Tomorrow (2014): Dir: Doug Liman / Cast: Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleesan, Noah Taylor: Scientific version of Groundhog Day that dabbles on the issue of fate. Set in the future, aliens have waged war and Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage who refuses to be placed on the battle ground. This has him knocked out and forced into the middle of mayhem. He initially dies in battle yet he awakens repeatedly in the same place and repeats the same day until he gets it right. The goal is to destroy the alpha male but they always anticipate their arrival. Cage seeks out a freedom fighter, played by Emily Blunt and together they repeatedly try to figure out how to win this war. Humor occurs when she trains him and he constantly gets injured thus resulting in her shooting him and setting him starting all over again. Other roles include Bill Paxton as a gruff no nonsense Sergeant, and Brendan Gleeson as a cynical General who initially forces this position on Cage. Noah Taylor steals moments as a former government scientist whom Blunt has recruited to help figure out the key to destroy this alien race. Once Cage comes into play they progress forward but not without difficulty. Directed by Doug Liman who previously made Go and the overrated The Bourne Identity. The screenplay is inventive despite constant repetition. Cruise and Blunt have great chemistry and the special effects are explosive with aliens that seem unstoppable. Groundhog Day was more theme oriented while Liman's film goes for pure entertainment action that should place viewers at the edge of their seat. Score: 8 / 10"
"adrongardner","8","1","2","8 June 2014"," All you need is Keiji
","Edge of Tomorrow is a terrible title. <br/><br/>But it is an awesome movie. <br/><br/>I'm one of those jaded moviegoers who has seen everything in nearly 40 years. I even read the original Sakurazaka novella and was expecting a horror show. I don't even like Tom Cruise, but darn it, I honest to goodness enjoyed the heck out of this movie. <br/><br/>Is it flawed? Of course it is! The opening premise is shaky. I just can't side with Hollywood replacing Japanese characters with bankable names like Cruise and Cage should be Keiji and played by a Japanese actor. But I'm going to let this stuff pass. Emily Blunt was tough as nails - and that's been a hard sell for Hollywood. Tough women - Linda Hamilton tough - haven't been handled well by the studios and that's not saying the women aren't out there. Blunt pulls off the famous red warrior with ease. I'll even say it - Cruise does a good job, however, I still cringe when proper story and characters are buried in favor of the same old faces.<br/><br/>And then there's that ending ripped right from Pacific Rim. We know it's coming. Even when i finished the novella, I knew it would never fly in Hollywood. That and it's quite a bit more complicated. Or maybe Liman filmed it all but the test audiences hated it. There's no telling. But I still enjoyed the ride.<br/><br/>Basically: Slaughterhouse Five + Groundhog Day + Pacific Rim + Elysium = Edge of Tomorrow. The movie is - literally - about ten movies you have already seen 1000 times. And it is awesome."

"Quinoa1984","9","2","7","23 November 2014"," largely refreshing and clever science fiction thriller, verging on comedy in parts
","What makes Edge of Tomorrow arguably the best Tom Cruise starring vehicle in the past ten years - yes, I'm going that far (excluding the Mission: Impossible movies I should add) - is context. For a while, Cruise has been playing characters who just come ready-made it seems as bad-asses; Jack Reacher, the character in Oblivion, Knight & Day (that was leaning more to comedy, but the point still stands), Valkyrie. In all of these, we don't get to see much at all in the way of a transformation into him being a ""bad-ass"", he just is, and it's gotten tiring after a while. Then enter in Edge of Tomorrow where he plays basically a PR man for the military - a talking head - in one of those apocalyptic societies where aliens have landed and there's a battle for Earth yada-yada. He gets tricked by Brendan Bleeson's General or Colonel or whoever, and is placed right into combat. Where he dies. Because he's not fit for war. But due to a kind of alien-substance-MacGuffin device, Cruise's character ends up going back to right when he's about to enter the combat hell. And this loop continues again, and again.<br/><br/>What's different here? Cruise has to *become* a hero, and while this may not be something exactly new in action-sci-fi spectacle movies - certainly it's more along the lines of what you'd pick up in a screen writing class - it's refreshing for this star, especially to see Cruise have to act as the sap who is caught in a bad situation, and has little other choice but to get better (aside from, you know, the film's tagline of ""Live Die Repeat""). In another way what's so absorbing is that the structure of Liman's film, taking off from a Japanese comic book, is that it's like a video game: if you go into a combat zone, you have to progress (I was thinking of one of those Metal Gear games, but I'm sure there's something closer to what it actually is in video games). You have to get to that next level and keep going to get to the final ""bad guy"".<br/><br/>The movie is short from being altogether great for the reason of the familiarity of the alien invasion dynamic - albeit the alien designs are rather extraordinary, with their spaghetti-limbs and quick pace - and the climax has more of that familiarity with what Cruise and Emily Blunt are going after to destroy that alien 'source'. But outside of that, Edge of Tomorrow is a winning picture, and the filmmakers have a lot of FUN with the premise and all of these times that Cruise has to go through this combat situation - also Bill Paxton as a scene-chewing sergeant with his platoon of metal-suited soldiers - and Blunt too. The team up works a bit better as well than some of the past Cruise vehicles (again, Reacher and Oblivion come to mind) as far as the two stars playing off each other, finding the dark comedy in these situations, and the gravity in the drama as well. When Blunt's character has to tell about how she went through this Groundhog's Day scenario before, there's weight and substance to the drama.<br/><br/>I have to wonder if it'll work as well on another viewing; in the theater there was a real sense of surprise to every step of the movie's logic. I imagine it will be entertaining just by the nature of the writing, and it also must be said that Liman directs the action very well. There's some of the shaky-cam crap - he was the director of the first Bourne of course - but not TOO much, and you can tell what is going on in relation to the spaces shot to shot. It's all in all a case of a star taking it just a little bit easy, and it pays off: Cruise is really appealing in the film, as he goes on this adventure, learns as he goes along, and he and Blunt get great lines to play throughout. In other words, the kind of comedy-action-drama-spectacle that gets shoveled down the world's collective throat with Transformers, but much much better, for the reasons stated."
"TheTrthHrts","7","2","7","8 October 2014"," Nope...not worthy of its praise and hype...
","6.5/10 <br/><br/>*please pardon the forced incorrect use of nested parentheses; apparently, IMDb believes anything in a bracket is ""markup"" ...<br/><br/>So, essentially all I've heard and read of this movie is that it's an under-appreciated work of genius that should serve as inspiration for all future sci-fi movies. Unfortunately, the reality is that this movie offers precisely zero original concepts, nothing remotely close to anything requiring intelligence to decipher (it's literally Pacific Rim (horrid), Independence Day (horrid), Source Code (decent, but overrated), and Aliens (yep: excellent) tossed into a blender, the mix being even bitterer than the majority of the individual ingredients), and is simply unworthy of the baseless critical acclaim it appears to have received since failing spectacularly at the American box office. When not even the excellent Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, and Doug Liman can save a totally unworthy script that offers literally nothing that hasn't been done before (and done better, numerous times), you know you have a ""problem film"" that shouldn't have been green-lit.<br/><br/>To be sure, I went into this movie expecting it to be the under-appreciated work it's been touted as; I personally enjoyed Oblivion (surprisingly superior to this film in literally every way) quite a bit, thanks in no small part to Tom Cruise's ineffable charisma that's made him the greatest movie star of all time (in my opinion). Obviously, despite the fact that his image has essentially been destroyed through a fabricated scenario involving couch-jumping (from what I've read, it was manufactured and coerced), he remains one of the most appealing actors working today. (Granted, there were the Scientology issues--that was entirely Cruise's doing...) I expected to be bored by the necessary repetition that the script requires (Groundhog Day), but impressed by everything else; that was simply not the case. The script is unintelligent and clearly aimed not at the ""superior"" filmgoers of the day, but the average box office-goer/gamer (see below) who will appreciate (publicly or privately) what he's seen before (a hundred times, at this point) with the added elements of supposed ""class"" and ""intelligence,"" neither of which are anywhere to be found within this film (most disappointingly).<br/><br/>Of course, a major marketing point of this film is that it ""replicates the respawning frequently seen within modern video games."" The film borrows very heavily from the Crysis series (if you've played the games, I'm sure you'll agree), as well as numerous other ""run and gun"" game series (aren't they all, nowadays). That's great and all, but this unfortunately doesn't translate into an exciting concept for a film; it's about as entertaining as watching someone play a mediocre modern throwaway video game. In other words, it's generally exceptionally boring. By the last half hour of this film, I was astounded by how boring and humdrum it had become, with an ending that defies all logic and invalidates any ""character development"" that's come before it. Worse, said character development is nearly non-existent, Cruise's protagonist is an obvious coward unworthy of subsequent praise (the actions of his character are highly unlikely, given the way the film initially portrays him), and the pseudo-relationship that almost kinda-sorta develops between Cruise and Blunt is entirely dull, misdirected, and insipid.<br/><br/>In short, if you were disappointed by Oblivion and were counting on this film to represent the ""true potential"" of a modern Tom Cruise sci-fi spectacle, think again. Re-rent Oblivion, disregard the critical indifference it received, and recognize it as being far superior to this failed effort to capitalize on recent sci-fi trash. After that, re-rent Minority Report. Forget this film.<br/><br/>p.s. as they essentially retitled this movie, I had to do a double-take when renting it from Vudu; I wasn't sure if it was a lengthy set of bonus features of ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" the film that I intended to rent. Don't retitle films simply because they failed at the box office, guys. Please and thanks."

"jboothmillard","6","2","7","10 June 2014"," Edge of Tomorrow
","From director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Jumper), when I first saw the trailer for this film it looked rather complicated to me, but I knew it was big, and the leading stars made it appealing, so I went to see it. Basically in the not too distant future humanity has been in a war against aliens called Mimics for five years, NATO military has created United Defense Forces (UDF), and their armed mechanised exoskeleton suits called Jackets are helping to achieve victories. UDF spokesman and United States military officer Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is summoned to meet UDF commander General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) in London, multi-front invasion Operation Downfall to defeat Mimics controlling Europe and relieve Russian and Chinese forces pressure is to be launched, and Cage is ordered to cover combat on the beaches of France, he tries to blackmail the General, so he is arrested and stripped of his rank. The next morning he wakes in Heathrow Airport and its base where he is to be dropped into battle, but Mimics have anticipated the first wave attack, so the invasion is crushed, Cage manages to kill an unusually large Mimic, but in doing so he is doused with its acidic blood and dies. Cage is shocked to wake up the previous morning in Heathrow, with all the same events repeating, and when it comes to the attack happening all over again and he is killed once again, he wakes up again the previous morning, he is stuck in a time loop, every time he dies he ""resets"" the day (the previous 24 hours). He is unable to convince the soldiers of what he is going through, in his loops he attempts to save other soldiers, and one particular loop he meets ""Angel of Verdun"" Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), she recognises he can can anticipate events before they happen, so she tells him to meet her when he repeats, before he goes into battle. At the base in a repeat of the day Cage finds Rita, he explains they have met before in battle, she recognises he has an ability she had herself to reset the day, she gained celebrity status anticipating and killing hundreds of Mimics in a victory of Verdun. Rita explains to Cage that he gained his ability from the Alpha Mimic blood doused on him the first time he died, the Mimics possess a singular consciousness called the Omega, giving them the ability to reset time, she lost the ability after receiving a blood transfusion. She mentions that he will see visions of the Omega's location, which is crucial to defeating the Mimics once and for all, so in his repeats Cage is trained in combat, and if severe injury occurs he must be killed immediately, each time his skills and accuracy increase, and each time they enter the battle together they get a step closer to finding a way out of the battlefield. As these repeats have occurred Cage has become attached to Rita and finds it hard to watch her die each time, and when they do make it off the battlefield and into a shelter he tells her that no matter what they do, from the various repeats he has had, she is going to die regardless of changes, she ignores this and attempts to use a helicopter, and she is mortally wounded, and he is killed moments later when Mimics appear. Cage decides on a following loop to find and destroy the Omega himself, believing it to be in the Bavarian Alps, he cannot locate it and narrowly avoids a Mimic stealing his ability through blood draining, he tells Rita and former government scientist and Mimic biology expert Dr. Carter (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Noah Taylor) that his visions are a hoax. But the doctor mentions a transponder device kept by General Brigham that if injected into a Mimic or someone with their ability it could theoretically help locate the Omega, several failed loops later the General does give in and give them the transponder, and while escaping from the General's Whitehall office Rita stabs age with the device, he confirms the Omega is in the Louvre, Paris. Following a crash Cage wakes in a hospital bed, he has had a blood transfusion, so his ability is gone, so with the day unable to be reset he convinces soldiers in the base to join him and Rita on a mission to Paris to destroy the Omega, Alphas try to counteract, soldiers are killed, but with a grenade belt Cage finally reaches the Omega and primes the explosion, just before being killed by an Alpha. In the end Cage wakes up the previous day before, for the briefing with the General, not the day of an attack, the Omega has been disintegrated and the Mimics are seemingly giving into the UDF, and not stripped of his rank Cage is able to visit Rita at the Heathrow base, she has obviously never met him and he smiles. Also starring Bill Paxton as Master Sergeant Farell, Robin Hood's Jonas Armstrong as Skinner, Blunder's Tony Way as Kimmel, Kick Gurry as Griff, Attack the Block's Franz Drameh as Ford, Dragomir Mrsic as Kuntz, Charlotte Riley as Nance, Coronation Street's Terence Maynard as Cruel Sergeant and The Tomorrow People's Madeleine Mantock as Julie. Cruise does well playing against his usual type of character being cowardly, Blunt is feisty as the special forces poster girl, and supporting cast members Paxton and Gleeson get their good moments too. If you combined Starship Troopers, Battle: Los Angeles and Groundhog Day, then this is probably what you'd end up with, the repeating and changes to events concept is clever, combined with the apocalyptic alien invasion and battle sequences, so expect plenty of explosions and fantastic special effects, and the small romantic element is pleasant too, I agree the ending is a little soft, but overall it is a really entertaining science-fiction action drama. Good!"
"neil-476","8","2","7","5 June 2014"," Big loud fun
","It is the near future, and an alien invasion is close to achieving world domination. Cage is a US Major in Public Relations, happy that this keeps him far from the front and actual danger. He is deeply upset to be railroaded into combat, particularly as this gets him killed. Before dying, however, he has been infected with the blood of a rare alien Alpha, which has the effect of resetting time whenever he dies: he starts to live the same day again. This may even lead to a plan to beat the aliens.<br/><br/>I'm sure others have said this, but this movie is essentially Groundhog Day meets Saving Private Ryan, only with the doodads from The Matrix instead of Nazis. Which doesn't make it bad. There is considerable entertainment to be had from seeing Cage (Tom Cruise) trying to worm his way out of being sent into combat, his sheer funk on his way in, and the repetition of his deaths, some of which are very funny. The special effects are astonishing, and the film is entertaining throughout.<br/><br/>If I was to be critical of it, I would say that it is a big flashy movie of little consequence other than immediate entertainment value, but that could as easily be an endorsement as a criticism. It is one of those films which, when it pops up on TV, you'll almost certainly sit down and watch it. Get out the popcorn and enjoy!"

"InMyHonestOpinion","4","2","8","26 December 2014"," Live die Repeat until it becomes comical
","I loved the concept behind this film; it can so easily be expanded upon almost in a ""Matrix"" kind of way. I remember a lot of the conversations I had about that film when it was first released and I guess when more people get to see ""The Edge of Tomorrow"" those conversations may start up once again. The only problem with these kinds of film is the ""reality nuts"" and sci-fi geeks"" it brings out of hiding who don't get enough explained to make it work. What I mean by that is it is really hard to turn imagination into reality and there always will be some pivotal points missed or simply forgotten as a consequence. I fall into the later of the two nut bags. For me there were just so many holes left unexplained. I don't believe the director had that intention though unlike Nolan who can pull it off so well. So in saying that the film still has its moments of greatness making it worthy enough to give a decent rating. The plot is one that has been done before but not on such a grand scale. Set in a futuristic world the Earth is at War. Major William Cage played by Tom Cruise (Mission Impossible, Vanilla Sky) is a military journalist never seen a day of combat in his life. After refusing to be front and center and report from the impending battle against an alien race known as ""Mimics"", Cage is arrested and knocked out, when he wakes he finds himself in cuffs, his rank has been revoked and now finds himself labeled as a deserter. Cage finds out that now instead of being a reporter on the mission he will now be a soldier, a suicide mission as it becomes apparent. Major Cage dies within 5 minutes of landing after seeing a Special Forces officer Sergeant Rita Vrataski played by Emily Blunt (The Devil wears Prada, Looper) first die. Next thing he wakes up one day earlier and finds the day suddenly repeating Cage seems to be caught in some kind of time loop every time he dies the day starts over There is a lot to give away to the plot if I go any further into the story so I'll leave it there. This is one of those films that we could discuss for years and never come to a solution; I'm sure everyone who sees it will come to their own conclusion which makes it well worth seeing in my opinion. As I stated earlier though I'm a sci-fi geek that needs things to at least work even in made up lands. There is so much that doesn't make sense when thought about, but then there is enough goodness to forgive those mistakes as well. Cruise is actually pretty good in his role not that it's too much of a stretch from other characters he has played before. Blunt does just as well in her kick ass bitch role as well. The majority of this film was shot on green screen which isn't a problem it just means judging its artistic creativeness with cinematography is almost pointless. The CGI of the Mimics I loved though I thought they were great. Not really one for the kids but to be honest I don't believe they would understand its storyline anyway."

","For a reason that is unclear, even for the most hardcore sci-fi fans, major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is trapped in a time-loop (a la Groundhog day) during a war against an alien race who wants to take over the planet.<br/><br/>With such a premise and a budget of $180,000,000 you can expect some serious visual effects in this one. The movie doesn't take itself too serious and that's a good thing, so you can expect some funny moments too.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough there is also a romance in it. And I mean it is a surprise because Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are far from a matching couple. There is no romantic chemistry between them as simple as that.<br/><br/>Anyway. Overall it's a fun movie. I usually rate these with a 7 but I'm rating this particular movie with 6, because of the unsuitable cast/couple."
"digitalbeachbum","1","2","8","1 July 2014"," Time travel is always difficult
","Time travel is a very difficult subject to project to the viewer. The writer(s) need to be careful because once you throw time travel in to the story you could open a Pandora's box of problems.<br/><br/>This movie, based on a book, fails miserably. The time travel in this movie is so messed up it creates more questions and continuity errors than it can resolve. And while people will dislike what I say next, in real life, time travel does not work this way. Check the science for the theory of time travel.<br/><br/>I thought the special effects were good and I thought that the overall flow of the movie was good, but the time travel thing didn't work for me. I liked the fight scenes, the humor, the CGI, but the time travel thing didn't work for me.<br/><br/>When the main plot of the movie has continuity errors, and this one has it is spades, I no longer like the movie. I dislike it because the illusion has been broken and I realize that I'm back in my seat watching a movie.<br/><br/>There are individual scenes which are good, but the overall movie stunk. I want to be submerged in to a juicy plot which will make me forget reality for 90 minutes. This movie reminds me that I'm sitting in a seat, watching a movie.<br/><br/>And in closing, I don't care too much for Tom Cruise any more. He seems one dimensional to me. I think in his elderly years, he's become ridged with his acting style. The characters in his movie all seem the same, the way they project emotional responses."
"metalrage666","1","3","15","1 October 2019"," Edge of boredom
","I normally like action sci-fi movies, even when they make very little sense, but I absolutely hated everything about this. Very few movies these days, if any, manage to have a completely likeable cast, but it seems there's no shortage of movies where you end up hating every character in it, so much so that you don't care what anybody does, what they say or whether they live or die.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Tom Cruise is part of a media relations team covering the war in Europe against squid like aliens called mimics. He's not a combat soldier and when he's ordered to go along as correspondent to cover the allied retaliation invasion, he refuses. He tries to blackmail the general in charge of the whole operation, is arrested, demoted to private and sent in as an army grunt. The operation is a dismal failure, Cruise is killed by an alpha mimic and gains the ability to reset time where he ends up living the same day over and over, apparently getting a little better each time until he's a highly skilled combat veteran trying different tactics to win a war, no one seems capable of winning. Sounds good, but I can assure you it's not. It's tedious, annoying, boring and the whole movie is just one huge plot hole from start to finish. If I'm going to watch a Groundhog Day style of movie, where so many scenes are repeated, the least you can do is make it interesting. If I'm sitting there wondering when it's going to end, then it fails on all counts.<br/><br/>If Major Tom Cruise was the media face of the war why doesn't anyone seem to recognise him? Why is a U.S major transferred under orders to be taking orders from a U.K general? (seemingly the ONLY general in charge of the whole show). To avoid fighting at all, why doesn't the demoted Cruise demand a court martial in order to avoid combat for which he's not trained? If this is set in the near future, why is the army still using outdated WWII invasion tactics against a far superior force? If Cruise is killed on the same day or day after he's posted to his new team, even if this day is repeated for months, how does he manage to intimately learn everything about his team who instantly hate him anyway? Why does he insist on trying to be friends with Emily Blunt's character who also openly despises him and doesn't think twice about killing him in order to reset the timeline to start the day over from scratch? Why do they bother equipping an overwhelmed ground force with cumbersome mech suits, when you can just call in multiple air strikes or navy fired missiles from offshore before sending in humans at all? If any of this were even remotely possible, reliving a day of intense combat over and over, where everybody hates you and you repeatedly die horribly would literally send any person insane. Also at the end when the timeline has corrected itself and Private Cruise is back to being Major Cruise, no Sergeant, regardless of her accomplishments or decorations would greet a Major with ""who are you, what do you want""? Without so much as a salute.<br/><br/>I can accept stretches in reality when the movie has been set up that way, but when a movie like this attempts to ground itself in reality by news broadcasts, interviews and clips of real people only to then completely deviate from all common sense or continuity, the distraction overwhelms enjoyment. I can't accept the reviews giving this 9s or 10s and tags of ""best sci-fi ever"" etc when there's just far too much stupidity in it. I don't expect too many thumbs up for this as there's a never ending love of mediocrity but if I could give this zero stars, I would."

","I read ""All you Need is Kill"" before i watched the movie. For those who do not know, the movie is based on ""All you Need is Kill"".

Compared to one another, the Movie is a dumbed down Hollywoodized family friendly smudge filled with predictable everything. I do get that change is necessary at times when going from novel to film as you have to fit a the in a 3 hour-ish format. The changes in this film however is absolutely bonkers, removing almost everything of its originality and charm.

"marccolten-1","2","2","9","24 December 2018"," Stupid sci-fi
","When I heard the title I thought it was a daytime soap opera, but that's hardly the point.<br/><br/>The first problem is that they treat the ""time reset"" as an advantage when it is not. Imagine D-Day. Years of planning, hundreds of soldiers killed but the objective is achieved and an Allied foothold is taken. Then, just as the day ends, a single soldier is killed. He steps on a mine or is shot by a sniper and suddenly it's yesterday and they have to do it all over again. Maybe it will go better or maybe it will be a disaster. The point is they do not control it, not with Alphas roaming loose. They also have to know that the power can be transferred to a human, giving them the advantage.<br/><br/>The real stupidity is in the writing. For example, despite being the only one with the power, Cruise manages to convince a platoon to follow him. So, the night before the battle (a battle that Cruise knows is a trap) they sit around talking about how they are going to get off that beach alive. But if Cruise knows it is a trap why are they going there at all? Why walk into a trap? In fact, why are they waiting at all? They've got a 12 hour head start. Why wait to step into a trap to desert? Why not start now and be halfway to the Omega before the battle starts?<br/><br/>Another example is the helicopter. He knows they fail every time so why keep trying? Isn't the textbook definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result? I he knows it's a trap, why not swing a few miles north or a few miles east and try that? Why do the same thing over and over? It's just stupid.<br/><br/>Of course, the whole ending is absurd. They kill the Omega and it's the day before, when the Omega is still alive. Everyone who died is alive and the aliens are defeated and no one knows why or how."

","I was so disappointed to be watching ""Groundhogs Day"" with action and aliens. That is the entire movie. Boring, repetitive, keep repeating until you get it right. I didn't like Groundhogs Day, hated it to be honest, and this was very very similar. I gave it a 5 because the action was well executed. As far as plot / storyline it was taken from others, not unique in any way. Due to the high rating score here on IMDb, I will never trust it again. Someone must have submitted a bunch of false ratings. Seeing Tom Cruise as a humble unknowing soldier was not believable, I questioned his character the entire show. Very sad as I was looking forward to a blockbuster, and found nothing of the sort."

","So as I told my fiancé. I love Sci-Fi movies. But I am NOT a huge Tom Cruise fan. I just don't think he is that good of an actor (he is ALWAYS Tom Cruise, you know - and what is with the motorcycle riding scene in EVERY movie). If you compare his early career to now he took a lot more chances. No silly crazy sci fi / action films. Seriously. Go look at his filmography. You will be surprised. Then for some reason - just like Will Smith - they entered the by the number automatic summer action flick movie machine. I get it. It is what it is. But over time it just gets a little boring. Like comic books. It is like the film industry finally realized there is a whole gigantic universe of ready made content prepped for movie consumption. It seems that no one has realized there is 100+ years of awesome mind bending sci-fi just waiting out there for movie consumption/awesomeness. But instead we keep getting movies like Oblivion and Edge of Tomorrrow starring Tom Cruise. Recycled dreck and tropes. So my fiancé asks why do you keep seeing these movies. Well. First b/c Tom Cruise picks scripts that would also be interesting to me. We seem to like the same stuff. I am just always disappointed in the final product. Just Eh. Poorly written. I posit the movie may have been better by having Cruise and Blunt switch characters. As if Cruise would ever let that happen... Blunt was so one dimensional. Think about it. If you took her out of the movie NOTHING changes. She was a cardboard cutout. You can see there was a cut out love story in there. Which was the appropriate decision. But when they cut those scenes there was nothing left for her. Oh well. Then plot holes galore. Creature design lifted right form the Matrix. Deus Ex Machina stuck in towards the end b/c huh we don't know how to end this. So lets make a device he stabs into his thigh. Really? They also lose the exo-suits (the coolest thing about the movie) a little after half way through-dead batteries. Huh. Really? It occurred to me the next day that all they had to do was to find the Blue Alpha again on the beach. 1. Killing it would save everyone on the beach and make weeks (months?) of the worst rails video game trial and error unnecessary and 2. could have splashed blunt with its blood also to remain immortal. Sigh. The end was literally lifted right out of Pacific Rim. Why is every alien race a hive mind. Seriously? it all gets a little tired over time (get it - over time - ugh). Oh well. It was dumb. But enjoyable. More ninja exosuit scenes and I would have been happier. Oh well. You can't have everything :-)"
"aharmas","4","2","9","7 July 2014"," Thrilling?
","Tom Cruise has had an amazing career. Lately, he has embraced action films, and we have gotten some good entertainment. ""Mission IV"" was very exciting. ""Jack Reacher"" was not bad, either, and how can we forget his ""War of The Worlds""? Sadly, ""Edge"" leaves plenty of disappointment in his deja vu story. The whole thing is not a complete mess, but there is much to leave disenchanted.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice is that movie budgets are escalating so out of control that all we are getting are faded cinematography. What is happening? ""Waterworld"" and ""Mad Max"" looked like real movies. I say leave all the artsy tendencies behind and give us something that is not straining our eyesight. CGI must be much better now, and we don't need to hide those imperfections.<br/><br/>The second thing is the excessive amount of ""time travel"". We get it. He is sent back and must learn from his experiences. Half way through the film, we are exhausted because too much time has been invested on this gimmick. Some people have equaled this movie experience to a video game. Well, if you enjoy repetition, this is the holy grail of action movies. Otherwise, take a few bathroom breaks.<br/><br/>There are some good elements here. Emily Hunt is surprisingly effective as an action heroine, tough, good looking, smart, and more than a match for Cruise's confused army man. In one of the film's twists we discover that she's not the world's savior, more of a support system, an inspiration, and that's kind of a pity because she definitely shines here. I have loved her before, but she's an action star here.<br/><br/>There are some funny lines, and they keep you from falling asleep, just not enough, and those aliens must have stopped by the concession stand because they're out of control. It's hard to appreciate what they are capable of doing, and threatening is not something that comes to mind. Mostly, annoying! We're hoping they were truly defeated, and that we don't get a sequel."

The special effects and stunt-work are quite good, there is a surprising amount of humor, and a very unexpected character arc for Tom Cruise's character.

","Edge of Tomorrow stars Tom Cruise as William Cage, a military officer sent with the U.S Special Forces to stop a terrifying alien invasion that threatens the human race. Within the matter of minutes, Cage is killed in battle only to unexpectedly wake up at the beginning of the day where you he started before the battle. When he discovers this amazing power to reset the day, he ends up getting himself killed repeatedly and restarting the day multiple times to learn how the stop the invasion and get everything right. Emily Blunt plays Rita, one of Cage's comrades who assists him in the mission against the alien onslaught. <br/><br/>Directed by Doug Limon who produced the Bourne series, with the exception the fourth installment with Jeremy Renner, Edge of Tomorrow is a rare science-fiction actioner that manages to come up with something original, which not many sci-fi flicks nowadays do. Based on the tag line ""Live, Die, Repeat"", this film plays as a cross between Independence Day (1996) and Groundhog Day (1993) with the main character fighting against an army of aliens, while carrying the ability to restart the day over and over. Tom Cruise's character does die quite a bit in this movie. Halfway through the film, we experience a montage of his character and Emily Blunt's character training for the invasion, whenever Cruise makes a mistake Blunt would pull her gun and shoot him so he could wake up start over. This happens countless times and although it does get a bit repetitive after a while as you watch some of the same scenes countless times, the idea is nonetheless interesting. The special effects are fantastic and I can definitely say the same for the visual effects. The CGI on the aliens are incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully shot.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow can easily be called one of the best sci-fi films of this decade so far. I was very pleased with this movie, not just because of its special effects and visuals, but also because it expresses an original and inventive idea."
"bryank-04844","9","1","3","17 August 2015"," 'Edge of Tomorrow' is highly entertaining and is an excellent addition to the sci-fi genre. I can't wait to watch it again on repeat.
","I'm very glad that the science-fiction genre is back and doing very well these days. The more sci-fi in theaters, the better. And we have what seems a pretty good lineup this summer of movies that involve everything you could want in a science-fiction film. Here to start off June 2014 is 'Edge of Tomorrow', formally titled 'All You Need Is Kill', which is based on the 2004 novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka of the same name. Director Doug Liman ('Swingers', 'Go', 'The Bourne Identity') took a swing at this $178 million dollar budget film and hit a home-run.<br/><br/>Although we may have seen similar things in different sci-fi films before, this film feels fresh and original with its great script, good performances, and amazing special effects. One could say that this is like the movie 'Groundhog Day' but with an apocalyptic alien invasion backdrop thrown in that stars Tom Cruise. And let's face it, if Tom Cruise is in the film, you can rest assure that he will save the day, the planet, the solar system, and the universe. The guy just gets things done.<br/><br/>We follow a man named Cage (Cruise), who is a military officer journalist who is in charge of convincing the human race that we need to send as many people to war to take out this vicious alien race that has attached our planet and left major cities in utter ruin and millions dead. These aliens are called Mimics, and they look amazing and evil in all the right ways. Their bodies look metallic and have many tentacle like arms and spears. They can move at lightning speed and are super strong. These aliens look like a futuristic killer octopus hyped up on the best speed that money can buy. They can be killed, but it takes some fairly impressive firepower to do so. Needless to say, the Mimics are winning the battle.<br/><br/>After a rough talk with the head general (Brendan Gleeson), Cage finds himself demoted to Private and is about to be shipped off to the literal front line of a full scale attack on the Mimics. Even with a full metal robotic endo-skeleton for armor, Cage only lasts a few seconds in battle when he is dropped off (Normandy Beach style), as he has never seen combat or used a weapon before. However, after he is killed by a different looking Mimic, he awakens the day before when he is demoted to Private and has the same conversations with his new officer Master Sergeant Farell (a hilarious Bill Paxton). Everything happens the same exact way, but when he dies, he loops back to waking up at the military base and demoted.<br/><br/>A woman named Rita (Emily Blunt), realizes what Cage is going through and asks him to find her when he wakes up again. Rita is the literal poster child for bucking up, becoming a badass, and killing Mimics, as her face is on every bus and billboard around, telling people to sign up for the military. Once Cage and Rita meet up, they figure out that the only way to win this alien war is to kill the head Mimic called the Omega, which is very similar to Vampire lore. So the film plays out like 'Groundhog Day' with Cage learning and going further into finding the Omega each day, but is always met with death on the beach, thus repeating each day.<br/><br/>Watching a movie that loops over and over can get tedious, but Doug Liman and his editors did a flawless job in keeping things fresh and non-redundant. At no point in time did I say to myself, ""Here we go again with this."" Instead, we got different perspectives and comical moments from Paxton and Cruise. It was nice to see Cruise ""not know how to fight"", at least for a little while here and was met with some good laughs. There are some small nit-picky things I can go into and pick apart, but they are so minor, I'm not going to bother, although I did think the overall ending was wrapped up too nicely with a pretty bow, which is something that recent Tom Cruise movies have a lot of.<br/><br/>The special effects are a mix of practical and CG and look very impressive. This proves that Liman can take on a blockbuster budget action film and succeed. I only hope that it makes its money back, because it deserves too. 'Edge of Tomorrow' is highly entertaining and is an excellent addition to the sci-fi genre. I can't wait to watch it again on repeat."

It is an exceptionally well concept to me, looping in time during a war. It makes for a riveting watching experience because of the time looping, you're engaged and zoned in to the movie as soon as that starts, there are however some inexplicable things about the movie, like how did they force him into combat after only being tased? Did I miss something? He gets tased then all the sudden he's been transported to the war in France.

Repeat. The slogan is so very apt and succinct, capturing the essence of the film, and yet eliciting imagination about the plot. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" wastes no time in story telling. Within thirty seconds from the start, we are already being told about the major catastrophe. Then, the cycle happens quickly and repeatedly, yet the repetitive cycle does not feel cumbersome because of great editing. Every time it repeats, it tells less of the previous parts and adds a little more information. The story is just brilliant because it combines various science fiction elements into one, and it works very well. It captivates me throughout the two hours. I really enjoyed watching it."
"friendly_poison","Null","1","3","7 March 2015"," Rearing Starship Troopers with Groundhog Day and introduce Aliens to the playpen. It blasts the doors off. WITH GUSTO!
","From the offset of hearing about this film in trailers, posters and here in fact, in IMDb. It did look like something I thought would be seen, forgotten and in a bargain bin in HMV within the first year of its DVD release. Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>The story is, Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage, As high ranking official in an army who are faced off with a seemingly unbeatable Alien race, intent on conquering Earth. Cage, who has never seen a single day of active combat is stripped of his rank for insubordination by his commanding officer and thrown into a barracks where he, and a ragtag platoon of soldiers (including an ever charismatic Bill Paxton) are thrust into what appears to be a suicide mission. Meeting the Alien army head on in combat. After being killed, Cage inexplicably awakens the morning of the battle with his memories and combat experience intact. Enlisting the aid of Emily Blunt, hardened Special Forces Soldier, Rita Vrataski. Cage begins a race against time quest to win this battle and bring victory for the Human Race.<br/><br/>The thing with Edge of Tomorrow, going in for me, was that it took me by surprise in a completely unexpected fashion. On the surface, Edge has the face of a Sci Fi action thriller that, I later found out was an Americanizd version of a manga entitled 'All You Need Is Kill'. The image of a sword wielding Emily Blunt on the poster is a reminder of the comic bookish stylisation that runs throughout. The mech style armour suits worn by the characters and the high tech weapondry holds a certain sense of Iron Mongers vs Plantlife in the organic looking Alien creatures.<br/><br/>In short, Edge of Tomorrow is a new cult favourite of mine and I'm sure is up there in may other lists too. Around half way though, the film introduces an almost supernatural feel with the biological implications of the Aliens DNA on Cruise's character, causing the day restarts. The ways that the script handles the template of the 'Groundhoggish' support is innovative and continues on throughout by upping the stakes. Just when you think the films plot strands have run their course, a new route to the end goal is discovered and is implemented and evolved. Much the same as Cage, who begins the film as a cowardly deserter and is forged by Rita with a hammer into a Warrior who carries the weight of humanity on his ever growing shoulders.<br/><br/>A true, new age sci fi epic. Not to be missed! -FP"
"brianberta","7","1","3","26 February 2015"," Much better then I expected
","This is a great movie which is well-acted, funny, and creative. Its plot revolves around a man put into combat without any training. He's killed within minutes but an alien gives him the opportunity to relive the day over and over in a time loop. He then has to figure out how to stop the alien invasion. Every time he's killed, he learns a bit more and advances a little more. The film offers likable characters. Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise do a great job acting. The film offers some comedic moments to give you a break from the action sequences. This film offers enough surprises and plot twists to keep you entertained. The reason this only gets a 4 out of 5 is because the ending is predictable. The movie tries to play it safe putting in a happy ending but it falls flat because of its choice. Despite this flaw, the film offers enough to keep sci-fi and action fans entertained. Just don't expect it to be revolutionary or decade-defining when watching it and then you should enjoy it. This movie represents what Michael Bay should have been."
"jpmccart","8","1","3","17 November 2014"," Edge of Tomorrow
","Very often, if Tom Cruise is present, it almost guarantees an interesting movie. And it did in the case of Edge of Tomorrow. Directed by Doug Liman, (The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Edge of Tomorrow has all the elements of a good, if not great, movie.<br/><br/>It's mandatory to get the Groundhog Day (1993) comparison out of the way, as the plot follows soldier Bill Cage (Tom Cruise) who repeatedly dies and relives a day (apparently his first in combat) repeatedly. He also seems to have no training, and continues to repeat the cycle until he encounters Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) a famous solider who has experienced the same phenomenon. <br/><br/>The opening montage of news networks did not set up the plot entirely clearly, and I wasn't a fan of this style of opening in I am Legend (2007) as much as say, simple titles to state the current situation. The plot is familiar: aliens invade earth, and the world needs to fight back. However, an interesting twist of reliving the same day each time Cage dies, given to him by the invaders, makes the plot much more interesting. <br/><br/>Regardless of our suspension of disbelief, it almost is believable, considering the fact that the invaders come from space, coupled with Einstein's theory of relativity, that aliens from outer space would be able to see the future and twist time as they do in the film. <br/><br/>The film draws comparisons between itself and WWII (landing on the beaches of France, a possible invasion of London from the other side, and the fact that the aliens land in Germany and fight outward across Europe). Perhaps the screenwriters (Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and novelist Hiroshi Sakurazaka). wanted to use the plot to convey situations and emotions faced by soldiers in WWII, including the alliance of nations, and the chaos of battle at Normandy. <br/><br/>The continuous repeating day provides some comic relief, as Cage is able to recite word-for-word what people are about to say before they say it, dodge punches before people throw them, and so on. The editing was well done where the scenes allow the audience to see the repeating day and understand how Cage is able to learn from the previous day's experiences, but do not linger so long as to bore or irritate the audience. <br/><br/>As for the cinematography, some point-of-view shots add to the feeling of confusion and immediate danger as Cage struggles with his suit and weapons, accidentally choosing a foreign language for the instructions, and frantically scrambles to figure out how to reload his weapons. <br/><br/>Overall, Edge of Tomorrow will not disappoint. While it is not necessarily a groundbreaking film, it is a solid movie with an interesting plot, good acting, and good visuals. It is about all that I felt it would be before I watched it, and perhaps even a little more."

","***Might contain Spoilers***<br/><br/>I wasn't so excited to watch this movie. I didn't even care about the movie at all. I went to watch Transformers : Age of Extinction (the movie sucked) and saw the posters of Edge of Tomorrow. Even then, I didn't care because I don't like Tom Cruise. I avoid him whenever I can. However when I read the plot on IMDb , I decided to watch the movie and I was blown away. If you have already watched Groundhog day then you wont face difficulties in understanding the movie.<br/><br/>Its a great concept but the difference is that aliens (Omega) have the capability to control time. They sense the danger and whenever an Alpha alien dies, the Omega resets the time so save him. Tom cruise kills an alpha and dies with him but it gives him the power as Aplha's blood gets mixed with tom's blood. So now Tom is acting like an alpha and every time tom dies, Omega resets the time thinking that its an alpha.<br/><br/>Humans are fighting a war with these aliens but they wont be able to win as the aliens know that they are going to attack (time loops). now its tom's task to kill the omega so that they wont be able to control time and humans can kill them. The full metal Bi**c helps him. <br/><br/>So basically its a great movie which is so different from the sci-fi movies that I have seen in recent times.."
"Turfseer","7","1","3","3 November 2014"," Despite hokey premise, 'Alien' meets Groundhog Day as Cruise delivers in entertaining sci-fi action-adventure
","There are a number of reasons why 'Edge of Tomorrow', a Tom Cruise sci- fi action-adventure vehicle, did quite well at the box office in 2014. Primarily it's the overall concept: a 'Groundhog Day' mixed with the alien invasion genre.<br/><br/>Cruise adopts a variation of the 'Bill Murray' role, playing a former advertising executive turned public relations officer for the US Army, and assigned to a United Nations-like 'United Defense Army', who have been entrusted with the difficult task of battling a bunch of nasty aliens who have taken over almost the entire European continent.<br/><br/>Cruise plays 'Major' William Cage and he's similar to the narcissistic Phil Connors in 'Groundhog Day'. Both must go through the trial of time repeating itself before they develop the insight to change their personalities. Connors' character flaw that he must overcome, is misanthropy; Cage, on the other hand, must overcome not only his lack of competence as a soldier, but his 'cowardice'. It's General Brigham who sees through Cage's phoniness and lack of bravery right away and has him arrested after an escape attempt; as punishment, Cage is stripped down to the rank of private, and finds himself assigned to a forward operating unit at Heathrow Unit in London, about to be shipped off the battlefield on the French beaches.<br/><br/>Cage ends up under the charge of Master Sergeant Farrell who bullies him continually after learning that he's labeled as a 'deserter'; Cage meets the various soldiers, who he ends up fighting with against the aliens on the beaches of France. Cage is petrified as he's parachuted down on to the field of battle. Before being almost immediately killed by one of the aliens (called Alphas, larger aliens who command the foot soldiers, the Mimics), he meets Sgt. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who tells him to seek her out, when he 'wakes up'.<br/><br/>The film becomes much more engrossing and entertaining when Cage suddenly wakes up and finds himself back at Heathrow and being escorted once again by Sergeant Farrell to meet the same fellow soldiers he met before. He realizes he's in some kind of time loop but doesn't know why. In order to meet up with Sgt. Vrataski, he must find a way to escape from his platoon and there's some comedy thrown in when he tries to sneak underneath a truck and gets crushed, only to have Sgt. Farrell quip, ""What the hell were you thinking?"" But after getting killed, we see Cage make a second attempt going under the truck, and this time he makes it.<br/><br/>Cage hooks up with Vrataski who puts him through a grueling training course to learn how to successfully navigate his way through the battlefield against the mimics. Each time he fails, she finishes him off with a bullet from her gun and he goes through the same training, eventually perfecting his craft as a warrior.<br/><br/>Vrataski also introduces Cage to Dr. Carter who explains how he came to acquire the power to continually to go through the time loops. The explanation proves that the film's premise is not grounded in science but rather fantasy—so for those Ingmar Bergman aficionados out there, do not be disappointed if this explanation doesn't turn out to be 'rocket science'. Cage ended up getting sprayed by the blood of an Alpha after he killed it in battle and somehow, since the Alphas are hooked into the hive mind, the Omega (who controls the time looping ability), that somehow allows him to take over the Omega's fantastic power. This power can only become undone if one ends up getting a blood transfusion (which is exactly what happened to Vrataski before, when she was wounded on the battlefield and brought to a field hospital!).<br/><br/>Obviously getting too caught up in analyzing the pseudo-science behind the whole time-looping premise, will only detract from the enjoyable machinations to come. Cage, now fully a 'battle machine', has been clued in about the Omega's visions, which may lead him to where the 'queen bee' is hiding. After several scenarios on the beach where Vrataski keeps getting killed, he decides to proceed inland himself, but discovers that the Omega hiding out at a German dam, is only a ruse.<br/><br/>The plot now thickens when Cage, Vrataski and Carter decide to lift a 'prototype' which has been developed at the Ministry of Defense, to locate the Omega. That seems rather convenient but there's enough 'action' along the way, to keep your interest. And this is when Cage is injured and ends up getting a blood transfusion, losing his power to reset each day.<br/><br/>The climax is slightly anti-climactic. Cage of course finds out where the Omega is hiding (under the Louvre of all places!) and must destroy the big blob in order to disconnect the rest of the interconnected Alphas and Mimics. This whole idea of an interconnected hive, tied to a controlling 'brain' (and forcing the good guys to destroy it) has been done ad infinitum. Cases in point: the Borg series in Star Trek: Next Generation (with the 'brain' taking over the body of Picard and now calling himself 'Locutus') and 'Vikki', the chief operating system in 'I Robot'.<br/><br/>Since Cage gets splattered with the Omega's blood after it explodes, he gets one more reset. This time he wakes up where it's announced that a 'power surge' in Paris causes a cessation in all alien activity—the threat is neutralized. Cage is now back being a major and meets Vrataski, who of course, doesn't recognize him. <br/><br/>In addition to the enjoyable plot and pulsating electronica score, 'Edge of Tomorrow' features some neat battle suit designs (based on real-world exoskeleton initiatives), as if appropriated from an 'apocalyptic' Mad Max set. Kudos to Mr. Cruise for the excellent stunts. 'Edge' maintains its edge despite the hokey premise and a few clichés along the way. Definitely worth a look!"
"omairajmal2007","9","1","3","29 October 2014"," Truly a marvelous movie and a rare find. Must watch.
","Im unable to understand the critics panning this movie and also the relatively low domestic revenue this movie generated. This movie from the start to finish is simply amazing and a true gem. Strong story, good acting will keep you glued to the seat and how can you not like Emily Blunt. Tom Cruise has proved once again why studios are so willing to cast him in their movies. I will never understand the hatred shown by critics when it comes to his movies. Critics are simply irrelevant and unimportant and they kinda know this too. They need to bash some one or pick on someone and call majority of the movies bad otherwise they would out of business. If you look at the critics you realize all of them are average joes, average looking people with average lives. Most likely bullied in their past because of their appearances. They harbor inferiority complexes and anger which they sublime using the term being a critic. Movie critics are frequently wrong when it comes to rating movies simply because one critics cannot judge the taste of millions of people who will be watching this movie. So most of the critics are still stuck in 1950s and 60's and still raving Citizen Kane. This movie is simply an amazing watch and in no WAY less than citizen Kane or its likes. What critics don't understand is how difficult and hard is it these days to produce and make a movie with all the CGI, work and preparation. It was far easy to make movies in 1950s so it probably took 1/100th of the work to produce citizen Kane than this movie so stop bashing good movies like this for no reason."
"xamtaro","10","1","3","29 October 2014"," Tip of the Spear, Edge of the Knife, Crack of my.........
","Based on the Japanese novel ""All you need is Kill"", EDGE OF TOMORROW is a gripping character focused tale that gives a fun fresh edgy spin to a tried and true sic/fi premise. Remember those impossibly difficult video games where you just keep dying only to restart the game in frustration, get past that part where you last died and then die again? The cycle repeats and only through learning from past missteps can you outmaneuver your enemies and make it to the end. It is all a video game to us, but for the unfortunate Ex-Major William Cage, it is looping nightmare.<br/><br/>An alien species called the Mimics have landed. Inhumanly fast, vicious and able to outsmart human attack plans at every turn, Mimic forces threaten to overwhelm the world starting with Europe, until A mysterious victory at Verdun spurs the military's confidence in the one man army exoskeleton called ""the jacket"". If one woman, Rita Vertasky, could master the ""jacket"" within a few days of the victory at Verdun, then a legion of similarly equipped soldiers would stand a chance against the mimics. So begins a massive counteroffensive on the coasts of Europe which ends disastrously for former PR officer turned forced conscript William Cage (Tom Cruise).......until he wakes up 24 hours before the invasion at the start of his conscription.<br/><br/>What follows is an intense ""groundhog day"" style war story. True to the movie tagline, Cage lives, dies and repeats the day each time, and each time, he discovers more about the mimics and his mysterious ability. To change the future of mankind, Cage has to continually enlist the help of Rita Vertasky, the angel of Verdun, to train him and ultimately help him take down this alien menace.<br/><br/>In playing against type, Tom Cruise shines as the cowardly Cage whom we discover is all brave talk and no action. His performance is earnest and nuanced, lending weight to the more tragic scenes of Cage experiencing the deaths of those close to him over and over again. Equally nuanced is the tough as nails ""angel of verdun"" Rita Vertasky played by Emily Blunt. The emotionally captivating script conveys a beautiful heroes journey for Cage where he grows and learns following each cycle. Peppered throughout is the kind of dark humour which would make Paul Verhoven proud. Bill Paxton channels Lee Emery from Full Metal Jacket and delivers the best drill sergeant jerk face character in recent years. <br/><br/>Through the use of the time loop gimmick, this movie is able to deliver intense thrills and real chills. The irony is in how unpredictable the plot becomes by fooling its audience into the illusion of predictability with its premise. Just as you start to feel ""safe"" that Cage can overcome any problem by just dying and looping back with renewed knowledge, new twists are thrown in and this heightens the stakes; feel of peril when Cage is suddenly caught off guard has never felt more dangerous. It helps that the antagonistic ""mimics"" are possibly the most ""alien"" alien threat that we have seen in a while.<br/><br/>They are a mess of glass-like inhuman appendages with gaping maws that glow fiery red. They are a whipping blur and always seem out of phase with time and space, spectacularly brought to life with cutting edge special effects. While many shots were done on location, one would be hard pressed to tell where the actual location ends and the special effects begin. Those into mecha would definitely be captivated by the exo-suits worn by the human soldiers which harken back to the story's Japanese roots. <br/><br/>All this aside, Edge of Tomorrow is a lot smarter than it seems at first. It deconstructs clichés and may even be seen as a parody of an audience's expectations when they see a movie. Each loop Cage experiences is slightly different and he fails when he expects only the same formula and is caught off guard by new surprises. In a way, movie audiences feel most ""safe"" in a clichéd movie. Look at the highest grossing blockbusters worldwide and you can see this proof. In the same way, here is a movie that is built on cliché: the time loop, jerk face drill sergeant, world war two Normandy landing ripoff, special effects laden combat etc. Yet these clichés are handled smart and they are delivered spectacularly. <br/><br/>Many have called this the movie Starship Troopers should have been. I for one come away with joy and hope seeing how wonderfully Hollywood has adapted a Japanese light novel especially after mediocre results adapting manga and Japanese movies. There are many such novels just waiting to be adapted into blockbuster films: the high school espionage thriller with mechs ""Full Metal Panic"", the post apocalyptic vampire tale ""Trinity Blood"", and of course the Gothic science fiction horror that is ""Vampire Hunter D"". <br/><br/>Watch this, savour this, and repeat. Edge of Tomorrow is easily the biggest surprise hit of 2014."
"admullen","8","1","3","25 October 2014"," An actually intelligent action movie with good acting... a pleasant surprise
","I'll admit it. I did not have high hopes for this movie. Based on the trailer, I thought it would just be some mindless explosion movie. I was pleasantly surprised when it proved me wrong. I think the actors did very good jobs portraying all of the parts, the plot twists actually tend to be pretty surprising (except for the ending- that was pretty predictable), and there weren't so many explosions or shaky camera that you couldn't tell who is dying and who is killing who. Overall, I think it was an excellent movie. Now, onto the couple flaws. First off, it's main idea is a complete and total ripoff of Groundhog Day (another excellent movie). It changed it enough to be original, so I'm not too mad. Second, they made it blatantly obvious that Cage was going to get a blood transfusion at some terribly inconvenient time, so that is another ""twist"" that most people saw coming. And third, everybody's heroic sacrifices kind of lose their meaning when legitimately everybody survives. Overall though, I think it was a great action movie with a good story and character development, not some Transformer-esqe explosion fest."
"p-jonsson","7","1","3","24 October 2014"," Surprisingly enjoyable
","I have to say that this movie was surprisingly enjoyable. I did have my doubts about it. I always have doubts about movies that manipulate time. I guess one advantage the movie has is that it does not really involve time travel and changing the past to influence the future but ""only"" resetting a day and living it over and over again.<br/><br/>The entire concept is of course still totally ludicrous. Even if we forget about the feasibility about resetting time altogether there are just so many things that are wrong with the concept. For example, is time reset all over the universe or just on Earth? Both of those avenues create their own issues further down the line of course. Even if we try to forget these larger issues there are the issue that as soon as Cage altered his own behavior from one repetition of that day to another he would alter the chain of events and what he knew was the events in the previous repeat would no longer be certain in the one he was living right then. Not to mention that he had a longer and longer chain of people to convince on a single day and still get the job done.<br/><br/>Okay, enough harping about that. If you manage to lock out all these annoying issues with the story what remains is, as I wrote before, actually a fairly enjoyable movie. It is primarily a science fiction action movie of course and the action as well as special effects are not bad at all. We get treated to plenty of the classical déjà vu scenes were Cage tries to convince people by predicting their immediate future in minute details. Classical and very not innovative but well done and I have to admit that I am a bit of a sucker for these impress-and-surprise someone scenes. On the whole the movie managed to use the basic concept of reliving the day and make it feel reasonable fresh despite it not being a entirely new idea. The fact that the acting was quite adequate and that both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt made a good performance as far as I am concerned of course helped.<br/><br/>Naturally the movie builds up towards the climactic battle against the alien central organism and of course everyone (who Cage managed to convince) have to throw in their lives to get Cage in position for the final attack. Personally I liked the ending although I have to say that I was a bit miffed that the writer did not manage to come up with some more imaginative ending scene between Cage and Rita though.<br/><br/>Bottom line, an enjoyable movie well worth watching."

The movie is intelligent and hilarious in equal amounts; Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton are excellent in their supporting roles. The movie progresses in a serious and contemplative direction in the second half; wish it had gone for a darker ending instead of a cheesily happy one.<br/><br/>Dying again-and-again and coming back to the same day may seem like an advantage, but it's quite a painful ordeal. And being the only one to sustain the memory of all the events (through every death) is even more painful.<br/><br/>The special effects are incredible, the sound effects and background score are well in tone with the film, and humour is used quite efficiently to tell the story.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's character is different from his usual ones, and quite funny, and it's interesting to see his character grow.

While I do dislike how American films based on Japanese mango or films lose the darkness that make their Japanese counterparts so great, this is one movie that I enjoyed seeing the writers take some creative liberties with it. I went in hoping for the best (cause let's be honest Tom Cruise has been pretty good as of late with his flicks) and got even better.

And boy, was I pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>What I liked about this movie was that the center/core of the story focuses on the time concept of rewinding time. It illustrates the grim bleakness of a losing war and the potential human beings have when they can retry a battle countless times. The aliens are but an enemy - a figure representing an unknown opposing force. <br/><br/>Both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt delivered their roles wonderfully. I liked how Tom Cruise's character Bill Cage was originally a coward who tried to do whatever it takes to get out of fighting. I liked how he was forced into this war and by sheer chance got his time travel ability which is a hope for mankind. I liked that this cowardly guy who was forced into action is a departure from Cruise's usual confident, action- ready guy. <br/><br/>All in all an awesome summer movie. Go see it!"

","Tom Cruise may not get much respect these days but, for my money, he's one of the most consistent actors that delivers entertaining movies. I can't recall the last Cruise movie I disliked. This one's a fun, smart sci-fi action movie. Parts of it remind me of other movies like Groundhog Day and Starship Troopers but it never strays into rip-off territory. Cruise is in top form. You either like him or you don't. Nothing about his performance here is likely to change your mind about him. Emily Blunt is beautiful, which seems to be a point of contention for some who feel she's too attractive for the role. One wonders if these same people have ever said ""that guy's too good-looking to be a believable action hero."" Doubtful. Regardless, she's great in the movie and has good chemistry with Cruise. Bill Paxton has a supporting part but he's always fun. He pretty much steals every scene he has. The action and special effects are good, although the designs for the aliens are a little on the unimaginative side. It isn't a big dumb Michael Bay movie, which I appreciated. The ending of the film won't please everybody but I liked it. It's a summer blockbuster that doesn't assume its audience is full of morons. It's one of the best movies I've seen this year."

","This movie was surprisingly excellent all the way through. I was intrigued by the preview, the reviews and the fact that Tom Cruise rarely makes a stinker. The reason I say 'surprisingly' is because I was expecting a bit more of a formula and perhaps more of that stupid chit chat that Hollywood injects into action movies, when in real life, you'd be running and screaming to save yourself and not having some inane D&M at that same moment. It starts well, gets better and by the last 20 minutes I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat chewing my nails... no mean feat... I've seen that many action pics I didn't think that could happen anymore. If you love really good action sci fi then this is for you, and if you just like a very good movie with great actors then this is for you. This is one I can see again."

","Earth has been invaded and most of Europe has been taken over by a seemingly undefeatable alien foe. A small victory encourages an all- out assault on all front lines; into the middle of this is PR officer Major Cage – out of favor with a superior and finds himself dropped into boot camp as a deserter and forced onto the front line. Killed within minutes along with many others, Cage somehow finds himself walking up at the same point of the day before, stuck in a time loop which resets with each time he is killed. With every day giving him more knowledge and skill, Cage may be able to take the course of the battle.<br/><br/>A very high concept idea doesn't always mean that things will work and it is worth acknowledging the good job that Edge of Tomorrow does in selling us the time-loop idea and throwing us into a world and scenario that is engaging. The idea seems to have its roots in video gaming since it is often the case when playing a game that one progresses through the level by gradually learning from mistakes and getting better at the skills you need. So it is with Cage and the film builds this idea very well at first. With very little background, we join a terrified Cage as he heads to certain death. This aspect is very well done as the battle sequence is brutal but also darkly comic. This rather dark streak continues as Cage makes tiny steps each time, with the repetition being exciting but also a little amusing.<br/><br/>From here a plot starts to form, doing so from a point where the viewer is already engaged by the idea, the action and the effects. It does ultimately end up being less smart, edgy and brave than it seems, but by that point the film has done a lot to get us on board so we stay with it. The action sequences are really well done, and the effects are very impressive – even more so because generally I was caught up in the events rather than looking for the CGI work. Performances are surprisingly good; I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but he is very good here. For the majority of the film he is not a hero or action-hero but rather an arrogant salesman (PR) and he lets us see his terror and confusion for the first half of the film – a key factor in drawing the viewer in. He does end up becoming a more traditional Cruise character, but he justifies getting there. Blunt is also good alongside him and is not just an attractive female sidekick. Support from Gleeson, Paxton, and those in J squad also helps build a convincing world and one that fits well the sci-fi genre without feeling like it is aping it.<br/><br/>I watched this expecting it to be just a professional and expensive action movie and, while it of course is this, it is also a lot better than I expected. The use of humor, violence and action all help to make the concept work, drawing the viewer in really well so that when it does settle down to be more of what you expect, it still works because it already has you. A superior summer blockbuster."

","I saw this movie with a buddy and I was really impressed. I actually just wanted to say that because I know so many people who refuse to see it due to Tom Cruise being the star.<br/><br/>He does a good job in this movie and so does everyone else. Beyond that I don't care about the people in it as I do not know them and believe in freedom of speech.<br/><br/>Also I saw this initially in 2D in the theatre but it was then released in 3D on Blu-ray. I liked it in the theatre, but when I was it in 3D later I thought it really brought out the action sequences and settings even if it's not immediately apparent while you watch it. I went from thinking the action was adequate to being quite impressed by it.<br/><br/>So thank you everybody involved for making such a great movie for me to enjoy"
"cool-an2011","8","1","3","29 September 2014"," Intense , with a short dose of deep drama !
","The Edge of tomorrow is one of the best sci-fi movies i have seen in a long while ! it is an enjoyable experience with a lot of great twists into it.<br/><br/>Now lets begin with the story which is a bit familiar being used in many comedy movies such as ""17 again"" and romantic movies such as ""About time"" and many other movies , and for all i know this is the first movie i see which uses this one for an action-sci fi movie , while i admire this but i think its the biggest downfall of the movie since you kind of can see where the plot is going , yet there were some nice twists around it like the ambush thing when he had seen vision about the ""enigma"".<br/><br/>However the most i liked about the movie that it has less dramatic part and more actionatic part ! which is exactly why you would love it .. unlike other movies that wash up its main idea and focuses on cliché scenarios of human boring love and sacrifice stories , the dramatic scenes and focus is very low in this movie and comes in small short and deep doses -like the kissing scene!- in most movies it would take about half an our to finish the ending scene kiss between the two great antagonists but hey common freaking sense tells us that there is a monster chasing therefore the kiss is clean fast and cut in the middle ! likewise in the rest of the dramatic parts in the movie and i think this is where it succeeds.<br/><br/>there was also a lot of reason in the movie , i kept chasing a cliché breach of common sense as in most action - sci fi movies but i actually couldn't , everything made sense -in the ""movie"" reasoning- thats another reason why i loved it<br/><br/>thats about all , 8\10 ! you won't regret watching this :)."

","Excellent is the word I give for this movie. I just bought a projector at home with Harmon Cardon Speakers connected to my PC. What a class of effects and imagination. Firstly, whatever was done in the movie makes complete sense and if interpreted with special effects, gives more life. The Alien looks scary but still they know what is happening and why. Secondly, Tom Cruise is the only actor who suits the character in this movie itself, well done Tom and hope you will get best actor Oscar soon. I still watch 'Oblivion' on Blue Ray during weekends. I just want to express that this movie is a worth watch for all Sci-Fi fans. What ever they have seen till now in any science fiction, this is surely a boon to your imagination. Just watch it in big Screen I am sure you will get bumps during alien attacks."
"stuart_davies","10","1","3","25 September 2014"," Damn! damn! damn! Tom Cruise does it again!
","How does Tom Cruise do it? Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, The Last Samurai, War of the Worlds, Oblivion and now Edge of Tomorrow. I've had a begrudging admiration for him since I saw him Top Gun which I thought was cheesier than Wotsits. Yet here he is in a belter of a movie, producing a well crafted, believable Cage character with wonderful acting that maps out the transformation from slimy coward to purposeful soldier and finally to deserving hero, with emotion and even comic timing when needed, all the while utilising his obvious talent and boyish good looks to great effect; he makes me sick! Ahem, anyway the story is intelligent, well directed and edited. The acting is marvellous, especially Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. The production is quality, although I would have liked to have seen slower CGI sequences of the aliens in order to appreciate them more in detail. The plot twists are cleverly implemented with lack of prediction and dark humour is nicely woven into what is a story of catastrophe for the human race. Each temporal cycle is a sub-plot of its own that links nicely into the main story, even if the characters reach a practical dead end. The viewer is not spoon fed the story artefacts, so I found delight in speculating where the next cycle would lead. As a scifi fan, for me this is another glorious example of visual storytelling and I can't recommend it enough."

The action set-pieces themselves are really very well done, and like all good big blockbuster movies this is hugely enjoyable throughout, with an interesting, if not entirely faultless plot. The fact that this pulls the Groundhog day trick that as it happens didn't fill every person who went to go see it with a huge groan of boredom is in itself quite an accomplishment.

","Tom cruise, the Akshay Kumar of Hollywood. Literally one of the best movie I have seen in a long time. It's an exceptionally entertaining, consistently humorous, and surprisingly moving story sporting top-notch visual effect. Cruise is better than he's been in a while because he damps down his usual all-intensity-all-the-time MO. He's best here when his character seems the most scared. Some critics have mentioned something like ""we've seen these ideas before"" in other movies. While it's true that there's nothing totally new in this movie per se, that doesn't make the movie less appealing, In my opinion. Emily Blunt also did an amazing job as given the role of Rita Vrataski , Guiding and helping Cruise to fight against aliens but OFC its Tom Cruise who gets all the credit because who are we kidding, Its Tom Freaking Cruise."

Of course there were memorable scenes and memorable lines, but I'm not gonna put them here, I'll let the readers think what were those memorable scenes & lines.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise tries on new genres and seems to be great at them.

","I don't need tell you the basic plot, you should've already read it, and I'm not one for writing spoilers about what happens and who does what etc, so the following is basically just my summary.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, this film ticks all the boxes that make it into my list of films I'll watch more than once (and it's not a big collection).<br/><br/>It's not a film that completely hinges solely on big plot twists, which is good in my opinion, it means it doesn't rely on you not knowing whats going to happen to keep your interest.. +1 for re-watchability! The scattered moments of comedy are nicely subtle... they don't try too hard to be funny.<br/><br/>To use the word ""action"" to describe it, I feel wouldn't do this film justice, I've seen a lot of bad films described as being ""packed full of action""... so, if you're going to take any summary from this, this film is ""packed full of energy"" that will keep you hooked from the very start to the very end.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it :p"
"Slackshank","9","1","3","5 August 2014"," Success of movie
","Cruise does one of his best performances. I really haven't been noticing before how he can take lot of more than the ""Top Gun"" gestures. The selection for the female main role is a shame. This actress, Blunt, is unknown to me and didn't convince her skills of acting. Paxtons lightweight side role is a nice tune-up (better than the one in The Colony).<br/><br/>Movie contains lot of humor which is intellect and works very well as situational comedy. As a matter of fact the movie offers much better content of comedy than most of the todays comedies that get the to see the daylight even in theaters.<br/><br/>Very nice movie, if you love sci-fi, action, comedy and little bit drama, this will surely be enjoyable film. Remember; these are movies and not to be taken seriously, you're missing the joy of the entertainment then."
"i_ianchev","9","1","3","2 August 2014"," At the edge of a concept
","I personally think that ""Edge of tomorrow""is a very smart, funny and entertaining movie. But that's not its main value - the script is the best thing about it...<br/><br/>There are already many movies about time loops. And some of them are brilliant (remember ""Groundhog day""?). So Edge of tomorrow had to be good to break through its predecessors. And it does in a very fresh and innovative way. The story is originally Japanese (of course!) - from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's ""All You Need Is Kill"". So they had a good start even before shooting this picture. But the transition from book to finished script is also very good. The new imported details are pretty decent, considering what has been presented to us in the recent years by the film industry. It took some 2-3 years to finish this movie and boy did Tom Cruise do a good job! It is incredible how Emily Blunt is incorporated in this movie as the second main hero. Both main characters are developed very well and I would like to add that they have incredible chemistry on screen. This should also mean that the director of this movie (Doug Liman) has done this time a what he should have done with ""Jumper"" before, for example.<br/><br/>Anyway, I should move on. I think that the graphics and the creatures' design are indeed cool and interesting for us viewers. Recently the aliens concepts in movies were rather dumb I should say. So a straight A goes to the designers behind this project. Besides - the camera is swinging perfectly between scenes and the colors and lighting are matching perfectly the mood you as a viewer have to feel. So from technical point of view - the film is incredibly entertaining. <br/><br/>About the whole structure of this sci-fi action movie - I think that many people will see it only as a very good entertainment piece. But the reason why so many viewers will like this movie has roots in the relationship between the main two characters and the interesting concepts of time repeat, life-death situations, the meaning of war, and of course the greatest concept of them all - inevitability. This word for me represents the reason why so many people relate to this film. That is because we all feel the same way as Tom Cruise's character in this movie at many moments in our lives. We all have this feeling of not being able to escape from certain situations or certain course of events. For good or bad, we as humans tend to believe that we have only one chance, only one life, only one true choice. But the truth is that we don't need to stiffen that much about this. If we do what we feel is right, the outcome will always be OUR outcome, no matter if it is what is expected or not. <br/><br/>So much like the feeling of fulfillment this film piece is giving us the sense of completion at the end of the movie. This is the same with every good movie."
"AshutoshD","8","1","3","2 August 2014"," Well crafted story and a return to top action hero form for Cruise
","It really is Groundhog day mets Source code. Not just because of the construct of the film. but also because it manages to infuse action and comedy very nicely. Tom cruise's character development from a snivelly marketing guy to an action hero is really well done. Also his chemistry with Emily Blunt is amazing without the dramatic romantic overtones. My only criticism would be that the ending could have been better and much less soft and slightly.Even the fact that other actors don't feature prominently other than Cruise and Blunt works because they are both superb in this movie All in all I was really surprised with this smart, zippy action thriller with subtle comedic touches."

","I don't have too much to say about Edge of Tomorrow, other than I'm pretty pleased. The concept is original and developed, the lead characters are likable and 3-dimensional, the pacing is excellent, and it even stole a few laughs from my theater.<br/><br/>Minor issues - I wasn't a big fan of any character besides Cruise's and Blunt's. Their only role was to supply additional guns for the ending. The Magic 2014 Slivers are interesting, but almost too kinetic. Its difficult to grasp how they're beating the humans in combat. Projectiles are fired at Earth's forces, but I couldn't guess how the Mimics are firing them. Cannons? From their mouths? I don't think we ever see them shoot on screen.<br/><br/>Its a good action film, fresh and ""smart"" (for the lack of a better word). Its a fine rental."
"keyos27","8","1","3","26 July 2014"," Turning a foreign novel into a Hollywood film succeeds
","The trailer of Edge of Tomorrow, starring the well-known actor and the actress whose career is quite remote from a combat movie fiercely facing uncanny-looking enemies on muddy soil under a barrage of explosions looks indeed cliché and unoriginal to me. However, the fact is this screenplay is actually based on the military science fiction light novel, written by a Japanese author, Hiroshi Sakurazaka. And the movie takes me by surprise with a unique sense of humor and stunning visuals.<br/><br/>Having said that, adapting a successful novel into a screenplay does not always guarantee the efficacy either. A careful observation and nifty editing skill to keep the originality is a must. Also, when it comes to foreign novels, compulsory changes need to be made so that a wide range of audiences can embrace the contents without misunderstanding. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, the crew is able to not only westernize it well but also make the film effectively succinct. Emily Blunt's role as Rita Vrataski, the chief of the Special Forces pans out as her usual toughness and charismatic demeanor is shown professionally despite this being her first heroine as a warrior. Watching her wielding the gigantic Tomahawk is quite impressive. Tom Cruise as usual, stands out by playing the protagonist with various emotions. And the stage of becoming from a coward major with no battling experiences to a reckless and competent solider is neither over-the-top nor under-performed. <br/><br/>One thing that disappoints me is not being able to see the details of the mimics, the robotic creatures that resemble octopus-looking aliens with a chain of metallic arms that slice or throw human forces out. It is hard to identify what they are really capable of due to the fast- paced battle scenes. But that really does not matter because the story keeps getting interesting as it moves forward. <br/><br/>As this film contains a series of iteration, it may look confusing for some people. However, I can't not think of any other counterparts that explain the theory of the time loop better than this one. I also highly recommend everyone to check out the manga/comic book version of ""Edge of Tomorrow"", which is called ""All You Need Is Kill."" There are no spoilers but fresh looks with a different style to enjoy."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","23 July 2014"," Recharing alien invasion sci fi with some clever batteries
","Imagine Bill Murray's suicide scenes from ""Groundhog Day"" as a futuristic science-fiction movie and you (sorta) have the groundwork for ""Edge of Tomorrow."" High (yet familiar) in concept, ""Tomorrow"" puts a needed twist on alien invasion films, succeeding by telling a story much narrower in scope yet still big in terms of storytelling stakes.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, rolling with sci fi yet again after last year's solidly entertaining ""Oblivion"" stars as Major Cage, a high-ranking officer for the United Defense Force, a global military power created in the wake of an alien invasion that has seen Europe taken over by ""Mimics,"" extremely dangerous beast-insect hybrids with a penchant for world-conquering. Against his will, Cage (who has never seen combat) is dropped off at UDF's Heathrow Airport base on the eve of a massive military operation. The operation is quickly compromised the morning of the battle, and Cage dies, but somehow he wakes up the day before. He dies again in battle, and wakes up again, and the cycle continues. He eventually discovers he has harnessed the enemy's ability to reset time, and he must use it to defeat them.<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" resembles Ducan Jones' ""Source Code"" only it swaps out thriller/mystery elements for straightforward action. ""Tomorrow"" has no twists or surprises, but it makes its way from plot point to plot point with enough panache to keep your blood pumping. Writer Christopher McQuarrie along with Jez and John-Henry Butterworth have crafted a basic three-act film that wouldn't necessitate applause under normal circumstances, but under time alteration and a complex sci-fi context circumstances, that's neat and tight work.<br/><br/>Whereas one might expect the film to take a misstep or step back in the second act after the novelty of the time-altering premise wears off, ""Tomorrow"" doesn't. The screenplay's million-dollar device here is to play with how much the audience knows, shifting from complete knowledge in the first act to keeping us in the dark the second. As Emily Blunt's Rita, a soldier who was the hero of a previous battle with the Mimics, factors more into the story, the movie begins showing the action from her perspective instead of Cage's, as if the events on screen have happened multiple times already but we don't know it. It's a drastically different form of suspense that really works.<br/><br/>Blunt, by the way, continues to shine as a leading actress. Rita is well beyond stereotypes of sci-fi leading ladies, as she's self-determined, a bit of a brute and integral to the plot. Whereas her previous time-traveling effort in ""Looper"" was more supporting, she shares the lead in Cruise after her introduction in this film. Cruise also continues his mini-renaissance of sorts. His name doesn't translate to box-office dollars the way that it used to, but ever since ""Mission Impossible – Ghost Protocol,"" he has reminded everyone why he's one of the best leading men in Hollywood, even at age 52.<br/><br/>In the midst of the many well-functioning elements of ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" it's easy to forget director Doug Liman. The ""Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" director has among Hollywood's most capable action hands when he's working with the right material. He doesn't do anything too flashy but he keeps the action intense and helps the story barrel forward. He has plenty of fun with the repeated sequences, such as a scene when Cage undergoes a painstaking training process and gets killed countless times because he's not the quickest at picking up combat technique.<br/><br/>Great sci fi films change the genre. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" isn't that kind of a film, but it does the next best thing: merge two familiar concepts that have never been put into the same film and present something familiar yet fresh. Rather than going for the giant alien invasion, this story is smaller, more focuses and more intelligent. It could try bigger ideas and bigger concepts on for size, but it does a lot of things very smartly and very well.<br/><br/>~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more"

","The antagonists in this movie, as well as the soldiers' powered suits, are *very* derivative of the bad guys in Heinlein's Starship Troopers, but the story is told well and the characters are good. In particular, I really like the way they treat the women; while this movie doesn't pass the Bechdel Test, the women in it are strong and treated as equals by the men. It does get somewhat predictable, especially near the end. On the other hand, it's told pretty interestingly and there's some neat aspects of time and story compression. You'd have to have some of that -- obviously you don't want to see *every* repeated day in toto -- but it does it in an interesting way."
"PWNYCNY","8","1","3","16 July 2014"," Time looping is not fun.
","Time travel and time loops, two literary contrivances that must be applied with care. In this movie, these contrivances work. It works because of the principal character, Major Cage, played by Tom Cruise. With each loop, more and more information is revealed about Major Cage, who is the subject of the movie. It is an interesting way of telling a story. When the looping stops, no more is learned about Cage and the movie ends, rather predictably, and a predictable ending never helps a movie. The mixture of science fiction and suspense adds to the story, as one wonders what will finally happen to Major Cage. He's a reluctant hero and is caught up in war and in a time travel infundibulum that is reminiscent of Billy Pilgrim's travels in Slaughter House Five and Phil Connors' in Groundhog Day, but without sentimentality or corniness. Yet, one can care about Cage as he struggles to make sense out of what initially is a confusing situation. Tom Cruise succeeds in playing his role well and in carrying the movie."

"Rob_Taylor","8","1","3","12 July 2014"," Fine, fun movie, but with a bad, ""focus group"" ending that almost ruins it.
","So, Tom Cruise seems to have a thing for scifi movies these days and, I have to say, for the most part they are pretty good.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow (EoT), is another such film. Plenty of action and time travel malarkey and an alien invasion smack in the middle of it. Cruise does action rather well and there is plenty of opportunity here, I'm sure, for him to do a lot of his own stunts.<br/><br/>But what do you get for your money? Well, imagine D-Day meets Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day and you'll have a good idea of what to expect. Cruise is the soldier seemingly cursed to repeat the same day over and over. The difference here is that the day resets when he dies, not when he goes to sleep. And he dies a lot, of course. In the process, learning everything about his fellow soldiers and the aliens and how, in fact, to not get killed.<br/><br/>The action set-pieces are well done and there is some originality in them. But essentially, it is one action scene after another, as Cruise tries to find a way to turn the tide of the war against the aliens.<br/><br/>The aliens, as others have observed, bear similarities with the sentinels from the Matrix. However, any indignation at this pseudo-plagiarism quickly vanishes as the action mounts.<br/><br/>Turns out, the aliens can control time, or rather, their leader can. But, in a twist purely designed to set up the premise of the whole movie, that power can be stolen from them by simply killing an ""alpha"", which are aliens connected to the main controlling brain of the invasion. Yeah, I know, it's hokey and it doesn't make sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>So, derivative story, derivative aliens and an alien weakness designed by whoever came up with the aliens in After Earth. So it must be rubbish, right? Actually no. EoT is a fine, fun military scifi adventure that holds together despite its flaws. However, all the fun, action and enjoyment comes perilously close to being ruined by the dumb ending.<br/><br/>See, time travel has a set of rules. Anyone that has watched any amount of scifi knows them well. If you go back in time, you can change the future. This is what Cruise's character Cage is trying to do. Going back to the beginning of the same day in order to find a way to defeat the aliens instead of them defeating us.<br/><br/>But, at the end of the movie, Cage gets to go back once more, after defeating the alien menace. Except, that when he wakes up at that first day, the aliens are still defeated. Wait, that bit hasn't happened yet... so what the movie is trying to sell us is that by changing the future you can change the past...<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but that is just bullshit right there and I can tell you exactly how it came about.<br/><br/>Presumably the ending was deemed to dark if both Tom and his lady-friend soldier get killed at the end. So some morons in a focus group somewhere suggested to the studio that they make the ending happier and more heroic (as if self-sacrifice isn't the noblest thing in the world). So a new ending was shot in which everything turned out fine in the end.<br/><br/>Let me make it clear, I don't dislike the ending because it is happy. I dislike it because it is crappy! Whilst this ending will never come close to being disappointing in the way that say... Blake's 7, or Mass Effect 3, was, it nonetheless made me scowl and glare at the screen.<br/><br/>After adhering to its own rules for the whole film, the ending gleefully throws them away so that idiots with no brain stem can walk out of the movie with a stupid smile on their faces. Unfortunately, those who do possess a nervous system are left feeling cheated and saddened by this sudden, but by no means inevitable, betrayal.<br/><br/>Now, I said the ending almost ruins it and it does. Only the general level of fun and mayhem up to that point saves it. That, and my fervent hope that, much like I Am Legend (which suffered a similar ending for stupid people), there will be an alternative ending cut made available on Bluray/DVD. Perhaps something darker and more noble, or perhaps something that has just been thought out more and not hacked on at the behest of a test audience of popcorn munching primates. That is my hope for this movie.<br/><br/>PLOTHOLE EDIT: So, the alien brain has the power to reset time IF one of the alpha's is killed. So why then, does it not keep an alpha close to hand and have the minor aliens kill it if it is threatened by assassin's such as Tombo and Blondie? Instant reset and then it sets an ambush for them. Without the blood in their veins, they won't remember they've been there before and would repeat everything, allowing brain to kill them handily.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Good scifi action movie made a little sour by the dumb ending, but worth watching nonetheless. Hopefully there'll be an alternate ending on Bluray."
"theicon87","8","1","3","12 July 2014"," 'Edge of Tomorrow' resets the endgame
","Tom Cruise (Mission: Impossible) is an unlikely hero in this sci-fi action thriller. Honestly, I tend to avoid watching Cruise's films for the most part, but this and the Mission:Impossible movies are exceptions. Even though I'm not a fan of Cruise, I can't deny he's in some good features. Edge of Tomorrow picks up informing us of a war that's been waging for five years now against an alien race called Mimics. And we see the human's fighting gear, which like the world, is upgraded and very futuristic, unlike anything you'll see soldiers wearing right now. The gear looks like a combination of the uniforms worn by the Marines in Aliens (1986), with some Elysium (2013), and Iron Man (2008) mixed in.<br/><br/>Cage (Cruise) is a spokesperson for United Defense Forces (UDF), who developed the exoskeleton armor for soldiers now used in the interspecies war. Cage is not trained in combat, nor does he even like the sight of blood. But odds are against him as he's strong-armed into battle. Master Sergeant Farrell (Bill Paxton) insists on not cutting Cage any breaks, as do the rest of the soldiers he's fighting with. Unlike in present time, there is no 'leave no man behind' motto. Instead it's every man for himself, as your own team will steal your weaponry and throw you to the wolves.<br/><br/>After dying several times and returning to life, Cage not only improves his combat skills (and learns how to turn the safety off), but he searches for answers as to how and why this is happening to him. He tries to reason with his fellow warmongers, and explain to them that their landing on the island is an expected attack by the alien race, and he along with all of them gets wiped out. He lives it over and over. But to no avail, because not only does no one believe him, they even resort to duct taping his mouth shut so he'll stop talking. Leaving Cage with no other option, he becomes an even better fighter.<br/><br/>Then, Cage finds Rita (Emily Blunt) who tells him to meet her when he wakes up after dying. When he does, she explains that she used to have his ability to ""reset"" and come back to life, but doesn't anymore. She was injured, and while in the hospital, had a blood transfusion, causing her to lose her ability. We come to learn that Cage being drenched in the blood of an ""Alpha"" (a particularly nasty type of Mimic) is what gave him his ability to repeat time. Time looping is a defense skill the ""Alphas"" have in order to predict their enemies movements in war, allowing them to be one step ahead. Cage can now use their knowledge and technology against them.<br/><br/>Rita explains how dire it is that he hold on to his skill because it allows the humans to form a game plan against the alien race. Cage is also warned that if he gets injured, he should be sure to just die, so he can ""reset"". Getting injured may resort in him being hospitalized and losing his capacity to ""reset"".<br/><br/>The plans description involves Cage dying over and over again, until every detail is roughed out, and they can win the battle with as much ease as possible. It's just like a video game, where you play the same level over and over until you memorize every little detail and eventually beat the level with flying colors. Cage's mission is to find the ""Omega"", a singular consciousness that all of the Mimics are tied to, along with Rita. It has the ability to control time, and then destroy it. But of course nothing goes as smoothly as planned. Things get a bit hairy as they have to complete their battle plan with successful results, and only have one more chance to do so.<br/><br/>Aside from the eye candy that Emily Blunt provides, she and Cruise carry this motion picture with ease, and appear very comfortable with each other on screen, allowing good character chemistry and flow. I don't have a complaint about anyone's performance, actually. But, I didn't think Cruise would be as likable as he is, you can totally get behind him. And there's some wicked actions scenes, and the special FX are very well crafted and beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>If I had to sum this flick up, I'd say that it took the better parts of Terminator Salvation (2009) and Transformers (2007), and made them more explosive, idealistic, and entertaining. The ending is good, and although the film as a whole has a dark plot, there's some good humor that's intentional, but not over the top to cause any cheesiness. It's funny because, I didn't even want to watch this at first. It took several times of seeing the trailer before I was convinced. And I was wrong, because in the end, Edge of Tomorrow is a winner."
"AudioFileZ","8","1","3","12 July 2014"," Recycled Theme? No Problem 'Cause It Works.
","First, this is a good Sci-Fi. The movie gets to it too as whoever the aliens are need not be explained as what's important is they're here and they're on the brink of eliminating mankind. The CGI effects are definitely ""perfect"" here as we get really original bad-ass aliens and well realized battle scenes with them.<br/><br/>Then there's the compelling differences. One big one, and it ain't even original, is the premise of replaying the day as per Groundhog Day. It doesn't ever feel recycled though and it is the absolute core of the story. Perhaps the biggest difference is we get a Tom Cruise character that isn't in any way a typical summer ""money-grab"" cut-out: cooler than cool character. We get a real Sci-Fi anomaly whose persona is in a desperate situation and he plays it perfectly. PR officer Bill Cage, Cruise's character, is suddenly thrust into a major front line battle situation in which he, quite accidentally, becomes the one valiant person who can divert humankind's demise. He gets some nice support by a very physical woman warrior played by Emily Blunt and an obliviously gung-ho Master Sargent Farrell Bill Paxton (he drank much Cool-Aid).<br/><br/>So, if you enjoy ""nasty"" (i.e., big and good action) Sci-Fi this ones got you covered. The living the day over thing is treated with both humor and that needed tiny crack of hope in that outcomes actually can be changed by extraordinary means."
"rjszantyr","7","1","3","11 July 2014"," A good film, worthy of its place as a summer blockbuster
","Edge of Tomorrow (the premise of which I will not discuss here, since it is best experienced than described), will seem familiar to some filmgoers, and that is perhaps inevitable. It seems more and more that summer blockbusters are becoming formulaic and predictable, as studios spend more and more money to gamble on franchises they hope will pay off in the box office. Edge of Tomorrow is, however, familiar in a different sense. It reminds me of summer blockbusters that were fun and engaging and, yes, surprising. Even in the final minutes of the film, I was unsure of where it was going, and for that, I am glad. Tom Cruise plays the lead, and does a great job of reminding the audience why Tom Cruise is a star: he walks the line between relatable and extraordinary, and comes off with both a confidence and a dubiousness that fits well with the narrative of the film. The action is also good. One could easily imagine the film becoming bogged town by too many repetitious action sequences, but director Doug Liman does a good job of making the action chaotic where it needs to be and more subdued when that is called for. One of the most pleasurable aspects of the film is its comment on both action films themselves and, in a sense, video games. It uses its premise to both take characters to dark and compelling places, while also providing levity. For that, the screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth should be applauded. Edge of Tomorrow is a good piece of blockbuster filmmaking, and in a cycle of sequels, remakes, and reboots, it is a welcome refreshment."
"JohnWelles","8","1","3","9 July 2014"," Original, Intelligent and Thrilling Sci-FI.
","""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014), directed by Doug Liman, is a military science fiction film that revolves around Cruise's character endlessly repeating the same day, always dying, to explore his evolution from coward to hero. By deftly showing Cruise's changing responses to the same people and events in the run-up to landing in the battle zone, he undergoes a subtle metamorphosis. From attempting blackmail on General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) in order to avoid action to eventually realising he alone can combat the alien threat, it's a well-written character arc. He is allowed to handle a complex role which can switch deftly from seriousness to black humour (stemming from him being able to predict what other characters' are about to say and do due to his multitude of deaths). It's his best performance in a long time, benefiting from the intelligence of the material he has to work with. It's also a testament to the script that the time loop never becomes tiresome, but instead is constantly inventive in its repetition, the storytelling enlivened by the elliptical editing of James Herbert and Laura Jennings. Scripted by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (based on the Japanese novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka), they handle the variety of plot threads and main duplication of the same day very well.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt, playing a renowned warrior, has the more limited role, her character 'reset' every time Cruise dies, but nevertheless shows her ability to project external strength and an admirable lack of sentiment in her training of Cruise. Bill Paxton as a tough Sergeant Major is fairly one-note, but it's a fun note all the same, Paxton clearly enjoying himself in his constant admonishing of Cruise.<br/><br/>Director Liman is able to deal with kinetic action scenes as well as quieter, character-orientated moments, whilst cleverly altering how he films repeating sequences. The main battle scene on the French beach is a good example, initially staying with Cruise's point of view, but gradually revealing more information each time, until around midway through, Liman pulls his camera back and reveals in a long shot the enormity of the military operation. Visually, he and his cinematographer Dion Beebe are aided by the interesting production design, in particular the exoskeletons the soldiers wear and the design of the aliens themselves, which creates a neat dichotomy with the contemporary appearance of much of this near-future world.<br/><br/>If its final act is slightly weaker, preventing it from becoming truly excellent, this is certainly a far sharper, original and more intriguing sci-fi action film than is normally found."
"abcvision","10","1","3","7 July 2014"," living on the edge
","This is a really action packed good movie. Tom Cruise plays Cage, a PR military man who comes to help put spin into a messy war front. Not fitting in to the frontline he is sent to play soldier, only to discover he is caught in a time vortex where he keeps repeating the same day over and over again all the while the aliens fight to take over the world. A very intense movie that creates a believable fog of war experience. The lights and sounds and the chaos of being on the battle field. Tom Cruise really makes this movie as his intensity helps guide the good guys into what seems a lost cause. The movie makes you realize the fine line between reality and imagination and the easy way in which our perspective can misguide us and make us question our own sanity."
"pc95","8","1","3","6 July 2014"," Highly Entertaining
","I must admit when I first saw the trailer for ""Edge of Tomorrow"" I was skeptical, but a co-worker informed me he enjoyed it, and I 2nd that opinion and then some. I think this is one of the top of movies of 2014. Director Doug Liman and the writers involved have struck a great balance of action, sci-fi and humor. Of course it's not completely original but it pulls and mixes the right amounts from past ideas to blend a great hybrid story and characters with witty and succinct dialog. I thought Tom Cruise was fairly good in Oblivion recently, but here he he's topped that performance and even manages some subtlety and nuance between earlier and later character development in the story. Blunt is well directed and fulfills her co-star role with quiet resolve and physicality. Excellent direction, I'll repeat. There are some great support roles too with Bill Paxon and Brendon Gleeson(spoilers) The alien concepts and execution may not be pinnacle or wholly original, but the inception and the way the story uses time causality concepts bolsters that weakness. A great entry for Sci-Fi and 2014 - highly recommended 8/10"
"sjsustudent007","8","1","3","6 July 2014"," I can watch this movie over and over again!
","Tom Cruise's character in Edge of Tomorrow constantly goes into combat, dies, and is brought back to the beginning to do it all over again which makes this movie relatable to playing a video game. While this movie was fun, it almost seems almost like a rip-off of Groundhog Day, only without the thought evoking metaphors of life which can be related to the five steps of overcoming a drug addiction. Instead of having such a deep meaning, this movie's metaphor is a simpler one about war.<br/><br/>For the Tom Cruise fans, this movie has the signature action scenes with Tom Cruise running and fighting. But this movie takes a slight break from the notion that the main character is completely indestructible by making him more of an ordinary man who has to learn to be the action hero we want to see at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Although the CG in this movie was done really well, it still looks like CG. A lot of the action, vehicles, and environment look very good, but the attacking aliens and the way they move seemed a bit artificial to me. The colors are too bright to be realistic, and they don't seem to move naturally as they appeared from and burrowed into the ground. If you can get over this glitch in the movie, then you will be able to enjoy the movie for what it was meant to be.<br/><br/>All in all, this was an entertaining movie. If you like to pick on all the plot holes and are looking for anything wrong about a movie to be negative about, this is not the movie for you. In fact, I don't think there are too many movies for you at all. If you like to be entrenched in a world created to entertain you, then this is a great summer flick."
"bravesfanc","8","1","3","5 July 2014"," Give it a shot
","Tom Cruise's last few films haven't been all that great. (Oblivion, Jack Reacher to name a few) So when I first saw the preview for this, I didn't want to be tricked into seeing another one of his movies because the trailer looked good. But word of mouth from several people got me to decide that I would give this a shot. And I'm very glad I did.<br/><br/>Firstly, before seeing the movie I wondered if it was going to be repetitive considering the movie is about re-living the same day over and over again. But the way the plot moves along, it's actually quite refreshing with each passing minute.<br/><br/>Along with the good action and special effects, there is also quite a bit of comedy involved as well. It's really a perfect mix of each. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised with the entire film as a whole and I think it might be a movie that if you were to watch again, you might notice something you didn't see the first time."

I would recommend this to any sci-fi/fantasy junkie out there you will love this movie. a do not miss movie. There is not to much to say about this movie other than the fact it is based off time-travel type concept . I don't want to give away the movie to much just recommend if that appeals to you to go see the movie.

Highly recommend this movie in summer movie season or on DVD whenever that comes out to."
"dfle3","7","1","3","4 July 2014"," Entertaining movie but lacks inspiration. 75%
","It was interesting to learn that this movie was based on a Japanese 'manga' called - amusingly - ""All you need is kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka (it sounds like one of those awful translations generated from a poor web based translation service!). Wikipedia says it was a novel with pictures but then turned into a manga as well. Be that as it may...<br/><br/>The story itself is nonsense on stilts - of the kind that a small child could punch holes in the logic of - Earth is invaded by aliens humans dub ""mimics"". For the life of me I can't work out the relationship between that name and what they look like. The aliens look pretty abstract, which perhaps affected the way that I responded to them. They look computer generated and not nearly effective aesthetically as the non-computer generated alien in the movie ""Alien"" or its sequels.<br/><br/>The biggest nonsense of this movie is that the aliens have the ability to control time...to 'reset' to an earlier point in time which allows them to learn from their mistakes and thus defeat humanity's best efforts. If you've seen any ads for this movie you'll realise that Earth's hero, Major William Cage (played by Tom Cruise) acquires this time shifting ability of the aliens.<br/><br/>Earth's resistance is co-ordinated by the UDF (United Defence Force), of which Major Cage will soon become a servant. The UDF's leader is General Brigham (played by Brendan Gleeson), an Englishman who - early on, especially - has a pinch of Winston Churchill about him. Tom Cruise's Major Cage has a pinch of Jack Nicholson about him early on too. Perhaps it was a choice of the film makers not to have the Earth's defences led by the US...as in it comes across as a 'team' effort to defeat the aliens, not the Americans being the sole heroes...then again, perhaps it's in the original novel too?<br/><br/>Whilst set in the future, the imagery is not unlike something you might see in representations of World War I...and its sequel too, perhaps.<br/><br/>More than one professional review mentions how this narrative device of time travel is like a video game. I can see that. Perhaps like a 'noob' war video game player, Major Cage is a coward but by a process of constantly dying at the hands of the enemy (that is where the time travel 'reset' device comes in), Cage eventually becomes a worthy opponent to the aliens...a hero, in other words. It's this kind of unrealistic and video game like 'cheat' which makes you wonder how much honour there is in potentially defeating the aliens by dying at their hands so often...but that is how the aliens came to be winning the war against humans in any case.<br/><br/>The female character of Sergeant Rita Vrataski (played by Emily Blunt) has an interesting strand to her backstory. It concerns how she got the epithet ""Angel of Verdun"" and how that relates to the aliens' 'long game' as far as their war with humanity goes.<br/><br/>The concept of this movie was exciting and interesting to me but despite being an entertaining movie in itself, it didn't scale any greats heights for me. It lacks joy. It is, after all, a boy's own adventure tale. It just did not sweep me away like a movie of this sort should. Ideally you'd want the movie to be rousing and to love the characters. Perhaps one could say it is a little bit sterile in this regards?<br/><br/>A sort of similar movie to this is ""Source code"", which I gave 10/10 to on this site. Even though my memory of this movie has faded, I do remember that I loved it. Like ""Edge of tomorrow"", it is not the acting or the characters or the script which win you over. Despite both having this 'flaw', ""Source code"" manages to achieve a level of greatness which ""Edge of tomorrow"" doesn't.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'll just mention liking the score for the end credits...after the song. I liked the stereo field created in the cinema...how the music pans from one side to another and creates an aural space.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie, in other words...but nowhere near as good as ""Source code""...or the truly great ""Dark city""...or even ""The 13th floor"", which are all similarly 'concept movies."
"swellframe17","7","1","3","2 July 2014"," A nice surprise.
","3 out of 4 stars.<br/><br/>I didn't think this film would work. I had seen the previews many times and had no urge to see it. Tom Cruise has had several disappointing action films, like his 2013 film ""Oblivion."" However, critics started giving ""Edge of Tomorrow"" good reviews and I gave it a chance. I'm surprised to say that I liked it.<br/><br/>Doug Liman's 2014 film ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is an action-packed summer blockbuster that is actually smart and funny. The film is about an American officer (played by Tom Cruise) who is forced to fight in a an alien battle in France, but he hijacks the alien's power so that every time he dies, he wakes up the day before the battle with the memory of how he died. He can build on these memories and figure out what to do.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, and Bill Paxton give solid performances and the story has its twist and turns that keep you engaged. The dialogue is very blockbustery. You've heard some of these lines before, some of them probably by Tom Cruise in other movies. I thought the movie was consistent for the most part, but the ending is a little corny. <br/><br/>If I didn't walk into the film so skeptical, I may have liked it a little more. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a nice surprise that is actually worth seeing. It's a fun, action-filled ride that will keep you engaged."
"witster18","7","1","3","2 July 2014"," What were the chances, right?
","Looks like a knock-off of District 9 and Elysium. Stars Tom Cruise. Bares a scary resemblance to Transformers:Dark of the Moon's trailer.<br/><br/>That's why, when I saw the score actually rising in the second and third weeks after release, it got my attention. That's the opposite of what usually happens with these cgi infested summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>The a-typical rushed set-up and lackluster first 10 minutes had me a little concerned that I had somehow been duped, but it wasn't long before all those concerns were squashed.<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" is about as good as these types of films can be. It's better than the ORIGINAL Transformers, better than Oblivion, and NEARLY as good as District 9.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is excellent. THe acting all around is solid, but definitely not the key to the films success.<br/><br/>THe best thing about this is that the CGI is all-over-the-place yes, but it's executed nicely. The plot isn't over-convoluted or too confusing, and while it all seems familiar, the time-jumping aspect adds A TON to the overall product. Mostly, it adds a fantastic comedic element.<br/><br/>The action is fantastic. The film isn't overlong. And the ending is strong.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. Haven't seen many 2014 releases so far, and I usually see about 90-110 films from each year. THAT SAID, this one will be hanging around the top 25 for 2014 like a vulture to a carcass.<br/><br/>Awesome flick! Pure adrenaline! See it on the big screen. Best 'popcorn fare' I've seen since 'The Avengers', only it's a notch above that fine film. Also enjoyed it more than Captain America Winter Soldier. Both good films, but this even better.<br/><br/>You'll like this if you liked: Lockout(nowhere near as good), Elysium(a clear notch below), Avengers(not quite as good), Aliens(a tad better), or Starship Troopers(a notch below).<br/><br/>83/100..actually entertained ""9"" for about a minute or two.

","Good action, obviously great graphics. The concept of the aliens was good both aesthetically and in the plot. Emily Blunt was great, Tom Cruise was okay. Brendan Gleeson's role was almost negligible. Too much humour spread in the movie, and not what I was looking for from the movie. The story was a bit predictable and stale, didn't really draw me in or make me feel much compassion for the characters. Some scenes seemed strictly for humour, with no contribution at all to the plot. Other than the alien scenes, most of the action scenes were included in the trailers. <br/><br/>Glad I saw it in theatres for the visuals, but probably wouldn't recommend it and won't watch it again."

He rarely fails to deliver and is one of the greatest stars in Hollywood. In Edge Of Tomorrow, he gives one of his best performances yet, in this action epic!<br/><br/>With numerous laugh-out-loud moments and plenty of eye popping action, some of which are carried out fantastically by Emily Blunt, watching the same scenes over and over again (due to its Groundhog Day story line) never tire.<br/><br/>Beautifully done, and a great companion piece to the fantastic Oblivion."

Not that I think Tom Cruise is a bad actor, but he seemed a little old to be staring in action films. SURPRISE!! HE'S ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!! I wouldn't hesitate in saying this is one of his better performances in his career. The humor in this film is done excellently.

"drtacpdonrogers","9","1","3","20 June 2014"," Much better than my expectations
","Cruise's 'Oblivion' came to mind when I first saw the movie trailer. But being cloned in a merely risky environment is completely different than repeatedly dieing in an inevitable slaughter and then being reset to the day before your death. Ad infinitem. The producers of this movie proudly offered the fact that this movie revisited themes explored in so many (6) films that came before. They rightfully left off 'Oblivion' on that list. Groundhog Day is the most relevant. Live, Die, Repeat is the movie slogan. The biggest drawback is how similar to Cruise's 'religion' that slogan is. The movie is riveting throughout without any loss of intensity. Levity is provided and very natural to this story flow that involves the perennial human story of avoiding the inevitability of death as a finality. Spoiler Alert: Crucial to this story are the 3 types of alien attackers. Alphas occur only 1 in 6 million aliens. Omega's are carefully hidden alien Generals that control the action of the enemy fighting units from afar via telepathic communication with the battlefield Alphas. They (Alphas & Omegas) alone are capable of imparting the time resetting capability that Cruise experiences. Killing the Omega is Cage's (Cruise) and Rita's aka Full Metal B**ch (Blunt) objective to win the war. The movie is based on a Japanese novella by Hiroshi Sakurazaka ""All You Need Is To Kill"". This movie is a very enjoyable ride with an absolutely believable deus ex machina ending. The only movie that was more literal at deus ex machina and satisfying: Toy Story 3."

","Cage (Cruise) is put on a suicide mission to defend the planet from an invading race of aliens. Before dying on the beaches of Normandy with the rest of mankinds soldiers he is caught in a time loop where he will ""respawn"" in England the day before the last desperate human attack on Normandy takes place. <br/><br/>It is a pleasure to finally see Tom Cruise back in form in Edge of Tomorrow. Following a streak of mediocre sci-fi movies Cruise finally showed audiences why he is still considered one of the absolute top leading men in modern cinema. He certainly brings his A-game to the movie with an enthusiasm that we haven't really seen since Tropic Thunder, in a less tenacious but much more determined and unassuming fashion. He got great help from rising-star Emily Blunt who was sensationally stunning as the hard-hearted officer and Angel of Verdun. The chemistry between the two is what essentially sells the movie (together with tons of CGI and of course alien robots) and they sell it well. The repeated first-meetings between the two never gets old, we always want to see if Cage can somehow manage the fiery Rita better than last time. <br/><br/>The film is functioning extremely well in the ever-growing grey-area between film and video game. We feel a close connection to Cage because we are the only ones that know and can identify what he is going through. It is always a movies job to make the audience identify with the protagonist, and Edge of Tomorrow does so effortlessly and elegant. The structure takes us on a unique journey with Cage were we follow him every time he has to reset and we feel his distress when he got close before he was reset. <br/><br/>Fans of difficult campaigns in the FPS gaming genre will find the elements reset and restart very familiar as the whole aspect of ""move forward, die, move a little further, die, etc.etc.etc.) Is almost always very prevalent in that genre. This is all exemplified and enhanced by the short exchange between Cage and Rita - ""What do we do now?"" ""I don't know, we have never gotten this far"". As opposed to ""Gamer"" this works out very well for Edge and the audience never feels let out of the action and the storyline is much easier to follow than the grossly mismatched trailer might let you to believe."

","For those of you who have never heard of ""Groundhog Day"" (starring Bill Murray, Andy McDowell) Edge of Tomorrow will have a bigger impact than for those of us who have. I must say I was slightly disappointed when I realised the central theme behind the film.<br/><br/>Whilst it has been said by another reviewer that the story is brand new with no copycats, it is not. Groundhog Day was the first (as far as I am aware) to do the ""lets restart/relive today again and again and again and keep trying different things every day until we get it right"" concept.<br/><br/>That said, even though the concept is not new, Edge of Tomorrow has applied this in a totally different genre and it has been put together flawlessly, making for a solid 2 hours captivating entertainment even if you have seen Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>I felt there was a nice balance between action, comedy and romance. I did not find myself getting bored or wishing the pace would pick up. On the technical side, the CG effects were brilliant and the story/events plausible. I thought Tom Cruise's acting was great too, unlike many of his more recent films. <br/><br/>All in all, apart from the rehashed ""Groundhog Day"" concept, Edge of Tomorrow is an excellent film and well worth watching. I give it a solid 7 only because of the borrowed ""Groundhog Day"" concept."
"classicalsteve","8","1","3","15 June 2014"," Cruise in One of His Better SF/Thriller Role: The Title Hints at Main Character's Primary Dilemma
","Of Cruise's several recent science fiction roles, including ""Minority Report"", ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Jack Reacher"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"" ranks as one of his better offerings. Even some of the later Mission:Impossible installments are not as strong as this latest action-SF thriller. The one issue with this film is that if I describe the main plot line, all future viewers' cinematic experiences will be spoiled beyond repair. I will offer only some basic premises and refrain with giving away the main plot twist which occurs early in the film.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Lieutenant Cage, a former ROTC student at University who ends up producing advertisements for the US military. Extra-terrestrial baddies, sort of a cross between ""Predator"" and ""Alien"" with the speed of the parasitic ""Alien"" creatures who impregnate unsuspecting human beings, have infiltrated the world and threaten to exterminate all human existence. We learn from the get-go that humankind and ""baddiekind"" have already engaged in several confrontations. Cage has gone on a television campaign to recruit the best and the brightest to fight the baddies.<br/><br/>Cage is then summoned to Europe and learns from a gung-ho Scottish/British commanding officer, General Brigham, that the latest military operation is to throw everything the international military has at the beasties on the western front of France, sort of an SF reenactment of D-Day near the beaches of Normandy. The General wants Cage to command the mission. Cage declines siting as his excuse that he's only an officer in name, but not really a soldier. And besides he's in the US military, and not under British or European jurisdiction. However, he finds he has been put under the general's command and after trying to weasel his way out of military service, Cage is forced to become a low-level combat soldier. He becomes, in a sense, his own recruitment.<br/><br/>Thrust into the middle of regular enlisted men and women who use large body armor suits, similar to the one used by Ripley in ""Aliens"", Cage engages the battle with other soldiers. The battle turns out to be a route in favor of the alien baddies since they appeared to know every step and every move the humans made during the combat even before they made it. And then towards the end of the battle, a strange circumstance pivots Cage into another reality of sorts, the details of which I will fore-go revealing lest I be banned from writing further reviews on IMDb.com! And this is actually where the story really begins...<br/><br/>A very satisfying cinematic SF experience. The film has an excellent balance between action and a compelling storyline. Cruise is excellent at pulling his viewers with him where he wants to go, provided it's a compelling script, which ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is. Emily Blunt plays a fellow soldier, far more seasoned in the ""ready aim"" department than Cruise, and the two achieve good chemistry. I will mention, by the way, Blunt's character's name is Rita. Interestingly, another film, whose main character has a similar dilemma to the one experienced by Cage has a female lead character, also name of Rita. This is essentially the SF equivalent of that other film, which shall remain nameless."
"matthewssilverhammer","9","1","3","14 June 2014"," Cruise Brings Scifi Fun
","EoT is a heady film, but not a heavy film. Instead of self-importance (like Cruise's2013 scifi Oblivion), it takes a smart premise and pokes at it. It presents tropes and then plays around them instead of letting them take over. It cheats with some of the science, but keeps the story loose and entertaining. It even touches on big themes of fate and making the most of life, but overall it's simply great fun. Cruise plays a Lt. Col. during a future alien invasion, more focused on PR than actual fighting. When he's unceremoniously dropped and killed in the midst of battle, he discovers his regeneration ""gift"", repeatedly reliving the same day (think ""Groundhog Day"" but action-y). Each time he restarts, he learns a little more about himself and the enemy. The action and effects are majestic and realistic, with a surprising respect for warfare, with aliens who are scary, unique, and cool, but what really makes EoT work is Cruise. He performs against the rock-solid action star type he has tended towards in recent years, instead playing a squirrelly, vulnerable, and comedic character with refreshing effortlessness. His opening fear is palpable, and his eventual transformation into a fierce warrior is steady and believable thanks to great direction and committed acting. This is a modern premise with an 80s sensibility, never losing the fun while juggling the philosophy. The space-time continuum problems and moments of clichéd dialogue are overlooked by the below-the-surface tongue-in-cheek spirit that permeates the entire film. EoT is a twisty, rewarding, funny, and deftly made summer blockbuster."

"scottjohnson7896","7","1","3","14 June 2014"," Edge of Being Generic(Raging FIlm Reviews)
","Tom Cruise is back for yet another action film. This time he plays a soldier who relives the same day over and over again, dying at the end of each day and reborn the next. While the movie is basically your run-of-the-mill summer action blockbuster, its innovative script and premise keep it from becoming just another action flick that gets lost in the fray. <br/><br/>Originally called All You Need Is Kill, Edge of Tomorrow starts off rather confusingly. Tom Cruises' character, William Cage, is a major in an army where he has not seen a lot of action. The ""Mimics,"" an alien race that does not appear to have any motives other than conquest, have taken over France and Germany, and they are fast approaching Britain, where we find our hero. His cowardice in not wanting to fight the war leads to him trying to blackmail his general, played by Brendan Gleeson, into keeping him behind the lines, but it inevitably puts him into the thick of things. After he dies fighting off a special ""Mimic,"" he is given the ability to relive that day over and over, which comes with both positive and negative results. From this point onwards he finds that another person, Rita, played by Emily Blunt, once had this ability. They team up in order to put an end to the the alien invasion.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so of the movie do not make much sense. There does not appear to be any sort of urgency considering the fact that Germany and France are both completely annihilated. Cage's actions also seem rather unnecessary, but the plot choices ultimately end up making more sense than they first do.<br/><br/>Other than Cruise, Blunt, and Gleeson, we do not get too involved with many of the character's lives. There is not a whole lot of development in the supporting cast, so by the end of the film we do not feel as though the losses carry any weight with them. The action is exciting with the exoskeletons, creating a new type of action hero. From swords, to missiles, to machine guns, these suits can do anything.<br/><br/>The script is the strongest part of this film. It saves the film from being just a generic action film. It isn't completely mind-bending, but it is smart enough to create a chuckle here and there, while also making you think enough without being completely on the nose. Several times throughout the film a brief line is dropped that actually makes you think about how many times Cage has relived the same day.<br/><br/>Blunt and Cruise have decent chemistry, but I appreciate how little the plot gives to their romance. We get hints that there is more emotion there, but it never detracts from the plot other than the fact that he cares about her. It does not give itself up to the tropes of many action movies where there needs to be romance and sex in order for it to be entertaining. Just teasing the idea works well enough in Edge of Tomorrow.<br/><br/>So, in the end, Edge of Tomorrow is, for the most part, your average action movie. What saves it is its creative script that fuses time-travel with solid action, and enough brain twisters to stimulate the brain without making you have to calculate all the minute details. The only downsides are the lack of supporting-character development and the fact that the world outside the military does not seem too concerned that two major countries in the world have been utterly decimated. That shouldn't be too much to deter you from seeing a fun action movie, should it? Go check Edge of Tomorrow out.<br/><br/>For more reviews check out ragingfilm.com"

","Despite Tom Cruise's presence (yes, the movie might just be 11 out of 10 featuring someone else) the movie proves its worth. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie void of typical Hollywood clichés.<br/><br/>1. US isn't the target of choice anymore, Europe is. World armies join to combat the enemy threat. It was really nice to see London and Paris scenes.<br/><br/>2. No pointless love/sex. It's war and the main characters focus on that. There's some tension in the air that remains unfulfilled.<br/><br/>3. The climax of the movie is a ruse, there's no cheap/forced buildup to there but a natural tension that breaks for a moment letting us know we've had a red herring before the actual solution is found. Despite the misleading act, it's a climax nonetheless and it is genuinely thrilling (unlike the predictable formulaic movies that Hollywood is swamping us with every summer).<br/><br/>There's a reason for all that: the movie is based on a Japanese manga novel."
"Hellmant","10","1","3","11 June 2014"," Definitely one of the best movies of the year, so of course it's one of the least successful!
","'EDGE OF TOMORROW': Five Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars in this big budget sci-fi action flick based on the Japanese 'young-adult book' (referred to as a 'light novel' in Japan) 'All You Need Is Kill', by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. It was directed by Doug Liman (who's also directed such hit movies as 'SWINGERS', 'GO', 'THE BOURNE IDENTITY', 'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' and 'JUMPER') and written by Christopher McQuarrie and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth; the Butterworths also wrote the 2010 political thriller 'FAIR GAME' (which Liman also directed). McQuarrie previously worked with Cruise on 'VALKYRIE' (which he co-wrote) and 'JACK REACHER' (which he wrote and directed). This movie also stars Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson and Noah Taylor. It's a clever and fun thrill ride that's as much a thinking man's action film as an effects filled alien/war flick.<br/><br/>The story begins five years into a war with an invading alien species called Mimics. The Mimics are winning and about to take control of Continental Europe as the United Defense Forces, UDF (combined NATO armies), introduces a new weapon to their soldiers called 'Jackets'. 'Jackets' are mechanized exoskeleton body armor; which one soldier, Rita Vrataski (Blunt), used to kill hundreds of Mimics at Verdun (giving her the nickname 'Angel of Verdun'). A UDF spokesman, named Major William Cage (Cruise), has made a career out of promoting military products, like the 'Jackets', to the public. When a UDF commander, named General Brigham (Gleeson), wants Cage to join beach forces in France (in order to report on them), Cage blackmails the General in an attempt to get out of it. Brigham then has Cage arrested, stripped of his rank and shipped to the London Heathrow Airport; where he's ordered to join the forces in combat there. His worst fears come true when the Mimics slaughter the UDF armies and kill Cage. To his surprise he wakes up a day earlier and finds himself continually repeating that day; until he can some how change things and stop the Mimics. He of course joins forces with Vrataski, who seems to know what might be happening to him.<br/><br/>The film is sort of like a sci-fi/action version of 'GROUNDHOG DAY' but that doesn't mean you've seen anything like it before. It's completely original and different than any other potential summer blockbuster you might see this year (or any other). The script is brilliant, Liman's directing is perfectly fitting (to the material) and the acting is superb. Cruise gets to play a cocky pussy in the beginning of the movie and then evolves into a precise 'killing machine'. He makes a great reluctant hero and this is one of his better performances. Blunt is hot and also an awesome action heroin; she just kicks so much ass, the entire movie. It's also great to see Bill Paxton as another soldier (this time an officer) killing aliens again (it's an awesome homage to 'ALIENS'). It's definitely one of the best movies of the year (so far), so of course it's one of the least successful (so far). It is doing really well overseas though (where Cruise is still a huge star) so it should at least make it's money back. It's just a shame more people won't see it on the big screen domestically; they'll definitely be missing out!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Ie33IbZzmi0"
"mikael_a10","7","1","3","13 June 2014"," A surprising summer flick that brings action, comedy, and Tom Cruise getting shot over and over again
","Tom Cruise's new sci-fi flick, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" tells the story of Major Bill Cage (Cruise), during the war against alien creatures, the Mimics, who are determined to conquer and destroy human race. Cage, being a TV spokesman, tries his hardest to avoid field job, while the aliens are conquering Continental Europe. Things, however, change when General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) of the British forces, sends him to join the storming of Normandy. On the fields, he encounters a special type of Mimic, and successfully blows him up. Yet the Mimic's blood corrodes Cage's body. But instead of rolling the credits, the film begins its main storyline in which Cage receiving a special power of traveling back in time, a day before the storming begins, when he first arrived to his mission. With the help of Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a decorated soldier, Cage tries to destroy the brain of the alien forces, the Omega, in order to prevent human defeat against the Mimics. The film is based on the book by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, All You Need Is Kill, and, in a way, retells the story of the D-day invasion.<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman's witty approach is what makes the film successfully tell a repetitive story, without boring the audience. Every time Cage starts a new cycle by getting a bullet in the head, mostly from Vrataski during their training, we can't help ourselves but share a laugh. The influence and inspiration from The Groundhog Day is seen throughout the picture, yet it still brings a lot more action-filed atmosphere. However, what the director was not able to do is develop a real war movie feeling to ""Edge"". There is very little tension before the storming of Normandy begins. Minor characters are poorly developed, which does not allow the viewer to feel for them and have a strong concern about whether they will be able to survive. The reason why General Brigham experiences such strong dislike towards Cage, that he sends him into the middle of the action knowing about his lack of military experience, seems to be avoid or rather ignored. There are also a lot of questions regarding the time travel. After waking up, Cage tends to proceed with different actions, switching some of his choices from before. Yet all the character interactions, and the main action on the beach, remains unchanged from the first time Cage arrives to his mission, disregarding the fact that even a little change in his actions would somehow affect the development of future events, and not keep most of the things the same. Also, the ending makes you question whether or not the film should have taken a classic Hollywood finale. <br/><br/>Even with its lack of characterization and uncertain time traveling factors, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a very entertaining, action-filled mish-mash of ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", that delivers laughs and excitement. Also, the score by Christophe Beck (who charmed the world with it's music for Disney mega-hit ""Frozen"") adds it's own thrill, both during quiet and ""bullet-flying-Mimic-killing"" scenes. The film is self-aware and does not try to act as an emotionally serious sci-fi drama. It's a nice piece of summer blockbusters, which once again proves that this time of the year brings major excitement to the screens."

"TheSquiss","8","1","3","12 June 2014"," Sci-fi D-Day meets Groundhog Day. Blunt & Cruise kick alien ass again and again and
","Mostly cinema should be about great entertainment. Sometimes it needs to be educational. But not today. Today is all about romping with guns and explosions and adventure and thrills with two fine stars and a generous portion of intelligence.<br/><br/>The Edge of Tomorrow is essentially a futuristic D-Day thriller; it's a science fiction Groundhog Day with aliens, a Source Code with warfare instead of terrorism.<br/><br/>Earth is losing the war with a hyper intelligent alien species and no military force seems capable of thwarting them. Humankind is doomed unless a miracle occurs. Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is a soldier with no combat experience whose reward for p*****g off his superior is a reposting as cannon fodder from which he is not expected to return. He doesn't. Except he does. Kind of. Killed in minutes, Cage finds himself reliving the day, but with memories of each previous experience. He finds Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) who understands his unlikely 'gift' and together they must learn quicker than the aliens in order to win the war before time stops resetting.<br/><br/>It's easy to take potshots at Cruise; he's just about the biggest movie star in the world, has been box office gold for 30 years and has the odd turkey to his name. But Cruise is a star for a very good reason and The Edge of Tomorrow more than makes up for last year's clunky Oblivion. This is an intelligent action thriller where Cruise doesn't merely fall back on his cheeky smile and winning screen persona, he gets down and dirty with the task of killing that which would destroy our planet. And what a fine job he does of it.<br/><br/>The Edge of Tomorrow is clearly sold on Cruise's name. He's the star, the box office draw and the principal reason it was green lit. But the greatest joy here is that he almost plays second fiddle to Emily Blunt. And it works. Rita kicks Cage's ass, she absolutely rocks and is a gritty heroine who doesn't need the tight-fitting Lycra and a heaving bust of the Lara Croft-types Hollywood mostly serves up to capture our attention; shut up, watch and listen or she'll beat the crap out of you and leave you to pick up your own dismembered limbs. Cruise is the bigger name, but Blunt is the centerpiece of The Edge of Tomorrow and it's a refreshing change from the expected norm.<br/><br/>Top marks, then, to screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie and Jez & John-Henry Butterworth for their gripping adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel, All You Need is Kill, that retains the brutality without ostracizing viewers with a leaning towards sit-back-and-relax action thrillers.<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Jumper) is on his surest ground since Mr. & Mrs. Smith 2005 and ramps up the thrills, injecting them with humour that never detracts from the task at hand. There is a worrying moment when he puts Blunt in a 'look at me, I'm an action heroine' sequence in a battle rehearsal warehouse, but it is forgivable for being brief; Liman clearly respects his star and her ability to grip us firmly by the short and curlies without needing to resort to pseudo machismo and constant cleavage shots. And he respects his audience enough to realise we'll buy into our heroes, irrespective of gender, if their performance is strong. Neither lets him down and Liman reciprocates. Just, please god, resist the temptation from the men with the dollars in their eyes to fabricate a pointless, needless sequel.<br/><br/>After my disappointment of the sure-fire hit that was X-Men: Days of Future Past, I approached The Edge of Tomorrow cautiously. I needn't have worried. Yes, it is fantasy. But this is science fiction and it's a movie, so stop your whinging about it not being realistic. It is, however, thrilling, exciting and the most fun I've had at the cinema I've had for a good few months.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

At no point do the characters act with obvious foreknowledge or blind spots, as they so often have to in a sci-fi flick to keep the plot rolling. That and the CGI is truly seamless, and not much gets past me. <br/><br/>But up until that point we basically watch a hapless Tom Cruise get sent off to die.

I have to say after waiting a full weekend to see it, and hearing all the great buzz, it was going to be hard to live up to the expectations. I really enjoyed this movie, especially because of how different it was to any previous Science Fiction movie. The action is top notch, and the chemistry is great between actors. Obviously, the idea of re-living a day several times has been done before, but with aliens involved it becomes refreshing and new. Emily Blunt is fantastic and every scene with her is gold. Cruise, in a very different role, is also good and I'm glad they didn't try to force the romance into the movie.<br/><br/>The movie does take a few scenes to get going, but once Blunt steps on screen, she captures your attention. It's great to see they are using Blunt in a different way then before. She is a complete bad*** in the movie, and besides Looper this hasn't been seen before. She has been up for a few different comic book roles in the past so these huge action blockbusters didn't seem too far off. The supporting cast in the limited time they have were serviceable. I'm also really glad the re-living scenes didn't feel repetitive, as they went with the comedic route instead of dramatic.<br/><br/>The scenes on the beach were great to look at, but I couldn't help but find myself wanting more of it. There were also a few times the movie was going to end, and when it finally did I was a tad disappointed with the result. The ending didn't seem to fit the overall story. I know they had to find a way to kill these Aliens, but for some reason the ending didn't resonate the way it should have. I also understand they didn't want to feel too much like Elysium, where the lead takes the kill for everyone else. The ending doesn't take away from the incredible action sequences along with Blunt and Cruise' great performances. It's a refreshing take on the Alien invasion story, now more people just need to go see it to help it reach it's budget. Give Blunt more action roles. NOW <br/><br/>+Blunt is golden on screen <br/><br/>+It's different and new <br/><br/>+Action sequences on the beach were incredible.....<br/><br/>-...Wanted more of them though <br/><br/>-Disappointing finale <br/><br/>9.2/10"

","This is a movie that feels different from the start, and that's relieving among the various blockbusters that recycle the same images and themes.I'm glad that, according to the reviews I'm reading and the general score, it gets the appreciation it deserves(which means there is enough good taste left).I have to admit that I admire Cruise's choices, so much that I often go to see his movies having trust in his choices(although, of course, there are occasional disappointments, such as last year's Oblivion).But usually he scores high(Jack Reacher, Mission Impossible, and, of course, Eyes wide shut).Edge of tomorrow is an excellent movie that can be seen as a sci-fi action comedy, with wit and playful character, that is pure joy to watch from beginning to end.I also liked Godzila for the visual style and the respect to the original Japanese monster, and Captain America was fine as an action movie (I cannot say the same for Spider man, whereas X-men seemed to me satisfactory enough), but I think that the real winner of the contest-if there ever was one-is Edge of tomorrow, a movie that also reminded me of the cinema of Verhoeven(Starship troopers and Total recall).I only give eight stars because this is my limit for any movie that doesn't go deep down to my heart or my mind;and I think that what we have here lacks the ambition to be something more, something to stay in the mind(although after leaving the theater I was a little taken away by the film's concept and images).Time will show if it will get a cult status or stay just as a nice memory.As the memory is recent I vote for the former"
"alwaysplanb","10","1","3","10 June 2014"," One of the Best Manga-Adapted Movies!
","More than often, Manga/Anime adaptations turn out to be some real disappointments. Classic example is Dragon Ball Evolution. However, with Edge of Tomorrow, director hits all the right notes. <br/><br/>This is the blockbuster I was expecting all summer. An action packed extravaganza. I read some reviews calling it Groundhog Day meets Battlefield Earth. To tell the truth, I haven't seen Battlefield Earth. But GroundHog Day is one of my all time favorites. Edge of Tomorrow treads on the same premise, yet manages to present a whole new story. Best part is it wasn't dull or boring for a single second. With the whole time-loop concept, it's very easy to create a mess of a movie. Fortunately, Edge of Tomorrow isn't one of those.<br/><br/>Action is pretty much awesome and some scenes remind you of Saving Private Ryan minus gore. This is the kind of action I was expecting from Elysium but was disappointed. All I can say is Edge of Tomorrow perfectly defines how a movie involving exo-skeletons should be!<br/><br/>In Retrospect, there are two things I didn't like. <br/><br/>1. Tom Cruise never wielded an Axe (similar to the one Emily carried) like in the original Manga. I'm pretty sure, action would have been on a whole new level with Tom wielding an Axe.<br/><br/>2. There was NO Tom VS Emily in the ending. In the Manga, Cage fights and kills Rita because they find out that Rita became an ANTENNA the moment Cage gained her powers. However, I also liked the new definitive Ending in the movie. What I would have liked more was, Tom fights Emily. Kills her. Then Blow Omega Up. And Everything is back to Normal. Somewhat of a crossover between original ending and the one in the movie.<br/><br/>Apart from that, there's nothing that I didn't like. <br/><br/>One of the better Tom Cruise movies in recent times, this movie was one hell of a ride."

","It's technically proficient, has a lot of interesting ideas, is a smart film with occasional humor that delivers in many areas. Very good...and yet...<br/><br/>I staggered out of the theater feeling like I'd been run over by a train. If this is entertainment, then I have to find something else to do with my time. Extremely dark, even though it wasn't gratuitous. Is this the signature of today's movies, that I feel worse coming out than when I went in?<br/><br/>Cruise gives a superb performance, with a wide range of emotions. From the first scenes, we're with him, a smart and witty guy thrust into horrible situations that are over his head. But Emily Blunt is resoundingly one-note. She's great at anger, determination, scorn. She's driven. But she's not magnetic. If she'd shown another side for even a few frames, I would have sensed some depth, would have found her interesting. As is, she was as intriguing as one of their battle suits, moving around a lot and killing everything in sight but basically just hardware."
"ScottGentry","8","1","3","10 June 2014"," Arguably Tom Cruise's finest performance for years.
","""Edge of Tomorrow"" (12A) Directed by: Doug Liman. Starring: Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson and Jonas Armstrong.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is 50 years old, but by heck, he doesn't look it. His latest Sci-Fi epic ""Edge of Tomorrow"" takes the alien invasion plot device and neatly places it within the subject of time travel (or time displacement, it depends on your interpretation!). <br/><br/>Cruise plays Major William Cage, an officer who has never seen a day of combat, due to his job of literally being the face of the army, during a war between the human race and an alien nation, known as Mimics. Yes, you guessed it. Cage is a cowardly, yet slick, public relations officer (a reinterpretation of his character Jerry Maguire?) who is safe behind the cameras and news crews. But, due to unforeseen circumstances whilst in Britain, Cage is thrust into the battle for the front line, which will eventually amount to becoming a complete suicide mission. <br/><br/>Upon landing on a beach within France (it's slightly reminiscent of Normandy), Cage is killed within minutes, but is inexplicably caught within a time loop, that forces him to relive the cursed battle over and over again. As Cage fights within each battle however, he becomes stronger and wiser, eventually discovering that with the help of fellow officer Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), they might just be able to end the war for ever.<br/><br/>It's complicated, yet intriguing, and that's possibly why this adaptation of the graphic novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, is so entertaining. From the opening battle to the very last scene, Doug Liman's eighth directorial feature is completed in its excellence by screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie, Jez and John-Henry Butterworth. The trio of experienced writers (McQuarrie wrote ""The Usual Suspects"", if you haven't seen it, you must!) strive to bring audiences something fresh and exciting despite the format having been used numerous times within ""Source Code"" (2011) and ""Groundhog Day"" (1993).<br/><br/>Fortunately that's just what they do, by simply adding in romance and comedic elements, with Tom Cruise seemingly doing what he does best, by contributing his humorous charisma and providing a great and appealing performance, in order to keep the film light at times, yet dark in others. Emily Blunt also acts well in the form of the officer, Rita (aptly named the ""full metal b**ch""), who seems to perform in a reserved manner, yet keeps in line with the warrior style.<br/><br/>﻿﻿﻿ ﻿﻿The rest of the cast also provide fine support, especially actors such as Bill Paxton (equipped with a wonderfully unhinged performance), and Brendan Gleeson who isn't given a large role, but performs well, and is always welcome on the big screen, especially after his performance in this year's black comedy, ""Calvary"" from John Michael McDonagh. Other actors such as Jonas Armstrong (formerly portraying Robin Hood, in the BBC series), Tony Way (also seen in ""Game Of Thrones"", as Ser Dontos Hollard) and Franz Drameh (from ""Attack The Block"") all act perfectly, nailing the fine line between serious and comical.<br/><br/>Despite the great chemistry between Blunt and Cruise, I couldn't help but notice however, that (because it's a Doug Liman movie, it must have a tad bit of romance!) the romantic side to the main characters relationship, seems slightly tedious, but when it does work, it works particularly well and the two leads are more than capable of holding the romantic side of the story together. <br/><br/>In regards to the director Doug Liman, this is possibly his finest film since ""The Bourne Identity"", directing each action sequence with style and proving that he can direct a film that is decent in terms of its plot and cast. Each action sequence has also been planned and edited perfectly by James Herbert, in order to deliver a ""Saving Private Ryan"" feel to the battle, putting his skills as editor on Guy Ritchie's highly stylised ""Sherlock Holmes"" films, to good use. The composer Christophe Beck also contributes by creating an exciting score to the film, including an impressive theme that is used throughout the film. ﻿ ﻿﻿﻿ It is also worth mentioning the quality of the visual effects by Nick Davis (""The Dark Knight""), in particular the aliens known as Mimics look extremely well designed. In addition to the visual effects, Dion Beebe's cinematography is perfect, capturing the gritty style of war and apocalyptic themes just as well his cinematography for ""Equilibrium"" (2002).<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" is an intriguing and ambitious blockbuster which is constantly funny, shocking and engaging; it's arguably Tom Cruise's finest performance for years.<br/><br/>8 Stars out of 10<br/><br/>Written by Scott Gentry."
"tariquei","9","1","3","10 June 2014"," Fast and entertaining.
","Watching this movie was a great relief after going through the monstrosity of ""Godzilla"". I generally like Tom Cruise movies , so maybe I was tuned to like this one too. It also helps that I also am a big science fiction ( particularly alien types) fan, but then I hated Prometheus(one of the worst I have ever seen), Battleship (2012) and Elysium ( a great let down). I am mentioning this so that you can get some idea of my taste of movies. Regarding this movie, it is fast , well shot and entertaining. If someone is looking for logic and science then it fails on multiple accounts , but if you want entertainment then it is sure worth a watch. The film lacks in originality but makes for it in its pace and action sequences. The combat suit is something that we have seen often, the idea of time loop is not new ( it's very much like in 'The source Code') and the concept of aliens being connected and powered from a central source is prosaic, yet the movie didn't bore me and that is all I expect from one. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to evaluate science fiction movies scientifically. Also, if you are a Tom cruise fan you wouldn't like to miss this one. Watch it for its entertainment value."
"nebuchadnezzar26","10","1","3","9 June 2014"," Old wine in a new bottle but with an excellent flavor !
","The overall theme of the movie is inspired from the Groundhog Day, Source Code etc. The aliens in the movie are inspired from the Matrix and to some extent from The Darkest Hour, even the battlefield setup itself looks like to be copied from Battle LA. I also felt that the dialogs could have been better and the background score more inspiring but tell me one thing - What in this world exists without any flaws? Flaws make us more human, more vulnerable and more believable. isn't it? <br/><br/>I believe that not even one of these is a showstopper at least not for me and if I try to see beyond these shortcomings, I can say convincingly that the smart and excellent execution by the director Doug Liman along with an engaging script was a pleasant surprise. Most of us usually develop preconceived notions about a movie after seeing its trailer, the cast or the storyline and take them with us to the theater but once that movie starts breaking out of these shackles of expectations, we start enjoying it. So even though I was aware about the overall plot of the movie (which can be easily inferred from the trailer), it never felt boring or repetitive (in spite this being the central premise of the movie). There were many elements incorporated in the movie which kept it going in the right direction and preserved the freshness of the plot. Some action sequences were funny and intense at the same time and none of them looked bIand. The movie was a fun watch and managed to keep me on the hook till the last moment although I was not very convinced with the ending but nevertheless, that can be digested after some pondering.<br/><br/>Cruise was good enough (looks like he has continued the mode from Oblivion), Paxton and Gleeson fulfilled their duties religiously but the crown jewel of the performance should go to Emily Blunt without a doubt. She looked beautiful, charismatic and delivered a top notch performance which was believable and right on the target. Although the chemistry between Cruise and Blunt could have been better but given the plot, this can be overlooked. <br/><br/>Special effects were good in most parts barring a few at the end and the director tried to keep the fighting sequences simple and clean unlike the Transformers where you can't even figure out who's beating who. The exoskeletons seemed to be of high production quality and looked solid.<br/><br/>To conclude, I can only say that this movie defied my expectations and came out as one of the best entertainers of this year till now."
"RforFilm","9","1","3","9 June 2014"," With great action and a good sense of humor, Edge of Tomorrow is that surprise of the summer that needs to be seen!
","I love the creativity of what alien invasions can do, but a lot of movies tend to go with the same formula; we'll get a signal from space that turns out to be extraterrestrial life, they'll come to our planet and kill us to either take the Earth or take a resource. Just stroll through your library in the science fiction section to see just how unique something from Ray Bradbury and Lovecraft can be. When Hollywood tries it's hand at alien invasions, their more out to make a disaster movie then they are science fiction. It's easy to understand why as disaster movies are more likely to make money. Even the marketing of the recent Godzilla was mostly disaster influenced. <br/><br/>There's an understanding why we don't get a lot of movies that try some crazy science fiction material; the audience of film is different then of books and comics. Reader tend to pay more attention to the detail that's transcribed to them while watchers have shorter attention spans that needs the visual storytelling to engage them. Movies like Aliens and Avatar were hits because the visual imagery were enough of a sale to persuade a non sci-fi audiences. Material like Edge of Tomorrow has to combine it's complicated ideas with captivating imagery to tell an awesome alien invasion/time travel story. <br/><br/>In the near future, mankind has been fighting off a creature called the mimic for over five years, preventing it from escaping Europe. Every army has taken occupation in London to make it's latest attack successful thanks to new exoskeleton tech called jackets. Major William Cage (played by Tom Cruise), a high-ranking officer for the US military finds that he's been summoned to cover the combat of the big D-day attack on the mimics in a few days. He tries to decline but he is arrested and knocked out, only to find himself stripped of his rank and about to deploy the next morning with other recruits, under the command of Master Sergeant Farell (played by Bill Paxton).<br/><br/>To his horror, the mimics were anticipating the attack and have the edge. He manages to kill an alpha mimic, but dies when it's blood comes in contact with his face. He wakes up back where he started, arrested and told to fight on the beaches the next day. Cage finds he's stuck in a time loop, having to relieve the same battle over again. When he manages to prove to Sergeant Rita Vrataski (played by Emily Blunt), she tells him to find her again and again. Each loop gives Cage and Vrataski more time to prepare and find the Omega, the central nervous system that's causing the time loop and the heart of the mimic, and destroy it.<br/><br/>Every summer has that movie that turns out to be the unexpected surprise that's glanced over. Edge of Tomorrow is that movie. The seemingly complex story never gets that hard to figure out as the scenario is explained in great detail, not to mention allows itself to throw in some good jokes that were missing from the Tom Cruise movie from last year, Oblivion. <br/><br/>As is, Tom Cruise does well here, giving the likable performance that an action hero has. But despite his stardom, this movie belongs to Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. Blunt really shows off how much of a badass she can be, really reminding me of Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Bill Paxton seems to have a lot of fun, channeling the drill sergeant stereotype and also throwing some good dialogue about war being Tom Cruises destiny. <br/><br/>If there's anything else to note, is the design of the mimics. I'll admit that this is as alien to me as these creatures are to the military. They move really fast and seem to have a metallic-tentacle structure that ensures quick kills and fast reflexes. The CGI really works to the aliens advantage, but never becomes a distraction from the real military actions of Cruise and Blunt.<br/><br/>I'll give this nine mimics out of ten. Edge of Tomorrow may have been a tough sale here in the States, but I'm sure it's going to be a hit in the foreign markets. Science fiction movies like this deserve recognition, not just with the kind of aliens it has, but with the story and how it uses time travel."
"mm-39","7","1","3","9 June 2014"," Cruise has three good performances in a row.
","Edge of Tomorrow is the surprise hit of the summer so far. Edge of Tomorrow is a mix of Star ship trooper and Groundhog day. Tom Cruise relives the same battle over and over, which is a mystery? The story is intertwined at several levels with each new characters and scenes leading into a new plot twist. A well acted, directed movie, which Tom Cruise stands out! I have noticed that Tom Cruise has his charisma back. The first fifteen minutes is a strong performance which mixes charm and wit. Cruise's acting drives the movie with his demeanor and mannerism which create a screen chemistry that only movie star dynamic can add to a movie. A strong seven out of ten."
"ameya5982","9","1","3","9 June 2014"," Review of Movie : Edge of Tomorrow.
","Movie: Edge of Tomorrow. Director: Doug Liman Cast: Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Brendon Gleeson, Bill Paxton Genre: Sci-fi Action Synopsis: An untrained Army officer thrown into a whirlpool of deadly battle between mankind and alien creatures. Chain of events enables him to increase his combat skills and teaming up with another battle hero; he changes the outcome of the war.<br/><br/>Review: Once again Doug Liman exemplified an outstanding skill of directing this sci-fi action pack movie, which will definitely grip the audience with its story, cinematography and action scenes. The story is the perfect blend of an alien invasion, war, action and time loop. This movie shows the best ever combination of aliens and time manipulation. Doug Liman has made sure that the film will not digress from its sci-if action genre and emotional quotient will be very less to the story. <br/><br/>Asusual, Tom cruise acting skills are at its best, and we wonder whether he will ever be ageing off in reality. His agility in actions sequence are great and the way he portraits the character of Lt.Col Bill Cage, who is a media face of U.S Army, forcibly thrown into ongoing war against the horrid aliens is simply AMAZING. <br/><br/>The punch line of the film ""Come find me when you wake up"", by Emily blunt to tom cruise, when he warns her of an immediate consequences is the crux of the story. Rita Vrataski is the character played by Emily Blunt a woman warrior and a face of campaign against alien invasion. She has justified this character well and according to me would be face to watch out in the future action movies. <br/><br/>War scenes are directed brilliantly and uncovering of story is done with great sense. The time looping concept around which the film revolves is very new and makes sense of how the story unravels in the end. Editing of the film is unquestionable and makes the film duration shorter without losing any serious plot. The soundtrack suits to the central theme of the film. On the scale of 1 to 5,I would rate this film with 4 points."

Some basic traits that made this movie excel in comparison to, say, Transformers(part 2 onwards..) and Pacific Rim are wittiness,a good overall cast and the effort they made to make us believe in the plot. Yes, it was always going to be action packed with BIG robotic arms and GIANT aliens but the director managed to create a basic and a believable story-line in between these action sequences. The time wrap concept is handled cleverly so that viewers doesn't get bored with it. Cast did a decent job with whatever roles given to them. Cruise and Blunt looked great together (fighting at least..) and i was relieved that they didn't cast some younger female lead(age between 20 to 25 yrs..) opposite Cruise.

"griffolyon12","7","1","3","8 June 2014"," Spoiler Alert -- Tom Cruise Dies!
","Tom Cruise dies over and over again in the new sci-fi/action film, Edge of Tomorrow, having to relive the same day each time he dies. In the film, Earth has been invaded by aliens who can relive days, with Tom Cruise's character accidentally tapping into this power and trying to use it to end the war. It's a little complicated to wrap your head around at first, but the movie quickly catches you up to speed and before long you're playing by the filmmakers' rules. <br/><br/>I'll go ahead and get to the point, this movie is fun. If you're looking for explosions, laughs, and some generally likable characters, you can't find another new movie out in theaters this weekend that will sate your appetite the same way this film does. With all of that said, the film doesn't give you more than a little taste of what could have been. <br/><br/>I haven't read the manga this film is based off of, but from the very first frame of the film, there felt like there was something missing here. Sure, the story is coherent and engaging enough to warrant seeing, but I kept feeling like there was something special in this premise that still remains buried underneath the surface. I feel that the film often barrels forward with the narrative at the cost of the characters. <br/><br/>Majority of the film is told from Tom Cruise's perspective, but every now and then we are told he's lived a scenario multiple times without actually seeing him living and learning from that particular scenario. It's not necessarily a plot hole, it just feels rushed and not as fulfilling as it would be if we saw these moments happen. It's this rapid fire narrative that makes it hard to invest fully in the relationship between Tom Cruise and his kick butt love interest, played by Emily Blunt. The moments where Cruise falls for her aren't often represented on screen and are just inferred as having happened, so we don't quite feel it.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Edge of Tomorrow comes close at times to being something special, but always falls just short. In many ways, I think had the film taken more time developing the relationships while also basking a little bit more in the wonder of the futuristic technology, and taken more time to build up the suspense before action scenes, the film would have been stronger. I really don't say this all that often, but I honestly believe that had the movie been maybe thirty minutes longer, and done a few of the aforementioned things, it could have been a science fiction classic, but as it is, Edge of Tomorrow is merely a fun Summer movie. Even so, Edge of Tomorrow has enough explosions and enjoyable moments to keep you entertained. Bottom line, if you're wanting to just sit back and go on a roller coaster ride for two hours, this is the right film for you this weekend.<br/><br/>I give Edge of Tomorrow a 7 out of 10!"
"fallyhag","9","1","3","8 June 2014"," One of the best films of 2014 so far...
","I was on a downward trend with Tom Cruise so my real reason was to watch Emily Blunt. An English Rose :)<br/><br/>The film doesn't hang about and gets straight into the story. Aliens and invasion etc...the normal thing. But the characters are enough to make you look through the cliché. But what really wins here is the subtle humour. The play with the Groundhog Day storyline and Emily's character. It just works.<br/><br/>Okay so the story keeps resetting and they have to do things again. But the way it is told does make it interesting. It shouldn't be...but it is. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the story flow and liked the characters. The action was fast and chaotic but it worked. I was left curious as to how they were going to resolve this. However, I kept having a niggle that I kinda knew how it might end. The reason I haven't given this a 10 is because it kinda fell flat for me as it got nearer the end. The trip to that Capital city was a little anti-climatic and rushed just to end the film. Or thats how it felt. Then the ending was a little unimaginative. <br/><br/>But I wasn't left disappointed or annoyed. The film was good. One of the best I have seen this year...but it could have been better...near the end. <br/><br/>I would certainly recommend this. Its an action film with some feeling and some good humour. It is a good film. Hope you enjoy :)"
"YasheshJ","8","1","3","7 June 2014"," Doug Liman finally delivers again after Bourne Identity. Cruise is grand; Blunt matches him equally.
","Of late, mainstream cinema is once again seeing some solid films with time loop as an underlying plot, e.g., SOURCE CODE, LOOPER; and now, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is another deserving addition to that list. <br/><br/>Strong Points—<br/><br/>Emily Blunt: plays a headstrong and beautiful leader. No wonders Cruise's character didn't mind being murdered by her time and again! She is not there for eye candy; complements Cruise in each and every frame, and makes her presence felt strongly. Apparently, she underwent some intensive physical training, along with yoga, while preparing for the role. Effort clears shows and works well for the film.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise: his popularity and dashing looks are more than enough to make a film box office success; however, these qualities often overshadow his performance and we tend to overlook how robust a performer this man has been. Ever since TOP GUN Cruise has been a consistent actor, always delivering the goods for his productions. This film is no different; stardom aside, he excels in the role. Watch out for his transformation from a mildly timid man into a leader and ultimate savior. <br/><br/>Screenplay: terrifically done! A lot of cine goers prefer a certain degree of complexity in a film dealing with non-linearity, and most times the complexity simply can't be avoided. Here, the makers purposely put together a storyline that should come across as elementary to every casual cine enthusiast—so, don't expect a PRIMER or even SOURCE CODE. Very cleverly, the repeat scenes are first shown in length, and then, after a few replays once audience is also well acquainted with all that is happening, arbitrary cut-to scenes to the relevant point in storyline are used. <br/><br/>Blunt and Cruise: love story angle is nicely intertwined into the plot without ever overdoing it or impacting the storyline. When a hottie and hunk hook up some love-sparks are bound to flare; good thing makers didn't ignore this natural human disposition in favor of: duty/saving the world comes first.<br/><br/>Good humor throughout. Supporting cast is majorly a part of comical elements of the film.<br/><br/>A minor weakness was the ending. It wasn't at all disastrous but should have been left at Blunt sacrificing herself to give Cruise a shot at delivering the killer blow and killing Omega, and dying himself in the process. However, the film did maintain an amorous and somewhat humorous tone throughout, so perhaps director went for a happy ending. Furthermore, when Cruise and Blunt were tracking down the omega, they came across an idyllic house; in that scenario I so wanted a little display of intimacy! It might have been calamitous for the plot; except, we never know...maybe it did happen :)<br/><br/>Plot does seem like a concoction of ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Starship Troopers"" but it is not blatantly lifted, rather reworked purposefully. Special effects are expectedly good, and so is alien (Mimcs) design.<br/><br/>Final verdict: this is Doug Liman best work after the masterful ""Bourne Identity"" and I hope he keeps at it now! Indeed a fast-paced, entertaining, and high-octane showdown that deserves a big-screen outing.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Trivia: Verdun and D-Day (Normandy) are clearly references to World Wars; there is also one reference to TERMINATOR's judgement by a Sergeant Farell played Bill Paxton!"
"Argemaluco","7","1","3","7 June 2014"," Edge of Tomorrow is entertaining, but not very memorable
","If we can swallow the fact that Edge of Tomorrow is basically Groundhog Day with aliens, we will encounter an entertaining film with an ingeniously planned screenplay and excellent special effects. And even though that's not enough to make it something brilliant or very memorable, it works properly as a pleasant experience. Co- screenwriters Jez Butterworth, Christopher McQuarrie and John-Henry Butterworth have fun with the temporal loop concept, which allows them to kill the hero in many occasions, and at the same time brings him a kind of immortality which is explored with humor and enough logic in order to excuse the most improbable elements from the premise. And I estimate that that will be the main weak point from Edge of Tomorrow... some spectators will accept the ridiculous explanation about time travel, and other ones won't. I personally found it too forced, even though it brings some interesting dramatic levels to the film. Tom Cruise brings a weak performance in Edge of Tomorrow, because he feels listless and bland. I could never feel the intensity and conviction from his best performances; and it's not even necessary to compare it with his classic action roles in Mission: Impossible or Top Gun. It's enough with remembering the work he brought last year in Oblivion, a sci-fi film with multiple ideas taken from better movies; even there, Cruise showed much more life and passion. By the way, the description of Oblivion also applies to Edge of Tomorrow: a series of burrowed concepts (the temporal loop from Groundhog Day, the mechanic suits from Starship Troopers 3: Marauder, the overwhelming combat from Saving Private Ryan, the cyclic drama from the ""Cause and Effect"" episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, etc.), but ready-made in a story with enough personality in order to earn an own identity, as long as we can excuse its most extreme ravings. In conclusion, Edge of Tomorrow deserves a moderate recommendation as an entertaining sci-fi film. However, it lacks of that ""magical touch"" in order to be something memorable."
"oscaralbert","7","1","3","7 June 2014"," Has anyone else noticed that Tom Cruise is plagued . . .
",". . . by machines rising out of the ground to attack him? Perhaps it began most famously with TOP GUN in 1986, when his ""Maverick"" character was just moseying along in a jet, only to be assaulted by surface-to-air missiles. Then in 2002's MINORITY REPORT, Cruise's ""Chief John Anderton"" incarnation was pursued by spidery metal eyeballs scurrying across floors to spy on him. Most people thought the culmination of robotic attacks from beneath upon Mr. Cruise would be WAR OF THE WORLDS in 2005, when massive machine-bound aliens awoke from millenniums of sleep underground just because Tom's ""Ray Ferrier"" was walking over their ""graves."" No such luck. Where Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s ""Rod Tidwell"" character loudly demanded that Cruise's 1996 JERRY MAGUIRE title sports agent ""Show me the money!,"" Tom must yell at his own agent to ""Show me the sneaky robots!"" If you cross MINORITY REPORT spiders with the WAR OF THE WORLD robot suits, you get the ""meteorite attackers"" for EDGE OF TOMORROW. Though simple calculations prove that the mass of all the spider-bots shown in EDGE OF TOMORROW would have required a space object twice the size of Manhattan to contain them all (which would have been detected by astronomers years from earth, and blown to smithereens by our nuclear shield), who expects realism from Tom Cruise flicks?"

","It's June, and, on schedule, here come the movies that will keep young people entertained. The Edge of Tomorrow is part of the first wave of films targeted at the young people. <br/><br/>A non-stop special effects extravaganza, Tom Cruise is Major Cage, a reluctant hero who must fight the same battle over and over. The script resembles ""Groundhog Day"" where Bill Murray lives the same day over and over. Characters in The Edge of Tomorrow return to the same moment on the day before a major battle. Weird that I saw the movie on D-Day, and the footage of the Normandy invasion resembles the footage of the big battle.<br/><br/>Unlike Groundhog Day which is about a man improving himself to the point where he is ready for a relationship with Andie MacDowell, The Edge of Tomorrow is about saving the world from alien invaders. Major Edge returns to the same moment in time after being killed on the field of battle. Each time he is killed he learns something new about the impossible odds which confront the human race. When in battle, he and the rest of the forces on the field must kill alien spidery things covered in tentacles. They are somewhat hard to kill, and they are under the command of a big giant brain. <br/><br/>Virtually infinite number of spidery things and unlimited numbers of new lives available to Major Edge give the film a video game quality. Fighters shoot and kill the spidery things. As they become more able to predict the behavior of the spidery things, the fighters move to different environments. The top level of the game is the final battle with the giant alien brain."

Those aliens look pretty familiar: somehow they seem copy/pasted from Matrix sentinels (nothing to bother too much about). <br/><br/>Beside the textbook drama, besides the high quality CGI, the movie is empty and predictable. Do not expect deep content. This is pure entertainment and nothing to think about but from the top to the bottom of your popcorn bag. Therefore: If you like Sci-Fi, if you like entertainment, if you like CGI: This flick is yours."
"socrates99","9","1","3","7 June 2014"," I came, I saw, I got my money's worth. What else is there?
","This is a tricky premise. How to shoot a movie where a lot of the action is repetition? First, get two excellent actors as leads. Second, don't scrimp on the CGI or the artistic vision. And, lastly, get good writers involved.<br/><br/>I'd have to say that each of these, in order, was progressively less successful but still far better than most. The movie was especially memorable for its acting. Both Cruise and Blunt are in fine form. Blunt who I hadn't really noticed that much in other movies, definitely got my attention and admiration this time. The woman clearly understood all of the plot's ramifications and was every bit the committed soldier the story required. It was oddly moving to see. Most women don't really seem to understand what combat would mean. Cruise actually dialed it back a bit to start, but was skillfully in full action mode by its end.<br/><br/>A bit less enticing was the CGI and the alien antagonists though not enough to hurt or spoil the movie. The aliens are wonderfully aggressive though they seem to have been designed to do no more than wreak mayhem. I think if it were me I'd work on them a bit more, make them a little less frantic though what they've already filmed must have cost a fortune. The rest of the CGI was excellent and no complaints.<br/><br/>The last ingredient, the plot, could also use a little more work, but here I feel I'm being a bit of a perfectionist. The story's main idea is hard to miss and, in total, is well executed here considering what they're trying to describe. Few will be unmoved despite the bizarre premise and even though some of the details may have been lost.<br/><br/>The fact is I smiled to myself several times during this movie and afterward didn't feel in the least disappointed. I'd been thoroughly entertained and even intellectually challenged.<br/><br/>A great time at the movies!"

","Last night I've seen this movie and can't wait to write a review on IMDb. Not even a single dull moment through out the film. Theater was filled with full of laughs and claps. Intense action sequences, amazing visual effects, artistically crafted alien creatures, the humor which makes your face hurt, captivating story telling and a slight touch of emotions are pros of this movie.<br/><br/>Since it's a sci-fi and time-loop movie I thought story line would be very complex to understand and the repetitive scenes would bore me but as it turns out, the story line is gripping, suspenseful, intense and easily understandable and they took good care of repetitive scenes which are extremely funny.<br/><br/>I don't have to talk about Tom Cruise 'cause he's the beast of action movies and Emily Blunt is very good as per usual and great work by Doug Liman.<br/><br/>I bet in the last fifteen minutes, your jaws would drop with amazement and I felt that 1hr 50 minutes have quickly passed, I wish this movie is bit more longer and to my surprise the post credits song is super freaking cool. Don't miss it."
"ccponds","10","1","3","6 June 2014"," Edge of your seat entertainment from start to finish
","Fun, action packed, and well written are just several compliments I give this film. I rarely go into the theater with high expectations, but sometimes I cannot help myself. The rare times I do go in with my expectations through the roof, I usually come out disappointed. This was not the case with ""Edge of Tomorrow"". This film is not just another run of the mill sci-fi film. Instead, it is the movie that could very well pave the way for video game films of the future. It takes a simple idea of ""resetting"" a battle and turns it into one of the most gripping stories I have seen at the cinema in recent years. Despite the fact that this story contains a decent number of nods to video games, it does not feel like it is about a video game. It still is a movie that is very story driven, but with the same amount of action that modern shooter games contain. The battles in this film are visually stunning, and they fit into the story perfectly. They do not come across as just another way of showing the audience the next ""summer blockbuster"". Each one, even the repeated ones, are filled with elements that make them memorable, and will stick with a person for long after he or she leaves the theater. One of the most surprising aspects of this film was the way that it managed to tell the overall story. As much as I was looking forward to it, I was worried that the film would feel a little long and redundant (considering the whole 'live, die, repeat' formula it showcased in the trailers). But instead, this films direction and storytelling are what make it standout. It successfully keeps the audience wondering what is new (what has not happened yet) and what has been ""repeated"". All in all, this film honestly was the one I was worried would not live up to my VERY high expectations, yet it met every one of them and then some. I was laughing, I was holding my breath, I was biting my nails, I was blow away. As of now, and likely until the end of December, this film is my movie of the year."

","Edge of Tomorrow is a very intelligent sci-fi thriller that doesn't let you lean back into your seat after the first ten minutes or so. It may seem that you're in for a routine post-apocalyptic one trick pony at the start, but then when you realize what just happened, you shall seek permanent refuge on the edge of your seat. It is a film that makes you think. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is shot in amazing light, has brilliant sound effects and will go down as one of the best films of this year.

"palme20","10","1","3","6 June 2014"," Edge of (my seat) is more like it!
","First.. I would watch this movie as many times as Cage (Tom Cruise) dies in the movie. (Okay maybe that's an overstatement, but the movie was seriously THAT good). <br/><br/>One of the greatest things about this film is that nothing was overdone. There was just the right amount of action, drama, romance, thrill, and sci-fi to make this film one cohesive, compelling story, without going off onto to tangents (as many films do by including draggy love scenes, or over complex scientific explanations for events). Every aspect of this film is weighed and measured to craft a well-balance feast for our insatiable minds, and that prowess speaks to the ability of both the director and the editor(s). Undoubtedly, the editing of this film must have been painstaking and intricate. Trying to figure out how much of each day was enough to keep the audience following along, without being overplayed must have been quite the process. <br/><br/>I think some people might be turned off from this movie because when the plot is said out loud it sounds sort of flat: ""A movie about a guy who lives the same day over and over again, and dies a lot."" Okay, so what's to keep us from getting bored while the filmmakers hit replay dozens of times? That's simple: a powerful, moving performance by Cruise. Not once can I recall a scene where Cage was left out. The audience intimately follows his journey, both mentally and physically, and Cruise makes the surreality of the story come to life in our own minds and eyes. <br/><br/>Speaking of eyes, there is plenty of awesome robotic technology for us to marvel at, as well as the appearance of the enemy creatures, who look like something we hope never to encounter, and move at terrifying speeds with grace and precision.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is definitely worth seeing in 3D or standard format. So go see it! And maybe you'll be left wishing you could reset the day and watch it again (without paying the ticket price of course)."
"rgkarim","8","1","3","6 June 2014"," Time Loop, Butt Kicking Action
","Science fiction is a genre that is by far my favorite to watch and review. The worlds and creatures created stretch the imagination and allow for a variety of qualities to be built into the story, i.e. horror, action, etc. Of course, many recent sci-fi films fall below expectations, with the trailers often more entertaining than the actual movie itself. So when I saw the trailer for Edge of Tomorrow (EOT), I was entranced, but skeptical as to what they would bring to the table. Would it be repetitive? Would it have the action promised? Would Tom Cruise annoy the heck out of me? What did I think about this most anticipated movie? Read on to find out. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen the trailers, EOT is a time paradox movie centering on Major Cage (Cruise) and his battle against the metallic Mimic army. After a failed operation, the first time, Cage develops the ability to relive the day before the invasion over and over again, training under super solider Rita (Emily Blunt) to stop the invasion. Now like most scene repeat movies, there is a looming threat of becoming bored with the repetitive scenes and sequences. Some movies know how to keep up the entertainment value, but others use repetition as merely a tool to get more length at a fraction of the price. In this movie, the movie remains entertaining, only occasionally becoming drab as Cage fails training, often in some comedic scream or landing. Yet, director Doug Liman manages to keep the other elements intertwined with the repetition, allowing the story to unfold in a rather efficient manner. The fact that he keeps the scenes funny as well makes the repetition relevant to the story and actually worth watching.<br/><br/>Of course comedy wasn't what I was going for mainly in this movie; I was all about the action the trailers promised. I'll admit in the beginning I was worried that I would be disappointed, as the first battle was merely a sequence of running, death, and convulsive, dizzying camera work. Luckily, both aspects improved, the first battle merely a diluted taste of what is to come, the camera work occasionally getting unstable at parts. As Cage grows stronger in the art of war, becoming adrenaline-pumping carnage that fans will love. While the scenes are nowhere near as long as I wanted, they are well adapted to drive the movie, allowing for strategy and planning to be integrated with gunplay. There were a lot of similarities to the final battle from the Matrix Revolutions, but the story and strategy helped EOT stand out on its own. However, Rita and Cage are primarily an army of two against the swarm of machines, while the other soldiers are merely CGI cannon fodder for the glowing beasts, which brings me to my next point. <br/><br/>The movie focuses on pretty much only these two with a few cameos and interjections from others here and there. Now surely this comes to no surprise, so there should be no complaints right? For the most part I agree, Blunt and Cruise work well together, their chemistry was very good, almost as if being two soldiers caught in an infinite time loop was their job. The main complaint I had though was that despite the amount of screen time they had, the two characters didn't have much development past fighting the war. Bits and pieces of their lives unfolded, more so Rita's, yet half of the pertinent information was kind of blown over and pointless. What was the point of such intricate details if you weren't going to use them in the first place? I guess in such a limited time span and such dire circumstances there is only so much bonding you can do. Luckily the story to uncover the secret of the machines has enough suspense and ""mystery"" to make up for the lack of character development. However, it cannot make up for the introduction of the J squad and doing practically nothing with them. The squad does have some comedic relief and has a few useful moments, but I felt they were rather useless in the grand scheme of things. Oh well, when you get decent, graphic technological warfare, you probably don't care much about the other infantry. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow has a lot of good qualities that make it one of the better science fiction movies in the recent years. While the action is not what I expected, it is well balanced with comedy and plot to help keep the movie suspenseful. The acting is pretty solid, and fans of Tom Cruise will enjoy the scientologist's latest project of whipping CGI butt. Just don't expect much detailed character development in anybody else, or any life lessons because it is not there. As for watching it in 3-D, I could see a lot of potential, but truth is the 2-D was awesome, and you save yourself a few bucks. Check this one out in theaters. <br/><br/>My scores for this film are:<br/><br/>Action/Sci-Fi: 8.5 Overall: 8.0"
"bbickley13-921-58664","9","1","3","6 June 2014"," This was a awesome Film!!
","I came into the film a little nervous because the last Sci-Fi film Tom Cruse did, Oblivion was not the best (although I like the ending).<br/><br/>I felt a similar tone to Oblivion in Edge of Tomorrow, which is about William Cage, played by Tom Cruse, who dies in combat and wakes up starting the day over again and discovers this is the same ability the aliens have when he meets Rita Vrataski, played by Emily Blunt, who trains him to help her win the war. However, the movie itself turn out to be far greater than Oblivion.<br/><br/>I read an article in the Village Voice stating that Tom Cruse is the last movie star, and I guess he tries to prove it with this one, hyping up the charm and charisma that made him a movie star in the first place. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt is very sexy in this film in an Ellen Ripley from the Alien movies sort of way. I love bad ass girls on the big screen and Blunt gives it too us bad ass. <br/><br/>The action sequences are very impressive. Not too CGI looking, but I caught a few moments when the action played like a video game. The alien antagonist was pretty game-like as well, with no kind of real personality.<br/><br/>The movie was fun as well. It was everything a Blockbuster should be. Good one Mr. Cruise."
"RichardSRussell-1","8","1","3","6 June 2014"," Groundhog D-Day with BFGs
","Edge of Tomorrow (PG-13, 1:53, Imax, 3-D) — SF, biggie, original<br/><br/>Officially sourced from the Hiroshi Sakurazaka novel All You Need Is Kill, this movie will never escape the comparison to Groundhog Day, where the protagonist (here Tom Cruise instead of Bill Murray) is required to live the same day over and over until he gets it right and can finally escape into the future. What, does that make it derivative? Yeah, sure, because it reworks a concept so overused that you can remember picky little details of its predecessor — like the snowball fight or the alarm-clock song — 21 years later. When's the last time you saw a hair's-breadth escape from a car crash, volley of gunfire, or exploding bomb and thot to yourself ""Golly, THAT'S original!""<br/><br/>The comparison I encourage you to make is to Greg Bear's Nebula-winning short story ""Hardfought"".<br/><br/>Here the day being relived occurs not in placid Punxsatawney, PA, but rather on the beaches of Normandy. Not the Normandy of D-Day 1944 (tho the movie was released on its 70th anniversary, doubtless by pure coincidence) but rather one of the near future, when a meteor smashing into Hamburg, Germany (seen briefly in an opening montage of TV news clips), has emitted a ravening horde of kinetic alien sea anemones that rapidly overspread Europe like, um, a ravening horde of Nazis (maps included). Human resistance seems futile until the Battle of Verdun (no, not THAT one, THIS one), when a heroine emerges: Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), quickly dubbed ""the Angel of Verdun"", who seems to be everywhere on the battlefield, able to anticipate the enemy's every move and provide just the right counter to it. On TV news coverage, this is credited by US Army Major William Cage (Cruise), a former PR flack, to ""new technology"". <br/><br/>Of course, as is customary in war, the first casualty of battle is the truth. There was no new technology involved. Instead, as we soon learn, Vrataski's abilities were a fluke, the result of her having been initially killed at the Battle of Verdun by an alpha-type alien that got some of its blood on her. It turns out that alpha blood, now mixed with hers, enables her to restart the day whenever she dies. So that's what she does, hundreds of times, each time learning exactly what to do to avoid her previous death until she finally prevails.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more. There's a flaw in her plan of continual resurrection. Eventually she's just wounded instead of killed, she gets a blood transfusion, and that thins out her time-shifting abilities to the point where they no longer work. Now she's just an ordinary soldier (tho admittedly by far the most experienced one on the planet), when into her lap drops Cage, a former ROTC guy who isn't trained for warfare, isn't any good at it, and wants nothing whatever to do with it. That's why he too was killed (also by a splattery alpha, as it happens) 5 minutes into the invasion he was press-ganged into. Rita's job becomes to prepare him for combat, join him on the battlefield, and keep killing him until he gets it right.<br/><br/>Of course, each day that Cage comes back, he's initially confronted with non-coms who think he's just a shirker looking to desert as soon as possible, so he has to figure out a reliable way of outwitting them as quickly as possible so he can get busy with the real work. The movie gives us 1 or 2 quick tastes of what this must be like without beating it to death. The rest of the film is building up the choreography step by step, using trial and error, without ever having seen the full dance demoed.<br/><br/>Hanging like a sword of Damocles over the whole proceeding is the knowledge that the alien's central controlling omega organism — Cage and Rita's ultimate goal — is itself capable of fiddling with time.<br/><br/>After you walk out of the theater, you may find yourself asking questions like ""Where was our air support?"", ""Why didn't we just nuke 'em with ICBMs?"", or ""Why was Paris awash in water?"", but none of that occurs to you in the midst of the action, which is a mark of a movie that effectively causes you to suspend your disbelief."

Without naming specifics of the story, there is a message about growth and strength, and about how we learn from out mistakes. Most people won't pick this out of course, because the writers have made no attempt to make these allusions obvious - for the general audience this is a clever and exciting action movie, with some good laughs thrown in for good measure, and a little character involvement. <br/><br/>Very worth seeing, if you want that engaging ""ride"" people go to the cinema for."

","As reviews go on here, there is a lot of regurgitation of the premise to fill up space and not a lot of fresh ideas shared by people writing reviews. Unfortunately, I'm no genius, but I'll do my best as I've decided to write a review for this movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, I read in the Cineplex magazine (paraphrasing)""If you like Tom Cruise, he's at his best, and if you don't, he dies like 300 times."" I had a laugh at that because the most common complaint I hear about actors like Tom Cruise is that they're in every scene in their movies, which is true with this movie.<br/><br/>I was excited to see this movie because I'm pro Sci-fi, so there's my bias in action. I read some reviews on here and I heard some comparison to a ""Ground Hog Day"" meets....(sci-fi action)...my one stipulation to this, is that I recognize a lot more in common with the popular video game ""StarCraft"". This slashes my hopes for a future StarCraft movie, but on the same note, the aliens were done so well, and the movie so good and relatively creative and imaginative - with a lot of detail to small things Sci-Fi fans like - that I'm not upset that a StarCraft-like movie was made. And, like ""Ground Hog Day"", the character repeats some scenes with different outcomes, but the flow of the movie is a lot faster and dedicates less time to the learning curve than Bill Murray's movie does.<br/><br/>I felt the movie could have been a bit longer, and perhaps slowed down its fast pace in the middle of the movie to develop the characters some more, but, then again, I always say the movie could have been longer if I enjoyed it. Hopefully you will/did too, as more Sci-Fi movies like this need to be made.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading."

","""What I am about to tell you sounds crazy. But you have to listen to me. Your very lives depend on it. You see, this isn't the first time."" Lt. Col. Bill Cage (Tom Cruise)<br/><br/>Although Edge of Tomorrow could have felt like Source Code on steroids or living Groundhog Day over and over, it doesn't. Thanks to The Usual Suspect's writer, Christopher McQuarrie, and his colleagues, this sci-fi engages your mind with scenarios that repeat but don't get old because the film doesn't either, despite the fact that the repetitive cycling through past and present has been worked over in film ad nauseum.<br/><br/>Cage (Tom Cruise) is a soldier in a battle against Mimics, spider- octopus-like creatures doing a successful job taking over earth. That Cage begins as a reluctant combatant is a chance for the usually heroic Cruise to play against type. As much as we dislike Cage, he retains his sense of humor and the trademark Cruise self deprecation. In other words, Cruise is the linchpin of the film's success.<br/><br/>Yet, Emily Blunt as Rita, the global soldier-hero, commands attention next to Cruise because she's a delicate actress who steps up to a warrior role and gives some of Cruise's sense of humor companionship. More than that nuance is the low-key romance between the two warriors, a joyful all- business attitude strong and sexy in its minimalism.<br/><br/>While the plot requires some attention, and I consider that a plus, the demons are hardly unique, and their mother source hidden on earth is nothing new in fighting screen aliens either. What saves the repetitive trope is the sardonic script and superior acting, not forgetting that the estimable Brendan Gleeson plays the stodgy general who makes sure Major Cage is Private Cage. In addition, James Herbert's (Sherlock Holmes) editing from past to present is smooth and flawless.<br/><br/>For those of you who would like to see Cruise die multiple times, this is the film for you. For those of us who have enjoyed his knowing swagger and youthful energy, he is, in his early 50's, a film star who can."

","I was not really sure what to expect when I went to see this movie and who was staring in it other than Cruise and Blunt. I was quite surprised to see Paxton and whole list of British and Southern Irish faces on the screen.<br/><br/>The story was well scripted and constructed. The main drive of the movie is to win the war everything else is secondary. This is done at a fast past, so you will need to remain focused to keep up. This is not a boy meets girl movie but a man with a gun on a mission to win a war by all means where necessary.<br/><br/>The repeat were cleverly done so as not to bore you. It would have been nice to see more of Blunt and Paxton in the movie but this did not distract from the plot themselves.<br/><br/>The special effect were first rate, well grounded and realistic without being mind blowing or over spectacular.<br/><br/>There is a lot of killing in the movie but the effects are more to the level of the ""Terminator"" rather than ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>There are some humorous and romantic bits in the movie but this is a gun tooting fast paced action packed movie."
"s_campanale","8","1","3","1 June 2014"," Here we go again - Cruise cruises through Video Game pseudo-movie with Emily becoming a Blunt instrument and Liman lending a Light touch.
","Another year another Tom Cruise mind-frakk Sci-Fi puzzle picture with a top androgynous Brit actress! After last year's pleasing though not universally admired 'Oblivion' now comes 'Edge of Tomorrow', based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel and directed by Doug Liman, author of the original 'Bourne Identity' <br/><br/>'TBI' was a very different movie to the two Greengrass sequels, more gay-spirited, lightweight romantic Euro-adventure than the dark, oppressive and more politically oriented films that followed and this film is very much in that tradition. It is a light, fun, breezy film that wants to take you on a crazy ride and have a good time getting there and that's it. <br/><br/>The setup is simple enough. Yet another alien invasion threatens the Earth after a meteorite/troopship hits Germany and squiggly luminous polip-lion creatures are taking over Europe just as the Germans and Italians did in WWII (No subtlety at all here) Humanity responds with mini-mech suited legions and plans a great beach landing at Normandy (still no subtlety!) Slick PR guy Major Cage (Cruise) manages to pees off General Brigham (Brendon Gleeson) and ends up press ganged into the landings where he dies in the act of killing an 'Alpha', the blue hued officer class of the alien hoard with a direct link to their leader 'The Mind'. However he wakes up at the same point on the same day and finds himself repeating the same thing every time, yet learns by his mistakes and survives longer every time and becomes a better soldier as a result. Then he meets the Allies star warrior, Rita Krasinsky (Buffed and Womaned-up Emily Blunt) who had experienced a similar thing herself before her great victory at the decisive battle of Verdun (Subtlety totally absent!) Turns out Cage has inherited the powers of the Alpha, who is an avatar of The Mind and can 'reset time' once killed so it can have the strategic edge over its enemies every time.So the two team up and try to get to the 'boss level' Mind, getting a little further every time until they are tricked by false visions into a trap. Only way to locate The Mind now is to obtain the top secret device invented by wacky MOD scientist Dr Carter (Noah Taylor) which involves some 'Mission Impossible' shenanigans at Whitehall during which Cage is injured and gets a blood transfusion which robs him of his 'time reset' powers as it did Krasinsky. Now very mortal, the duo recruit the rough jarheads of J- Squad on a Dirty half-Dozen mission to Paris to take out The Mind by any means necessary.<br/><br/>As this précis suggests, Sakurazaka's story is very much a gamer universe with the 'fight-die-repeat-get better-advance through the levels till you reach boss level' reality of most console adventures and it is no surprise to learn that Sakurazaka's background was as a games designer. So what we have in effect is a film that plays like a game, instead of the endless movies based on games that don't, capturing perhaps for the first time the actual experience of gameplay. Of course it could have been fun to go beyond the actual narrative parameters of the story and have the character discover they were part of two universes, their own and that of 'the users', as we saw in 'Tron' and 'The Lego Movie', with the ensuing existential angst and metaphysical dilemmas, but that would have been another movie altogether. Liman is happy to play along with the concept and let it roll. Of course being so different to the traditional narrative structure yet without any extra dimensions or allusions it risks tiring an audience and wearing out their patience, so you have to know what you are going to get if you want to avoid disappointment. <br/><br/>The acting is not splendid but functional. Cruise nicely essays the journey from douche to hero better than most (those are his two set personas anyway so with either he is still in his comfort zone) but he is never stretched or taxed. Same goes for Emily Blunt, who has been to the gym and got herself a hard body which she shows off through wife- beater vests in a way that would make even Michelle Rodriguez proud. Of course someone like Rodriguez would have been a more natural first choice for this role, so it is brave casting to go for the normally very petite and elegant Blunt, who is however no stranger to odd-sci-fi. The two do not exactly have much of a chemistry, but given the situation and the whole 'wartime' milieu, it is perhaps intentional. Gleeson does his part well as does Bill Paxton as the hard ass Sargent. No mystery why he was cast, though sadly he never says 'Game Over' (Too obvious?) The rest are familiar character actors playing tough Space Marines and are never meant to rise above pure stereotype.<br/><br/>Action wise we see the same impressive aerial landing and beach battle (the one in the trailers) many times, and there is a nice 'ruined city' fight at the end, but none are THAT spectacular and after you've seen them again for the thirtieth time (including the trailers) they begin to lose their lustre. Special Effects are also OK but nothing extraordinary. The look of the movie is very much 90's, and that is probably down to Liman (or a tight budget) London gets to do Blockbuster duty again with Trafalgar Square, Waterloo Bridge and Whitehall all getting a pounding.<br/><br/>The second time travel 'change the future by replaying the past' summer flick after ""X-Men Days of Future Past"", it pales a little in comparison but is still easy and original fun (If you forget 'Groundhog Day' and 'Source Code' of course) if that is what you seek for a night out."
"YJLcool","8","1","3","2 June 2014"," A well-made sci-fi action comedy thriller, one of the good films of the year
","Although it is based on the widely-praised 2004 Japanese sci-fi light novel All You Need is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, Edge of Tomorrow is a film that reminds you of Groundhog Day (1993), Source Code (2011), Starship Troopers (1997) and Elysium (2013) due to the similarities of the plot elements. Therefore, comparisons are inevitable for some viewers for an alien invasion war film that features time loops and powered exoskeleton suits. But surprisingly, the film managed to stay fresh and entertain the audience with enough humour, action and suspense from start to finish.<br/><br/>The story is about an untrained US military officer, Major William Cage, who's just a spokesperson for the army in the United Defence Force with no battlefield experience whatsoever. He was demoted to private following an act of cowardice and being forcefully sent to the battlefield by the general to fight a losing war against the ""Mimics"" - invading aliens with the ability to efficiently respond to Earth's military combat strategies.<br/><br/>When Cage is sent to the front lines, he managed to kill a large and extremely rare Alpha Mimic by sheer luck but winds up dead. However, due to his exposure to the Alpha mimic's blood, Cage gains the time-loop ability to relive the same day over and over again each time he dies. Remembering what's going to happen when and where, Cage eventually managed to save Rita, a.k.a. 'Full Metal Bitch' who once had the same ability as him. With Rita's help, Cage's skill as a soldier grows in each subsequent time loop and they work together as a team to find a way to end the war. That's roughly how the story goes.<br/><br/>Despite its time-loop plot device, the film never feels tedious or repetitive due to the occasional humour that comes with Cage's time- looping experience. The repeated scenes were shot at different angles and Cage's response to the situation is different each time that it feels fresh even when he relives his day again. The relationship between Cage and Rita is nicely developed and the constant reintroduction between them is swiftly handled. It's surprisingly funny to see Rita shoots Cage for his countless failures during training and he needs to wake up, find her and get shot again and again. There's also another ridiculously funny scene where members of his squad find him for a fight due to his absence during the training, but Cage managed to remember the moves well that he's managed to avoid them with his eyes closed. The audience gets to see Cage's transition from a coward officer to a well- trained battlefield soldier throughout the film.<br/><br/>The visual effects in the film are top notch and the battle scenes with the Mimics were shot in a fast-paced manner that they keep you engaged at all times. The exoskeleton battle suits are fully utilised in battle, equipped with many weapons. Tom Cruise has always been committed his role in films. Once again, he's giving his best performance as the lead and doing all the stunts himself, which is quite impressive (take note, he's 51). Emily Blunt is a complete badass in her role as Rita, especially when she swings her big sword to kill several Mimics at a time. The origin, function and intention of the Mimics are well explained to the audience without much confusion. However, there's a slight complaint though: most of the cast (especially J squad) does not have any real character development at all and need to rely on exposition to know who they are.<br/><br/>Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is a well-made sci-fi action comedy thriller. It's funny, thrilling and action-packed, the story makes sense and everything falls into place nicely in the end. It's one of the good films released this year.<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/06/movie-review-edge-of-tomorrow.html<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","I saw the trailer for this film some time ago and was really looking forward to it coming out, the concept looked clever and combined with the action I had high hopes.<br/><br/>All I can say is for me that the film delivered on my expectations. I know the time loop thing as been done before and people are picking on this like it's wrong for a film to have similar plot devises or themes with any other film out there. It's really well handled in this film, the loops never become boring and there's even well placed humour amongst the action.<br/><br/>I enjoyed both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt's acting, both had important roles to play. As you gather from the trailer, Emily Blunts character is the mentor to Tom's inexperienced soldier. A part which she convincingly portrays.<br/><br/>I sat through this film and there were parts I can accurately use the phrase I was on the edge of my seat. I left the cinema with thoughts about the film buzzing round in my head. Try and imagine what it would be like to live the same horrible day over and over, to die again and again. If a film can leave you with interesting questions and get you talking about it with people then in my opinion it's done something right; that's what a good piece of entertainment does.<br/><br/>Don't just take my word for it, go and see it."
"ODDBear","8","1","3","29 May 2014"," Fun flick
","I went into this pretty blank; hadn't even seen the trailer - just the tag line ""Live-Die-Repeat"" and already I thought of ""Groundhog Day"". Little did I imagine that this would, in fact, be somewhat of a kindred spirit to that comedy gem. <br/><br/>When all is said and done; ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is pretty entertaining and doesn't take itself all too seriously. Tom Cruise is in fine form and reminded me, at least, how likable a performer he can be. There are of course a number of action packed set pieces that look good and the special effects are top notch. There is at least one heartfelt moment midway through that I thought was well played out but the film pretty much steers away from sentimentality. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is good; Emily Blunt is a good match for Cruise and Bill Paxton is always fun as an army officer. <br/><br/>Minor spoiler alert.<br/><br/>I felt it lost a bit of steam towards the end but nothing detrimental as to ruining the whole experience. It's capped off with a ""what the..."" type of ending but it's not too mind bending and really is in good flow with the overall tone of the film. <br/><br/>End of minor spoiler.<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" was just plain fun and I recommend it."
"vistheindian","8","1","3","29 May 2014"," Biggest pleasant surprise
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>After an alien invasion, all of humanity unite together to fight a losing war. Cage (Tom Cruise), a rookie soldier, unknowingly gains the ability to relive the last day of his life every time he dies. With the help of a seasoned soldier, Rita (Emily Blunt) and his new found ability, Cage must find a way to win this war. Despite the generic alien-war synopsis, Edge of Tomorrow delivers an incredibly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi, with great humor. This is one of the best sci-fi action movies in a long time. You will no doubt leave the cinema very satisfied.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>When the first trailers were released, Edge of Tomorrow felt like yet another unoriginal movie with a brush of CGI to hide its faults and make it look pretty. I will admit, I should not have been so shallow, because Edge of Tomorrow is also pretty on the inside pretty freaking awesome.<br/><br/>The actors Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt were incredible to watch. Cruise has solidified himself as an action super-star over the years, and in this film you continue to see his dedication to every stunt and action scene. Emily Blunt does a great job portraying a skilled badass soldier as Rita Vrataski, a.k.a. Full Metal Bitch (admit it, that's a badass name). They both have very convincing character development and a great on-screen chemistry together.<br/><br/>The story involves Cage gaining the time-reset ability from the aliens, and how he uses it. This plot device does mean that some scenes are repeated to a certain extent. However, at no point did the repeated scenes feel repetitious. This is because there is always a change that is introduced, but more importantly it is because of the humor in this movie. Of all the surprises, that has to be the biggest one. The movie, especially the first half, is genuinely funny and that helps keep things engaging. It is a good balance to have this humor against the bleakness of the serious setting. <br/><br/>As for the action, it is exhilarating to watch. The clunky yet powerful exoskeletons the humans wear make for some cool fight scenes. The CGI is seamlessly rendered in every scene and is immediately impactful. The best part of the action scenes are the aliens themselves, with some very unique creature designs. Sci-fi elements of how the aliens function is well realized. Additionally to the designs, their movements are actually terrifyingly awesome. They move in a very chaotic and erratic manner, which makes fighting these aliens all the more intense.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow has all the elements of a fun summer blockbuster. It is action-packed, funny, has great memorable characters, and more. Some story elements may not be very original, but the way all the pieces come together is what makes it so great. This is a truly gripping movie from beginning to the end. I highly recommend checking it out."

","All that has to be said is Tom Cruise and Bill Paxton (Scientologists, among others) are in this Sci-Fi movie and has something to do with it's writing and productions. 'nuff said.

When the video game would be adopted into live action movie. it will be made like that. It's bizarre a little.<br/><br/>The savage thing was that he had to start over when he was killed.

","This movie is pretty poor in deepness (OK it's just more an action movie than real sci-fi) and some dialogues are almost dumb. But hey, it's Hollywood. I used to play Starcraft and I also watched more than once groundhog day, which was a great movie in my opinion, so I see the connection between the two worlds. It's there.<br/><br/>For me it's more or less a computer game connected with the learning process a guy makes repeating the day, than a real movie.<br/><br/>Nothing more.<br/><br/>Everything is moving fast and you don't really have the time or occasion to get into it. But when you start to think about the story line you can't ignore some discrepancies. If you are a coward you want became a tough guy ... it's character not training. But OK let it be. The change of strategy or the dialogues connected with the girl evolves sometimes as like she would remember the day before...but that can't be because it's only him going back.<br/><br/>OK, let's turn a blind eye to it.<br/><br/>The biggest discrepancy is the end. <br/><br/>***** spoiler alarm ******<br/><br/>The end of the movie is non sense pure... Cage was dying but he was still able to drop the bomb to kill Omega, Alpha was not able to stop him. Just to point it out: Cage was able to swim faster the the Alpha alien, but OK. And here it come to the non sense Omega dead, Cage dead, Alpha's blood gives the ability to Cage to go back in time. Cage is just sleeping through the night and wakes up in a helicopter the next day. How is this possible? Who took him out of the water? Why he wakes up the next day with his clean officer uniform?<br/><br/>Omega is dead war is over, all the dead of yesterday are now alive. Whaaat? How is this possible? If you go back in time OK it's logic, but if you skip the night the dead which were necessary to kill Omega are still dead. Otherwise nothing of it real happened and Omega should be still alive. What a paradox. The best part Rita and all the others never saw Cage before (the next day?? Once again who helped to kill the beast?). What kind of parallel universe is this? It's non sense. You can make it so stupid. I don't understand why are all the people so enthusiastic about this movie. Special effects great, acting OK, dialogues poor, paradox story line. 4 of 10 is more than fair."

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","4","8 April 2017"," Brilliant, thoroughly enjoyable
","Tom Cruise, dare I say, has been making really decent stuff these days, some of which is downright brilliant. Oblivion had its moments, carried on wings of an M83 score that was better than the film itself (hello Tron Legacy syndrome), Jack Reacher was solid badassery all round, but Edge Of Tomorrow is just pure class and could almost be considered an instant classic. I waited a long time to finally see it, because in most cases a pg-13 sci fi blockbuster starring Tom would be cause for me to cruise right on by in the Netflix/on demand lineup and pick something else. The reviews were uncommonly good though, and so I inevitably went for it. I'm sorry I waited, because it's flat out spectacular. What makes it so? Well, it is everything I described above. A sci fi, blow 'em up blockbuster starring Tom Cruise, packed to the gills with action, aliens and stuffed with more Independence Day fireworks than you can shake a stick at. The catch? It has the plot, script and character development to match. This is one seriously thought out story, with heroes who don't start off that way, conflict among the ranks of characters and genuine, honest to god arcs. You can hurl all the cash you want at a film and blow up as much stuff as you can, but if you don't have those core elements of story in place, and well so, you'll end up with a hollow piece of vapid space garbage (like that Independence Day sequel). No, this one earns its stripes, opening up during a chaotic intergalactic war between humans and a formidable alien race, who are winning fast and stamping out any hope for our race. Cruise plays a weaselly military PR puppet who talks tough but has never seen a moment of actual combat, until he's thrown directly into it by chance, with neither skills nor experience to keep him afloat. Stuck in a Groundhog Day esque time loop (I won't spoil the how and why, but it's a wicked smart premise that logically plays out), our coward gradually gains what it takes, day by day, to become a hero and save the planet. It takes a lot of dying and starting over though, each day beginning in the same fashion, the possibilities ripe for him to finally get that perfect round and win the day. Emily Blunt, that adorable badass, plays the most adorable badass thus far in her career, a resilient and vulnerable valkyrie who's rage at the marauding fiends burns through terrifically, providing moments of grit, warmth and humour as needed. Bill Paxton plays a gung-ho military honcho with the same gee whiz charm that made Pvt. Hudson (Aliens, for you plebs) so memorable, and Brendan Gleeson does a third act encore as another General who takes a fair bit of convincing to get onboard with their plan. It's so much fun you never want it to end, the high concept used for all it's worth, supported by truly inspired creature design, detailed steam punk style weaponry and old school Hollywood fanfare rationed out in deliciously measured portions, resulting in that perfect recipe, an effects driven crowd pleaser with the brains to back it up. Who knew they could still make that? It's a thing of beauty."

"joshuafagan-64214","10","1","4","19 May 2016"," The Perfect Blockbuster
","This a stellar, stellar action movie.<br/><br/>If you don't like this film, you're probably not a fan of action, sci-fi, or well-crafted stories. It's thrilling, emotional, well-paced, thoughtful, and dynamic.<br/><br/>The main 'gimmick' is that every time our hero, Captain Cage, gets killed, he gets to relive the same day. What day is that? After refusing to go on the front lines and threatening the crazy general who tried to force him there, he is captured and put on a high-risk squad as a private. He wakes up every day in London in chains, with a man yelling in his ear.<br/><br/>What is his squad for? Landing on the beaches of France- yes, there are more than a couple WWII shoutouts here- to stop an alien invasion. The design of the aliens is fairly average- they look like better versions of those things from the second two Matrix movies- but their society is fascinating. The humans won a victory at Verdun thanks to Sergeant Rita Vraski, and are now looking to expand on it with a full-scale invasion.<br/><br/>But the invasion goes badly. The aliens seem to know exactly what the humans are doing. Cage, having no experience, is killed, but before he dies, he gets the blood of the alien he killed on him, and gets to relive the days over and over again. Rita seems to know about his powers, and she tells him to come with her. The next cycle, he does, and he finds out she used to have his powers, but lost them when she was wounded- but not killed- and got a blood transfusion.<br/><br/>Sound confusing? It's not. The film does a fantastic job at saying just enough to let you know exactly what's going on without devolving into Wachowski-like speeches. If you ever get confused, just think of it as the Groundhog Day plot, only with more guns.<br/><br/>It is a fairly complex movie, one more fit for a novel than the big screen, which may explain its relative underperformance at the box office. If it weren't for Tom Cruise, it would have grossed less money. I greatly respect Mr. Cruise for using his star power to get this thing off the ground. He has my thanks.<br/><br/>I had some concerns about how they could translate the premise from something like Groundhog Day, which was a romantic comedy, to a serious action drama. I needn't have worried. They know exactly what they're doing. Because they don't stop for ten minutes to explain every little thing, you might miss the fact that they solved more problems than an overworked math teacher. It's all so seamless. The writing in this is really good. It's not the kind of flashy writing that gets you an Oscar, but it's the kind that gives you such a satisfying, mindblowing action movie. They actually play the premise better than Groundhog Day. GD is beloved and for good reason, but it has some pacing problems. This doesn't. It doesn't have to reach or contrive to be effective. For example, a sergeant gives Cage a speech about the importance of war and sacrifice. At first, it's merely typical army stuff. But you when you hear it again and again, having learned some new revelations each time, it rings more and more hallow. It's a very nice touch.<br/><br/>They also play it for great relationship drama. My favorite scene in the film comes when they stop into an abandoned house in the British countryside. Rita wants to fly a chopper, but he tries to convince her to take a car instead. Later, after Cage nurses her shoulder wound, Rita is ready to get going, but Cage tries to convince her to stay. At first, you think Cage just doesn't want to see her or hurt, or that he is trying to make a move on her, but then he reveals to her- and the audience- that they have been through this scenario before, and one of them always ends up dying. It's one of the most powerful moments in an action film ever.<br/><br/>I could go and gush about this film further, but I don't want to spoil its intense, twisting plot. Instead I'll simply say that the film is well-acted, well-shot, and the huge budget is very clearly on screen. The ending wouldn't work in a different movie, but here, it just feels right. If you love sci-fi action movies but wish they weren't stupid, here's your film. Enjoy. Then go watch it again. I know I will."

","See Edge of Tomorrow? The best way to explain it is in using movie maths. I'd put it as Independence Day plus Groundhog Day equals Edge of Tomorrow. You'll find other various combinations elsewhere but that sums it up. So if you like those two movies then you'll likely like this.<br/><br/>This Sci-fi etc centres around our hero (played by the very impressive Tom Cruise) reliving the moment trying to battle the alien invaders. Assisted by the ever impressive Emily Blunt, this film wraps together light romance, action, thrills and spills quite well. As soldiers on a mission for the sake of the earth itself, they usually have one chance. In this, Tom Cruise is a soldier who like in a computer game can start again to retry in a Groundhog Day manner.

","Edge of Tomorrow is one of the most brilliant, original sci-fi films to grace the big screen in recent years. Of course, it carries an infinite load of action sequences, but this is also a character story that infuses sci-fi themes like time travel in a way. The film is essentially a louder, sci-fi version of Groundhog Day. The film is not only fun, but it is also brainy which is hard to see in a sci-fi film nowadays. The film should have been seen by more people, because it's just that good. <br/><br/>Doug Liman's film is about a global war that is ongoing between the humans and these aliens. Major William Cage is sent into battle despite having no combat training. As the battle is just beginning, he dies. But he wakes up with day starting all over again thanks to making contact with one of the alien's blood. Along with the help of one of the world's best soldiers, Rita, Cage must relive the day over and over again until he can defeat the aliens. <br/><br/>The film has great acting. Tom Cruise is getting older, but he still can hold an action film on his own. There are no death-defying stunts here, but I feel that Cruise once again does a really good job. He is equally matched by the gorgeous Emily Blunt. I don't associate her with action movies, but this movie may have changed my mind. I also liked Bill Paxton as one of the army leaders. He is just quite funny. <br/><br/>Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is an excellent film that has such a well- founded, original premise. The action is heavy, but that doesn't stop the film from adding such good moments of characterization. As for popcorn summer blockbusters, it does not get any better than this. A sci-fi film that will actually make the audience think. A very good film with great visuals, good acting, and heavy on the action. <br/><br/>My Grade: A+"
"veronicastep","10","1","4","12 April 2015"," Matrix fan worthy
","This has to be one of Tom Cruise's recent toppers, and that alone says a lot. The entire time, there is never a dull moment or lack of suspense, yet we witness the key characters grow and develop a relationship in training and the battlefield. There is a touch of sci-fi fantasy coupled with war and a bit of romance necessary for the viewer empathy, yet just enough and not over the top. There are a few surprises, and certainly the viewer is never sure whether our main character will make it but rooting for him each time. Arguably we can tell when the final battle takes everything he can give it and there's not another reset to save him. There's equally a subtext of humor that allows us to see imperfections that are more likely for an amateur recruit, particularly in the beginning.<br/><br/>There is a paradox at the end with the time reset. If our hero's blood been transfused with the alien enemy's, which ultimately causes the reset, wouldn't that logically have irradiated him when he destroyed the alien?"
"engelst","6","1","4","22 March 2015"," Falls short of its potential
","I'm a huge Groundhog Day fan. Unsurprisingly, I'm charmed by the basic premise of Edge Of Tomorrow. Sadly, the idea has not been consequently exploited. There are many plot holes and we're missing real tension and intensity.<br/><br/>Although I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, I have to respect how he can always lift a movie with a very reliable performance. I loved Emily Blunt, hovering between military toughness and subtle femininity.<br/><br/>If you didn't know the main plot before seeing the movie (a must if you want to enjoy it fully), the movie starts off with a surprise. But after an adrenaline-filled introduction, the story loses pace and starts stumbling from one plot hole to the next. The atmosphere suffers from the lack of different scenery and the overdose of scene repeats (necessary for the story but just not handled with the required finesse). If it weren't for the lead roles, I would put this off as a boring little scifi-flick.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the chemistry between Blunt and Cruise is excellent, which helps keep us on our toes and motivated to follow the story."
"Dirtroadie","6","1","4","22 March 2015"," A pastiche of familiar Hollywood tropes
","Like the repeating time travel story device this movie uses, we have seen this before in Star Trek episodes, Groundhog Day, etc, etc. Sure, Tom Cruise gives us another charismatic performance, and there is a flavor-of-the-month hot blonde half his age to fuel our naughtier fantasies. There are explosions and special effects and technologically advanced yet mindless space aliens.<br/><br/>But does any of that make it a good movie? Not to my admittedly limited capacity brain. I suppose I could go into listing plot holes and asking other rhetorical questions about how and why what happened, but things like that don't really interest me that much. What does interest me is dramatic impact and thought provoking situations and dialog. Sadly, there is little of that present in Edge of Tomorrow."
"CrisMovieCorner","8","1","4","18 March 2015"," Expected mediocrity, got SO MUCH more!
","Doug Liman is a very hit and miss director, well at least for me, he has had some success in ""Swingers"", ""Mr & Mrs Smith"" and ""The Bourne Identity"", then some less than enjoy work with the likes of ""Jumper"" and ""Getting In"". Anyway, back to what matters, Liman's jump back into the world of Science Fiction, this time around he truly got it right. He really brought on his experience of character driven story like in Bourne and comedic repartee as seen in Mr & Mrs Smith, using past elements really helped him make a thoroughly enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The special effects in this film were phenomenally good, the great thing about them too was they were not used as a crux to keep a boring film alive. They were an integral part of the film, however, they were not over used, they were used to tell the story along with the brilliant story. The quality of the special effects were of that much of a high standard, if felt like playing a video game, they were a beautiful spectacle. Liman uses amazing effects to really sell this as a world ravaged by alien invasion and destruction of major cities, the battlefield landscape they used conveys the pure and utter destruction these ""mimics"" can unleash on humanity. The battle scenes are beautifully executed unlike some of the Sci-Fi blockbusters in recent years *cough* Transformers *cough*, they are masterfully done and not a muddle together in some sort of blur in which you can not make out characters.<br/><br/>The trailers really never gave this film the justice it deserves, well not for me anyway, they painted a pretty dull attempt at Science Fiction with Comedy with Action elements. The film is a great Action/Sci-Fi based blockbuster with great elements of Comedy which are used to break up the despair of ""the end of days"" feel. The on screen relationship between Cruise and Blunt was great, and it's not often I compliment Mr Cruise, however in this event he had a great relationship with Blunt. Blunt's character Rite not surprisingly nicknamed ""full metal bitch"" is an utter bad ass not to be messed with and she oozes alpha female, while also having an air of vulnerability that makes her a very relatable and believable character. Also Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson are usually a great addition to any cast they appear, this is no exception to that, they were great in their roles of Master Sergeant Farell (Paxton) and General Brigham (Gleeson) while they do not exceed the roles and do something we haven't seen before they do make them their own.<br/><br/>Story was something I was worried about with this film going into it, I expected the use of the ""time loop"" to be played out and become the constant go to, in order to keep a boring story alive. Boy was I wrong, from the get go the story really pulls you and keeps you excited without becoming overly gloomy or depressing in light of the impending doom from an alien invasion. Instead, the story thrives on wit, action and drama, all the makings of a great summer blockbuster which this really turned out to be. The story flows well together without the overused trope of twists and turns, while still leaving you guessing what could happen next, not many obvious occurrences take place in the story. Plus it was good to see a movie with a beginning, middle and end, no messing around setting up for cashing in on sequels, feel good to see a film that actually ends.<br/><br/>A lot of reviews I have read in the past couple of months have made fleeting comments about how it is inspired by video games, and they are not wrong, the entire film feels like you're playing a video game and that is not a bad thing. Especially for my fellow gamers out there, who like may also be a little disappointed in how video game adaptations have been a bit below par as a whole. However, this while not based on a video game really thrives on all the video game elements that make gaming so great. If you look at Empire Magazine's review of the film they said ""When Cage (Cruise) awakens into the first day of his enforced demotion (also the second-to-last of his life), he is effectively starting from a save point. When, eventually, a close encounter on that bloody beach with a tentacle-flailing, blast-furnace mouthed ""alpha"" — the end-of-level boss — causes his health bar to retract to zero, we snap back to that save point, and he must 'play' the two days again. With each replay, he must learn how to survive to reach the next 'level' (to ultimately meet the end-of-game boss), although, paradoxically, just as we learn from our mistakes in life, he must learn from his deaths."" Overall, the film was a purely entertaining two hour ride of action, drama and laughs, it was a lot better than I was expecting, I had a feeling I would like it maybe as a passing ""yeah, that was okay"", I was SO far off on that. This was genuinely one of the better Action/Science Fiction films I have seen in a while, especially a newer released on. Some may consider the film a ""popcorn flick"", and in some respects they are right, however the film has a bit more substance than your typical popcorn flick, this has a more complete feel about it. As I said I don't enjoy Cruise's acting, however this was more bearable due to Blunt and the pure brilliance of the film, that being said any male action star could have played the role and it would have been a bit better in my opinion not enough to really change anything though."
"alindsay-al","9","1","4","16 March 2015"," A fantastic action film that came as a surprise.
","Now I have heard allot of good things about this film and now that I have finally seen it I must saw that this is a fantastic action film. The premise of this film sees a US army spokesman forced onto the frontlines to fight a war against aliens, when he dies in battle he starts the day over again and with his team tries to stop the war. Now Tom cruise is a great action star especially in the mission impossible franchise but when I saw the trailer for this film I thought it would be similar to oblivion which I didn't like that much. But he was great in this film, it was a different role to his usual and it was refreshing to see. Emily blunt was great in this film and it truly highlighted why she is such a good actress. Her character was interesting and unique but also a great action star that was really enjoyable to watch. Her chemistry with cruise was great and was one of the best aspects of the film. Bill Paxton plays the drill sergeant and he was good even though you have seen him in this role before. I do wish though that there had been an interesting alien character for the team to go through if that had happened then this film could have got a full 10. The story was really interesting with the time loop really allowing the film to make interesting character development and great deaths over again. The script was surprisingly great as well with allot of comedy involved which isn't completely necessary but it was a great addition to the film. The style was also great with all the action being great and being worthy of a true summer action flick. Overall this is a fantastic action film worth seeing."

","Edge of Tomorrow is the most original movie that I have seen in a while, which is the primary reason why I give this movie so much praise. In a year of prequels, sequels, and reboots, it is nice to see a movie that introduces a new, innovative storyline that is not only unique, but is also executed very well! The acting, dialogue, cinematography, and special effects all come together perfectly to help create a movie that could have easily been a huge flop. However, the storyline proves to be my favorite element of the movie as it contained everything from suspense to even some laughs. Edge of Tomorrow is no doubt one of the best, if not the most unconventional, movies of 2014, and would definitely top my list of the most underrated movies of the year."

","Edge of Tomorrow (2014) is a greatly made action sci-fi film starring Tom Cruise. The other valuable members on this team are Doug Liman, one of the most skilled action-movie directors in Hollywood, and co-star Emily Blunt, who lives up to her surname and is never less than an equal partner in this enterprise.<br/><br/>As noted by several, Edge of Tomorrow is based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's militaristic science-fiction novel All You Need is Kill, which finds the armies of Earth being dismantled by Mimics, an invading alien force that in the movie looks like piranha/jellyfish hybrids made of steel and cranked up to 100 mph for attacks."
"XweAponX","10","1","4","1 February 2015"," New Concept: Tom Cruise as the Anti-Hero
","In the first five minutes of this film, I had to be thinking, ""What a jerk!"". This is an alien concept for Cruise, who is always the ""Competent Man"".<br/><br/>For the next couple of hours, we see a believable transformation of the jerk into a hero- And nobody will ever know it.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is ""Major Cage"" - A Hypocrite, and a coward. Who is apparently getting his just deserts: arrested, demoted, and sent into the front line ranks of doomed soldiers using the very same equipment which he had told all of BBC was ""Winning the War"", only he has never used it, does not even know how to turn off the ""Safety"", and to top it off, it's not as much of a boon as he had insisted on British TV.<br/><br/>More quietly, we see references to a ""Full Metal B____"" aka Emily Blunt as ""Rita"", who had single handedly won a previous major engagement with ""Minimal Training"" plus a huge Sword.<br/><br/>We really don't understand what is happening until Cruise and ""Company J"" (Equipped with Drill Instructor Master Sergeant Farell played by Bill ""Game Over"" Paxton) hit Normandy Beach- And then we get to see what these ""Mimics"" really are.<br/><br/>But that is not the real fun, as Cruise, who is now ""Private"" Cage, takes out an unusual Mimic and himself in the process, only to wake up... On the previous day.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of films dealing with aspects of Time lately: ""Predestination"" of course, based on Robert A Heinlein's excellent short story ""All you Zombies"" which deals with the famous ""Grandfather Paradox""- ""What if one were to go back in time and kill their own grandfather?"". Then, there is Relativistic Time-compression and expansion with 5th Dimensional cross time communication in Chris Nolan's ""Interstellar"", which could be seen as a rehash of ""Contact"" or an Homage to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".<br/><br/>But this is a science fiction/War Movie version of ""Groundhog Day"", Doug Liman creates a somewhat believable excuse as to why it is happening.<br/><br/>With each iteration Cruise experiences, he changes from Arse to Hero- He has no choice really. If it had not have happened to him? He'd continue to be the jerk he was, most likely. But with each repetition that original jerky character falls by the wayside.<br/><br/>In short order, Cage discovers that he has something in common with Ms Blunt's ""Rita"", when she tells him something odd on the battlefield: ""Find me when you wake up"".<br/><br/>What does she mean?"
"sjarja","6","1","4","9 January 2015"," a little disappointed, but on a higher level
","I went into that movie with higher hopes. I was not hyped, but i had heard more good than bad about it. I was also in the mood for an action film that evening.<br/><br/>Now how can i say it without sounding overcritical... . The action sequences are good, but pretty much standard for high budget movies these days i think.<br/><br/>The alien design is one aspect that i disagreed with. Comparing the possibilities today (meaning CGI and near unlimited creative freedom) the alien design was outright mainstream/boring.<br/><br/>The two protagonists were fine. Tom Cruise did an average acting job (average as in - what he usually does) and the supporting characters were alright but a bit flat and/or stereotypically one dimensional.<br/><br/>Aside from Cruise - there was very little character development present (which makes sense considering the nature of the time-line) - and his development again ... was fine.<br/><br/>The solution was another part of the movie i disagreed with. It was uncreative and felt like such plot solutions occurred in many movies before - and even more computer games (which the movie oddly reminded me on) All in all, i would give that movie a score slightly above average. Story and creativity is low, execution is well done - but most importantly, - it is not boring."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","4","2 January 2015"," Most underrated film of 2014
","The storming the beach sequences were spectacularly filmed. I never lost track of where I was within the action. Too many films these days try to hide their shortcomings by having the immersive camera, which basically means shaky cam. This does not enhance the viewers experience in ""war"", it does the opposite. You'll have your audience squinting at the screen trying to see what the hell is going on. Liman manages to film the battle sequences beautifully, blending action, comedy and drama in all those sequences. <br/><br/>Wait, what? Comedy? Yes, this film is funny. Liman has fun with killing off Cruise multiple times in funny and unique ways. <br/><br/>Cruise is a coward when we meet him, trying his hardest to NOT be enlisted onto the front lines. But things don't work out for him and he finds himself waking up in cuffs and thrown into the war. No idea how to use his mech suit, no idea how to fight, no idea how to do anything, he finds himself in hellfire trying to stay alive. He doesn't last that long and ends up dying after blowing up an ""Alpha"" alien. <br/><br/>Rewind. <br/><br/>He wakes up again back in cuffs, alive. But how? What can he do differently to survive this time? Edge of Tomorrow takes a few minutes to explain to the audience why Cruise has this ability and what he must do to stop it, but other than that, this film is non-stop excitement. The editing here is crisp and benefits the story immensely. We are in Cruise's shoes at the beginning, learning what is going on, seeing the different outcomes for the first time and how it can be changed. Then, we find ourselves in Emily Blunt's shoes, experiencing events for the first time, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it hasn't happened already. Cruise reveals that he's been here before, despite the viewer never seeing this scene. Now we have no idea how many times he's gone back. <br/><br/>The third act raises the stakes a bit, I won't reveal why, but at that point it also tends to be a bit more generic and clichéd. Other than Blunt and Cruise, we aren't really given much character development from others. Not needed really, but how are we suppose to care for the squad Cruise is with when they die? We don't. <br/><br/>I found myself asking questions after the film was over. Does every time Cruise die start a parallel universe ala Back to the Future? There was one particular sequence where he dies and it continues on for a little bit. We see what happens after he dies, so the question remains, does each time he die have that exact timeline continue on? OR is it simply that ONE timeline that continues to be reversed. Either way is possible.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this film. I went in with low expectations and was more than surprised."

"ArchonCinemaReviews","8","1","4","7 December 2014"," Worthy and entertaining blockbuster
","Edge of Tomorrow follows along the path of Pacific Rim and produces an action packed science fiction movie where all of humanity and planet earth is fighting against a powerful alien invasion.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Cage, a higher-up public relations executive in the armed forces. He is thrown to the front line before a massive battle when he goes against his commanding officer General Brigham. Not trained in the art of warfare, especially against an extraterrestrial enemy, Cage faces certain death. On the day of the battle a strange thing happens to him and as the film's tagline says: ""Live, Die, Repeat."" <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is one of the rare films where a trailer actually hindered the film. I believe the greatest hook of the movie, the part where for some strange reason Cage is able to reset the day and seemingly change the future, would have been much better utilized if it was a surprise. This action version of Groundhog Day is a refreshing and original take on a typical summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>As a film where history repeats itself, Edge of Tomorrow does a wonderful job to engage the viewer effectively as the story evolves during the same twenty-four hours. With each reboot we get just enough new information amidst the old news of the past without ever feeling repetitive or redundantly boring. Though with any 'time traveling' feature, Edge of Tomorrow is certainly not flawless and contains several plot holes.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is a superb action star of the future and I hope she continues to gain roles of this type in addition to more serious roles. She is strong, capable and sharp as Rita, the Angel of Verdun.<br/><br/>Overall Edge of Tomorrow is a worthy film to entertain the masses as a summer action blockbuster. The story is unique and evident, different but not a stretch and the fight scenes are thrilling but also light and comical.<br/><br/>For more full reviews of all the recent releases, please check out our WEBSITE."
"williampsamuel","8","1","4","7 December 2014"," Groundhog Day meets future D-Day, awesomeness ensues
","That's the short version of Edge of Tomorrow. The somewhat longer version is that five years after a meteor strike brought the mimics- a species of shape shifting alien tentacle creatures- to earth, all of mankind's remaining armies are poised for a massive offensive to retake Europe and exterminate the alien menace. But they know we're coming. The invasion will be a slaughter. And only one man can save humanity, by living and dying it over and over again.<br/><br/>That man is Major William Cage, US Army press corps. As a savior, he's about as unlikely as they come. Fast talking and cowardly, it's only because of his own insubordination and the equally underhanded shenanigans of a superior officer that ever ends up holding a gun. But something happens on the invasion beach which makes it so when he dies, time resets and he wakes up again the day before the invasion. Working together with war hero Rita Vrataski, the only other person who what he's going through, he must find a way to turn the tide and save humanity. <br/><br/>That's just the setup. What director Doug Liman and his team of writers do with it is spectacular. Adapting the acclaimed Japanese novel All You Need is Kill, they're created a sci-fi action thriller that is not only action packed and exciting, but also complex, witty, and surprisingly deep. The time loop William is caught in isn't merely used as a plot device, it shapes the entire narrative and viewing experience. <br/><br/>Every time he dies and reawakens he comes back more skilled and with the knowledge avoid his previous death. Not that it necessarily gets him more than a few steps farther. At times the cycles flash by with nearly identical deaths, like an eighties training montage with more explosions and head wounds. Before long he has the assault down to an exact science, anticipating every attack and coaching Rita through the battle step by step- turn here, look there, duck now! There's no way to get an exact count, but he must hit that beach thousands of times over the course of the story. Sometimes the effect is darkly comedic. At others it drives home his sense of futility; that no matter how many times he tries it will never be enough. <br/><br/>The film of course doesn't show nearly every cycle, so when a new- really new- scene begins, we often don't know if this is his first time to make it this far or if he's been here a dozen times. The other characters of course have no idea what's come before. Every time he introduces himself to Rita it's the first time for her. Throughout the film he comes to know her better and better and loses her too many times to count, yet for her he's always a new face, one that she has to trust knows her and knows what he's doing. Still, there's an undeniable attraction between them that runs both way, made tragic by their circumstances.<br/><br/>Edge of tomorrow works as comedy and drama. As a sci-fi action thriller it excels. Fast paced and intense, the battle scenes turn repetitiveness from a weakness to a strength, giving a sense of Cage's progression and adding new twists to the same encounters. The robotic exoskeletons are every bit as cool as they look in the trailers, and the mimics are one of the best alien designs in recent memory. Constantly shifting and incredibly fast, they burst from the ground and whirl through opponents like a tornado of tentacles. They have no personality and most seem more like animals fighting on instinct than independent thought, but in their own way they're as deadly and unnerving as Alien's xenomorph.<br/><br/>Cruise and Blunt's performances are also noteworthy. Quite at ease in this role, Cruise has a certain roguish charm to him and embodies both the terrified rookie of the early scenes and the experienced, jaded veteran of the latter sections. Emily Blunt is likewise perfect for the role of Rita Vrataski. Gorgeously fit and tough as nails, she's reminiscent of a young Sigourney Weaver and handles alien monsters just as well. I almost pity any mimic that crosses her path. Together their performances, an abundance of action, and a finely crafted, fast paced story make Edge of Tomorrow fun, smart summer entertainment."

","A narratively ambitious sci-fi action, Edge of Tomorrow plays out a familiar alien invasion apocalypse drama in a way that, through repetition, allows humanity to learn from its mistakes and have a shot at surviving until another movie's monsters from outer space show up. Picking yourself up to fight another day might work for the characters, but battle fatigue eventually sets in for viewers as Doug Liman's film keeps folding back on itself time and time again. Tom Cruise and gigantic action scenes assure sizable openings internationally, but several commercial question marks hover over this expensive Warner Bros. release, including the second-tier tent-pole grosses for the star's recent action outings (other than for the Mission: Impossible franchise), a title that sounds like it belongs on an old daytime soap opera and, most significantly, the extent to which audiences will tire of the let's-play-it-over-again storyline."
"leonblackwood","7","1","4","19 October 2014"," Definitely worth a watch! 7/10
","Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, which has non-stop intense action/drama from beginning to end. The director added a witty script along with a decent concept which is a mixture between Aliens and Groundhog Day. Although the premise is about a man who relives the same day every time that he gets killed, you do see different parts of that day so your not going through the same thing over and over again. It was cleverly put together by the director, who covered every aspect of the storyline, and I'm glad that it didn't go down the soppy love story route and it just stuck to a full out action movie. The weird looking creatures made the movie intense and dramatic, even though they looked similar to the ones in the Matrix, and the suits were pretty impressive. Basically, it's everything that you expect from a Tom Cruise blockbuster action movie and I personally enjoyed it more than Oblivion and Jack Reacher. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Tom Cruise really isn't showing any signs of slowing down at the ripe age of 52. He still looks pretty good for his age and he's still pulling off a lot of his own stunts. In this movie, he plays his role extremely well because he adds a little wit to the puzzling situation. The chemistry between Cruise and Blunt was great but it could have done with a couple more decent actors as his crew. Its good to see Bill Paxton back in a decent movie but the director should have used Brian Gleeson a bit more. Anyway it's definitely worth a watch for its originality and great concept and I personally think that you will see something different every time that you watch it. <br/><br/>Budget: $178million Worldwide Gross: $369million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there action movies about a man who relives the same day every time that gets killed. 7/10"

Now this is good science fiction not that stupid and idiot transformer age of Extinction which was dumb and people like it. I don not know what happen to the world this is like a film we should be watching. do not ask your friend about the film because they will spoil you and you movie will be ruin go and watch a master piece alien execution. all actor done a good acting and smartly written film and full of tactics.

Watching Cruise's character develop from the beginning all the way to the end was well displayed.

I wasn't expecting it to be awesome. I was in love with the movie by the time the end credits rolled on the screen. I highly recommend this to all gamers. Yes, gamers. They will totally identify with it. We all know Tom Cruise is an amazing actor and an action movie specialist. The actual hero of the movie for me is Emily Blunt. What a performance. She's not just a tag- along sidekick. She does full justice to her role. The action, acting and direction are excellent and there is not a single boring moment.

","Love Tom Cruise, hate Tom Cruise - you have to admit - the guy picks good movies to be in (well, most). I'll even go so far as to say he does what he does (e.g. action, hero, etc.) really well! He hit gold on this one. What makes this movie fantastic is the writing. It's nothing short of genius. I haven't seen writing like this for a very long time.<br/><br/>You have to appreciate the thought that went into this movie. Cruise is the A-LIST actor that ties together this great effort on so many levels. You kind of wonder if ""Oblivion"" wasn't his first attempt at science fiction greatness. Sadly, that movie fell short. Happily, he didn't give up and gave us this solid movie to enjoy for a long time to come.<br/><br/>Writing A+, Special effects A, acting A, overall A!"

","I loved the alien concept and the fear of the destruction of the planet. Humans vs the invading forces, I will never tire of liking this thing kind of movie. However, come on! Yeah, he dies and wakes up again and again; yeah I get it but really how many times do you have to show that. That seemed to be the case for 95% of the film. It could have been executed a lot better if he'd died less and there had been more of an actual story to get involved in. The concept of defeating the alien mother to destroy all has been done before as well as the idea of waking up again and again to experience the same day. I don't feel 'Edge of tomorrow' brought anything new to the table at all in this relation except some upgraded special effects added into the mix. For me this film was entertaining while relaxing at home but but overall not a particularity great film. I'm happy to have seen it but won't be watching it again anytime soon......."
"Blazs91","10","1","4","28 September 2014"," Tom Cruise in the role of a more or less qualified space marine.
","The film wasn't promoted and over-hyped by armies of high profile and fierce marketing campaigns, so I belatedly noticed its only existence. When I first glimpsed the official poster of the movie, it somehow failed to arouse my interest, because by the sight of the two actors posing in the futuristic uniform the first thing which came into mind was that we got the concept of another silly game adaptation, which happened to be Warhammer 40K at this time.<br/><br/>However, over time I realized that the film has nothing to do with the game even despite of the space marine style uniforms. I've started looking after the things and I've conducted a little investigation, but finally I managed to find only a brief and condensed information about the plot. I became eager for more details so I had to sit in the theater stuffed with curiosity. And there came a huge and pleasant surprise!<br/><br/>Thanks to the unique and original story, the splendiferous acting performance, the fantastically choreographed action sequences, the not overacted and exaggerating humor, and many other positive things, the only sentence came into my mind was that I'd watch it again, and repeat, and again!""<br/><br/>I don't wanna give you spoilers about the story, so the only thing I can say, that I consider it really unique. The Live, die, repeat!"" slogan does not provide too much information about the whole thing to prospective audience, but it's quite enough to throw a spoonful morsel to you, which you can chew on until you gather adequate amount of curiosity to get yourself committed about watching the whole movie.<br/><br/>Let's examine the characters under the microscope. The film could be enjoyable for those who are infatuated with Tom Cruise, and for those who loathe him either, as he gets killed countless times in a row on the battlefield. The characters go through a real development, which was build up properly. We could witness how a weak, scared, left- handed wuss officer become a brave, dauntless and almost fearless butcher, who grinds and slashes the enemy easily with joy. Emily Blunt perfectly embodies the cool and absolutely bad-ass female protagonist, what she could implement in a so unique and amazing way, that it does not gives us the concept of the typical, phlegmatic, annoying, empty-headed, though chick who can humiliate every male characters in the movie with ease. Instead of that we could recognize a real amazon warrior woman while seeing her acting performance. Let's face it guys, that this has been achieved by hardly any women so far! And Bill Paxton magnificently shows us his priceless talent while bringing cynical leader into life. It's a great pleasure to watch!<br/><br/>The battle scenes are totally mind-blowing! You scarcely can see a drop of blood on the canvas throughout the entire movie, but nevertheless the movie throws some so brutally created action scenes right front of our eyes, that we can almost feel the shooting pain in our limbs when we see a character getting injured. I watch the first landing with opened mouth, without taking a small breath, when Tom Criuse has been first dropped right into the middle of the battle. It was almost scary to watch soldiers falling sequentially like little flies.<br/><br/>The film is a spectacular, high quality, and moreover it's an intelligent blockbuster, which can be considered a true rarity these days. In my point of view this movie earned the honorable title of The Movie of the Year"". Everyone should see this masterpiece!<br/><br/>Thanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!"

","It is in fact a very intriguing story of an alien invasion on earth. I would like to see more of the power of a man can do from the source of an alien. In fact, that is what I get. The story line is short and compact with ideas in many different ways. I would say, the ending of the story was not disappointed at all. I can say, that as what I was expecting would have happened at the end. It is not shocking. It is not unexpected. But it is believable. A science fiction that can make something believable that could happen in real world, somehow. In a games and real life is different. We are given many chances and should do it seriously with all the resources we have. One thing I like was when Cage said, 'I'm out'. Although given the advantage of knowing the source from, still it was not easy to get it done."
"xcvb_2003","8","1","4","13 September 2014"," Tom Cruise still got it.
","Tom Cruise still got it. Last year it was Oblivion and now this. <br/><br/>The movie is about an Alien Invasion and an all out attempt by Humanity to wipe em out. The protagonist, played by Tom Cruise, during the battle dies and wakes up a day before and finds out that whenever he dies, he wakes up at that point. The concept isn't new or anything BUT it is the first time I'm seeing it applied to an Alien invasion sci- fi film, which just makes it a unique experience and a breath of fresh air. <br/><br/>The movie is well directed. It has good pacing and some really good action scenes. The aliens themselves are great. Loved their design and agility. Not your typical aliens, they were really menacing.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was of course great as the lead, and was joined by Emily Blunt who was pretty good as a tough soldier chick, still HOT. Then there were lots of side characters, all of whom were good and added to the movie somewhat. The movie had a good amount of humor in it too, and it was blended perfectly with the story and pacing. I even laughed out loud during some moments. <br/><br/>The CGI is pretty good. There were some really beautiful shots of chaos and destruction during the battle, good cinematography. The soundtrack could have been better though, not saying it was lame or anything but there wasn't any really memorable tracks in it. <br/><br/>Overall, a great sci-fi summer blockbuster, a really entertaining ride, a must watch.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","In between your Transcendence's, Transformers, and other third rate sci- fi movies Edge of Tomorrow stands out as the best sci-fi movie of 2014 so far (review written before the release of Interstellar).<br/><br/>Usually my patience is a little thin when I go to the cinema, purely because watching movies at home is so much more comfortable. If a movie is at all tedious, like Man of Steel, I usually want to get the hell out of there after 90 mins, though I might enjoy it more when it is released on DVD, as I did MoS.<br/><br/>This movie had me engrossed for the full running time. Tom Cruise carries this movie very well, as he did last year's Obilivion. Emily Blunt is excellent. There is great balance between the impending doom posed by the alien invasion and the more groundhog day-style comic moments.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is well-paced, with a strong sci-fi storyline, excellent battle scenes, acting, humor and a lot of originality relative to the dross that gets hurled a us cinema-goers.<br/><br/>Definitely one to watch again and again."
"acidrosesrijit","8","1","4","23 August 2014"," Over the ledge
","I thought I'll never say this about a Tom Cruise movie, but I liked what I saw. Although the concept is not new (watch Groundhog Day) and is steeped in Buddhism/Karma, this film version of the manga All You Need Is Kill is an intelligently paced and fast action movie. The high concept drama and the labyrinthine sci-fi plot was excellently presented without making me lose my interest. The characters, reminiscent of Starship Troopers (the original) are life-like, everyday grunts fighting a war that is, in many ways, reminiscent of the Second World War, especially, D-Day. <br/><br/>I got hoodwinked thrice in the film. First, in the beginning, Tom Cruise comes across as a weaselly military officer who talked more like a civvy than a man of war. And I was getting irritated, but then, that's exactly what he is. He has never seen action, being as it were, a military PR agent. <br/><br/>Second, Emily Blunt. I love her as an actress, and she comes across as a hero more than just eye candy. It is Emily Blunt, who as the tough-as- nails no-nonsense soldier, Rita Vrataski, is the driving force behind Cruise' Cage. Known as the Angel of Verdun because of her killing of hundreds of alien invaders at Verdun, she is, in no way a damsel in distress, or just a second fiddle love interest being present to boost the male ego. She is a soldier - focused and strong and that is what is important. They should have more characters like her in films.<br/><br/>In a sci-fi movie like this, its tough to represent the actors' expressions without a strange reason to have the characters remove their helmets. You wonder that a well-placed headshot would finish these two off - and again, that's exactly what it is. (hoodwink three) All the others wear helmets, but these two don't because they don't care. It's all about Live/Die/Repeat. Interesting film."
"simondclinch-1","9","1","4","20 August 2014"," A must-see for all sci fans
","Early on I thought it would be a twist on Final Destination, then Groundhog Day but at some point after that I accepted it had originality in the plot after all!<br/><br/>Emily Blunt certainly managed to live up to her established record of playing unique characters that have much more than average depth. In fact it's not hard to feel that Cruise was playing above his league opposite her.<br/><br/>The film made me look for more Emily Blunt films in fact and without digressing too much - I'd recommend that exercise, which bore some exotic fruit.<br/><br/>Looking at the film as a whole, it has above average originality on the whole, good special effects, good acting and was well worth the effort."
"petarmatic","8","1","4","31 July 2014"," Something new and original!
","I will not keep a secret. I really liked this film and Tom Cruise is a shining star! This time shifting stuff was very original and I really liked it, otherwise plot was one of those war films type of plot. Nothing new about war plots, it is always war and murders and shooting and all of that type of things.<br/><br/>If you turn on TV you will see live war from Gaza, you do not need to pay a ticket to watch war. Will it ever stop? I had a feeling that this plot was a little bit anti war, but I guess today you can not make a film without a lot of shooting and war, so people would watch it.<br/><br/>It is a problem of today. People are acting too much like what they see on the films, and unfortunately Hollywood goes with the flow way too often. What a shame! Shame on you world!!!"

","This might have a bit of a spoiler in it, I'm not sure so to be safe maybe don't read it. There was nothing wrong with this movie until we got to the last two or three minutes. ""Re- setting the day is an interesting thing to do in a Sci-fi I guess, and it made it possible for an incompetent guy to become an excellent soldier in a fight against the superior aliens. There is only one (really big) problem. There is no way to re-set the day and get the result that the ending gave us. It's not cool to fool around with time or any physical laws more than you already have to get to the end. You can't just write a happy ending and resurrect dead characters or anything else ya might want to do to satisfy your desire for a happy ending. If you establish certain ""Physics"" then be happy the audience will accept that and tell your story. But, you can't assume that you can then just do whatever you want. You have to stick to the new physics and finish your story. If you want a whole bunch more lee way to get the ending you want then re- write it or write another one. This story was rendered ridiculous by the idea that the protagonist killed the main bad guy so now he can have whatever he wants when and however he wants it."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","4","25 June 2014"," The Definitive Summer Blockbuster of 2014
","The summer of 2014 has already seen few behemoths in the form of Godzilla, X-Men: Days of Future Past & How To Train Your Dragon 2 but nobody was really expecting this Tom Cruise starrer, which debuted on the silver screen a few weeks ago without any significant buzz, to surprise them the way it has & with every passing moment, it continues to gain momentum with its strong 'word of mouth' praise.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow tells the story of Major William Cage who hasn't seen a day in combat but finds himself caught in a time loop after killed within minutes in a war against an alien race. But as he's forced to experience the same battle over n over again, his skill to handle the adversaries of war gets better and with the help of a Special Forces warrior, he ultimately gets closer & closer to defeating the seemingly invincible enemy.<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman has made excellent use of the available resources here to craft an action film that's as smart & engaging as it is entertaining. The screenplay is inspired from the Japanese novel, All You Need Is Kill, and also infuses elements from cinema classics of the past to come out with an original storyline which is then further refined with clever use of action, wit, drama & unpredictability to deliver a cinematic experience that's highly rewarding.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, cinematography expertly exhibits the director's filming trademarks & makes prevalent use of frequently cut hand-held shots. Editing is undoubtedly its finest aspect as not for once does its repeating segments feel dull or tiresome, VFX & sound are state-of-the-art stuffs that never take the viewer's focus away from the story and the background score ends up adding even more intensity & energy to the whole package.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow features an overall dependable cast amongst which Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt end up impressing the most. Playing his most challenging, funniest & meatiest role in a long time, Tom Cruise delivers a fabulous performance as William Cage but was constantly challenged by Emily Blunt who truly kicks ass with a ruthlessly aggressive rendition of her character, Rita Vrataski aka ""Full Metal Bitch""; the decorated veteran who guides & trains Cage after recognizing his current predicament.<br/><br/>Although the film is no doubt an endlessly entertaining extravaganza, I still had few minor issues with it. One being the ending that isn't very fulfilling in accordance to its build-up & other is the inclusion of a romantic arc near the end which was absolutely unnecessary. Still, the positives outweighs the negatives by a huge margin as Edge of Tomorrow manages to get most things right & is the perfect summer blockbuster of the year with enough quality & quantity to dazzle most moviegoers.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Edge of Tomorrow is a smartly scripted, cleverly narrated, brilliantly directed, energetically photographed, tightly edited, timely humoured, wonderfully scored & strongly performed motion picture that may look like an action-laden video game but damn me if it isn't a remarkably well-played one by its cast & crew. If you still haven't seen it then cut the foreplay & just go for it before it completes its run on the big screen. You can thank me later.<br/><br/>Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"

","My first thoughts of this movie was that it was going to be another everyday sci-fi movie but I was wrong. From outset the movie was exciting, funny and action packed. The great thing about this movie is that it has something to offer to everybody, even my mom who has not much interest in sci-fi movies loved every second of it. Edge of tomorrow offers a great storyline that is consistent throughout the film,I was also surprised to see that it had a great sense of humour even when characters were in difficult situations. The only negative thing I can think about is that the ending didn't explain all questions but this maybe intentional so that it can set itself up for a sequel. This film is great for everyone but maybe a little violent or even a little too confusing for a under 12 year old but it is a great film that has almost know faults so it is a 10/10 for me and one of the greatest films I have ever seen."

"Robert_duder","8","1","4","15 June 2014"," A Sci-Fi Flick that will inevitably be very under-rated
","I still think Tom Cruise has got it. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie that he wasn't at least ""decent"" in and he's been around a long time and has some truly outstanding movies. In reality he's probably one of my top five favourite actors period. I don't care about his personal life. Oblivion let me down quite a bit. I thought it was a mess in a lot of ways and tried way too hard. I had decent expectations of this and its a tough sell because of the obvious comparisons to the aforementioned film last year. Edge of Tomorrow is as different as night and day to Oblivion. It is a special effects drive, science fiction blockbuster that is worthy of its fans that are really trying to talk it up. It seems to be getting lost in the summer shuffle but I promise you that at some point this will be considered and under-rated classic and for good reason. It is fiercely intelligent, hits all the right science fiction notes and the sort of unique time travel aspect makes it very nearly riveting. Honestly, this probably would have been a nine for me if not for the silly, non-sensical and forced ending. I would love for someone to try and explain to me how the ending works so that I can change my review to a 9. I'm also thinking there were absolutely some inevitable plot holes but how could there not be when dealing so blatantly with time travel. 99% of the special effects were spot, even the 3D was decent (I hate 3D in general and think its a huge money grabbing gimmick.) <br/><br/>Tom Cruise commands the lead and does what he does best. He probably has more charisma on screen than any other actor in history. There is just something mesmerizing about him. But its not just his charisma because he is actually a great and versatile actor. You just accept him as the hero. His character starts as cocky, a ""salesman"" of sorts and the fear he shows when he is railroaded into being a soldier...was outstanding. This is no Oscar performance but as an ""action/Sci-Fi"" hero, he absolutely nails it. He was perfect. This also might be the first film where I can say I really enjoyed Emily Blunt. I always feel like she is miscast in her roles and have never been impressed by her. As the female hero in the film she holds her own. She is edgy and strong and as good of an action star as Cruise is. Women should flock to and love this character because quite frankly she's bad ass. I think I could have done without the inevitable implied romance between her and Cruise but its used sparingly and not a driving force in the film at all. The two stars are definitely the focal point of the movie but that's not to say the supporting cast don't deserve mention. There are vital characters played very well in various sized roles. Some of the most significant performances were Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson, Madeleine Mantock (would have loved to have seen more of her character), Dragomir Mrsic, Jonas Armstrong and everyone else that played in J-Squad. I really wanted to see more from that entire group but understandably this wasn't the focus.<br/><br/>Doug Liman has had some very good films as a director. He has done a Bourne Film, Fair Game and Mr. and Mrs Smith. However, he's never really done a sci-fi flick and I'm surprised because he handled it nearly perfectly. The cinematography was outstanding, the special effects excellent and for any lover of Sci-Fi you will appreciate this for being a terrific flick in that genre. Liman knows how to make a great script come to life and this proves that again. My one biggest annoyance were the ""mimics"" or the alien species they are up against. I thought their CGI was lacklustre at best. They looked hokey and that was unfortunate given how good everything else was. There is no human villain at all which is different but the mimics and the time travel aspect give you everything you could want from this story. Its far from the most intelligent science fiction movie but it does hold its own. Its a mainstream blockbuster that actually requires you to think. It has a few moments of appropriately timed and toned comedy, the fish out of water scenes in the beginning are just perfect and this is just sheer entertainment that you can and should enjoy. Don't hesitate to see this!! 8.5/10"

","Doug Liman's 'Edge of Tomorrow' nearly maximizes the full potential of its clever and deceptively simple premise while avoiding many of the potential pitfalls that might have otherwise derailed it. The result is a fun, rousing piece of Summer popcorn entertainment that actually gives us something fresh in an era of endless sequels and reboots.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has become a rather polarizing figure in recent years due to his personal beliefs, but his energy and charisma remain second to none. He's in nearly every scene, and he alone takes the film to a level it would not otherwise have reached with any other actor.<br/><br/>I had a few small gripes. The aliens remain faceless and without any clear agenda, and though rendered impressively, their rather busy design and movements make them hard to track during the movie's many action sequences.

","Action-packed summer tent-poles continue with EDGE OF TOMORROW, Tom Cruise stars in this hardcore alien slasher (with an estimated exorbitant budget of $178,000,000), directed by THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002, 8/10) alum Doug Liman, although it has been dead on arrival in the domestic box office, Tom Cruise' more appealing international star-power can be the last straw to make the ends meet. <br/><br/>Blatantly ripping of the time-loop concept from GROUNDHOG DAY (1993, 9/10) and SOURCE CODE (2011, 8/10) , the film craftily grafts it on a Sci-Fi battleground with Mimics, an alien species (with metal tentacles and high-speed mobility) invading the Mainland Europe, after his first-day in the front-line, rookie soldier Cage (Cruise) dies in a blast together with a giant blue Mimics (Alpha, one out of several millions), doused in its blood, he miraculously wakes up alive and kicking at the camp one day before, afterward, every time he dies, time jumps back to this exact same time slot and he gains experience while others are oblivious of all the happenings.<br/><br/>So, there is a quite plausible explanation about this whimsical setting, after meeting a female warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt), who has undergone the same situation months earlier and been deprived of her ability after a blood transfusion, Cage sides with her to find out a way to destroy Omega, the highly-intelligent brain behind all the Mimics who can anticipate human race's every and each move because it has the ability to turn back time, whenever an Alpha one dies, time- loop is intrigued to revive it to a near time-line, by coincidence Cage is mistakenly resuscitated in light of covered with Alpha's blood, he becomes a surrogate of the Alpha he killed as far as in Omega's mindset, it all lies in the blood. <br/><br/>After umpteen death (sometimes conducted by a cavalier Rita and teems with satisfactory gags here), Cage has evolved into a competent warrior and finally, they are on a one-last-chance journey (after Cage loses his ability too) to exterminate Omega under the Louvre Museum before the losing battle begins. <br/><br/>Slyly imitating the WWII D-Day invasion, the movie is a rip-roaring riot with its fast-paced editing (cheap-looking CGI though, makes one wonder how do they spend all that money? Cruise's pocket, maybe), Cruise is always in his tiny hero mode although this time he starts as a total greenhorn, the opening two-hander between him and Brendan Gleeson (as General Brigham) is rib-tickling as though the hefty Brigham is going to personally teach Cage a lesson for being a smug business man who gets cold feet when coerced to enter the real battlefield. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt (fresh from Rian Johnson's time-travel enterprise LOOPER 2012, 6/10) brings about a potent pulse as a bona-fide heroine, almost equally shares the save-the-world undertaking with Cruise, pitifully, the film is betting on Cruise's trademark, what would happen if it is Rita who drops the grenade near the coda? Maybe with a bit flashback of the expedition about how she finally cracks the time-loop theory in the first place. I cannot even imagine that, how awesome it would be! <br/><br/>Anyway, the picture is compelling entertaining, with a sophisticated script behind to support its primary assumptions, with a video-game setting of immortality to pander to its core audience, and efficiently omits the tiresome context-supplement process every time Cage restarts his routine day. We can only blame Cruise's waning sway in North American for its lukewarm debut weekend, it is time to consider Blunt as an action lead and she will shine no matter what."

","EDGE OF TOMORROW (2014) *** Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Brendan Gleeson, Bill Paxton, Jonas Armstrong, Tony Way, Kick Gurry, Franz Drameh, Drgomir Mrsic, Charlotte Riley, Masayoshi Haneda, Terence Maynard, Noah Taylor. SOURCE CODE meets GROUNDHOG DAY by way of Philip K. Dick could have been the pitch for this hybrid sci-fi vehicle for Cruise as a callow, cowardly military PR man in the midst of a cosmic calamity: invading malevolent aliens hellbent on destroying mankind hurl him into a never-ending time-loop video game-like reset each time he's killed. The crux is to relive his death for the common good and remember every step of the doomed battle to ensure a better strategy with time running out and the only one who will listen to him is a warrior soldier (a game Blunt) who is a kindred spirit of sorts. Mixed with a dark sense of humor sprinkled amidst the carnage and somewhat predictable trappings of the sub genre yet engaging thanks to its star and a fast- moving, quick-witted screenplay adaptation by veteran scribe Christopher McQuarrie and Jez & John-Henry Butterworth based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" and director Doug Liman's swift momentum of brain and brawn in equal measures."

","This movie managed to avoid the problems manifest in movies dealing with time. The plot is exceptional and the main characters deliver outstanding performances. The movie is not only dynamic but it is intelligent (unlike Oblivion where the creature is so easily duped). I dislike movies that appear to perpetuate the theme of ""save the world"" and they end up being more of the ""save your girlfriend."" This film didn't sacrifice the theme to honor some angst-driven patriarchal notion (it helps that Emily Blunt's character is a harcore badass). I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes well drawn action films where the characters actually make smart decisions."

","Wow! What can I really say without spoiling anything for those who have yet to see this movie or deciding to see this movie?!<br/><br/>With recent release of X-Men Days of Future Past and the upcoming release of Transformers Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow is slapped right in the middle of big name releases. <br/><br/>The pace of the movie was good, I thought it would be slow and dragged out considering that the movie is based upon the fact that Cage(Tom Cruise) relives the day over and over again every time he dies, the director makes sure that it isn't dragged out and I actually enjoyed it. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise character was played really well, he actually showed off his acting skills in this movie, I thought I was going to be watching Oblivion or one of his flops of recent years again, but he surprised me. His character fits the role and he really sold me on Cage. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt also warmed up, she played her part really well, living to the name of ""full metal b!tch"" but then we get a development on the reason why she was how she was. <br/><br/>The movie is based on the Japanese novel ""All you need is kill"" and it was well done. The ending leaves open to a sequel perhaps? The author, Hiroshi Sakurazaka did announce that he was penning a sequel to his novel ""All you need is kill"". Perhaps this will take time after Cage has learned to control the Mimics time power? <br/><br/>This is actually a movie I wouldn't mind watching a second time maybe in 3D. It may not have the ""wow"" factor of beloved comic book heroes of X-men, or the toy and Saturday cartoon nostalgia of Transformers, but I can honestly say that I would rate Edge of Tomorrow above X-Men Days of Future Past."

","I went into this with little to very minor hype to be amazed with the outcome. Edge of Tomorrow is one of those time traveling movies very closely related to Groundhog Day. Out of those two, EoT beats groundhog day so much. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunts chemistry between each other was an unforgettable one. They both share a similar quality with each other which both contains time travel. Out of all the movies i've seen so far in my lifetime, EoT is in my top favorites even while the movie wasn't even done yet. A quality I really liked about this film was that they didn't repeat the same scene over and over again to let the viewers wondering just like the other people in the same scene. I would definitely watch this again to get a better understanding though. All in all I give EoT a 9/10"

Blunt was great in her Role. One thing I didn't get at all was the 3d. I think the movie would be fine in 2d. I think that 3d added nothing to the movie.

","I'm going to keep this short: if you like Tom Cruise, action thrillers, sci fi, strong heroines, and/or borderline gimmicky time loop stuff, see this movie. Tom Cruise proves that even though he's kind of old, he still has enough charm and looks to carry a film. Emily Blunt, however, is the real revelation here. We saw Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, we know Cruise still has it, but no one could have guessed that the woman who became famous for roles in movies like The Devil Wears Prada could possibly shoot aliens and look bad-ass. But shoot them she does. And bad-ass she looks. The story is interesting, and there is more wit than most of modern ""comedies."" Yes, the premise does kind of sound like that of Groundhog Day, and some plot mechanics of that film (the same load of dialogue over and over again, main character is no longer a despicable human being at the end), but it does it all well, and in an action-thriller way. If you want an incredibly fun night, rent this movie."

This is my first review and previously I used IMDb's user reviews as my main source of wanting to know whether to go and see a film or not.<br/><br/>Nowadays, I try to ignore the 10/10 and conversely 1/10 reviews and look for the intelligent, thoughtful insights - skipping over the clearly fan/non-fan submissions.<br/><br/>This is getting harder as more keyboard warriors have a written 'voice'.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, this is an average, at best schlock, with Tom Cruise going through the obligatory TC motions. This is not original or thought provoking but it is fun. To give it 10/10 is to say it is better than Interstellar or Star Wars (original, groundbreaking sci- fi) is really to miss the point of our responsibility as general reviewers. <br/><br/>I had fun, I enjoyed it immensely. The special effects we really good, but of course with all sci-fi there will be plot-holes. I like plot-holes as they give you a chance to formulate your own opinions and second guess the writers. Emily Blunt (who was impeccable as always) putting TC out of his misery time and again was a really enjoyable sequence.<br/><br/>But let's get back to being informative, to give others a chance to decide whether we want to see something or not. The IMDb is not a fan-forum, it's for us to give our honest opinions.<br/><br/>Sorry, a little rant but I couldn't hold out any longer.<br/><br/>P.S. is it now a mandatory for TC to have a shot of him riding a motorcycle in every film now?

"seducamedusa","8","1","5","15 February 2015"," Cliché of Tomorrow
","There's nothing intrinsically wrong with this movie. Except to say that it doesn't seem to know what genre it fits into. First, it starts off feeling a little 'Minority Report'. Maybe that's Tom Cruise's presence and the sci-fi edge. But then it goes all, 'Groundhog Day' with touches of humour included. Which was kind-a cute but as the movie progressed, it was as if they forgot about that bit and proceeded with the movie properly. Oh, and then of course, we get the (ding-ding-ding - cliché blockbuster movie device - the female lead. Again, there's nothing wrong with her role. In fact, Emily Blunt is a physical tour-de-force. Think Terminator 2's version of Sarah Connor, and you'll have some idea of her physicality, if not her personality. Except for the tacky bit of sexual tension they've just thrown in for the leads. Well hey, it's Cruise. Better kiss the boy. Speaking of cliché, we have the rest of the cast. From the rag-tag bunch of supporters, there's Bill Paxton gone all 'Big Love' but his sub-ordinates aren't his wives, they're his soldiers. He's got the corny southern accent and I'm left wondering if every sergeant in the US army is a smart mouthed, small of intellect, slow on uptake nincompoop. It certainly is the case in Hollywood and he's no exception, except to say, he's not of African decent. I won't do the list but the team has a pink dressing gown wearing smartguy, a female whose attempting to channel 'Aliens' Private Vasquez, and what d'ya know, they play poker, against the good sergeant express wishes. Oh and make jokes about dead guys, foreshadowing, y'know ""the jokes on you"" sort of thing. Sheesh! My eyes are getting fatigued from all the rolling they're doing. They even have a slimmed down version of Ripley's power loader. Special effects? Overall they're pretty good. Some of it moves that little bit too quickly which makes it seem like the producers are trying to blur the lines of the creatures so you can't see the strings (kidding) but when Cage (Cruise) gets it from the big baddie (as opposed to the slightly smaller baddie), all I could think was that he's been taken out by a monster with lethal halitosis. So, he gets reborn and learns all the way too... +the angel of somewhere+ that he prattled on about as some army smooth guy that liaises with the media to push the propaganda, thus enabling even more rough-and-readies to enlist. Apparently. We know this because he tells it to some fat Englishman in camos, with an even fatter office in Whitehall. Oh, and it was in the opening scenes. Perhaps they think we couldn't work that one out by ourselves. The office is so ostentatious, I almost expect James Bond to walk in. Well, he has a secretary that's doing a pretty good facsimile of, well every proper English lady secretarial type. She's minor but survives. Actually, that brings me to the death toll and true to its groundhog pretensions, people who died survive. Lucky for the angel. Fat soldier in camos throws Cage into the front lines and thank goodness for Groundhog day. Well hey, the baddies even come out of the ground. Before you know it, Cage and whats-her-name are off to save the world but there's big mumma alien to find and deal with. She's one tricky creature for something that doesn't move. At all. ""I'm over here"" They go there. ""haha.., suckers. I'm actually over here. Oops, y'bastards found me."" Kissy-kissy and the bells are ringing and groundhog day concludes. What do we have - Groundhog-Aliens-An Officer and a Gentleman-World WarZ. Too long of a title. We'll call it something really inspired. ""Edge of Tomorrow"". Because that's so damned original. Hey, don't misunderstand me. Watch it by all means. It's a fun but predictable ride with some very clever CGI and I guess a broken heart thrown in. Or not. Hard to tell.

The subject matter is serious but there are a fair amount of laugh out loud moments along the way that add to the entertainment value. The acting is top notch by all. Bill Paxton gives a great little performance in a smaller role. Emily Blunt is also a very good, maybe slightly underrated talent, that always brings reality to the characters she plays. Tom Cruise is a very talented actor who has gotten caught up in his off screen personal life distracting sometimes from his on screen performances. <br/><br/>Overall this movie has a little bit of everything and easily makes my best list of 2014 films.

Japanese during WW2 was like Nazis. they invaded, manipulated, conscripted for labour, killed and raped many other Asian people. and they developed thinking that their race is superior against all other Asian races, and even whites.<br/><br/>formally, japan never, ever have apologized to those pan-Asia wartime victims. not one prime minister of japan apologized to those people, maybe, some lower, lower hands politicians have, but not one single Japanese prime minister.<br/><br/>while at the same time, Japanese so-called emperor, himself apologized to the us, belittling himself, ending the WW2.<br/><br/>there were many Asian females (all of them girls aged as early as mid- teens, who mostly, i believe, could have been virgins, if it matters) so-called ""comfort women"" around Japanese army bunker, who were conscripted against their will, who had to sell themselves against their will, and they include many Korean, Chinese, and Filipino and so on.<br/><br/>because when Japanese government acknowledge the fact that there have been ""comfort women"" conscription, then there would be big-time law suits against Japanese government, and it would cost a humongous money, there never have been any acknowledgement from Japanese government. furthermore, there are still Japanese right-wing sentiment (Japanese supremacist against all other Asian races, and even whites--i'm saying this, because i know how white people view themselves) around japan as always, this problem has never been solved. And those wartime victims (comfort women), especially around Korea and china are not surviving, due to their old ages. and because of the fact that they have been conscripted as a comfort women, these (now-ages-old grandmas) victims couldn't even have a normal life--happy family, husband, kids, and grand-kids. even worse, present Japanese prime minister ""abe"" is spreading a rumour (actually, not a rumour, told in a official press conference) that these women were conscripted with their consents, wtf!<br/><br/>i know my review is becoming very political, but what people have to know, it have to be revealed, right? because it has been concealed for a very long, long time. if it's not a news for you, but then it's okay, but when it is, then think, and consider the circumstances happening around Asia, especially around Korea, china, and japan, and recent Japanese right-wing movements (Japanese supremacists), and judge for yourselves!<br/><br/>so, now back to ""kamikame"", i heard a news that Japanese government submitted ""kamikaze"" pilots' letters to UNESCO to them to be considered a historical, memorial record.<br/><br/>""The letters are among a collection of historical documents, including diaries, wills and other personal items of the doomed pilots, being submitted to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register by the city of Minami-Kyushu, in southern Japan. It was from there that many kamikaze pilots took off on their final missions against Allied shipping taking part in the invasion of Okinawa in 1945.""<br/><br/>(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/ news/worldnews/Asia/southkorea/10621935/ Kamizake-letters-submitted-to-UNESCO-register.html, Feb 06, 2014)<br/><br/>i don't know if Japanese government want to canonize these people or not, but i smell something fish around this happening. japan always want to symbolize the fact that they were the victims of the war, i understand that. but true, worse victims of this war (WW2, and by Japanese right-wing, supremacist-thinking resulted in Japanese invasion around other Asian countries) were the ""other"" Asians themselves.<br/><br/>furthermore, there have been kamikaze pilot members of Koreans, and i don't think it really happened in ""voluntary"" circumstances. or maybe they were lured into their families' better lives. (while when conscripting so many women around Asia to be sold as a sex slaves to Japanese army, i don't think it has nothing to do with the assumption that they offered the better lives, for the vicims' families). and i think there could have been Chinese kamikaze pilots too, but i don't know about this fact.<br/><br/>anyway, are they victims, or enemies? is kamikaze pilots, or Japanese government victims, or monsters? i don't know about that. and this is the sentiment i got from watching this movie, especially, since as i know, this movie is based on a Japanese novel, very timely. i see a lot of reference to technological, mundane, superficial aspects of modern life, and even many crazy fps, shoot-em-all, or rpg games, and that was good. but then i kept asking myself.<br/><br/>who were the true victims of the war?"

","While ""Edge of Tomorrow"" doesn't revolutionize the Sci-Fi industry or bring anything that haven't already been seen in other movies to the genre, then it still turned out to be an entertaining movie. Sure, it was predictable to the core, but still entertaining.<br/><br/>The story is about an alien race invading Earth, and while man is fighting a losing battle, Cage (played by Tom Cruise) finds himself dying on the battlefield. But in those last moments, as alien blood wash over him, Cage wakes up to the same day, and must learn how to get through the same day over and over until finally coming to to learn the secret of how to end the alien invasion. Whenever he dies, the day resets and he starts all over.<br/><br/>Right, well it is bluntly put a no-brainer here. Live - Die - Repeat. Think ""Groundhog Day"" meats ""Starship Troopers"" and you end up with ""Edge of Tomorrow"".<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was good, and Tom Cruise delivers as he always does, despite having a very generic role and character in this movie. And of course, the day is saved by a single man, a single American soldier. But hey, you saw that ending coming the moment the movie started. Yeah, it is just that predictable.<br/><br/>While having a generic storyline, what drives ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is the intensity of the movie. There is always something going on, lots of fast paced action and nicely shot sequences. And of course, this is also an effect movie. And the CGI team really pulled it off nicely here, and the creature design was quite interesting.<br/><br/>I will go out on a limb here and say that the most memorable performance in the entire movie was that of Bill Paxton in the role as Master Sergeant Farell. He was just so well cut out for this particular role, just a shame he wasn't down in the trenches all that much throughout the movie.<br/><br/>This no-brainer is a fairly worthy addition to the Sci-Fi genre, just don't expect it to reinvent the wheel or anything. Cruise and Blunt delivers where it counts, and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is entertaining and enjoyable for what it is - generic storyline aside and all."

Terminator's been done--and so has Alien (and wait until you see the enemy and then tell me they're not ""Predator"" clones). There's such a thing as homage and there's such a thing as outright theft in bad taste. You'll have to make the judgment on this one yourself."

","Tom Cruise seems to be the actor to turn to for interesting sci-fi. In *The Edge of Tomorrow* he stars in yet another complex film which, if not as engaging as *Minority Report*, is nevertheless thoughtful. The film is an allegory for the endless wars that the West seems to have been engaged in with a stream of bogeymen that begins in this film with Napoleon but we might say really begins with Homer. The enemy here are called ""Mimics"" because they mimic the enemies from the many wars that have been sold as the great war to end all wars. Their real identity doesn't matter, for they are just an excuse for the endless fighting, signified by the endless loop Cruise's character finds himself in until he can kill the leader, whom he first seeks in Germany (for obvious reasons) but finds under the Louvre, the museum built on the spoils of Napoleon's wars. After killing the monster, of course, the war machine still thrives, and the female companion, along with the cliché of a misfit platoon that assists them, continues to train for the next inevitable war. Now, like the old-timers in the pub, they have their own invasion of Normandy to wax nostalgic about as a model for the next generation of warriors. Even the title is a combination of two soap operas, implying that the story is just as long and just as uninteresting as these endless dramas. Of course, pop culture needs to be subversive about such attitudes to war, and naive members of the audience are free to respond to the clichés of the characters and plot with no thought of irony while they enjoy the action, just as some critics will find fault with these very clichés, as if they were not intentional. Well done! This is an especially appropriate movie in the anniversary year of the beginning of the senseless WWI."
"TheMovieVlog","6","1","5","3 June 2014"," Way better than expected!
","Tom Cruise has been known to fight aliens before, but while his latest effort mimics the best of the genre (Aliens, The Matrix) while adding aspects of history (the Normandy from Saving Private Ryan) and glimpses of comedy (Groundhog Day), this movie ultimately feels pretty damn fresh. Time loop films can easily get repetitive, but director Doug Liman is too smart to give us the same scenes over and over. They all serve a purpose, move the plot, add humor or turn out to be frustrating dead ends for the protagonists. Once you accept the admittedly random reason behind the premise, there is no way not to enjoy this fun ride. This is all too cleverly crafted, breaking the chain of formulaic repetition with a pretty smart script, genuinely thrilling action sequences and impressive special effects. Following the kind of flawed heroes you enjoy growing invested in really helps, of course. Cruise-haters can instead take joy in seeing him getting killed over and over again. But make no mistake: We haven't had a grand-scale alien invasion thriller that worked so well in years, while knocking the audience's socks off."

","Tom Cruise gets to storm the beaches of WWII France as Player 2 in a first-person-shooter video game. Except the teenage boys who buy all the movie tickets don't think of Germans as the enemy, so we have aliens setting up shop in modern-day France and threatening Earth's good guys. 
At first, Cruise doesn't know how his game controller (aka personal weapon system) works. He doesn't have the slightest idea of which moves to make and he gets killed before he's racked up too many points.
Luckily, this isn't a realistic war movie, it's a video game. So Player 2 gets to start over. He zips through the preliminary stages and this time tallies a few more points before he gets killed. 
During one of these game-lives he meets Player 1 just before they're both killed. Before they hit Play Again, Player 1 has her friend explain to Player 2 (and us) what the objective of the game is so that he's not just pressing random buttons and getting killed too early in the game. Player 1 then teaches Player 2 her best moves. In turn, Player 2 teaches Player 1 his best strategy. 
They get better and better at it each time until they're both racking up the points and they get past Stage 1. 
And on it goes until they get to the final stage. 
There's nothing original in this extravaganza of noise and flashing lights. But as a video game with a bunch of Hollywood cliches tacked on, a $200M budget, and a superstar as Player 2, it's a reasonably entertaining, if immediately forgettable, diversion for a couple of hours. I wouldn't play it a second time."

","So lets tackle the elephant in the room, here we have aliens who can turn back time on Earth, so if they do that on Earth they must do the same for every planet in our solar system and the sun, also everything in our galaxy and universe. These creatures were called gods in biblical times, so these masters of space and time have angry steel wool balls as foot soldiers? What I enjoyed in the movie, the landing on the beach which showed the chaos and carnage with a nod to several D-day movies, good action scenes, good special effects. What did I not enjoy, Tom Cruise who I always think beneath his bonhomie exterior has some thing icy at his core seems pretty bored by it all, I appreciate he has to give the appearance of tedium as each day is repeated but he displays all his emotional acting skills from A to B. I have rarely observed such a lack of chemistry between the leading man and woman as displayed in this movie. I enjoy science fiction but I like it a bit more believable if that is not an oxymoron, this movie is simply so unbelievable it struggles to keep attention between set piece action scenes, not a horrendous movie but not that good."

","Bill Cage(Cruise, charming as always, here in spite of a role that starts out thanklessly grating) is the strawman coward nothing' like those self-sacrificing warriors that we need in order to win! Seriously, it's not new that Hollywood can be years behind reflecting the actual public opinion, but for it to be this aggressive and while pro-war is by its nature on the wrong side of history, regardless of what people think at the time, now, today, with a couple of recent(some unfinished) wars that should never have been started just, wow. Anyway, he has to go with the memorable lot(if it does feel a tad like they were just going through the token minorities to stock the group; in general, characterization is good, albeit no one gets to be all that deep), J Squad, into the Invasion-of-Normandy-like(rather well-done) retaking of France. He gains the ability to repeat the same 24 hours infinitely, and trains as a soldier and works towards victory.<br/><br/>Let's deal with the other elephant in the room immediately. Yes, the core concept is doomed from the onset for this genre. There is simply almost no tension for the 110 minute running time(not counting the end credits). Surprise, yes, because we don't know what'll happen. Our protagonist, however, does, and since he feels no fear, neither do we. This does get a lot of its solid humor from the repetition that tends towards not being tedious, but rather imaginative. But yes, sad as it is, this has no real excitement. And it is a real shame. Because the action is fun, well-choreographed, as well as personal and intimate in its perspective, making it chaotic(without ever being overpowering or unpleasant to watch). The gags are great. Still, for ""lots of epic stuff-go-boom with little consequence 'cause that's hard"", this is by no means, yet easily the worst.<br/><br/>With a mix of practical and CGI, the FX are another strong suit. The 3D is barely noticeable, though. The look is at points similar to Terminator for the post-apocalyptic war-zone(other spots in this are just abandoned), with Matrix-like Sentinels, without any ripping off of other, better movies. Y'know, other than at least two bits it lifts directly from Aliens(and they're not even related to Paxton he does enjoy himself, and so do we). Little insight into the outer space threat is nothing new, especially these days, but we know so little about the Mimics that we viewers can't ""play along"", such as the few times where our guys hidewhen we, the audience, have no clue how they detect humans!<br/><br/>This has a lot of implied violence and a little brutal, bloody, gory and/or disturbing content. I recommend it to those looking for light(outside of maybe the sci-fi) Summer Blockbuster. 7/10"

This could've been a great movie if it were presented 10x better, and it pains me to know that the director will probably never redeem himself after a blunder as big as this one.

"orri-13-158625","5","1","9","7 June 2014"," How often can you kill Tom Cruise?
","Edge of Tomorrow is directed by Doug Liman and stars Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. The film revolves around the earth being invaded by deadly aliens and the human race being on the edge of extinction. The aliens are winning the war and we decide to make one last push on the beaches of France in a deadly battle that we lose and everything is lost. One of the things that the film tries to do is defy genre convention. It tries so hard avoiding the obvious cliché that comes with a script like this and it does it so well up until the last act, which is arguably the least satisfying conclusion to a film that I have seen in a long time. <br/><br/>I wasn't originally going to be seeing this film in theaters but after hearing the praise it got from critics I started debating on whether to see this or X-Men but after receiving a free movie ticket I made the obvious choice of seeing Edge of Tomorrow. I mean, you can't turn down a free movie ticket! To make a long story short, I should have gone with X-Men.<br/><br/>On the eve of the landing, Pvt. Bill Cage (Cruise) is sent to the front line and is killed within the first five minutes of battle. This first act is so well made and treated with such respect that the rest of the film just seems underwhelming compared to the thrilling ride of the first half. Before his death, Cage was infected with an alien gene that gave him the ability to relive the same day over and over again giving the movie a lot to work with as it has so much going for it. Unfortunately it could have been so much better. The best part is without a doubt some of the clever plotting that makes the time loop aspect of the film never seem predictable or boring. There was probably not a single moment during the first half that made me want to close my eyes and fall asleep. The second half however is a cheesy, badly paced action cliché, which is a shame. <br/><br/>The acting was terrific, with Tom Cruise doing one of the most demanding roles of his career. Cruise's character was very complex and well thought out and I praise the writers for that. I love the fact that Tom Cruise commits himself to the action so much cause he really wants the audience to have a good time. Emily Blunt was so great in this film and I almost think that she should have been the star of the show with all her terrific action scenes. All of the actors did a really good job with their roles but what's sad is that there is almost no character development and Edge of Tomorrow suffers from that. Although the acting is great I didn't give a dime about any of the supporting characters making the film seem a little bland. Thankfully the first half mostly revolves around Cage so it doesn't hurt the overall experience to much. The cinematography was a hit and miss in this film. Sometimes the picture is just beautiful to look at with cool wide shots that hold the mediocre special effects whilst at other times the film feels like something a four year old with a camcorder could do better. It's annoying and distracts from the overall experience. I thought the soundtrack was all right and suited the film for what it is, a mediocre popcorn flick, filled with action clichés but redeems itself with an interesting main character, a plot that is all right for the most part and some cool battle scenes. If that is something you are looking for than go ahead, Edge of Tomorrow is your thing! However, if you want to see a film with a good consistent story, beautiful images throughout, good solid character development that sinks you right in and a satisfying end conclusion, you should rather go with X-Men: Days of Future Past."

","I didn't really expect much from this movie. The trailers made me think ""Oh, it's just Tom Cruise playing the same character over and over."" However, after giving this film a chance, I'm glad I saw it. While it felt a bit redundant at times (But I guess that's the point) and started off a bit slow, by the end I was enchanted. This is one movie Hollywood should NOT make a sequel to because this movie would be instantly tainted. This is not your typical sci-fi movie and is actually quite original. It's interesting to see how just one choice can cause a different outcome then a different choice. My one complaint was it wrapped everything up vaguely and too quickly. It feels like there's no ending. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not to keep the main idea of the movie but it felt rushed to me. I did enjoy the strategy concept of this film, and how it felt like it was poking fun at regenerating every time you die in a video game and have to watch the same cutscene every time. I'm pretty sure this was unintentional, but it was genius. I enjoyed this film and it's quite a shame it's considered a box-office flop.

","Edge of Tomorrow was a pleasant surprise for me going in. Of the big blockbuster movies coming out in the summer of 2014, Edge of Tomorrow was one of the ones I was looking forward to least, but I ended up really liking it. In fact, it is probably one of the better movies of the summer so far. They took an unoriginal premise and actually made it work. Tom Cruise does a great job. The action and effects were also very well-done.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a man named William Cage (Tom Cruise) who is a Major in the American army. However, he is mostly a public speaker and is not used to combat. He is suddenly forced into this huge battle with an alien race which up until now have been unmatched by any military in the world. This was supposed be the deciding battle for the humans but it goes horribly. However, when Cage kills an alpha alien and dies he gains their ability. Now whenever he dies he repeats the same day before the big battle over and over again until he is able to destroy the aliens' power source. To do this he must get the help of a soldier named Rita (Emily Blunt).<br/><br/>The film does many things amazingly. I like the way they handle rinse and repeat type of story. I have seen this many times so I was not expecting too much going in, but I thought it was handled well. I love how Cage is able to take everything he has experienced from his countless repeats and use it to his advantage, whether it comes to his combat skills, to him relating and reasoning with the rest of the cast. The film is also very funny in how Cage repeats everything. I love how he gets wasted countless times in battle or by Rita herself. I especially love the training sequence where he constantly gets seriously injured and Rita kills him and he has to start over. This film really does feel like a video game where when you die you start the mission again, except I am watching instead of playing.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise does a great job in this. His character is the driving factor in this film. If not for him I would not like this film nearly as much as I do. I like how he starts out as a wimp in the beginning (which I am not used to seeing) and steadily grows more and more badass as the film progressed. Cruise has done many Sci-Fi films in the last few years like Oblivion. I like Oblivion a bit more than this, but this is still well-done. I also love Bill Paxton in this. I like his character and his performance is great. I have not seen Paxton in a major film in years so it was great to see him back.<br/><br/>As I said before the action and special effects look nice. The design for the aliens is something I have not quite seen before. I also like their ability that they gave to Cage. I have seen better looking aliens but I think they look fine.<br/><br/>I do have a couple issues though. Other than Cruise and Paxton's characters I did not find the rest of the cast to be that memorable. Rita is okay and Emily Blunt does a good job performance-wise. However, despite having some cool moments, I was just was not that invested in her. When her and Cage are having their romantic and dramatic moments I did not care. The other important characters are the people in Paxton's platoon. I do not remember any of these people. At first I thought this was going to be like Aliens where you have a group of very like able and badass marines, but that is not the case. They are boring and ultimately pretty irrelevant.<br/><br/>Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is an entertaining Sci-Fi movie that takes a premise we have seen many times and puts a relatively new spin on it. I think you should definitely check it out. Unfortunately, like with Oblivion, it seems that the film is not doing very well in the US which is a shame."

At this point we find out Cage is a coward and gets demoted to a private, placed in the front lines.<br/><br/>Like a video game, when your character dies, you get to go back to your last save point, you play some more, level up, and try something else.

","'Edge Of Tomorrow (2014)' didn't do all that well at the box office, prompting the distributors to try and push an alternate title for the Blu-Ray release ('Live. Die. Repeat.') in the hopes that consumers would mistake it for a new release and give it a go - though, this must've worked since a sequel (annoyingly titled 'Live. Die. Repeat. And Repeat.') is supposedly on the way, even if it's not always a good idea to force a follow-up to what should be a future classic. This fantastic sci-fi film is an exciting, edge-of-your-seat experience throughout that mixes pulse-pounding, expertly choreographed, often large-scale yet always character-focused action with intriguing genre elements that create both a sense of mystery and an incredibly unique viewing experience on the whole, as the 'time-loop' conceit (which isn't just stolen from 'Groundhog Day (1993)') provides a constantly evolving but always consistent framework for the narrative to take place in; each iteration of our protagonist's journey feels like another step to solving a puzzle as opposed to anything even remotely repetitious. The only real flaw with the piece is its kind of cop-out, 'Hollywood' ending that makes sense only to a point and isn't quite in keeping with what we've seen before, but even this doesn't stop it from being one of the best entries in its genre. 8/10"

","That may be a line from Mad Max: Fury Road, but it fits this film perfectly.
If you are familiar with Groundhog Day and Source Code, then add war and aliens and you get this movie. You have to be very, very careful with this as well. Basically, Tom Cruise is an inexperienced (yeah, that's a first) officer who is afraid of blood, and he gets thrust onto the front lines. It's supposed to be a great victory, even having the name Operation: Downfall. Instead, the Mimics set it up for the world to throw all their soldiers right into an ambush. Then Cruise ends up getting an Alpha's blood mixed in him, granting him its time-manipulating powers. It becomes his job to relive every day, and slowly learn how to defeat the enemies. He meets Emily Blunt, the only person that will believe his situation, and she trains him to be able to defeat the aliens. Since the whole movie has the same day, same scenarios repeated, it's crucial to show enough to the audience without it looking repetitive. And I think this video game-like movie succeeds tremendously.<br/><br/>Hardly ever has an editor's job been more important or difficult. The result is very humorous at first at all of Cruise's deaths, but as he grows closer to Blunt and witnesses death every single day with little ability to make a significant impact, the dreading of having to do this again with no escape hits really hard.<br/><br/>If you're unfamiliar with Tom Cruise films, I may shun you at first; but do not worry, for I will gradually show more and more of his films (and so many are quite good). It's much more understandable to not know of Emily Blunt. And that is a shame, for she is a talented actress in some great films like The Adjustment Bureau and Looper (okay, she's probably known most for The Devil Wears Prada). Sadly, outside of these characters, there's nothing to cheer over with the supporting cast. But the focus is on the 2 stars, and that's the way it should be.<br/><br/>A cool addition to this sci-fi action flick is the exoskeletons worn by the soldiers. Resembling what was seen in Aliens, for the most part, the actors are actually doing stunts and wearing these. There's enough to figure out that it takes a couple of resets to be familiar with how to operate them.<br/><br/>One scene I particularly remember in Groundhog Day is Bill Murray at the bar, and slowly he finds the right words to say to make the conversation work; similarly, Cruise suffers many deaths only to be more aware for the next shot where he gets past the obstacle. The pacing is quick, but it also settles down for pondering the dire situation at hand. It's a combination of emotions that I think works very well. All in all, it's just such a fun and smart film that I'm really pleased to see made right.<br/><br/>In conclude<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a good film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a film that blends a hearty amount of action, comedy, and drama. I look forward to seeing more films from both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt."
"MJB784","8","0","1","21 May 2018"," It was almost great
","I thought it was a masterpiece until literally the last scene where I question why it would end that way. The scene before when I was certain it ended would have been a perfect ending and an equal to District 9 or the first two Terminators. I'm sure there's an alternate ending on dvd/blu ray even though the second to last sequence felt like an ending. Edge of Tomorrow is like a video game with intelligence. He dies, but learns how to defeat the enemy until the next location like when your character is on different levels of a video game. This is probably the best movie I've seen this year and certainly my favorite this summer! The story for Edge of Tomorrow sounds like a cross between Groundhog Day and Terminator. It's about a soldier that's thrown into this time loop where he dies and comes back battling robots every time. I would love to see it again and own this, but that final scene annoyed me."

","First time I saw it in theaters, I had no idea what I was going to: ""action flick with Tom Cruise? Urrr fine, let's check it out"", and wow. The movie is clearly above your average unknown action movie, it has something special. <br/><br/>I mean, there's Tom Cruise, a war and action, and it's based on a manga, this movie had all chances to be dumb as F but they somehow managed to make something pleasant to look at!
I can't judge this movie based on its source material since I've never read it, but as a standalone movie it holds up. <br/><br/>Whether you like him or not, Tom Cruise is very convincing and Emily Blunt seems to be built for tough roles, she looks pretty badass.

","I had a totally different expectation for this movie. I thought there was going to be somebody explaining the whole thing out at the beginning and you'd see it get played out. But no. This movie is almost like slightly lesser version of Minority Report with a really unique twist. you sort of go into the movie with so many questions, that you have to figure out based on the events in the movie.
Although there is some explaining as to his groundhog day-like day repeats, instead of just watching this character solve this confusing battlefront mystery, you are trying to follow it with him. 
I would say this movie focuses less on combat and more on this guys trying to figure out how he can stop this war using his unique borrowed power.
The ending - Wow. This was perfect to this movie's mysterious, out of place, tone. I really enjoyed how it ended on a cliff hanger, where you don't know if he stopped the omega or not, and you can use clues scattered throughout the movie to figure out/decide."

","Despite the presence of Tom Cruise, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a movie that flew somewhat under the radar back in the summer of 2014. Recouping only $100 million of its $170 million budget in domestic ticket sales, the movie proved to be a box office disappointment. However, it did perform better in foreign markets while also garnering a fair amount of praise from critics.<br/><br/>The movie casts Cruise as Major William Cage, a PR officer with no combat experience who gets demoted to private for disobeying orders on the eve of a massive offensive against an alien force. Thrust into the midst of a heated battle, Cage predictably doesn't last very long but when he dies he immediately wakes up on the previous morning with a full memory of what he has experienced. This sets up the movie's 'time loop' premise, whereby Cage continually dies only to experience the same day over and over again, learning from his mistakes and becoming a hardened combat veteran along the way. This draws obvious comparisons to the comedy classic ""Groundhog Day"" but in this case the phenomenon is given a scientific explanation. As with ""Groundhog Day"", the premise is utilized cleverly in the repetition of scenes with variations, often to comic effect. There's plenty of action as well and even some dramatic weight at times. Overall, while the general concept may be somewhat familiar, the story (which was adapted from a Japanese light novel) is one that should satisfy both science fiction fans and general moviegoers alike.<br/><br/>The cast is a pretty good one. Tom Cruise is well suited to his role and he receives excellent support from Emily Blunt, who plays a character that previously had the same condition as Cage. The supporting cast is mostly made up of relative unknowns who are nonetheless authentic. That being said, the supporting cast does include Brendan Gleeson & Bill Paxton, who are always welcome in any movie in which they appear.<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman did a good job here, balancing explosive sci-fi spectacle with lighter moments and even a dash of drama. The special effects are well done in a way that supports the story first and foremost, without drawing excessive attention to themselves. Both visually & musically, the movie is well executed though not necessarily exceptional. Probably the best technical aspect of the film is the editing, which is especially important in a movie with an unconventional narrative like this.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a finely tuned action movie with a pair of first-rate performances and a clever, absorbing plot. The reasons for its relatively lukewarm reception are anyone's guess but I suspect that American audiences probably just didn't have much interest in seeing Tom Cruise in another sci-fi action movie (particularly after the previous year's similarly tepid response to ""Oblivion""). In any case, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is well worth watching, both for fans of science fiction and fans of Tom Cruise in general."

Emily blunt was also very good, believable, tough and sexy.<br/><br/>A pretty inventive sci-fi thriller following Cruise as an officer (who has never seen a day of combat in his life) as he is thrust onto the battlefield as a soldier, repeatedly reliving his own death as he is killed on the battlefield while defending Earth from advancing alien invaders. Finally he seeks the help of a celebrated female warrior in order to defeat the extraterrestrials and save mankind.<br/><br/>Sometimes ""Groundhog Day"" type movies can be a bit too repetitive but with each subsequent redo here this managed to still remain fresh with some new bit of info Tom and the viewers experienced."
"arjunserenecertainty","9","0","1","9 November 2017"," Gripping movie with an interesting plot and good acting
","I remember watching behind the scenes footage and interviews for this movie back in 2014 and I really did not get the impression that this would be a memorable movie at all. It came across as some generic sci-fi flick that would be some nice popcorn accompaniment with special effects but nothing original in terms of plot and story.<br/><br/>Boy, was I blown away when I happened to watch this movie recently on Amazon Prime Video. The movie seems to be very original because I haven't seen a movie with such a unique narration style where most of the movie is about reliving and redoing what happened the first time.<br/><br/>Perhaps, this movie even has philosophic undertones as it made me ask the question and presumably more viewers, ""What if I had approached that situation differently or I approach this situation differently in the future, surely a different approach will alter the outcome vastly and perhaps our destiny will be very different if we adapt different attitudes."" <br/><br/>The movie definitely comes across at the start as very WW 2 like, reminiscent of the second world war as the troops make an ambitious savage surge at Normandy beach. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise acts very convincingly as a bumbling, floundering pretty man PR officer at first who is forced to join the infantry when he has no training and no interest in doing so. His transition from a reluctant inept coward to a virtuoso fast reflex sharp warrior is quite interesting to watch to say the least. <br/><br/>Rita (Emily Blunt), the female lead is very convincing in her bad ass role as she and Cage (Tom Cruise) work together to win the war by reliving and redoing things differently. <br/><br/>The only part of the movie I'm not fully satisfied with are the alien characters who don't seem to have much motive for their actions except for us to understand that they want to enslave humans and dominate Earth's natural resources. But then again, they are aliens who look fiercely savage and barbaric with their multi- tentacle fast lithe bodies and their savage screams with which they seem to kill all humans effortlessly. All the special effects are added in through the green screen and you'll have some laughs if you watch the movie and then see behind the scenes footage or images.<br/><br/>Except for Tom Cruise and Bill Paxton, most of the characters are British so there is a very healthy dose of British and American comedy which makes the film much more fun, providing great moments of relief to the viewer in a movie with a serious concept and plot.<br/><br/>Perhaps this sort of plot could even be made in to an interesting series to delve deeper in to the human characters as well as the aliens to understand their motives better.<br/><br/>Though I haven't watched any Doug Liman films before this I am definitely going to watch more of his movies now because this film is very good. The writers including Christopher McQuarrie, Jezz Butterworth, John Henry Butterworth as well as the editors James Herbert and Laura Jennings have done excellently in the writing and editing department -- making the movie slick and entertaining when this kind of plot could have been messed up. The cinematography by Dion Beebe and the music by Christophe Beck is breathtaking as well and definitely adds more atmosphere and layers to this movie. <br/><br/>The cameos by different actors is very good, comedic as well and it's a stellar team effort with everyone with big and smaller roles delivering some great acting performances. <br/><br/>Sometimes it's worth watching a movie even if the initial trailers, behind the scenes footage and interviews don't make it seem very interesting or original. This movie is very interesting and inspiring to say the least but don't take it too seriously, it's just a movie after all! Cheers and thanks for reading!!"

","Live, Die, Repeat: Edge of tomorrow.<br/><br/>The often quoted description of the film is ""A cross between 'Starship Troopers' and 'Groundhog Day'."". That may give an idea of the genre, but EOT in my opinion, surpasses both its parents and deserves the IMDb 7.9/10, despite the latter's 8.0/10 rating. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise (Major William Cage) makes the transition well into a relatively weak story-line. However, although I'm not really an Emily Blunt fan, she is cast faultlessly as Rita R Vratasky, a role which suites her so well, one almost feels it's her real life alter ego. <br/><br/>Quite a bit of the story building is intentionally repetitive, to give a sense of Cage's seemingly endless daily nightmare of dying and having to repeat every day. However, that itself is somewhat overdone, because most viewers will be able to imagine that the tiny daily advances will take hundreds of repetitions. <br/><br/>The scene leading up to where Cage and Vrataski finally get off the beach is probably the most memorable part of the film showing top class direction and production, then combining all the action, CGI and music (by Christophe Beck, who wrote the music for Frozen). <br/><br/>The plot does both lose its way and fade in excitement a little towards the middle of the film and the conclusion you will probably see coming even with both eyes closed.

Why!? Well, the one rational thing for the Omega to do is to kill an Alpha himself if someone breaks into whatever security perimeter. Think about it - the day would restart and as the Alpha and the Omega know about the powers the next attempt of an attack would be just futile. 2nd thought: in a battlefield of an Earth-scale even if there are only one Alpha in six-million units a battle for a planet would be an operation of all eternity.

","I so dislike Tom Cruise that when I pay attention to a character he's playing, I feel as if I've gotten my time's worth out of a movie. <br/><br/>I so like Emily Blunt that she could spout some dreary anti-Trump twaddle on a late-night comedy show, and I would turn off the sound and just gaze.<br/><br/>Doug Liman's Edge of Tomorrow gets off to such a weak start, with Cruise looking as if he lost his confidence when he heard ""action"" and Brendan Gleeson looking bored to tears, that I almost gave up. <br/><br/>But I stuck around, deciding I would give the movie a chance. <br/><br/>And off she went!<br/><br/>Cruise's character is such a spineless feather-merchant that you actually start to enjoy his discomfort-fear-loathing-confusion-panic as he gets dropped onto a beach in France to fight some sort of spider/octopus thingies, of which there are about a zillion. <br/><br/>He sees Blunt get killed, then gets it himself, and . . .<br/><br/>Wakes up where he started, at a staging area for the invasion force in England.<br/><br/>With some dandy editing, forgivable lapses in logic, enough true humor, and the whole concept of reliving your death so that you don't get killed, eventually, the viewer gets hooked. Deep.<br/><br/>And then the last reel starts, and the whole thing falls apart. It's a murky mess, with a bunch of volunteers helping Cruise and Blunt fight their way to the queen spider thingamabob (which actually looks like a spongy, electrified golf ball) to kill it. It's all so dark and confusing that the viewer wonders what the hell happened to the crisp narrative in the first two thirds.<br/><br/>Oh, well.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good use of time.

"Daedsikcaj","10","0","2","24 February 2017"," What I feel to be the best possible explanation for the ending.
","I just got done watching it, I'm really mad at myself for not seeing it sooner, and as I'm looking online for peoples interpretations of the ending I cannot find anyone who agrees with me. However that doesn't deter me from believing what I think really happens in the end because no other ending is as happy as what I think I may have seen, if it is really as clever a film as I believe it to be.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Most people seem to think that the last resetting of time has something to do with chronology; about when the Omega died and how that was earlier than the alpha so the time reset to an earlier point, I actually find that flimsy yet I'm seeing that everywhere.<br/><br/>Please hear me out but what if Cage is the now the Omega in the same manner that he was the Alpha and time wasn't just resetting to an earlier point based on outside circumstances, but it was being reset to a point designated by Cage and furthermore since the resetting of the day does not result in the loss of his powers but it becomes something that he keeps the way he kept the powers of the Alpha. Cage reset the day and he can do it again, and again, and again and now he functions as the controller rather than the trigger since it was the powers of the controller and not the trigger that he absorbed this time and ultimately, and this is where I'm gonna lose you but what if as an Omega himself he is fixated on his the relationship that he has with Rita and that, while the Omega reset the day whenever it's Alpha died, it's protector, half of what it needs to feel complete, who's bond is so unacceptable to be without, altering time itself rather than go on existing without the bond, what if now he will forever and ever be able to reset the day based on the death of Rita, his own Alpha, his own counterpart. <br/><br/>Just as the Alpha was the counterpart of the Omega and the Omega reset time rather than allow the loss of what is identifies to be an integral part of itself, so too does Cage now reset the day based on the being that he cannot and will not tolerate the loss of, the being that he is incomplete without .... and so now... Rita will never die, Cage will not allow it and will reset time any time that she does, and the two literally live happily ever, and forever and ever and ever and ever, after. Rita will go back to being the champion and hero of the war as the new Alpha and the protector that she already was in nature, so too will Cage revert back to his truer peaceful and non-violent nature, all the while empowering his chosen Champion just as he by nature found himself more suited to a life of rallying and inspiring troops to fight than to fight himself, becoming the love and undying support that the warrior needs every bit as much as the gentle half needs the protection of the warrior.<br/><br/>It's a little harder to see because the roles are flipped from what we are used to in terms of gender the men more traditionally being the fighters. But it isn't who these characters are. Cage has lived the life he lived up to the beginning of the film as a coward because the fight is not within his nature. And now that Cage has a choice in the matter, WHERE DOES TIME GET RESET TO. TO WHAT POINT? To a point that results in Cage never being forced to act against who he really is as a person. And time abilities or not Rita was a soldier and a fighter to start because that's who she is inside.<br/><br/>Cage picked a time that not only brings his other half back to life, but to a point where they are allowed to be themselves. Because now that he will be with Rita forever, wouldn't it be best if the love they will now get to have were based on honesty and truth with both eternal partners being who they really are? Aren't all lasting relationships and loves in life built around such fearless honesty about who we really are inside? Could any eternal love really work if either Cage or Rita were trying to be something that they are not? Can any of us really be loved if we aren't willing to bear our souls and show the ones we love who we really are? And would a love without end that repeats over and over forever, would that love demand anything less?<br/><br/>So it's not just ending about the potential for love or lucky timing that results in Cage being given a chance to try to win her over with a clever line. That would just cheapen things. it wouldn't merit the immortality that it's been granted. Instead it happens from the best possible beginning point. Where it can be laid on the solid groundwork of not just appreciation for the other, but of the self-acceptance and honesty that all unending loves demand."

Would put it up there with Alien & and all the other champions of sci-fi. My mind is still a little bit dizzy from just finishing the film, but felt compelled to write a review. Arguably one of the best I've ever seen. The camera filming, the way it must of been directed, all these things make it a true art of film- making. Although there were parts where you aren't always aware of what's going on it pieces itself together perfectly and I was kept on the edge of my seat for the entire film. Isn't that what films should do to us? I feel like that sort of thing is lost in modern film-making, but this truly is a marvel and I congratulate the director and writer for bringing to life such as genius idea."

The premise is used to great effect, with Tom Cruise's character, Cage, growing more and more competent with every loop. Emily Blunt is also great as the mentor character who has to learn everything again at the beginning of every cycle.<br/><br/>In terms of the film as a whole, the aesthetic is extremely well matched to the tone of the film and the film is very well written, with enough humour mixed in to make an excellent film.<br/><br/>The only reason that this film does not get a 10/10 from me is that the end feels a bit too much much like Deus Ex Machina but, in terms of the film, it works very well. As much as I don't like these kinds of ending where everything just gets wrapped up in a neat bow, this worked well. However I just can't give it 10/10 so Edge of Tomorrow gets a 9/10"
"Imdbidia","8","0","1","7 January 2017"," Action movie as best as it gets
","I loved this movie - the epitome of a good action movie, and a tribute to Cruise as action hero.<br/><br/>The Edge of Tomorrow reminded me of Groundhog Day in its philosophical premises. It is a constant day repeating itself until the hero gets it right. The difference is that in Groundhog Day the aim of the story is to give time to the character to redeem himself, to become his best self and get a fulfilling life; so the repeating day is a personal intimate quest. The Edge of Tomorrow is more about the process of change itself, on learning of your mistakes, correcting them, trying again until you achieve your goals. Of course, if you are a video-gamer that is what you do when you play, but I don't think it would be fair reducing this movie to a on-screen video-game, because I don't feel it is.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is the quintessential action hero to me. He is always fantastic in action movies, no matter the quality of the script, as he is able to carry his characters with honesty and soulfulness. This movie is greatly indebted to him because, although the script is good, Cruise nails it; we are there with Cage, not with Cruise, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Emily Blunt but she is believable in this movie, but not a romantic counterpart to Cruise. She and Cruise don't have much chemistry on camera; they would make good brother and sister, a romantic couple, not so much. Yet, the romantic story is not the essence of the story, so it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>All the supporting actors are terrific. <br/><br/>Frantic action and great special effects are two assets of this movie. The latter aren't there per se, to fill the gaps in the script and wow the spectator with fluff, they are there to serve the script and contribute to the overall story. That is how things should be in film making, but they are rarely so these days.<br/><br/>The film is very entertaining, a great action film, one of those films that ticks all the wows one expect to find in a 21st century action science-fiction film, but more indebted in its premises to the mindful action movies of the 1980s.<br/><br/>Pure entertainment and more than meets the eye in the story."

","I saw the trailer for this in the theater and wanted to check it out but my 11 year old regular movie companion passed, he was probably right at least for him. Cruise is an army officer with no taste for combat who gets railroaded into active duty against, well, one really tough bunch of alien invaders. Just by chance he happens to come into contact with a strange alien substance in his first battle and finds, after being exterminated, that he wakes up one day earlier being rousted (again) for duty. When this happens several times he is a much more capable fighter and begins to enlist the aid of Blunt, the ""Angel of Verdun"" who had the same thing happen to her some time before. Cruise continues his trial by error, getting further along against the aliens each day with the help of Blunt.<br/><br/>There is a grim humor to this, along with some pretty scary scenes. Whether you like Cruise or not there are certain movies just made for him, see War of the Worlds, and this one is right in his wheelhouse. Blunt is equally fine as the no-nonsense warrior. I thought the script was very intelligent and very involving and I highly recommend this movie."

The movie stars Tom Cruise as an Army Major who gets roped into participating in a live battle against an alien force as a PR stunt. Things quickly go south when his squad is ambushed and through a series of uncommon events, Cruise's character finds himself with the power to restart the day whenever he's killed. It's like mixing the movies Saving Private Ryan, Starship Troopers and Aliens with Groundhog Day which is pretty much like playing the game Halo on Legendary mode. Everything about this movie is a treat!

This movie is bound to be the action movie event of the summer and it earns every bit of it's high praise. If you have the chance to see it in IMAX take it into consideration, if not, at least see it in a theater because it's bigger than big and more action packed than anything I've seen in years.

It handles its premise very well, giving us the highlights of what would be a grueling, years-long experience for the protagonist.<br/><br/>Action scenes are fun, the acting is solid, and the movie manages to squeeze tiny moments of human contact in between moments of alien destruction. The movie never lags, and even though it's all about reliving a day, it's good at not repeating its own ideas.<br/><br/>The movie does get a little unfocused towards the end (but only a little) and the ending isn't especially convincing, but the overall experience is terrific."

","It is very easy to think that this movie depicts a video game and Tom Cruise its character, but as I put it, it's not the case.<br/><br/>Tom starts off from a safe point in time and space, heads off towards an unsafe battle, and every time he advances a length more to his last cruise. It is akin to the way one starts off in a video game, and advances every next game play to a better length.<br/><br/>Moreover, when the going gets tough and he is mature enough to understand the moves, he discovers a companion, Rita, who guides him in achieving the goal, killing Omega.<br/><br/>But the truth is vividly fascinating. The reason Tom is looping is because of the power he received through an alpha in his last battle, where he kills an alpha and is wounded severe enough in the process that the alpha's blood gets into his body, giving him the same power alphas possess - looping in time.<br/><br/>Best of luck getting heart broken with the fact."

It is a nice shift in the usual emotional-women dynamic and is also fully justified by the plot, since he gets to know her better every new day while she never gets to know him more than 24h.<br/><br/>I also really, really much enjoyed that romance is almost absent in the scenario - it is unclear if Cruise's character has feelings for Blunt's as a person he loves or simply as a person he got to care for because they went through so much sh*t together. The final kiss (sorry for the spoiler) annoyed me a bit, but seems like it was just a spur-of-the-moment/i'll die in 2 minutes thing.<br/><br/>(Just realized how much I'm annoyed by the fact that almost every movie-relationship between two characters of opposite gender around the same age always leads to a romance - no place for friendship, camaraderie...So this was a really nice and welcome change in the trope.)<br/><br/>So yes, if you love unromantic action movies with a bit of comedy, a bit of tragedy, good acting, great character writing and a original scenario - go see it!

","'Edge of Tomorrow' is the best Sci-Fi/Action flick one could hope for:) It cleverly combines drama, action and surprisingly humor with the fantastic directing of Doug Liman (Bourne Identity).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has without a doubt proved himself to be a shining action-star of this generation.

Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), better known in the war as the 'Angel of Verdun'. Blunt does a fine job of being the 'Full Metal B*tch' next to Cruise, having her character fleshed out more and more as the film progresses. Both her and Cruise make a decent pair although I personally thought someone much more attractive should have been cast in Blunt's role.<br/><br/>The trailers did a great job of concealing the Mimics/aliens, cause they are savage and scary as hell when they are seen in the final film. Hat's off to the effects team cause the visuals and designs of the aliens are simply fantastic. The Mech-Suites look bulking and odd when the actors wear them at first but once again, doubts are removed, cause they are f#%king badass once in combat.<br/><br/>It's hard to find a flaw in this movie other than the fact it had to end.

Fortunately, Edge of Tomorrow is a smart, often humorous and very tense film. The visuals are stunning, and it contains the best utilisation of 3D I've seen in a long while. Cruise is excellent (which grinds on me somewhat, as I really don't like the guy - but his talent is undeniable), and Blunt is effective and agile in her first action blockbuster.

The amount of times he dies and comes back to life is also a hilarious sequence. I must say that this is probably the only non-Ethan Hunt role Cruise has played that I liked; I don't generally like him as an actor but here he really does a great job. Emily Blunt was fantastic as well; she's a great female character and is absolutely lovely. The rest of the cast were great as well.

","Despite taking ideas from a plethora of science fiction hits, Edge of Tomorrow nevertheless oozes creativity as Tom Cruise is constantly sent back to the same point in time to win a war against an alien race on the brink of eliminating humanity. Every time he returns he learns just a little more about how to win the war, and learns a lot more about co-star Emily Blunt, who delivers one of the best performances of the year. Blunt's character is amazingly strong physically and emotionally and certainly deserved an academy nomination for best supporting actress. This film has amazing visual effects, lending itself to the very realistic futuristic war Edge of Tomorrow portrays. In addition, a beautiful score gives weight to the emotional moments in the movie and makes the action scenes much more dramatic. Though it was billed as an action thriller, Edge of Tomorrow is much more focused on the science fiction and character elements. This said, the action scenes are fantastically executed and both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt put their bodies on the line to give audience members a personal feeling as their characters kill and are killed by malicious aliens.

"skyminster","7","0","2","6 November 2015"," Watch. Sleep. Repeat?
","Edge of Tomorrow is one of those films that I didn't want to watch enough to see it in the cinema and so got it in Blu-Ray later on in the same year it came out in the cinema. It took me a while to get round to watching it; but it was worth the wait. It's a great film.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow, or Live. Die. Repeat. is a refreshingly unique film. But this comes as a bit of a shock, because the trailers and everything made it look like one of those generic, pretty good at best sci-fi action films; but it has a few things that put it above any other films similar to it. Firstly, its story. This aspect is the one that keeps you watching, nail-biting and on the edge of your seat. It's got all you want for a satisfyingly good story: action, aliens, romance and a good dosage of complicated spacey stuff — but not so complicated that you can't follow it. It follows the odd journey of Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cage, or, for short, Cage (Tom Cruise), from a public figure and advertiser for the US army to a confused soldier in the front line of battle. You are as confused as he is when he is thrown into the front line and proposed a fraud; and you are even more confused when he wakes up in the same position as he did the day he was thrown into the front line and does the exact same things as he did the day before the next day After dying a gruesome death.<br/><br/>This confusing intro, or, rather, intriguing intro, is what keeps you watching and wanting to find out what the hell is going on. The film is filled with thought provoking moments and teasers for what the hell is going on, and you are told just enough to get you through the film without your brain exploding; and that's a good thing for an action sci-fi film, because if there's no interesting story it's just a bland action film with aliens. This film isn't just a bland action film with aliens, and the story never fails to interest.<br/><br/>However, just having a good story doesn't quite make a good film; because without Tom Cruise I'm not sure this film would be as good as it is. I can't imagine Cage being acted as well by anyone other than Tom Cruise; he acts with sincerity, expression and perfectly fits his role. This film is one example of many that illustrates how good an actor Tom Cruise is, and how much of a positive effect he can have on a film. And you really grow to be attached to Cage and his companion in battle, Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) as the film goes on to its exciting climax.<br/><br/>Now, the climax has some action; which is what I will talk about now. This film has boundless amounts of action, with all the explosions, guns and violent aliens you'd want in a movie like it is. The action is quick-paced and filled with brilliant special effects; with every explosion being as enjoyable as the one before it, and every action sequence being as much of a spectacle as the one before it — and being as exciting as the one before it.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is as exciting as it is unique; with fantastic action, a clever story, a script that forces you to love the main characters and a gimmick that really does work with the whole living, dying and repeating thing. However, the best thing about the film may be Tom Cruise, as he is so good in the film that I'm not sure it would be as good as it is without him. This is definitely a film I would recommend, but I don't think it would have anywhere near the effect it has on you the first time if you watch it again — hence the 'Repeat?' bit at the start of the review.<br/><br/>But, yeah, it's a great film.<br/><br/>So I give it: 80/100."

","I didn't watch any trailer, didn't hear a lot about this movie for whatever reason (shame on me) and was looking for a movie that I can watch, since I watched a lot of movies that were on my mental ""to-watch"" list already.<br/><br/>This movie crossed my way and as mentioned before I just watched the movie without really knowing what it is about. I really wasn't disappointed with what I saw because there was a great plot with some twists here and there, great humor and that's not everything - the whole concept and idea behind this remix of two older movies is a great fit. I was purely entertained for 2 hrs and didn't catch myself staring at the clock wishing that the movie would come to an end already.<br/><br/>This isn't the best movie I ever saw but for what it is it's really entertaining and actually well thought out. The characters are interesting or funny in their own way, even though the topic behind everything is rather serious.<br/><br/>I can recommend the movie to everyone who likes the concept behind time travel and sci-fi action. Definitely worth a watch and not something you would consider a waste of time in my opinion."
"hsinghal1","9","0","3","13 October 2015"," Good movie
","The fighting gears and the aliens remind me of the ones in The matrix trio. The concept of time loop is interesting although not novel. The film is executed brilliantly. Tom cruise is just great. The basic problem with time travel movies is that they do not incorporate causality effectively i.e. the effect of the thing they do in past change the cause of the thing which actually led them to do that thing in the first place. Several movies have taken care of this problem brilliantly such as back to the future part II, time crimers, and time machine but this movie has several flaws in the time loop theory. Tom cruise should be dead by the end."
"justbob1982","7","0","1","28 September 2015"," Quality sci-fi with arguably the greatest film star ever
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)<br/><br/>Actors: 7/10<br/><br/>Plot/script: 7/10<br/><br/>Photography/visual style: 6/10<br/><br/>Music/score: 7/10<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10<br/><br/>There is a case to be made for dubbing Tom Cruise the greatest star in film history. Not necessarily the best star, and certainly not the best actor (although he can be very good on his day). For three whole decades, he has played lead in among the biggest blockbusters of the year, and yet is also willing to set aside his ego on occasion to play villains and other deeply flawed characters. Alongside the action hero parts, I could point you to Tropic Thunder, Collateral, Magnolia and Interview With the Vampire for a truly rounded filmography that stretches right up to the present day.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is one of Cruise's less outright heroic roles. Although he redeems himself by the end, he begins as a cowardly liar, and proceeds largely by an almost endless parade of failure, slowly developing into a badass.<br/><br/>Comparisons have been drawn between Edge of Tom and several other films. In particular, Groundhog Day and Saving Private Ryan are the plot precedents regularly drawn upon, with overtones of Starship Troopers. The story seems to me a direct retelling of the D-Day landings as a science fiction adventure, notably being released within days (and in some countries, on the very day) of the famous World War II offensive's 70th anniversary. It seems this has not been focused on much by reviewers or the film's own PR, but I applaud it as an attempt to make history accessible to young action film fans.<br/><br/>The plot device of a single day endlessly repeated while only one person is aware is now a well worn one, but EoT proves once again that there is more interesting material to explore. The set-up, it has to be said, doesn't entirely makes sense, but the focus is more on the implications than the causes.<br/><br/>It has to be said that the plot trajectory has more than a few clichés about it, revolving around an everyman who discovers an extraordinary ability, trains under a master and exceeds the master to save the day. However, when the master in question is played by Emily Blunt, an expert in characters with a little bit of grit and a share of concealed vulnerability, I am happy to let it go.<br/><br/>It's a shame they couldn't call the film 'All You Need Is Kill', the title of the Japanese light novel on which it is based, but I can see why the producers decided they needed something a bit less 'engrish'. This is very much a Tom Cruise film, and that is the way it was sold."

","Edge of Tomorrow is a must view film for science fiction (SF) fans who like a large dose humour against the majorly serious background of evil aliens. I haven't laughed this amount since some of the classic episodes of Stargate SG1 – sorry to plug that TV series which tried every type plot in the SF Bible. Repeating the day is so, so good and perfect for SF.<br/><br/>I did not realise that excellent actor Tom Cruise could lighten up that much on screen: ""Holy FCUK"" great quote!Also: ""What next a little PT?. Sublime Iconic. He was brilliant here and Emily Blunt was just as breezy and slick as his bad-ass kick butt mentor at the start but heck lets not say too much more for any of you that might have not seen it yet. I would add that no actor in this film is anything but brilliant. Must be good direction.<br/><br/>The music also folds into the action and yes you can hear every word the actors say – and you need to, there is a great script! This is just as good as Groundhog Day for completely different reasons as well as the one major similarity - yes just like the basic premise of that plot you can watch it over and over again.

"johnwiltshireauthor","10","0","2","21 September 2015"," Surprisingly Good
","I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, so I went into this on the recommendation of a friend and with no great expectation of enjoying it. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Not only is the action first rate, the plot is good too. Tom Cruise entirely sells the film, going from narcissistic coward to genuine hero. The guy can act and he's not afraid to make a fool of himself when it's required. I had minor gripes, mainly with the accuracy of the British army guys portrayed. If you have to have fat people in movies, to fill some kind of quota, don't make them generals, please. I have still not recovered from Forest Whitaker cast as a British squaddie in The Crying Game. Seriously? Just no."

A sci-fi film that will surely pay off the time you spend watching it. <br/><br/>Amazing effects, nothing too far fetched and overall really good acting and directing.

"lesleyharris30","8","0","2","12 September 2015"," An Original Sci-Fi that is a Real Delight,
","Edge of Tomorrow is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a talented cast. I really was not expecting this movie to be as unique and original as it was, it's a fun a clever take on Science Fiction films that is funny and never takes itself too seriously. The concept of repeating the same day made the movie stands out, it may seem a lot like Groundhog Day, but the situation works in a very different manner. <br/><br/>The only thing that I found to be a big let down in this film was the ending, it was very anti- climatic and does not wrap up the whole story in the way you would hope after investing in it for over two hours. It definitely had me questioning if that was really it, it could have been drawn to a close more substantially. The final battle, which we were obviously anticipating, was too brief and felt rushed by the director. <br/><br/>The cast is outstanding, Tom Cruise further proves that his career is in no way dead, playing a very different character here, normally a flawless, skillful stud (such as Mission Impossible), he plays a coward that is put in to a tricky situation which he struggles to overcome, which makes the experience more rewarding. I also loved Emily Blunt's performance, she plays a strong character, and I hope to see her in more action movies soon, she had a unique presence in this type of role. Action packed, funny and truly original, I would recommend Edge of Tomorrow to anyone looking for a good action or Sci- Fi film.<br/><br/>An officer must end a war against an alien race after he is given the opportunity to prove himself by the day resetting whenever he is killed. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Cruise"
"pyrocitor","8","0","2","12 September 2015"," Watch. Enjoy. Probably don't repeat.
","Edge of Tomorrow is the kind of movie that could very truthfully boast that it offers something for everyone. Die-hard fan of the Cruiser? Here he is in best swaggering/serious face-sporting, alien-blasting form. Can't stand him? Enjoy the cathartic satisfaction of watching him be blown away repeatedly, in various gruesome or hilarious ways. What's not to love? <br/><br/>Though its high concept elevator pitch would have it reduced to 'Groundhog Day as sci-fi action thriller', director Doug Liman's adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka's graphic novel All You Need Is Kill doesn't suffer the comparison. Thematically, there are similar takeaways about living in the moment and maximizing potential, but winding them into a slick action thriller motivates some genuinely thrilling and clever action sequences, squaring down with inventively ghastly hive-mind alien adversaries, to boot. After a cleverly laborious start with Cruise impressively playing against type as a cocky-cum-cowardly administrative weasel in a bureaucratic showdown with the masterfully grim Brendan Gleeson, the film kicks into gear with a nailbiting drop zone shootout/bloodbath. And repeat. While the film's repetition will invariably grate on some less patient audiences, Liman keeps the pacing taut - this is a war movie, after all - with enough slight variations and escalation to keep things interesting, as Cruise is trained by the fantastically hard-as-nails (and often surprisingly funny) Emily Blunt into becoming the ultimate war machine.<br/><br/>The best bit? The mech armour battlesuits and gloriously goofy Bill Paxton aren't the only takeaways from Aliens. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie also recycles James Cameron's fusion of high tension and macho humour, which keeps the film's tongue snugly tucked in its cheek even as the explosions, gunfire, and increasingly indignant death/resurrections (Cruise gets the best 'Oh COME ON!' moment outside of Arrested Development as he prepares for a ""reset"") erupt. Although this sense of fun wobbles somewhat in its Stakes are Never Higher climax, with any luck, audiences will feel too overstimulated to scorn being invested in the ride.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow, lynchpin of the recent Cruiseaissance, is a sturdy, fun, and inventive action flick, surprisingly likely to play well to a spectrum of audience sensibilities. It might lean a touch too heavily on genre conventions and precedents to earn the kind of Sisyphean viewing regiment its catchphrase demands, but giving it a pass entirely? Game over, man. Game over.<br/><br/>-8/10"
"mkelly1993","9","0","3","11 September 2015"," Solid Sci-Fi flick
","No spoilers here--everything is very generic, but hopefully of use in determining whether to see the movie or not.<br/><br/>This film is a very solid action/sci-fi flick--great acting, great writing, great action/choreography, great special effects, great story, great sci-fi elements, etc.<br/><br/>The premise is simple enough: Aliens invade earth, intent on dominating all life, and humans try to stop them. The catch is that these aliens can manipulate time, and by doing so outsmart humans. Game, set, match--no?<br/><br/>It's a wonderfully thought-out script--the kind where the you think you find a plot hole only to eventually realize that the writers had it answered. (Frankly, I love that--thinking I'm out-smarting the writers but finding out I'm not.) It's not to say it's rock-solid science (I'm sure the ""butterfly effect"" would come into play a little more often), but taken as a whole, it's a very satisfying romp through a time- warped story line.<br/><br/>The action is intense, the character development strong--there are even some bits of genuine (i.e., not cheesy) humor. The writing, direction, and production is deft at manipulating a repeating story line (a la Groundhog's Day) where you fully appreciate the repetitiveness without getting bored by it. And, as mentioned, the effects are great--and will likely stand the test of time.<br/><br/>So, in sum, if you want an action-packed thriller and/or a good near-future sci-fi view of a battle of humans vs. aliens, you'll want to see this one. It is certain not to disappoint."
"meritcoba","Null","0","1","8 September 2015"," Pretty damn good.
","I am no fan of Tom Cruise, especially when cast as a hero. He strikes me as a second hand car salesman; too slick to be true. I had therefore no problem to picture him as the protagonist in this movie: an officer charged with speaking to the media: lacking any combat-experience and intent on staying as far away from any combat zone as possible. When ordered to join the troops in what his superior deems to be a walk-in-the-park landing, Tom blackmails his commander to let him off the hook, which severely backfires on him, for he finds himself soon stripped of rank among the first to land with the reputation of being a deserter who pretended to be an officer to escape his duty. <br/><br/>The enemy are called mimics for reasons that are never explained in the movie. They resemble metal octopuses, who move at incredible speed, mostly underground. They are aliens and that is about all we learn about them and that is all we need to learn about them. It suffices that they are a deadly force hell-bent on wiping out humanity(some decades in the future, somebody will write a book about how these inhuman threats are a sign of the times, just like 70s and 80s had their disaster movies).<br/><br/>D-day quickly turns into a massacre as the aliens wipe out the human forces before they can gain a foothold. Tom dies too, but before he does, he manages to kill one of the rarest of mimics, and finds himself returned to life one day before the landing takes place. Baffled Tom goes through the same day and tries to intervene the course of action in a haphazard way. It doesn't matter that he does because everyone dies.. and he does to. And then finds himself alive and back in time again. <br/><br/>And so it goes. With each cycle Tom gets better because he knows what will happen, but also has a lot of time to gain experience, but dies nevertheless again and again. How does he get out of this predicament? He learns with each cycle and eventually he is aided by Emily Blunt, who has suffered from the same effects. <br/><br/>Up till this sounds like a corny predictable movie, but the script isn't as easy as you might think. The focus in this movie isn't on the humans vs aliens conflict, but on the interaction between Cruise and Blunt and their frantic efforts to turn the only advantage they have, foreknowledge, against the aliens. The key to their success is actually their ability to convince others that Tom possesses that foreknowledge so that they help in the effort. And this is the hardest part. <br/><br/>The script avoids giving us insight into the alien thinking. The mimics are kept as far away from the camera as possible and we never get a good clear view of them. This is smart for any alien eventually gets boring when shown too often. An example is the landing, in which a lot of carnage happens before the aliens themselves actually show up. <br/><br/>The movie even throws us of the track by introducing a twist in the story that makes the aliens even more sinister. Perhaps everything has been planned beforehand? <br/><br/>Yet there are flaws in the movie, such as the way Tom ends up in the combat zone. And also the ending is a bit contrived and clearly written to give us a good feel. There is nothing against a movie with a good ending, but one that forced makes for a lesser ending. Also one wonders why, having the possession of a flying craft at the start of the invasion, Tom and Blunt feel the need to have to get a car and a helicopter further land inward thus getting themselves killed time and again? <br/><br/>Personally I think that the movie is at its best when Cruise and Blunt are together and it might have been more stronger if more time was to the group of people who aid him so that their characters would have mattered if and when they died. <br/><br/>My learning points about this movie would be that some more time could have spent characterizing the people who eventually will aid Tom. Spend less time on the battles in the landing zone and the repeating scenes(which in themselves are shot in a way as to avoid boring repetition, which ought to be mentioned) and give more time to the final attack. <br/><br/>My ranking gives this a 7 out of 10. This needs an explanation: in it's genre this movie is a 9.. but since ranks are given not to genre or category they are given an overall score. In it's genre of action sci-fi it deserves something of a 9. Which means it is pretty damm good."
"reidoslad","8","0","2","7 September 2015"," Edge of Tomorrow - A Bad Ass Movie (8.2/10)
","So I have just finished watching Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. I bought this movie very cheap on blu-ray and expected not much out of it, and to be honest I was very wrong. Not many action movies in my opinion these days are able to capture a unique perspective on war as well as Edge of Tomorrow has.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Cruise as a General in a war against an alien threat that has invaded Earth. He was then sent into the firing lines as a platoon of soldiers attempt to recapture France by surprise, but in doing this are ambushed on the border. The aliens look like a large wolf creature with arms that can be used as weapons to grab soldiers and throw them far away. All of these aliens have a glowing orange mouth that is easily identifiable when they scream, however one in 6.185 million of the aliens (if i remember correctly) have a blue glow in their mouth, suggesting that they are an 'Alpha'. Cruise is able to kill one of theses alphas with a bomb but dies alongside the alien. In killing this rare creature Tom Cruise was given the ability to relive the entire day over and over again.<br/><br/>This movie dove deep into the meaning of trust and belief as Cruise begins to tell people about what power he possesses, only to be believed by Emily Blunt, a bad ass in the war that had the same scenario happen to her.<br/><br/>What I love most about Tom Cruise is even though he is in his fifties and only 5'2"". He can time and time again be a total bad ass. By the end of the film he can lunge at and forcefully attack these aliens like there is nothing to it. Also it is very amazing how at his age he is still performing every single one of his stunts. There is one part of the movie where he comes crashing down this slope of metal, in the process getting huge airtime before falling into another piece of metal before hitting the floor, all of this was stunted by himself, which is quite remarkable.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt also worked her bad ass role perfectly, not one second did I doubt that she was the most dominant soldier throughout the entire movie, which is a fantastic angle that the producers of this movie took. But as well you are able to slowly see a vulnerable side to her, even though at the end of the movie she doesn't remember a single thing about the whole experience and returns to this bad ass role.<br/><br/>The ending is pretty self explanatory, they find a source called the 'Omega' which triggers all the aliens to die if destroyed, both Blunt and Cruise die in the process of destroying this Omega but Cruise wakes up once again to the war being over and to Emily Blunt once again not knowing who he was, because after each time he died he had to convince her again about the situation.<br/><br/>Overall the movie did what it set out to do and better, it is amazing what a good movie can do to you when you enter the movie with little hope an come out of the movie with an engaging piece of cinema. The action sequences were top notch, the aliens didn't look fake (which is what turns me off most alien type movies) and the acting was where it had to be, a solid effort from the entire cast.<br/><br/>That being said I give Edge of Tomorrow an 8.2/10"

","I have been using IMDb for many years, but this is my first time writing a review. I'll go straight to the point, as I'm not very good with descriptive writing. The plot is absolutely terrific. I tend to get fidgety when watching movies, and start losing focus if I find it somewhat mundane, but this was not the case. I was engrossed from start to finish. <br/><br/>I read some other user reviews and there was a particular one that caught my eye, which I wish to paraphrase now. It has been an exceedingly long time since I have seen a movie with an unpredictable storyline. and yet the twists don't seem forced, the transitions effortless. <br/><br/>Cruise always seems to be at the top of his game, and I do believe we can't argue on the fact that probably no one would have been able to fit the role of Cage as well as he did. Also, this might sound cliché but one of the huge + points for a reason to watch this again, would be the intense and real chemistry between Rita and Cage. Emily did a great job as Rita, showcasing her versatility.Subtle facial expressions combined with raw emotion brought out the vulnerable side of Rita as she gradually opens up to cage.<br/><br/>I understand that judgement is purely subjective,and our opinions may differ,but I hope that this simple review of mine would allow someone out there to let go of his preconceived notions, and give this movie a shot( on blu ray of course)<br/><br/>As for me, I am now inspired to write more reviews on IMDb."

","The movie unfolds in the near future in which an alien race which is unbeatable by any military unit in world has hit the Earth. Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is an officer who has never fought in a war, is dropped into a suicide mission. He gets killed in minutes and he finds himself in a time loop where he has to fight in the battle, fighting, dying again and again. He meets a Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski(Emily Blunt) who had the same experience before. But with each battle, Cage, along with Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski increases his skills in war. Each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy.<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" is an experience. Based on Hiroshi Sikurazaka's novel ""All you Need is Kill"", it's a classic science fiction and highly conceptual film. The octopod looking beasts known as Mimics are controlled by a creature that seems able to see through time, or pierce through it. When the movie begins, we don't know exactly about the enemy's powers. Tom Cruise, who has never fought a war, is dropped into a suicide mission. The film begins with Cage travelling to European command headquarters in London, waking up in a chopper. The movie at various points feels like his dream but actually the rest of the movie is not.<br/><br/>When Cage meets the general in charge of the world's forces, he's told that he's being sent into this war and is to report for duty immediately. Cage protests, but none of his efforts can halt this assignment and soon after he joins his unit and learns the process of wearing combat armour, he dies on the battlefield. Then he wakes up and everything starts over again. Then he dies again and starts over again. He always knows he's been here before, that he met this person, said that thing, did that thing, made a wrong choice and died. Nobody else knows. Cage's only allies are a scientist (Noah Taylor) who believes the creatures are beating humanity through their mastery of time, and Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a Sergeant, who is an exceptionally gifted killer. Rita has experienced the same that Cage is now experiencing, but at a certain point it stopped. She recognizes his maddening condition but can no longer share in it. However, She can offer guidance, and speed up the learning by shooting him in the head whenever it seems obvious that they're going down wrong that'll lead to the same fatal outcome. The rest of the cast has less to do because this is Tom Cruise's movie. The director succeeded in convincing Emily Blunt as a fearless super-soldier, and of course a magnificent camera subject as well. The film's only flaw is its attempt to impose a love story between Cruse and Blunt's relationship. Finally Edge of Tomorrow is a good movie and of ""must watch"" type either in 2D or in 3D. It's a kind of experience rather than just watching a movie. At the end you just feel like you have just played a video game."

I really had no idea what was going on at first (we all didn't) then it just kept throwing more and more twists in, it kept you on my toes the whole time. <br/><br/>I wanted to write this review to mainly express my sheer fright at how utterly terrifying these aliens are. They don't resemble a human what so ever, they don't even represent an animal. The way the movie doesn't really focus on the details of the aliens adds to this fright. I couldn't think of a more terrifying enemy. They are hard to hit, move master than you can react, have out of this world strength, can go underwater, can rip the metal doors off your vehicle, can travel through the dirt like the worms in Tremors, and has about 6-8 arms. This was a tremendous enemy, no human could beat it one on one without metal suits, very powerful firearms, and reflexes like a fly. Actually, the only people who could beat them most of the time could see the future so yeah, I don't think humans would stand a chance."

","Edge of Tomorrow. A film that a lot Of people, including myself, passed off initially as another Tom cruise money getter, this film has a lot of heart and is really cleaver. It really is the action movie version of Groundhog Day. And although a lot of the major plot points, whether it be him being confused at first, or later him knowing too much which gets him into trouble, do mirror Groundhog Day, edge of tomorrow brings a freshness and own individual look. It's a great action movie, which surprisingly does not feel repetitive even though he's lived the day many times, and overall, Tom cruise is the star that we all deep down love. 8.8 for edge of tomorrow.

","A fun adventure movie designed around time repeating itself until Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt finally save the world. Another one of those enjoyable action packed flicks where Cruise shines best. I know he has done everything under the sun, but he is the ideal action hero. I understand that is a mighty strong label, especially with all that competition out there. I also know I am probably wrong (and so are those who disagree with me.) Let's see, in the past I knew he was good, but never had an interest in seeing what he was doing next or searching out his latest release. In other words, he was just another talented actor who churned out the good with the bad. Lately, I have noticed, he is turning out some quality stuff. OK – OK 'Oblivion' was forgettable and 'Eyes Wide Shut' was not one of my favoritesI got ithe can do stinkers, but they are rare. Unlike other mega-action hero stars, I think he has learned his lesson; meaning he will likely avoid the quick buck and wait for the cash-cow. This movie is all that should be expected from a science fiction action flickaction – with little to no reflection. Don't preach – just entertain – and I certainly do appreciate any movie that avoid the writers' pulpit. Thanks"

","I have become a little disenchanted with movies of the 2010s, especially these summer popcorn movies featuring aliens and tons of CG. I knew I had to see this because it starred one of my all time favorites, Tom Cruise. I think he gets unfairly judged as a movie actor because he is a star (plus he is kind of weird).<br/><br/>Anyway, I hoped that this flick was in the style of the excellent remake of War of the Worlds, coincidentally also starring Cruise. When I saw that they ripped off Groundhog Day, I was really let down. Luckily, I perked right up again very quickly. Yes, they do use the basic premise of that classic but this is much more than trying to find a gimmick for what is essentially something we seen a thousand times before: Man vs. Alien.<br/><br/>Let me get to my favorite part which is the performance of Bill Paxton. It's the first time that he and Cruise have worked together, as far as I know and I can't believe they have such good chemistry. Every scene they are together is pure comic gold. I wish that they had a little more screen time as a pair because after Paxton is gone, the movie takes a more tedious turn. Not that it gets boring but I don't think that the scenes between Emily Blunt and Cruise are that interesting. I was thoroughly disappointed when she shows up on screen. When she appears and is killed, I knew that it wasn't the end for her. Wouldn't that have been a cool twist, though. No, no. We can't have that.<br/><br/>Fortunately, we are spared the traditional love story but the movie gets bogged down in the scenes with her, Cruise and that annoying scientist. I don't know how he figured out how the alien could be defeated and the plot doesn't allow a thorough explanation.<br/><br/>Now for the worst part. The ending. Cruise loses his powers and has to convince his comrades to go fight this thing. The movie cheats by having them convinced in a matter of minutes but that's not the biggest problem. There are continuity problems as well. Again, I can forgive that. But when those black eyes appear again, I thought to myself: ""They screwed up"". I you haven't seen the movie, judge for yourself.<br/><br/>Anyway, my rant is over."

","I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise. I don't like his ""I'm the hero who saves the world"" attitude. He's a famous movie star and he knows it and seems to bring that knowledge to every part he plays. So, it was with some reluctance that I settled in for Edge of Tomorrow. And was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>It was a delight to see Cruise as a scared, even cowardice major in the US army who is in public relations because he can't stand the sight of blood, ""not so much as a paper cut"" as he himself says. He is then forced into combat as a private and the scenes that follow are priceless and show how fine an actor Cruise really is. He was funny too, I laughed out loud at many a scene during that first day of combat. Of course, as the day repeats itself, Cruise learns more and more and in the end he does save the world. But by then he had made me fall in love with him so much that it didn't matter. Plus we where with him every step of the way, and that makes all the difference.<br/><br/>There are some great supporting roles as well. Emily Blunt is wonderful. So is Bill Paxton. The other, minor roles, are all great as well.<br/><br/>9 stars"

","My favorite actor Tom Cruise(Cocktail 1988) is in his element here. A superb and believable performance by him, proves that in other film where he has not performed well, the script and director were to be blamed.<br/><br/>The film based on a screenplay adapted from the 2004 Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. The plot device of the film is a time-loop, where an event happens over and over again.<br/><br/>Plot: In the near future, a race of space aliens called Mimics has taken over continental Europe. In England, General Brigham, head of humanity's United Defense Force, orders Major William Cage, a public affairs officer and former advertising executive, to cover combat on the beaches of France during the next day's assault on the Mimics. Cage objects to the dangerous assignment and threatens to use his public relations skills to turn the public against Brigham when the casualties start increasing from the invasion. General Brigham has Cage arrested; Cage is knocked out during an ensuing escape attempt. He wakes in handcuffs at a forward operating base at Heathrow Airport and discovers he has been labeled a deserter and put on combat duty for the invasion under the command of Master Sergeant Farell.<br/><br/>The invasion is a disaster for the humans. Cage manages to kill a large Mimic but dies as he is sprayed with its acid-like blood. He then wakes up at Heathrow the previous morning. No one believes his story that he knows the invasion will fail. He repeats the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow over and over many times until he encounters Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) during the invasion on the beach. She recognizes his ability to anticipate events and tells him to locate her the next time he ""wakes up"".<br/><br/>Watch the film to find out what happens next...<br/><br/>Verdict: one for your DVD/BLURAY collection.

"robsta23","9","0","2","17 May 2015"," I Unexpectedly Loved this Movie
","What a way to end a semester of good science fiction by watching Edge of Tomorrow. I remember seeing the trailer for this film during a Godzilla IMAX 3D screening, thinking it looked too much like a video game and that it looked so cliché. I didn't grasp the fact that it was like Groundhog Day meets Terminator, and the result was a great deal of fun.<br/><br/>First of all, this film has a good casting of leads/important characters, such as Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt (who I had not seen much of before this film) and Brendan Gleeson (who I LOVE in In Bruges). Some people hate Tom Cruise, and to that I say give the guy a chance with great roles under his belt such as the lead in Rain Man and a role in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia which rightfully earned him an Oscar nomination. Emily Blunt is amazing as the ""full metal b****"" who does not give a damn, knocking out a soldier who nearly calls her by this name. And as for Gleeson, I guess he doesn't really do much, but I like him.<br/><br/>Going back to Tom Cruise, he plays an iconic spokesperson who has a high military rank, though he is more involved with advertising and wants little to do with actual battle. He is a coward who is sent on a journey to prove himself to be a very brave soldier.<br/><br/>The Groundhog Day aspect to this film provides a lot of laughs, focusing on funny ways that he dies early in the film and the way Emily Blunt's character kills him over and over again.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is kind of a stretch to believe, but then again this is science fiction; you either buy it or you don't. Cage is lucky enough to kill an ""Alpha"" with a claymore before dying, and the alpha's blood is splattered onto him and gives him the ""ability"" to reset the day as he dies. These aliens are unlike any we have seen before in alien invasion movies, looking like giant sea creatures with a type of ""hair"" that looks like the features of an anemone. Alphas are very rare amongst them, which are the ones that can reset the day, and their motivations are unknown, but they are a force that the world is fighting against. This is a very ""us vs them"" film promoting global unity to fight a threat.<br/><br/>You'll be pleasantly surprised with this gem; watch this film."

","I'm just putting it out there: I like a post-Rain Man Tom Cruise movie. As in, actually like it. Yes, there's some bits that don't quite add up. But it's a cool concept (don't worry I'm not going to spoil it for you guys). Cruise plays a character (at least for a while) that he doesn't normally and it's incredibly refreshing. I hope this is a sign of things to come and not just a positive blip on the TCTL (Tom Cruise Time Line) of predictable, but expensive, movies. And Emily Blunt! A revelation as a tough, strong, female character (although spoilt at the end very slightly).

"eric262003","7","0","1","11 May 2015"," Where Deja Vu Never Looked So Splendid
","It would be quite insincere to label ""Edge of Tomorrow"" one of the very best video-game adaptations ever produced, because it actually evolved from a Japanese graphic novel ""All You Need is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, but you will be mesmerized by the movie's artistic integrity, the encapsulating structure and the subliminal function and affect, but the source material is what makes this film very special. <br/><br/>The story stars Tom Cruise as Major William Cage, a military officer from the future where our entire planet has waged war against an alien invasion in which they're known as Mimics who have dominated pretty much most of Europe. Not much of a fighter, Maj. Cage is an awkward PR guy whose patriotic contributions come in the forum of less interesting things like promoting how great the military life really is and recruiting new soldiers as replacements to those who have been killed in combat. When he rebuffs at the General Brigham's (Brendan Gleeson) command to take charge in the front-lines, he gets badly demoted to private with a meagre chance of surviving the amphibious take-over in Northern France.<br/><br/>A strange thing happened on Omaha Beach. The Mimics go on a horrifying and expensive ambush as they attack human forces, whose weaker arsenal of weapons consisting of a mechanized bodysuit is just not enough to take down the much more powerful Mimics. Cage manages takes down a lower-tier alien specie called an Alpha, but gets their blood on him, which whenever he dies, he relives the events which leads to the failed initiative. It's like watching ""Groundhog Day"" meets ""Saving Private Ryan"" in which Cage must repeat all his steps over and over again until he he can successfully turn the tables around in fighting this almost unbeatable war. <br/><br/>Sure it may have the rightful tools needed for another monotonous, mindless, money-swindling action flick. But I was surprised that ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is nothing like that at all. The fighting scenes are complimented nicely with some much needed humour with the mystery genre reserved in its place. The film virtually takes off as Cage seeks assistance from a tough, veteran Captain Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) with whom had the same time-repeating capabilities that Cage has in his possession. Rita toughens up Cage from a wimpy recruit to hardened fighter who might even bring this alien invasion to a close with no assistance. She'll even go as far as to deliver tough love on him in the worst ways possible whenever he's succumbing to grievous bodily harm during the process. With every day passes, Cage is getting stronger, smarter and more powerful enough to send these Mimics packing or being destroyed. <br/><br/>Of course for a good story to work, it should go beyond a solid checklist. Not to say that the script by Christopher McQuarrie and the Butterworth brothers compliments to the endless exciting action, but ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is still very formulaic and not only does it feel like ""Groundhog Day"" or another film with similar formula like ""Source Code"" with a very familiar ending to it. However, director Doug Liman manages to use his visual mastery effectively without trying to hold back the tension this movie provides and uses proper manipulative quirks whenever the scenes starts to repeat itself. For a PG-13 movie there's a plethora of off-screen violence. The video game version of this movie sees our hero sporting great engine. In the movie, it provides a stimulating take on a time-jumping military man and never changes the story around. And the lesson that by repeating yourself, you will get better through every baby step you take."

","Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers...with a hint of Philip K Dick thrown in.<br/><br/>A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

There are a few minor gaps and implausibilities, but it mostly works. Plus the writers and director know when to quit with the clever stuff, and don't just start throwing clever twists and additional layers of complexity in just for the sake of showing off.<br/><br/>Good special effects.<br/><br/>Solid performances by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.

","Why does Hollywood have such a fascination with 'time reversal' movies? This film is yet another one in the genre, where the lead character lives the same day over and over again. It may be possible if we consider the 'many world's' theory, but again, the film at no time suggests this. It incorporates elements of other films you may have seen, like 'groundhog day' or 'predestination' etc, but for a loop to be created that makes a mockery of time continuum, then the 'other world's' theory must be included as part of the dialog. Its the only way someone watching can make sense of it. <br/><br/>This is a visually spectacular movie, where the use of CGI is never underused. Cruise portrays a believable character, where, on his journey of self discovery and stoic bravery, he leads the viewer into a world of alien invasion and terror. Blunt too is excellent, playing the hardened, war weary veteran, with charisma and balls. There are comedy moments and lighthearted homages to other films like it, but overall this is a tense action thriller that leaves a lasting memory.<br/><br/>There are too many paradoxes created in this film for it to work in the quantum physics world, but its enjoyable.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","Okay, let's get the 'Groundhog Day' comparisons out the way straight away. Ever since Groundhog Day was released, any other film that has based its premise around a single day repeating itself has been compared to it (i.e. Repeaters, Source Code, that episode from the X-files and so on).<br/><br/>This time we have aliens invading the Earth in the near future, but, just like that load of extraterrestrial nasties in Oblivion and War of the Worlds, they didn't figure on us humble earthlings having Tom Cruise on our side. And he's on cracking alien-slaughtering form. He may start out like a bit of a wimp – merely a disgraced army media spokesperson, forced to fight the xenomorphs on the frontlines. However, a freak accident means he acquires the power to restart the day every time he dies, meaning he gets one hell of a 'heads-up' on our invading monsters.<br/><br/>Naturally, Tom doesn't have to go it alone and soon recruits the highest-decorated soldier to help him out. And, just as naturally, the highest-decorated soldier just so happens to be a super-fit baddass chick, played by Emily Blunt. So, the two of them have to replay the day until they finally come up with a way of saving the Earth (and most likely getting together for good measure).<br/><br/>And it's a pretty good ride. I guess the main audience for it will be sci-fi films (dare I say men?). It's actually more intelligent that it sounds and there are a number of different aspects to the story that make it more than just an 'action version of Groundhog Day.' Also, it does play out a bit like a sci-fi version of a war film (think Saving Private Ryan, but with monsters), so you may have to appreciate war films, too.<br/><br/>Tom and Emily undoubtedly carry the film. It's their chemistry that makes it. It's good to see Tom gradually get to know her day by day, only for her to completely forget who he is when the day resets.<br/><br/>If I had to pick one flaw in the film it's the aliens themselves. You never really get much of a look at them. Yes, they're pretty horrid – fast moving squid-like things, but, because they're computer-generated and so damn speedy, they move in a blur and you never really get much of a look at them as they tend to kill the cast before we can take stock of their real form.<br/><br/>However, that's a minor point. Basically, if you either like Tom Cruise, sci-fi in general, or just a big-budget summer blockbuster that actually makes you think, then give it a go."

Edge of Tomorrow puts you at the edge of your seat, because you get immersed into the storyline and how mankind can be saved from alien apocalypse.

","After a long time i have seen a proper science fiction movie which intrigued me. The ending of the film was somewhat abrupt but movie as a whole is worth watching. Now a days the films released as science fiction are chick flick or teenage oriented movie (eg: Giver, Enders game) which is stereotypical, doesn't have any rationale of true sci-fi and lacks skilled cast. End of tomorrow is a movie with strong story and a skilled actors which will lock you into the chair from starting to the end. The film tells about the story of a solider who live,die and repeat (kind of a looped life) and his attempts to get back to his real time line. The veteran actor Tom Cruise has done a commendable job in this film so as other actors. The director also has done a fabulous job of making a complex plot into a realistic story which can be grasped by common folk."

","When I first watched this movie, I wasn't really looking forward to it. But I was so wrong. This movie has an interesting concept, its just mind-blowing. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt really deliver their lines and actions with emotions that its really realistic. Not to mention the aliens in this movie are very nicely animated, also their body structures are really unique! Everything in this movie is pretty original. One thing I loved most about this movie was the props and the scenery. You could see the effort put into all the weapons, the suits and the scenery. The people who designed this props honestly made it look real. Not to mention the people who did the scenery really made it look like the earth was in a war."
"Bruce722","10","0","3","28 November 2014"," One of the most original sci-fi films I've ever seen.
","All You Need Is Kill, Edge of Tomorrow, Live Die Repeat, I really don't care what you call it, bottom line, this movie was absolutely incredible. It's probably one of the most original plots I've ever read, seen, or experienced in any medium and Hiroshi Sakurazaka is genius for coming up with such an incredible story. Even with a great story, movies have been known in the past to not succeed in delivering on the fantastic plot. Luckily, Doug Liman executed the story arc to perfection and Tom Cruise and the stunning Emily Blunt were flawless. These two essentially carry the entire film and display great chemistry in the process. The action sequences are done well and the cinematography is excellent. Honestly, there's not a single flaw in the film, no matter how hard I try to find one. Yes, it is science fiction, not only from an alien perspective but also because the entire film is based on the concept of a time looping paradox, so there is an element of suspended disbelief that is required in order to enjoy the film. That being said, I think this movie did as good a job as any I can recall at staying true to the concept. Overall, this might have been the best film of 2014. Unfortunately the marketing team failed miserably at giving it the exposure it deserved. Additionally, the ending may have confused some who are not well versed in science fiction. Here is a great breakdown of the ending and what I think makes the most sense (the first explanation): http://screenrant.com/edge-of-tomorrow-ending-spoilers-time-travel/2/"

","This was such an enjoyable movie to watch, only the very ending bothered me. But I still immediately wanted to watch it again!<br/><br/>I watched this film without knowing anything but aliens attacking the world.When Bill cage wakes up reliving the same day immediately thought OH NO! Not another ground hog day!! But its utilises the best of Ground Hog Day. I was aware he was repeating the day over and over without having to watch the whole thing repeatedly constantly over and over.<br/><br/>You soon forget you are watching a man who is repeating his day, but then Cage will say and/or do something and you realise, Cage has done this many times. At this point we are like Rita, This is our first time, but is cages 20th or 100th.<br/><br/>It starts off with this amazing blend of comedic elements you are laughing so profoundly, but still manages to keep the seriousness of it all.<br/><br/>Fabulous film!"
"sscrofani-46-523365","8","0","3","25 November 2014"," Reminiscent of Groundhog Day
","This movie was one of the best sci-fi-action movies I've seen all year. Story is based on a Japanese novel, ""All You Need is Kill"", Hiroshi Sakurazaka's debut novel. Reminiscent of ""Groundhog Day"" because Cage (Tom Cruise) perpetually relives the same battle vs. the aliens, the Mimics, throughout the film. As redundant and potentially boring as this may seem, the film is very well done and exciting. <br/><br/>Cage soon learns that the reason he keeps reliving the same battle vs. the Mimics is because he killed a type of mimic, an ""alpha"", that has the ability to manipulate time when it is killed, and was saturated in its blood when this occurred. This gave Cage the same power as the alpha, the ability to reset the day, re-live the battle, so that they have a better chance of living the next time around.<br/><br/>The only problem with this, that was not addressed in the film - Why does Cage only have the power to reset the day after he kills the alpha and is saturated in its blood. Aren't there other alphas still out there that still have this ability? Maybe the book explains this better.<br/><br/>Regardless, this movie was great and I recommend watching it."
"thomas-w15","8","0","3","22 November 2014"," Most surprising film this year!! Tom Cruise has still got it!!
","Edge of Tomorrow(Also known as Live, Die, Repeat) 8.5/10- When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked really stupid. It looked like a video game nearly. Then, the new trailer came out and showed the main concept of the film. I changed my mind about the movie and decided to give it a chance. I am very glad I did. Edge of Tomorrow is a well-made mix of Groundhog Day and a sort of Saving Private Ryan the way they storm the beach of Normandy(except in this film its futuristic invasion on an alien species.) Not to mention it has Tom Cruise leading the charge who has nearly mastered fighting extra- terrestrials on camera. <br/><br/>I will get the bad stuff out of the way first. It was up to me, I would have gone with other fighting suits because most everyone agrees they look at least a tiny bit stupid and a little too much. The fighting suit situation is just something you have get passed in the film. Also, although I love the ""live, die, repeat"" part of the movie, the repeat part gets to be somewhat exhausting at times. Still, the benefits of the repeat part of the film far outweigh the downsides of it.<br/><br/>The special effects is something I and probably everyone expect at this point from a Alien- Tom Cruise picture. They are what they need to be, nothing more. The explosions and gunfire are all awesome but we have all seen them before. The only thing extraordinary that the special effects department did was the design of the alpha alien. The look and execution of the alpha alien is something that I have, at the very least, not seen very often and would like to highlight their efforts on this. The plot was the best part of the film because it provided so much to it. The plot paved the way for the good comedy that the movie needed, intricate storyline, and biggest thing was giving the audience something that we have not seen in a really long time. It may seem like a rip-off of Groundhog Day, but in my opinion as long the idea and storyline are executed well, Edge of Tomorrow has just as much right to the idea as Groundhog Day did.<br/><br/>The acting side of this film is just like the special effects department, what you would expect from the film. The actors make you believe that they are who they are playing and all of that stuff. The thing I was wondering though is how Tom Cruise was really going to sell his role since this particular character he is playing is much different than any of the others he has played in the past. I was pleasantly surprised by how well Tom Cruise was able pull it off. He was able to express all of the emotions that would take place if something like this actually happened to a person. All of the anger, confusion, pain, excitement, everything all throughout the film. I thought this was easily his best acting in fifteen years maybe ever. Emily Blunt has ,without fail, surprised me by the diversity of her roles and how well she is able to play each of them. There are a couple of scenes in this film where she really shows a lot of the talent and potential she has to offer to the film industry and I hope she is recognized for this. <br/><br/>I do not usually say this, but I advise you to listen to the critics for Edge of Tomorrow and it will not disappoint. I recommend that you make sure to see this while it is in theaters. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"rapefreemovies","8","0","3","20 November 2014"," Rape-free
","Edge of tomorrow was rated rape-free by rapefreemovies. It does not include any mention, attempt or fact of sexual violence. <br/><br/>Review: The plot is thrilling, and the suspense remains even as the hero goes back in time to live the same moment over and over again. The characters are rich and passionate, and Tom Cruise is just perfect in this role. The fact that he is the only one to go back in time creates a particular relationship with the viewers, who are the only witnesses that the scene has happened before: some ""private jokes"" are especially interesting. <br/><br/>At some point, the aliens look too strong for the humans to really be a threat to them, but the story later gives a satisfactory explanation."
"TxMike","Null","0","2","19 November 2014"," Live. Die. Repeat.
","This movie borrows a key element from the great ""Groundhog Day"", namely the main protagonist must die and repeat his day until he gets it right. That is why its tag-line is ""Live. Die. Repeat."" <br/><br/>Tom Cruise usually plays a gallant, suave character who always has a way to do the right thing. This role is a departure, at least for most of the first half of the movie. He is a military officer who has not been trained for combat, in fact he is afraid of combat, when he is told he will be fit with equipment for the planned raid he freaks out and tries to talk his way out of it. To no avail.<br/><br/>The story is about a type of alien that has invaded the Earth. These are fierce fighters, plus when they begin the raid it is clear the aliens were expecting it and all the Earthling fighters are doomed to die.<br/><br/>Cruise is Cage, and he in fact does die when he picks up an explosive device that kills one of the aliens, but also Cage himself, but in the process he is splattered with fluid from the alien. This has a particular effect of making him re-live that last day.<br/><br/>So, each time he awakes in the same place, on tarmac, handcuffed as a deserter, and told he will be in the raid. This is repeated each time he dies, and at some point he realizes he must convince others what is happening so that they can take different actions and defeat the aliens.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is Rita, a well-known hero from a former battle, she and Cage are in the raid, she too gets killed. But each time Cage is transported back before all that happened and she and the others are alive as they should be.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have said, this is not a movie to be analyzed too closely, just check your brain and sit back to enjoy the action and the story. It is very entertaining. Plus it has an excellent sound track. The opening 30 seconds of the movie (on DVD) has some of the deepest bass I have experienced, rattling glasses in the mini-bar and the pictures on the wall. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Cage and Rita have to figure out that there is one controlling alien and if they can get to it and destroy it, all the aliens will fall dead and thus be defeated. That is the most interesting part of the last 30 minutes of the story, to see how they figure this out and where it is, finally succeeding."
"tariq-hossenbux","9","0","2","14 November 2014"," A Thrilling Science Fiction Adventure That Gives Hope For Us All
","Edge of Tomorrow delivers an exceptional combination of thrilling sci-fi special effects, great storytelling, and a message of hope for us all. It is best viewed on the largest screen available to appreciate the scope of the battles and the marvelous technological creations like the drop ships that assemble in D-DAY like armadas. Certainly one of Cruise's best performances is enhanced by the natural chemistry between himself and Emily Blunt. Cruise is a reluctant soldier who learns to accept his role, and Blunt is his always steadfast companion on a mission that keeps repeating itself. Testament to the way the dramatic special effects and compelling romantic subplot keeps our attention is that despite the seeming repetitiveness of seeing these scenes over and over, we are still transfixed by their struggle to complete a mission of critical important to humanity. Well interspersed are occasional moments of humor to defuse the tension. The film has a relevance to our sometimes chaotic and tumultuous world as well that viewers should pay good attention to. At the end of the day this film delivers a message of true hope and that adversity must be challenged even in the face of previous failures."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","2","12 November 2014"," Pleasant surprise
","I wasn't terribly interested in this film when I first saw the trailers. Tom Cruise hadn't managed to convince me as an action star in years and even Emily Blunt couldn't raise my interest. But, eventually I ended up seeing it on DVD and I must admit that I should have gone and seen this in the movies.<br/><br/>We've seen plenty of these ""groundhog day"" type movies where time repeats itself and only a single man is aware of it. The trick in these movies is to show the same thing again and again while still keeping it interesting by changing how the protagonist goes around trying to alter the flow of circumstances. And this movie pulls it off beautifully. It keeps it pace and editing so quick and smooth that you always feel like things are moving forward, while they're quite literally not.<br/><br/>Cruise and Blunt were also another pleasant surprise, Cruise especially. Perhaps it's because this time Cruise doesn't try to play a born badass, which he no longer can pull off as convincingly as he did in his glory days. Rather he plays a media officer, who gets thrust into the middle of combat by a bad decision. Furthermore, he and Blunt have good chemistry together and it's nice to see a grizzled female war veteran instead of the usual fare.<br/><br/>Saying anything more would spoil the movie needlessly. Trust me when I say that its thoroughly entertaining experience and well worth watching for all fans of science fiction and action movies."

","The deja vu part wasn't as tiresome as I would've thought, and the juxtaposition of him dying and waking up again over and over was pretty funny. The film was well edited and the placement of the scenes complimented the story well. With some scenes having the audience in the loop and some without.<br/><br/>The action and visual effects were good too. Though I would've have liked a bit more background on how the aliens came to be and why they were on Earth in general. The armour was a cool addition, however I saw them equipping handguns and pistols.which with the image of the armour looked pretty comedic.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt acted really well in this film. Usually I feel like Cruise takes on very similar characters (and this one wasn't that different) but he did a good job here. Blunt played her character really well too, and was very fluid and consistent.<br/><br/>However some parts with the aliens felt too unrealistic. It doesn't seem possible to outrun from the aliens as they move so quickly, and also I don't get the business of them suddenly appearing out of nowhere when there's a loud noise. If they were already close by wouldn't they have known without the help of loud noise? Also, the knowledge of the power was a bit iffy.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was pretty interesting and had some cool actions and visuals to engage the audience.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","This is a cool movie. And a very original one. The mimic aliens are fascinatingly fearsome foes and a refreshing alien breed while the armored warsuits the solders use to battle the mimics with are unique as well and also awesomely armed with futuristic machine guns as the suits transform a regular old soldier into a super fighting soldier. Tom Cruise with Emily Blunt makes this movie so damn good. Tom Cruise is fantastic and still looks great as far as I can see. Cruise is action-packed in this movie. Tom never disappoints. Meanwhile Emily Blunt plays the elite and most badass super soldier and is pretty convincing at it. I love the chopper blade Rita uses against the mimics. I love Emily Blunt. This movie has a creative and entertaining concept with Tom Cruise obtaining the power to reset the day whenever he dies. Groundhog Day meets Saving Private Ryan. Has anyone else said that before? This movie is really funny too. Bill Paxton is certainly hilarious in every scene he is in. Bill is great. And Breendon Gleeson is just the smartest and most inviting actor on screen. He is great. I love this movie. Tom Cruise is alright. He's got a great smile I guess. Emily does, too. Emily Blunt has a great, great body. This movie has a very satisfying ending.

","The truth is, whether or not you like Tom Cruise as an actor, you WILL like this movie!<br/><br/>Yeah, even I referenced that great movie, even though everyone else has already, but it still is worth it! Because I remember the first time watching that Bill Murray and being absolutely BLOWN AWAY! This, this is the ""futuristic action sci-fi alien invasion"" version of Groundhog Day, if you will! Tom Cruise once again proves he's still got some talent! This flick was also directed by a Jewish guy, much like Harold Ramis - all the more reason to like it again!<br/><br/>This movie gave me one of the most exciting theater experiences I ever had! ;D Also I was interested to learn it was based off a Japanese comic originally titled ""All You Need Is Kill"", since I actually LIVE in Japan! But don't worry, the Japanese advertisement titled this film appropriately as it's original title, in Japanese Katakana - ""オール・ユー・ニード・イズ・キル."" whatever.<br/><br/>I also thought interesting the plot actually EXPLAINED why Tom Cruise (his character's name Cage), is repeating the same day over & over, whilst Groundhog Day never did explain, though it was still interesting; albeit the alien blood, the OMEGA artifact, etc. Which actually kinda reminded me of the ""Omega 13"" from the sci-fi comedy ""Galaxy Quest."" But I digress, 'cause THAT's even a good reference!<br/><br/>I believe actress Emily Blunt deserves to be known for basically THIS movie, on her IMDb profile! Not that overrated pile of trash ""Looper."" I thank GOD she was written as a cool character She became a great sidekick & genuine love interest to Cage; and I'm glad she didn't become a typical damsel in distress being over-sexualized with giant distracting jiggling boobs. lol<br/><br/>I give credit to AMC theaters giving the recommendation to go seeing this movie - they're quite a legit movie talk show! Because all in all, this movie had HORRIBLE marketing campaigns; there're can be bad trailers to good movies, and good trailers to bad movies! Something to think about.<br/><br/>If there is any slight down-side to this movie, I might say besides the casual intense violence or language in the film, I felt perhaps Bill Paxton was out of place as the war general. I think probably Bill MURRAY should've been cast instead; it would've been a GREAT homage to ""Groundhog Day"", the film he's mostly known for, rather than just naming the lead female character ""Rita"", like the one in Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>But seriously, ANYONE who's a huge fan of sic-fi, action, alien invasions, repeating time, etc., THIS is the movie for you - you WON'T be disappointed!<br/><br/>9/10"

","Major William Cage works as a press officer; he has never seen combat and has no expectation of seeing any then he finds himself on the front line in a war against alien invaders known as 'Mimics'. It turns into a massacre and he is one of the many casualties. He doesn't stay dead though! Instead it is as if time resets to the moment where he first met the combat unit the day before the attack. He has no idea why this happened and finds himself doomed to repeat the day over and over again. He always dies but each time things go slightly differently as he learns from his experiences. Eventually he meets somebody else who was like him Sergeant Rita Vrataski; she explains that he became able to reset time after getting the blood of a specific type of Mimic, called an Alpha, on him she also warns that he must never get a blood transfusion or he will lose the ability as she did. She also advises against telling anybody as he is likely to end up being certified insane or worse. Together they train and plan a mission that will, if all goes well, lead to the defeat of the Mimics once and for all.<br/><br/>I started watching this film knowing nothing about it; I even thought 'Live, Die, Repeat' was the title not the tag line! Early on I thought it was going to be yet another loud film with nonstop action but little in the way of character; thankfully that proved wrong. As the events start repeating there is an enjoyable wit about how it is handled. Tom Cruise does a fine job as Major Cage; a character who starts of as a coward hardly a typical Cruise roll. He is able supported by Emily Blunt as the tough Sgt Vrataski. The plot can be summarised as 'Starship Troopers' meets 'Groundhog Day' but it was done in an original way that kept me interested from start to finish. The action sequences are well handled and exciting to watch. Overall if you are a fan of Tom Cruise or enjoy science fiction then this is well worth watching."

It's not based on a popular comic book hero, it's not part of a franchise, it's not a young adult book, and its source material is highly original and pretty complex, so it's not your usual summer fare.<br/><br/>But blimey, its so refreshing to see something so original, so funny, and so involving have such a prolific release and treated with the respect it needs, and also respecting the audience.<br/><br/>Cruise hasn't been this good in years, here he's not playing the typical hero he has done forever, in fact, until the middle of the second act, he's a bit of a wimp who tries to talk his way out of everything.<br/><br/>But then we go back to the point where he wakes up, and for a good 30 minutes, it's hilarious, laugh out loud funny at times, and Cages frustration very time he knows he's going to buy it, is just priceless.<br/><br/>The second act is the strongest part of the film, and even though it does feel like its riffing on Groundhog Day, and Source Code,mother way its handles is very different and intricate to the narrative.<br/><br/>Blunt is okay, but her hard woman does grate toward the end of the film, and Cruises grin in the last shot is priceless, as if he's thinking 'just one more time'.<br/><br/>Its a brilliant movie, worth watching more than once, my only gripe is that Cage didn't smack the soldier who kept waking him up."

","Take Aliens, Groundhog day, Saving Private Ryan, Starship Troopers, Independence Day and Source Code. Add them in a jar, put a healthy seasoning of CGI and give it a nice good shake; there, you will have Edge of Tomorrow frothing out all over. <br/><br/>Now, if you are thinking this is an indictment of EoT, its actually not, because, well... a well made shake actually taste good. And ditto for this movie. Yes, it has no originality; yes the acting is average; yes, there is little character development; yes, there is no back-story, and yes, at times it is somewhat illogical, but then this is a movie that begs not to be taken seriously. What it has, and has in plenty is a well paced story and very well orchestrated action sequence that actually help to move forward the story.<br/><br/>One admirable thing about this movie's action is that it stays focused around the main plot. Although the story is about global destruction, but the directors have stayed away from showing now extremely cliché scenes of mass scale devastation and crazy fireballs. The action here is solid, very intense and thrilling. And although once again, in true Hollywood style, only a handful of protagonists finally defeat an alien super being that couldn't be touched by entire armies, the movie does end satisfactorily. <br/><br/>All in all, this a good piece of entertainment to finish a couple of burgers and fries along with :)"
"troy-manatunga","8","0","2","19 October 2014"," Tom Cruise is a different light.
","EDGE OF TOMORROW is complete mindfuckery. The kind of mindfuckery that is expected in a Doug Liman movie and the style of fuckery that an audience would accept with arms wide open. Yes – let's admit this, we love a twisted plot or even so any pattern of twist in a movie. Doug Liman is known for his confounding approaches and he in fact has done so and survived without having his name tarnished. EDGE OF TOMORROW is neither as complex nor impenetrable in terms of understanding like INCEPTION. It's a plot that is fathomable. It is a 24 hour loop where action super star Tom Cruise dies over and over and over again. I did lose count but it was a good 100 times minimum. So for those fans that dislike Cruise this probably is a win-win situation. A great movie and Cruise keeps dying.<br/><br/>Alien movies, movies about aliens we have seen so many and now as an audience to us this on its own is a legit sub-genre within the sci- fi genre. My first impression: what sort of intergalactic foe is this? Named the Mimic I preferred the name tentacles. It does look like a dog cross bred with an octopus aka dogtopus. An alien can be whatever Liman thinks of it as and I have no beef with this. Since of late alien movies have been quite disappointing and have been known to reach ridiculous standards. Viewers avoid them. This is all about change and EDGE OF TOMORROW is redemption, it is a revival, it is a must watch.<br/><br/>Lt. Cage (Tom Cruise) pisses off the wrong people and is thrown in the mix of war where the Mimics (Aliens) are taking over all of Europe. Cage is not an action hero. He is the absolute opposite of what we have known Tom Cruise on screen for over decades. Cage is a coward. A weakling in uniform is what he is. This is the first biggest sell in EDGE OF TOMORROW. See Tom Cruise play a role of his life time like you have never seen him before. Cages first mission is a beach invasion. Feels like the opening shot of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Explosive, Chaotic, Sand in the Camera but less bloody but certain death. Few minutes on the beach and Cage dies taking his own life and the life an Omega. The day restarts again. That's it. Yes that the entire movie. It keeps resetting.<br/><br/>Now what's a sci-fi movie or a war movie without a little bit of romance? The Full Metal Jacket (Emily Blunt) is absolutely military sexy! Whilst Blunt looks ravishing covered in sweat and dirt the steal of the day is Tom Cruises performance by far. (No – I am not a fan of Tom Cruise). Cage and Rita find common ground and Rita herself was able to reset the day until a blood transfusion took away her ability. This fling on its own makes the movie lighter giving it the final touch of its excellence.<br/><br/>Is it a movie about aliens? Is it a movie of war? Is it a movie of Romance? If there is one thing that is certain about EDGE OF TOMORROW it is a movie that MUST BE WATCHED. <br/><br/>TITLE: EDGE OF TOMORROW DIRECTED BY: DOUG LIMAN STARRING: TOM CRUISE & EMILY BLUNT RATED: PG-13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 113 MINUTES"

","This is yet another 2014 film that I'm late to although, considering the lackluster box office take, there's probably a lot of people who weren't aware of this or went and saw something else instead. It's their loss, though, as this is an incredible sci-fi adventure with plenty of action, humor and a dynamite lead performance by Tom Cruise. The gist of the story is that Major Bill Cage (Cruise) is a media specialist/recruiter for the Army who really likes his cushy job, but ends up getting thrown headlong into combat. On the morning of a huge invasion he ends up getting killed, but something happens to him that allows him to reset the day whenever he dies. The rest of the story is him trying to find a way to defeat the alien invaders, called Mimics, by taking advantage of this new ability. The person who really sells this movie is Tom Cruise, who is game for pretty much everything thrown at him. He gives an honest emotional as well as physical performance. Also of note are Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson who also do well in their roles. Emily Blunt does especially well, adding some emotional depth to the story while playing an uncharacteristically tough female role in a male-dominated story. Did I mention that she also kicks a lot of butt? Another element that elevated it above your typical alien invasion sci-fi film was the amount of humor. All of it came naturally out of the story and situations dictated by the plot, and none of it felt forced at all. The visual effects were also top-notch, and I liked the alien creature designs. The only couple of negatives I can draw out are some shaky-cam in the battle scenes, which is still kind of appropriate and recalls the Normandy beach landing in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and that a lot of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough outside of the stars in the cast. That being said, everyone gave an excellent performance. Overall, despite having the same gimmick as GROUNDHOG DAY, EDGE OF TOMORROW is an exciting, engaging and, in the end, thoughtful sci-fi film that has immense replay value. This is definitely one movie you won't mind watching again."

","An excellent premise that is carried by Tom Cruise throughout.<br/><br/>If you don't know what the premise is, then go into the film that same way. That way, you can follow Cruise's character as he finds out what's going on himself. Even with knowing, Cruise sells the premise very well, and he is the key element in the film. Without him, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" would be good, but more of a standard science-fiction movie.<br/><br/>The other characters run from underdeveloped to one note. It's fun to see Bill Paxton as a tough Sargent, when many of us remember him as the freaked-out grunt from ""Aliens!"" Otherwise, everyone, including Emily Blunt, don't have much character or shading to them. It's up to Cruise to carry the film, and he does so very well.<br/><br/>This is the first Doug Liman movie I've liked since ""Swingers."" Most of his movies are colorless, passionless affairs that are more productions than movies with any soul. He does better here, driven probably by the presence of Cruise.<br/><br/>The screen writing is great, especially towards the beginning as the plot and the premise unfold. The editing is also very good. The trick is, once we know what's going on, and what needs to be done to fight the aliens, we're kind of just hanging out until the end.<br/><br/>So, the last half is definitely less interesting than the first. But, the opening is very good, and the film is worth a watch.<br/><br/>NOTE: The 3-D is good. But, Liman and cinematographer Dion Beebe are unfortunately too much into the shaky-cam thing for their own good. And, it makes the 3-D too jittery an experience, which is unfortunate.<br/><br/>******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)"

","At some point in the future aliens invade earth. They fly like meteorites through space but are more like organic versions of the mechanical aliens in The Matrix--multi-legged octopus creatures of incredible speed and strength.<br/><br/>Human have created some tacky exoskeleton made of old rusty parts with weapons attached for their soldiers to wear. Like most other amazing military weapons they are a scam as they don't give humans much of an advantage. Oddly enough humans will only shoot bullets at these aliens even though they seem to be almost resistant to bullets. Part of the military PR campaign is some tough chick and some guy named Cage who appears on all the talkshows. In good neocon fashion, humans can only think of responding to the alien invasion with human boots on the ground in a huge military response in Europe. And Cage who is just a PR guy finds himself being sent to the frontlines. He protests, is tasered and wakes up on the base as they prepare for tomorrow's attack.<br/><br/>He meets the tough Master Sargent, is assigned to the J squad where he meets a sorry ragtag bunch of British soldiers. The squad dropped off on the beach for the assault but it's a massacre as the aliens knew that the humans were coming. He manages to survive a few minutes unable to make his armor work, runs into the tough chick who's killed, but then somehow he kills an alien, one that is a different color than the rest and who communicates with them. He's covered in the the alien's blood and his face sort of dissolves.<br/><br/>Then he wakes up again on the base as they prepare for tomorrow's attack. But he remembers what he's been through. He relives the attack but is quickly killed and wakes up on the base again. This happens a couple of times as he tries to save people he knows will be killed. Or then he tries to warn the Master Sargent about the slaughter in the hopes he'll stop the offensive. Nothing works. One time though when he meets the tough chick she tells him to meet her when he wakes up. And he does. She of course doesn't recognize him but he explains to her what is going on with him. Turns out she had the same condition but it went away. She introduces him to some weird scientist (as they all are in the movies) who explains how the aliens work. Eventually Cage will start having visions of the alien brain and its location so they can kill it. For that to happen though he will have die repeatedly to be able to get close to the location. And that is where this movie is headed then.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow combines familiar elements into an entertaining action movie with lots of humor. The repetition of the days, which usually can be annoying in movies, is actually enjoyable except for long, weird, and pointless scenes of Cruise undergoing training by the chick to shoot at and run from mechanical alien replicas. Cruise is his usual defacing and masochistic self. Blunt is completely forgettable, not sure what they see in her. For an action movie there isn't a lot of action and it's not at all impressive. It's still hyper action, fast, inscrutable stuff flying around. The aliens are lame and don't do anything other than kill and destroy (kinda like humans I guess). Edge of Tomorrow is an enjoyable and milder action movie."

","Not so long ago men were ready to hit the beaches of France and take on Nazi aggression. Times may have changed, but the allied forces, this time called the United Defence Force, are hitting those same beaches, to rid our world from aliens! There is a twist though, Major Cage (Tom Cruise) has to do this over and over and over as he is stuck in a time loop, which is a good thing, as he has no combat training whatsoever... he is a PR guy who like the gentlemen raising money for war bonds, excites the young and the stupid to fight the good fight.<br/><br/>Is the movie worth it? Yes! There are well filmed action sequences. The film is not repetitive given that the Major has to fight the same day over and over, until he is forced to make one final push that ultimately leads to the ending, and there's Emily Blunt, who is quite cute generally and quite sexy in uniform (or mech armour).<br/><br/>Take this one for what it is, a sci-fi action movie, that is fun, entertaining, and worth the entrance fee, or the rental price if watching it at home on your HD TV, which I recommend over a cinema anyway! Have fun watching!"
"cosmo_tiger","8","0","2","5 October 2014"," I have to say that like everyone else I really enjoyed it. The movie is fast moving, entertaining and fun to watch.
","""What I'm gonna tell you sounds crazy but it's true. You have to listen to me, you're lives depend on it."" Cage (Cruise) is a major in the US Army when the planet falls under attack by aliens. After a disagreement with his superior he finds himself bumped down to private and thrown on the front lines. He is killed in battle but somehow wakes up at the beginning of the previous day. The same thing happens again and again. The only person who believes him is a soldier named Rita (Blunt). Together they have to find a way to kill the threat and break the cycle. I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan but I have liked most of his movies. I wasn't that excited about seeing this but everyone I talked to that had seen it said it was great. I still had tempered expectations for it when I sat down to view it. I have to say that like everyone else I really enjoyed it. The movie is fast moving, entertaining and fun to watch. The movie does make you think and you have to pay attention to catch everything that is going on. To me that is what makes a movie fun to watch, one that keeps you involved. The movie is pretty much a sci-fi version of Groundhog Day like everyone says but there is more to it than that. If I had to pick one fault with it it would have to be the end. It is a mix of being way too Hollywood and one that doesn't totally make sense. When you watch this you will see what I mean. Overall, a very fun movie that more than just sci-fi fans will enjoy. I recommend this. I give it a high B+."
"baehr_adam","10","0","2","5 October 2014"," The Best Tom Cruise Movie To Date in my opinion!!!!!
","I will start out by saying that I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and I absolutely loved it. I will begin by saying that I love Tom Cruise as an action actor and that he is def in my Top 5 actors of all time. Now to the review. <br/><br/>Acting: I will begin by saying that the acting was top notch of course we have Tom Cruise who is Awesome and also Emily Blunt who was Fantastic. I thought the standout was Bill Paxton who was hilarious in the movie and also Brendan Gleeson who was also great with the few parts he had so acting was Superb. <br/><br/>Story: The story I thought was very well put together about the alien Invasion and by the end of the movie while there was still one question it was pieced together nicely.<br/><br/>Action Scenes: The action in this movie was Insane it was honestly non-stop from start to finish which I love for a movie like this take all the examples you have seen which combine Starship Troopers and the first scene in Saving Private Ryan and combine them and that is what you get an all out brawl of badass action scenes to rival these movies in particular which are Battle:LA and Battleship which I didn't watch because I heard it sucked but regardless if you love action movies this is def for you.<br/><br/>Verdict: I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy and action movies galore. I would say watch it in IMAX but if you can't just watch it in 2D this is the summer blockbuster to start the summer and possibly beat out all the rest and in my opinion is Tom Cruise's best film since my personnel favorite ""Collateral""!!!!! A Must See."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014) is superb film in all directions. Everything works here so well, that i can safely say, this is the best blockbuster of 2014 (although i haven't see ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" yet).<br/><br/>First 40 minutes of this picture are outstanding, later plot moves to next step, which is also superbly crafted. The very last ending of this picture wasn't as good as the rest of the movie, but it was OK.<br/><br/>I can praise everything in ""Edge of Tomorrow"". Directing is great, acting is very solid, production values are a top notch but the real star of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is script - very smart, very involving, unexpected and really engaging. No wonder, because the script was written by heavy-weighter Christopher McQuarrie - brilliant job in ""Edge of Tomorrow"", just brilliant. I was engaged in this film from the very first second till the very last shot, it's that good.<br/><br/>Overall, 10/10 for ""Edge of Tomorrow"" - brilliant script, superb directing, acting and production values - everything clicks here on full cylinders and although a was a slightly disappointed by the very last ending, nevertheless ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a must see type of entertainment."

","I see many movies based on the reviews but it was irony in this case! I heard some reviews saying that no difference was in this film with the other sci-fi's and yet, I went on to watch it just because its a Tom Cruise Sci-Fi. and now, WOW! its very fresh movie although it has Source Code theme (program there, blood here) but its kind of different. I see no other than Tom for this role. This was tailor-made for him. Although many continuity errors are there, the alien thing and Tom cruise distract us enough throughout the movie.

"JohnnyPHreak","9","0","2","23 September 2014"," Cruise and Blunt showcase this sci-fi action roller coaster with dark humor
","I'm a fan of Tom Cruise. He's the type of action star any fan would want. He's got charisma, star powers, works with good people and does his own stunts. I think if his lifestyle didn't get in the way of his stardom he wouldn't have alienated so many moviegoers. As a person I can take him or leave him. But as a movie star I'm always there first weekend for his films. I think many of his films lately have given people a bad taste. But that's not his movie star fault. His ""personality"" rubs people the wrong way. Which in my opinion is sad. I could go on about Jack Reacher. And I have many times. As normal I was excited to hear he was making an action sci-fi fun which he's not done very often. I was even more excited to hear he was working with director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr and Mrs Smith) and actress Emily Blunt. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow has been advertised as a Groundhog's Day type sci-fi action movie using time travel which isn't wrong. Cruise and Blunt's characters do live the same two days over and over trying to figure out how to win this war against an alien threat. But the way they use time travel isn't too complicated or too dumb for viewers to get. I would say it's a cross between The Terminator and Back to the Future. Cruise play a major who is a military talking head. He is blackmailed into being the face of this new battle. Cruise is playing out of character for most of the film. Which excited the hell of me. <br/><br/>He doesn't do the normal Cruise action star for much of the movie. He's just trying to survive in a situation he has no business being in. Emily Blunt throughout this film is the main hero. She is the ""super soldier"" who is on all the poster and doing the most damage in battle. It's so refreshing to see a female action heroine who is doing all of the action beats most male action heroes do. Blunt is strong, fierce and venerable. I really hope studios take notice because she needs more action roles. I'd love to see her face off with Eva Green in a big action film. <br/><br/>Blunt and Cruise's chemistry keeps the viewers sucked in. There is a lot of dark humor in the film. And it doesn't distract from the story. I feel like if some moments were taken too serious they would have fell flat. But the humor injects some brevity to the film. Bill Paxton plays a hilarious hard nose sergeant. With Brendan Gleeson and Noah Taylor rounding out the supporting cast as a headstrong general and ""mad"" scientist respectively.<br/><br/>Doug Liman is one of the best action directors working now. The film had quite a few awesome action scenes. They are shot well and not edited to death. A car chase and ""Plane"" chase stood out in my head as two of the best action sequences in films this year. It's nice to see that a character goes through an evolution in a movie before becoming the hero he's meant to be. It was so enjoyable not to force a love story. There's a bit a romance in the film but it is based out of the situation. This film was a blast. On repeat viewings I can see it becoming a cult classic with Emily Blunt's performance being heralded in the action fan circles. <br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"mkwh2004","8","0","2","23 September 2014"," didn't think I would like it but I did
","I did not expect to like this movie because it had Tom Cruise, but I love Emily Blunt so took a chance and I was pleasantly surprised. We've seen other films where they take this approach - repeating history until you learn the right thing or take the right path. But I thought the alien invasion approach unique. <br/><br/>Cruise pretty much revised every role he's ever had, but Blunt was so forceful and enigmatic that I could forgive that. The action scenes are dynamic and the ""repeated"" segments are done well so that you don't feel like you're watching repeats. I did like the progression of Cage's character - from the ninny to the uber-warrior. It was well done. The secondary characters in the military unit where Cage serves were also done well, though a bit cliché."

","Loved it. First if you are like most of us in movieland, you had no idea what this movie was going to be about. I was completely clueless going in to view ""Edge of Tomorrow."" From the title it's a little hard to tell. I thought I was going to be watching a futuristic cop movie. I make a point not to watch trailers because all too often I can figure out what the main plot will be or view too much info about the movie. To the movie: great intro one that gets your attention, the cool news real style, much like district 9. Then into our main character Tom Cruise. Outstanding performance. He is the classic reluctant hero. I watched this movie four times looking for the subtitles in his acting. If you are a Cruise fan this is a must see. Coupled with Emily Blunt who easily held her own. Brendan Gleeson as the General is very fitting and Bill Paxon, well, c'mon ""It's game over man Game over."" How can you go wrong with Bill and his famous Alien's line. Script is awesome, excellent use of comic relief, good film work, sets were impressive and the CGI does not disappoint. And above all, intense action. I loved this plot, there my be some who frown, but for me it really worked. Get the blueray when it's out and enjoy!

"DareDevilKid","9","0","2","21 September 2014"," A Deftly Calibrated Sci-Fi Spectacle
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.4/5 stars<br/><br/>The conceit may sound constricting, but Director, Doug Liman gets exceptional mileage out of it, presenting his ever-revolving tale with visual style, narrative velocity, and a wonderful dose of dark humor. Ultimately, it's is a two-hour video game. But the filmmakers play it exceedingly well to churn out an instant sci-fi classic. The plot deals with an alien race that has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Major William Cage (Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again...and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside special forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt). As Cage and Vrataski take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy. While this premise might sound derivative, be rest assured that the narrative is strewn with copious intricacies and unpredictable moments that demand your attention, lest you be left behind in the adrenaline-pumping, frantic pace of the film. More story than testosterone, more time-jump-cuts than spacey filler, and more war-as-hell than war-as-cool. The biggest achievement of the movies is that it leaves you pondering if we're 'masters of our fate' or just action figures going through the emotions in some supreme player's idea of a war game.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise once again shows why he's still a bona-fide movie star and guaran-damn-tees us that he's got at least a few more years of leading man material left in his arsenal. Along with the gorgeous Emily Blunt – in a kick-ass role – he takes you on a (literally) loopy ride that's thoroughly entertaining and – baring a few pardonable moments in the second half – never wears out its welcome. The performances of Cruise and Blunt are spot on, with good supporting work from Bill Paxton, who plays a very hard-headed albeit somewhat humorous sergeant.<br/><br/>The film is such a refreshing departure from the run-of-the-mill genre yarns of countless modern sci-fi blockbusters, and offers a fascinating and enjoyable vehicle that creates an ambitious illusion. All in all, a perfectly superior example of industrially fortified Hollywood fun, and as good a guarantee as Doug Liman can offer that we haven't seen the last of him yet. Smart, unpredictable, expertly-designed, well- acted, astutely directed, shrewdly-edited, and boasting impressive special effects, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a model example of the sci-fi genre and summer blockbuster done right."

","The only spoiler is what the aliens look like.<br/><br/>I liked everything about the movie except the aliens. It was well paced and funny. At the beginning of the movie, you don't see what the aliens look like. They're just called Mimics. It's not until Cage gets to the battle that we first see what the aliens look like. For me it was a let down. They basically looked like the transformers with their bodies made of the same CGI metal scales. They move really fast and have whip-like tentacles. I think the movie would have been better with a more original alien enemy.<br/><br/>Everything else about the movie really fell into place. Again, the pacing was just right so things weren't confusing or boring. There were funny moments and tense moments.

","It's quite funny to watch that a four star general is discussing the strategic plans with a major, as this never happens in real life. If a four star general talks to a three star that seems reasonable but to a major is quite lame and out of proportion. Moreover, a major cutting joke with a four star general is also clumsy and pure fiction, in military culture it doesn't happens like that, it shows how much you put in to make a movie. In military life a major thinks before talking to a lieutenant colonel who is just one step senior to him rather as shown in the movie the major is negating the four star general, very funny. A four star general do not speak to the CO of an officer he rather have to talk to the minimum the corps commander if he want to take under command an officer of the rank of major of some other army. Showing the same image again and again was quite confusing rather funny and good for younger children and was not expected from a Tom Cruise movie. I gave this movie 7 out of 10."

For me this is a 7 or even a 6.<br/><br/>Somehow one knew that at some point Cage would loose blood and loose his ability to reset the day. But he could have just built a mechanism that automatically kills him, for example a hand grenade attached somewhere. Or he could have told her to kill him in the car.<br/><br/>But still a very entertaining movie. The question remains: Will there be an ""Edge of Tomorrow 2"" or an ""Edge of the Day after Tomorrow""?"

","I Love the idea of this movie.. you will never regret watching it I assure you. I mean this movie is all about one could ever want in his life..Basically to be GOD. because for me to be able to control time and to relive some moments means to be God! I love this to see in a movie but now when I think about knowing when I will die for real I don't want this to happen..except if I would be able to do just like Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt did in this amazing scenario movie! If any of you have time to watch this movie I suggest you to do because it simply do your day but..On the other hand after you see it there are chances to be a little depressed if you will start to think how it will be if you could control the time..and reset even one day.. it will be amazing if any of us could be able to risk everything in one day with the opportunity if something goes wrong to be able te relive that day and make it how we want it..and I think that I would have had that power..to make one day of my life perfect I would have tried it many times until I will be full of cash.. I mean literally to have money in every bank and seif in this world. But thats just what an 18 year old boy thinks..who knows maybe in a few year or many years I will not think how I think today. See this movie! Brilliant idea!"

","This is another great Tom Cruise sci-fi action movie and exactly what i expected from the trailers of this movie,the movie has a good pace and it is so full of action you do not think about the many questions the 'groundhog day' situation brings.<br/><br/>Because everything that has to do with time travel immediately creates a time paradox and that is a strange situation where even the right is wrong and vice versa.<br/><br/>It difference from groundhog day cause that had to do with faith and here it is because of the blood from a certain type of alien that makes Tom die and repeat the same day over and over.<br/><br/>The rules about all this is well enough when your watching the film but after I watched it more questions arose but in a good way because it is good that a movie makes you think and I also came to the conclusion that if more was explained the movie would be to long and lost its pace.<br/><br/>Cruise is an actor who seems to know what he wants and what the audience wants and expects and there for he is one of the great actors of our time.<br/><br/>This movie was shot in Cruise Control and that makes it....awesome."

","I really enjoyed this movie. <br/><br/>I went through a phase some years ago of finding Tom Cruise a bit .... cheesy? .... However I have to say that the last few films of his have all been memorable and very enjoyable. He acts the smart- ass but terrified, business guy at the start perfectly, and we watch him progress very realistically into the sharp-edged warrior.<br/><br/>The Edge of Tomorrow is a thoughtful science fiction flick, someone has made an effort to see how people would get affected by the story line. Continuity must have been a nightmare.<br/><br/>PLOT spoiler....Not giving too much away by saying that this is like a modern take on Ground Hog Day. Where Bill Murray was simply trying to get into bed with Andie McDowell in 24hours, Tom Cruise is trying to save the planet and all of humanity. You quickly realise that this is just like playing a modern video game.... it doesn't matter that you die a million times, just reboot and start again.<br/><br/>Great movie, I watched it by myself when the missus was on a business trip. I am now really looking forward to watching it again with her when she is back."

","wow this movies had so many unexpected dimensions and all for its betterment.first of all the role of tom cruse is like a breadth of fresh air for once he doesn't play the role of super cool alpha male super soldier but of a weakling mean guy and from that point the good humor of the movie kicks in and remains. through-out the film there are many light moments which will bring smile to your face.another aspect of the movie which i think is not observed much is the love story though the time span for which our lead characters meat was always short but they were many and there were some subtle and beautiful moments took place in them.if you pay attention you can see that the thing that redeemed and changed tom cruse from a mean coward to a valiant soldier was his love for emily blunt.also the movie is pretty rational for a sci fi once the dynamics of the universe/time-frame where movie took place are described then they are followed well you wont find scenes(the one we find in lot of sci fi) where you can say ""hey according to the theory given in the movie itself this can not happen"" screen play is sharp editing is even better.what else ya emily blunt looked absolutely smokin hot in the movie.it was a sure 9 for me"

One of the other reason was that i love Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise so i had watch it.<br/><br/>This movie is a MASTERPIECE , EXCEPTIONAL but Emotionless. Director Doug Liman shows his brilliant filmmaking again after The Bourne Identity[2002].In the movie,the world is facing an alien invasion and Cage(Tom Cruise) & Rita(Emily Blunt) had to fighting against them to save the world(blah..!!). Well,this movie is based on the same idea as the Source Code[2011] was but a much much better implementation in some important fields of filmmaking.A Very good acting by both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, Wonderful direction by Liman and Exceptional writing.You will see some great visual effects.But the movie has its flaws also.I think the movie has less touch with human emotions.There is hardly a one or two scenes in the movie in which you can see the emotions coming out but the director was unable to catch them properly.May be Liman was so involved with telling the story that he forgot to include the emotions also.Also, I didn't liked the background score its more like a war is coming and something big is happening which is good and according to the movie but at certain time when their is a need for emotional score,background score goes plain. But, nevertheless this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to watch for its good acting,direction and writing.Don't expect any emotions from it..."

","Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt did a phenomenal job in this film. They really embodied the characters well. They complimented each other nicely in this.

","This movie had everything I personally like in it. Dark humor, action, science fiction elements, and suspense. The characters are well developed and play off each other, so you actually care what happens to them. This film says more the unspoken shots than the actual dialogue, which is a testament to the actors. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt nailed their parts! Tom being an understandably shaken man with major PTSD issues, and Emily striking a pose as a larger than life bad*ss hero.<br/><br/>Onto the awesome stuff. The soldiers are all equipped to battle in exosuits making them super humanly strong and fast. But that's not where it stops, they have rear mounted shoulder cannons and wrist guns, even wielding swords with ruthless efficiency. If that isn't cool, I don't know what is. However their enemies are no slouches either, resembling the machines from the matrix, they're whirlwinds of death. The eye grabbing style of the surroundings commands attention, resembling real life Halo but with some takeaways from anime.<br/><br/>This is something you have to pay attention to, but trust me you won't want to look away. 9.5/10"

","Good Groundhog Day concept, set in a European war against invading aliens.<br/><br/>It started out undercooked. We got a quick exposition by network news montage, then a really implausible dilemma for the hero, which was made worse by an unbelievably relaxed military base on the eve of a D-Day style invasion.<br/><br/>Lots of details got me thinking that would never happen, never! At this point it felt like the whole thing was held together with sticky tape.<br/><br/>The invasion sequence is Saving Private Ryan all over again, but not so much. And then ... the concept kicks in, and it becomes a great story, There's plenty of humour, but it's all gogogo action and the pace hardly flags. The aliens are menacing, better than Starship Trooper.<br/><br/>The acting was good, although I think Gleeson was miscast, and the rag-tag troops are a bit lightweight. The hero goes from glib coward to determined saviour, but there's nothing to show why (rather than how) he clicks into action.<br/><br/>I know some things have to be glossed over, but there's no explanation of how the rogue troops sneaked off base with a hulking great airplane for the final mission.<br/><br/>So I mark it down to 7 for that, but still very enjoyable."

Straight from the outset the film engages and you and keeps you on the edge (no pun intended) all the way until the films climax. Clever, intelligent, action packed and brilliantly acted by Tom Cruise. There are even undertones of a comedy in there somewhere as there are some genuinely laugh out loud moments. Not a traditional Sci-Fi flick in any way shape or form, truly original and a nice change from all the usual regurgitated dross that has been hitting our screens over the past few years. Fun, slick, original and comes highly recommended. One of my surprise hits of 2014."
"theflixerdotcom","8","0","2","2 September 2014"," Great movie, too bad more didn't see it!
","Edge of Tomorrow tells the story of Cage (Cruise), a soldier who is caught in what seems to be an endless time loop in a war against an alien race. He continuously lives the same day over and over until he meets Rita (Blunt) who is the only one who can help him Tom Cruise. What can I say? This guy never ceases to amaze me. He truly is a great actor and even at over 50 years old, he is easily able to pull off the lead in a high paced action movie. This movie has great action, great effects, and a fantastic story. Definitely my surprise movie of the year so far! I'll be honest, I went into this movie with low expectations; I figured I'd be getting something mediocre at best. The movie hasn't done well at the box office and I didn't hear or read much buzz about it (too much competition this year?). That said, I truly believe more people should see this movie. It's a work of art.<br/><br/>Lately, Cruise has thrived in roles where he requires large amounts of energy and a high pace. He plays the role of Cage perfectly and with a lot of emotion. One thing about Cruise is he invests not only his time, but his money into these movies and becomes truly passionate about every project he works on in recent days. You can see he put all of his blood, sweat, and tears into this role and his energy bleeds into other actors in the film.<br/><br/>Blunt does a great job as the leading lady and although I thought it was strange casting choice for what is supposed to be a bad ass chick, as soon as I saw her, I was in. She has great chemistry with Cruise in this film, and I think Cruise's energy level is infectious as I found her to be very much on par with what Cruise was bringing to this film.<br/><br/>Paxton has a supporting role as Master Sergeant Farell, he does a decent job but seemed a little cartoonish in a movie that was in a fairly serious vein. He felt a little out of place to me Another role I should mention is that of Brendan Gleeson as General Brigham. He plays a small, but important part and I think he does a good job in his execution. He doesn't have much screen time, but I still enjoyed his performance.<br/><br/>Outside of the acting, the effects were fantastic. I enjoyed the gritty feel, and the aliens are truly unique and terrifying at the same time. Their superiority to mankind is very well portrayed and a ton of fun.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is one of those films that I think will turn into a 'cult' favourite. Unfortunately, it didn't do well at the box office but I'm not sure if that was because of Cruise, bad marketing (which some claim), or perhaps a misplaced release date. Either way, see this movie if you get the chance. You will be pleasantly surprised. I know I was Rating: 8.5/10"

","This movie is a lot better than I expect it would be. I was no interested in seeing the movie because of the trailer and the marketing team behind it, but the movie itself really held up. I enjoyed the movie a lot and so did my friends that went to go see it. They even thought it was better than they expect it. The only thing that I did not like was the ending of the movie. I will have to watch it 2 or 3 more times before I get the ending of the movie. This movie was really unique and great, the length of the movie was good and the story line was good. It did not leave you hanging, so if you watched it straight you should be able to understand the story, but just the end kind of got me thinking, but i like that.

"fox252","9","0","2","31 August 2014"," Not To Be Missed: Cult Classic
","Let me begin by stating that I didn't bother to go see this film until almost a month after release. I thought the trailers looked somewhat interesting but, there had been so many disappointing pieces of sci-fi over the past few years that I was very wary. I found myself at the movies unable to stand going to see another sequel/prequel/comic book movie so I decided on Edge of Tomorrow in IMAX. What a treat this film was. The scope and action, the cinematography and editing, the acting and humor were surprising to say the least. Both my friend and I were blown away. 11 viewings later, I figured I should make this my first IMDb movie review.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gives a great and unique performance playing a coward. His comedic timing is impressive here. He can still carry a blockbuster and all is forgiven for past err.. let downs. The criminally underrated Emily Blunt shows that she can do anything including action. Playing a hardened veteran/ poster girl Rita, Blunt manages to sell her toughness while bringing touching vulnerability to her character. Melting into her role, she is completely believable (her background story also helps) as the epic warrior. There are a few smaller roles with big name actors. The best among them is Bill Paxton who plays a commander. He brings some of the most quotable movie lines in recent memory while also carrying much of the dark humor. For the relatively short screen time of his character, he manages to have a large impact on the film as a whole. <br/><br/>Admittedly, this is really a tale of two halves. The first 2/3 of the movie is about as good as it gets in terms to quality and entertainment. The last 1/3 leaves something to be desired. Had it finished better, we would have a master piece of entertainment on our hands. As it stands, this film remembers what most forget; that it's purpose is entertainment. It is not trying to change your outlook on life. You get action, humor, love, drama and clever plotting for pretty much the entire run time. With almost unlimited re-watch ability due to the fact that there is very little fat: No scene or moment is wasted while the plot and action move at a break-neck speed. I'm still rating it a 9/10 because of the perfection of the first two acts. Don't miss this one and shame on you if you didn't see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Check out the book ""All You Need is Kill"". Worth reading as it is very different from the film.<br/><br/>Out of 4 <br/><br/>Movie Score **** Film Score ***"
"The-Social-Introvert","7","0","2","24 August 2014"," Surprisingly refreshing
","Let me start by saying I've got a bit of beef with the title Edge of Tomorrow. I first came across the film around a year ago whilst scrolling through Tom Cruise's filmography on IMDb. There was a title for a future release adapted from a novel called All you need is kill. Well, there's an eye-catching title. The name itself was the only reason I added it to my watch list. Fast forward to a couple of months andthe film's gone. Oh. It took me a few weeks to find out that All you need is kill and Edge of Tomorrow were one and the same. And I find the new title a bitmeh, really. It sounds too la-di-da, too generic, and too Hollywoodish. All you need is kill is far more direct and striking, which is why I estimate that the new title will be forgotten in a couple of months. It's a shame really, because the film is far from ordinary.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow could be described as a combination of Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers and Source code. Whilst the premise is clearly not original, the way it is delivered makes up for the lack of creativity. The film is a breath of fresh air in the sense that it's a sci-fi film that does not try to build worlds, and instead focuses on a smallish scale story where it could have easily been lured into attempting a huge epic story when there is no room for it.<br/><br/>The trailers will have you believe that like Battle LA and Oblivion we would be getting another grim and gritty sci-fi blockbuster, in the wake of The Dark Knight. What they don't show you is just how funny the damn film is. The filmmakers utilized the fact that they could have Tom Cruise dying in all sorts of ridiculous ways (although probably not to their full extent – the film is PG-13 after all). One stand out death involved Tom Cruise making an escape from the military by rolling away from a press-up routine – right under the wheels of a passing truck. After Cruise emits his in-movie trademark shriek Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton), with a disgusted look on his face and supporting a hillbilly accent, inquires ""What were you thinking boy?"" Paxton was great in this, by the way. Really witty. It was like he was struggling to hold back an urge to wink at the camera. His involvement and Brendon Gleeson's was why I watched the film in the first place. Gleeson wasn't in it much but Paxton had a somewhat healthy role.<br/><br/>For a film that, in a way, replays the same scenes over and over again Edge of Tomorrow has a charm that remains consistent throughout. The pacing suits me just fine as does the fact that everyone involved seemed to know that this movie's purpose was to first and foremost entertain the viewer. Going grim and gritty would have ultimately made the ridiculous premise boring and bland.<br/><br/>It may be funny, but it's not a comedy – the film is truly a special effects-filled blockbuster. The metallic suits were awesome as were the weaponry. The aliens themselves were a bit forgettable but it was a visual feast seeing them get torn apart by bullets. I enjoyed the humanity aspect too – the idea that Cruise would start to develop feeling for Emily Blunt – the ""Full Metal Bitch"" – throughout the time loops as she tells him more about her was an interesting and well thought out one. The fight scenes were great. Unlike the Transformers movies you could see what was going on and the intense war scenes recall the Omaha Beach assault in Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>It's a shame this isn't making much money. I'd like to see more Hollywood blockbusters with interesting premises that seek to entertain first and foremost. Cruise and Blunt had a great chemistry, the special effects was great and Edge of Tomorrow was an all-round worthy trip to the cinema.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Final Word: Surprising<br/><br/>Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/movie-review- edge-of-tomorrow/"
"Tyson14","8","0","2","22 August 2014"," Edge of tomorrow:a fun if hollow film
","It's always fun to watch a time-travelling and see what it does with the genre. I wrote my senior thesis on time-travelling, so when I heard about this film, needless to say, I was interested.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage, a spineless public affairs officer, who's forced to go out on the front lines to fight an invasion against aliens who have taken over large parts of the continent of Europe. The invasion goes horribly wrong with the soldiers getting slaughtered and Cage is killed, but not before killing one of the larger aliens and getting its blood all over him. He wakes up and soon realises that every time he dies, his life ""resets"" to the point when he first arrives at the military base at Heathrow airport before the invasion. Cage meets up with Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) who is an expert soldier who tells Cage that she had the same ability to ""reset"" before a blood transfusion had taken away that power. With the help of a rag-tag group of soldiers, Rita teams up with Cage to train him in the ways of being a warrior and discover how to stop the alien threat once and for all.<br/><br/>What the many trailers and TV spots of the film do not showcase is how funny this movie is. After establishing the threat of the alien force and Cage's power, the story almost becomes a Warner Bros. cartoon with all of the comedic ways Cage manages to die. It's cathardic to see Cruise's character who had been portrayed as weak-willed get his comeuppance learning from his mistakes.<br/><br/>The narrative focuses on the enjoyment of the structure of the story itself, and the interplay with the audience: expectations of time-travelling, the mystery of the ability, and also the question of how much Cruise's character has gone through this process to where we see the movie more from the eyes of the characters surrounding him as he's become so knowledgeable about the world and the people around him that he almost becomes ""other-worldly"" even from Rita, who herself had gone through the same thing.<br/><br/>What you will not find, however, are a cast of well-developed interesting characters. You get stock military types where they ramble soldier jargon, pound their chests in testosterone fury, and safely stay within the confines being supportive canon fodder with only one or two distinguishing characteristics about them. Despite his high listing on the cast list, Bill Paxton's character of Master Sergeant Farell's only interesting features are the speeches he frequently makes, his southern accent, and the fact he has a moustache; he's essentially just used as a talking checkpoint for the audience to reorient themselves when they travel back to specific moments whenever Cage goes back in time. Even Cage and Rita don't have much concerning layered personalities, with their only real centre of character development springing from the conceit of the time-travelling mechanic in the film and how it effects them as people.<br/><br/>Though there isn't much of a story to be found here, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a well-put together action film with thrilling action sequences, good pacing, and a deft understanding of how time-travelling works best in this type of film, even if the mechanic itself is not that expertly examined in the story. You could do worse in terms of spending 113 minutes on a film, and Edge of Tomorrow provides enough excitement the entire time to where one's never bored of the narrative and the structure of the film is constantly bringing up engaging action-packed scenarios."
"KnightsofNi11","7","0","2","20 August 2014"," The fun kind of ridiculous
","Last night I spent $1.50 to see Tom Cruise scurry around in his newest blockbuster sci-fi action comedy extravaganza Edge of Tomorrow. Let me tell you, $1.50 is the perfect price to pay for this film. Now, don't interpret that as me saying this movie sucks. It doesn't. Is it worth the usual price of admission, which here in Los Angeles can be as much as $20? No. Is it worth the theater experience, though? Yes, absolutely. Edge of Tomorrow is loud, shiny, and extravagant, and it definitely entertains for two hours. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow takes place in the midst of an alien invasion as the humans of Earth try to battle back a vicious race of bizarre looking aliens called Mimics. Cruise plays Cage, an officer who finds himself stuck in a time loop where he repeats the same day over and over a-la Groundhogs Day. This day just happens to be the day that a beachfront attack on the aliens would go horribly wrong, resulting in an absolute slaughter on the human side of the battle. When Cruise meets up with Emily Blunt he finds out that, because of his G-Day syndrome, is the only chance civilization has at stopping the Mimics. The only catch is that he has to keep dying so that he can relive the same fatal day until he pretty much gets it right. <br/><br/>The easiest way to label this movie is by calling it a mix between Groundhogs Day and Starship Troopers. If that logline sounds absolutely ridiculous, it is because Edge of Tomorrow is absolutely ridiculous. It's an absurd concept carried throughout by absurd exposition driving an increasingly absurd plot. By about the halfway mark it should have been very easy to start hating this film, but it's saved by one thing; it's own self awareness. Edge of Tomorrow knows how silly it is, and it embraces that right off the bat. It hits the ground running with a good sense of humor and a protagonist who is intentionally a complete pussy. Of course, reliving the same day over and over allows Cruise's character to come into his own, and the transition from wuss to hero is pretty well done. <br/><br/>This film sets itself up well for non-stop action. It only takes about 20 minutes for us to get our first taste of combat in an epic D-Day inspired beach battle. Then we of course repeat this battle again and again, making for a battle sequence that technically lasts the entire movie. How many films get to say that? <br/><br/>This unfortunately sets the film up to be a little long winded, and I felt like a solid 15-20 minutes could have been shaved off to save some of the alien battle fatigue I was feeling by the third act. I was really enjoying Edge of Tomorrow from the get go, but after a while Tom Cruise getting smacked around by aliens and robots gets a little tiring and repetitive. Given the film's premise it's probably not totally fair to call the film repetitive, since that's sort of the point, but other similar movies like Groundhogs Day proved that you can still keep a repetitive movie fresh, and for most of the film Edge of Tomorrow is good about this. By the third act the film did something really smart. I won't give away any specific plot points but it definitely raises the stakes, keeping the plot freshly exciting, but the on screen action was more of the same. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow starts significantly stronger than it ends, but that doesn't stop this film from being a solid sci-fi action movie. It's a memorable popcorn flick that I can admire solely for the fact that it's not a sequel, prequel, remake, or reboot. I always enjoy original sci- fi, and Edge of Tomorrow is no exception. Especially given how dreadful this looked from the trailers, I give major kudos to Edge for keeping me entertained enough for it's two hour runtime."

","This is one of those movies that has high-tech special effects, but combines it with a clever story and direction. It's another movie about humans fighting against a alien race, but the story is just so darn well thought out and clever when it comes to the scenarios. That it actually stands out among other movies of this type. When it comes to the story, it's actually based on a novel called ""All You Need Is Kill"". The story is like a mix of ""Groundhog Day"" and a alien invasion movie with mech like suits. For a storyline like this it needs quite a bit of creativity or it gets redundant fast. Fortunately, the creativity of the similar scenarios is what drives this movie. It mixes the right amount of humor and the serious tone of this movie which doesn't go off track. Tom Cruise is a good actor and he is especially good playing these characters that gets built from ground up. I personally think he is a better actor for these sci-fi movies than Will Smith. The action is entertaining and the direction and scenarios are captivating to the point that I would highly recommend this movie to any sci-fi movie fans. Sure there are few plot-holes, but they seem to have at least have tries to make a interesting and intelligent film. You will have a blast with this one.<br/><br/>8.8/10"

Yes, I think that most of the war scenes are much like Saving Private Ryan. And yes, I have seen Aliens, and these battle armor.<br/><br/>And yet I think this still invented something. The plot is this -- Major Cage heads to London to oversee Operation Downfall (ironically named) when he is arrested for impersonation. Now he is Private Cage, and not only is he very inexperienced, he also absorbs a power from a rare alien species, and wakes up when he dies. He eventually meets Rita, who also has the same ability to reset after dying. <br/><br/>It is something we all wish we have, but here there is a catch! If you get injured, and if any blood oozes out, if you die you shall never wake up.<br/><br/>I will never understand why The Fault in Our Stars, which I really like as well got more money than this. Why? It was a YA Book. Well, this would have been a box office hit as well if it was not for the terrible marketing.<br/><br/>Besides the obvious criticism of the marketing campaign that I have just said, everything about the movie rocks.

As with royalty, bloodlines are depicted as a mechanism for time control. Although it seems like a battle with a fighting chance, the aliens have tilted the playing field in their favor using time control. When Cage gets the ""blood-line"" in him, he begins to win and the aliens decide he must be trapped by false illusions and controlled. At one point, we witness a scene where Cage's own human medics force him to have a blood transfusion, thereby emptying his time control power. The heroine Rita (Emily Blunt) also tells a story of undergoing dissection and ostracism after she was found to have sneaked into the blood-line.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow gives a striking depiction of women and men sharing barracks. The top soldier Rita is a woman with a mechanized exoskeleton. Any pretense of gender roles are lost and we know it's a ""real war"". Women in combat isn't a popular vote platform in this movie, instead, it's reality. We are shown that the General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) intends to carry out death by conscription for Cage in a military where trumped up allegations are commonplace reasons for sending people to the Army. It reminds us of the ""Press Gangs"" used for hundreds of years in Great Britain to kidnap sailors. Actually winning the battle was an annoying side note for the General. Many references to D-Day are made where it was a zero sum intention calculated to win by mechanized industry in addition to lives lost. The aliens are depicted as strange mechanized beings without joy or mercy and we wonder, what are the aliens fighting for?<br/><br/>The crisis reaches its sharpest point when we realize it is up to J- Squad to steal a plane and save the day. J-Squad is made of misfits, mentally ill and above all, fighters who willingly give their lives to only be forgotten immediately after victory was realized. In Cage's perspective, the final day's battle took hundreds of grueling days, but to others, it was just a blurb on the news to discuss at a bar. And Cage relived the day of battle again and again, almost as if it might never end."

So: ""Groundhog Day"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Matrix."" <br/><br/>If the ordinary spectator at the mere glance at the poster or trailer there doubts about the need watching ""Edge of Tomorrow"", it is possible to deny them safely and plan a visit to the cinema. Each member of the creators may serve as a sign of quality. Tom Cruise have not walk smack into something smelly, and can only rejoice in his presence such a good agent. His fees not break through the ceiling, it is not involved in the franchise, ""The Avengers"" and him not hunt directors. For all this, each role played for qualitatively, recognizable for his films involving collect good criticism, and it is his passion for good science fiction - above all praise. Emily Blunt - Actress, always related to the roles of responsibility, to their choice, and just a very pretty woman, which even the exoskeleton to face. Directed by today's cinephile celebration fans in general distinguished trilogy ""Bourne"" and cheerful militant about not quite normal couple spies (""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""). <br/><br/>Beforehand, it was clear that we will get the output as a minimum quality cinema. But what widescreen revealed as a result - has surpassed all expectations, and worthy of all praise. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is not exchanged on the story of a looped the bottom, it is not pushing carts pathos, the viewer is not martinet or clinical idiots. Tape filthy broom cleans any debris that could stop her - be it extra twists or flat characters. Every detail is fantastic founded and supported by evidence of plot, which is much more important. For, no matter how you lined up the mythology and rules - they will not work unless they are woven into the narrative. The local history is a perfect example of a sensible approach to compiling everything invented before. It's not plagiarism - it's borrowing, a very smart and thoughtful. Here and there sticking out ears films, which were named in the first sentence, but the ears are sewn so well that it looked like a native. Doug Liman sensibly figured that you should not fix what is not broken, and even reinvent the wheel is not necessary - you just need a good ride on it viewers. <br/><br/>Ride, meanwhile, is also not as simple as it seemed before. The plot, without hesitation, jumps off the rails a serious militaristic thriller about the invasion and moves out to sow comedy. To our joy with you, I must say, for the laugh Lyman and Cruise know how and love it. To its credit, the creators of searches no one genre component, from the history of rushing for nearly two hours without a hitch and sagging. <br/><br/>""Edge of Tomorrow"" is struggling to please everyone by weighing a notable amount of shooting and fighting, the aforementioned humor, story component and handsome Blunt.

It's amazing how sometimes enjoy looking at the same footage. <br/><br/>Having participated in the melancholy, slightly meditative ""Oblivion"" Cruise mood swings, but not a genre, for which we are very grateful. Science fiction is never enough and its abundance in recent years - a real treat. Deserve special thanks to local invaders. These tangles hostile activity and aggression in relation to all mankind - Decoration ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Aliens, nicknamed ""mimics"" Design is not as original and, according to the author of this text, they would be more luxurious, they will select the face and muzzle. But they behave really creepy, resulting in fact strong arguments in their claims to the conquest of the planet Earth, and prove it in practice in all the battle scenes.

"morgie55","8","0","2","7 August 2014"," Edge of Tomorrow
","The Edge of Tomorrow<br/><br/>First Impressions:<br/><br/>I've always liked Tom Cruise's science fiction films, from Minority Report, Mission Impossible I to Oblivion. In these he finds himself supporting one group or goal and having to suddenly change himself to counter-act a group or goal that is no longer survival and could mean his death if he continues on the path he finds himself. So he goes it alone, new, untraveled ground, to find himself and to fight the group he formerly supported. <br/><br/>Not so with Edge of Tomorrow!<br/><br/>Unusual for Tom's usual characters, he plans a PR man who encourages people to join the fight against the alien invasion that is rapidly taking over Europe and threatens to jump the Channel and England. Humans are losing and losing badly. <br/><br/>It's clear not all the public relations in the world will save the planet from this implacable enemy, but Tom tries very hard to make it so. Until they call him in for active duty! <br/><br/>He is a coward at heart and wants nothing to do with actual combat. After some interesting altercations, he finds himself on the battlefield, meets an alien called an Alpha, and almost accidentally kills it – and finds himself 24 hours earlier, lying on baggage in handcuffs, as he was the day before. Which is today. Of course. <br/><br/>Plots and Plans:<br/><br/>Really liked this movie! Not only the Groundhog Day-style living the day over and over, but in each incarnation trying to find a way to beat the alien threat. The aliens have time travel technology in their blood and know what we're going to do before we do it. Only Tom's character has the way and method of stopping them.<br/><br/>He teams up with a soldier who knows of his ability and tries to use it to beat the aliens. <br/><br/>The story is not so much about the aliens, but about the slow change of Tom's character – from a coward who wants to stay behind the lines to a man who realizes that only through his own actions will he stop a major threat to Man. <br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Not to give too much away, but Tom's relationships with the people in this film develops well and the characters that support him run pretty well throughout the film. The army sergeants, the ""J Company"" troops and others were a bit cardboard and not developed well at all. This could have been a five star film if I really cared about what happened to them. <br/><br/>This is not your Dad's Groundhog Day! It's a plot point that carries with it a message of standing up to your fears and realizing your goals despite unimaginable odds. <br/><br/>Great special effects! The ground swells with these aliens, look like spinning octopuses with large glowing eyes and can slice you up really well! Their weapons are energy balls that tear through the troop transports, that make hand-to-hand combat nearly impossible. You go to the battlefield of death! Except if you're Cruise – then you die again and again and again!<br/><br/>A physical film, action and guns, heroes and inner enemies. A must-see film.<br/><br/>Cast & Crew:<br/><br/>Tom Cruise Cage Emily Blunt Rita Brendan Gleeson General Brigham Bill Paxton Master Sergeant Farrell<br/><br/>Directed by Doug Liman <br/><br/>Writing Credits Christopher McQuarrie ...

"AnitaCole","7","0","2","30 July 2014"," It's a clever movie but they shouldn't make it so big
","The story is smart. This kind of movie can work on a smaller scale. They shouldn't make it on such a big budget, causing difficulties to break even. It's unfair when people focus on the failure of box office, not the film itself. <br/><br/>However, this movie is far from perfect. I think it's even not entertaining enough. Here is why-<br/><br/>1.It's clever, maybe too clever for general people to catch the crucial points. Many people understand the live-die-repeat thing, but have no idea about how the time loop works, the structure of alien society, or the difference between Alpha and Omega. That's why so many people consider it boring.<br/><br/>2.Tom's role is too far away from the roles he used to play, causing a lot of confusions. His acting is good. But this is not enough for a character building. Screenwriters should do more on the leading role's character development, not leave everything to the actor.<br/><br/>3.Most other actors are completely wasted. I can't believe such a good writer who worked out so many decent supporting characters (in both Valkyrie and Jack Reacher) cannot do it this time. It's a shame. I really start to worry about MI5 now...(I didn't worry and had enough confidence in Christopher McQuarrie until I watch this film)<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a nice film. The story telling is smooth and soooo clever. Tom is as good as always. Emily also did a great job. I think many people will enjoy it, although I'm a little disappointed as a TC fan.（Not a good enough film for such a crucial time in his career, it's good, but not good enough)"
"urgentneptune","8","0","2","29 July 2014"," Edge of Tomorrow Review
","Edge of Tomorrow<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is a sci-fi action movie starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. The story revolves around Tom Cruise's character, who is enlisted to fight in the war against the ""mimics"". Mimics are an invading alien species that threatens to destroy human life as we know it. However, Cruise's character begins reliving the day of the battle over and over again every time he dies in combat. The eventual goal: live the day long enough to destroy the leader of the mimics.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The plot, despite leaving you thinking after the movie has ended, has surprisingly few plot holes, especially considering that its a time travel movie. Going in, I thought I was bound to be watching the same scenes over and over again, but this what not the case. In the classic ""Groundhog Day"" scenario, Cruise masters the events of the day, so he knows exactly when and where and enemy will be, and what they will do, making for some intense and interesting fight scenes. For some, the plot may be hard to follow, and looking up an explanation of the movie may be necessary. However, I think plot is overall very stable, especially for a time-continuum movie. The ending of this movie is a Tom Cruise ""you decide what happens"" ending, leaving more to be resolved, but it fits the tone of the movie well.<br/><br/>Acting/Dialogue<br/><br/>The movie features a great cast, including of course Tom Cruise, whose performance is stellar. In my opinion, Cruise is an underrated actor, but in this movie he really shows his skill. His character's character arc is special, changing from a wimpy public figure to a full- fledged soldier.<br/><br/>Cruise and Blunt's chemistry is perfect in this movie. Without spoiling too much, I will say that Blunt's character really holds the movie together, and her performance is almost as good as Cruise's. Almost.<br/><br/>The dialogue is full of humor, one-liners, and witty remarks. The fun really comes when Cruise knows what everyone is going to say, and completes their sentences for them. There are some great monologues as well. This movie is sure to have people quoting and referencing it for years to come.<br/><br/>SFX/Action<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing. They look great, and the explosive action scenes in the movie are so pretty, they almost distract from all the destruction and death. There are some great fight scenes with Blunt and Cruise kicking butt. However, some of the most thrilling moments come in Cruise's death scenes. These scenes range from comical (in a gruesome way) and very serious, the latter of which becomes evident part way through the movie. <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>This is the movie to see right now if you are a fan of sci-fi action. A great story, great acting, and great sfx make for a pretty great movie overall. I give Edge of Tomorrow an 8.5/10. Go see it if you want to see Tom Cruise at his best, and leave the theater thinking about the movie for hours afterward."
"agmoldham","6","0","3","27 July 2014"," Everything seems familiar
","On the way into this movie I was thinking that a few of the Tom Cruise movies seem to have very similar plot lines. The Edge of Tomorrow is very much along the same lines as Minority report and Oblivion. The other obvious comparisons to movies in the past are Groundhog day and Source Code. So how does it compare?<br/><br/>The Edge of Tomorrow follows Cage (Cruise) as he is parachuted into a future war against an alien race. Rita (Blunt) is seen as one of the best soldiers and one of the people who could possibly turn around the war against the aliens.<br/><br/>It is a pretty entertaining movie and whilst there isn't really anything new it's a bit of a blast. Well worth a watch."
"sandimcg","10","0","2","26 July 2014"," Thoroughly entertaining - most will love this movie!
","This movie is packed with action which is varied and REALLY well done. There is humor (often missing in action movies - levity is a nice addition, since comic relief often adds a LOT of entertainment value). The screenplay is VERY well written. The main and supporting actors perform beautifully. I wish EVERY movie had these elements! Such good entertainment is why I am addicted to movies. Almost everything that happens is logically addressed (which is always satisfying). Of course, you can pick apart this or that in a few places. If that frustrates you, then you can go to the blogs and put in your 2 cents or see what explanation others have. And for ME, throw in some sci fi and make me have to think a bit - what's not to love? Whatever you do - THOROUGHLY enjoy this movie!"
"patsworld","9","0","3","24 July 2014"," Groundhog's Day On Steroids
","Tom Cruise scores again as the hero of this combat action film. He simply can't be best in these roles. He's tough, believable, and fascinating to watch. In this movie, which if you don't appreciate almost constant action you might not be such a fan of, Cruise's character dies almost instantly and is wakes over and over again, each time getting stronger and smarter. Watching him begin this picture as someone scared witless and totally unprepared for what he will be required to do – and evolving into an intelligent, powerful, capable fighter is brilliant. Emily Blunt is also believable in the tough character she portrays. Good plotting, super acting and a movie that you'll get sucked into before you know it as you find yourself rooting for Cruise to hurry and learn what the violence and action is determined to teach him...this is good entertainment."
"pjd9683","7","0","2","23 July 2014"," Surprisingly good but predictable ending
","I was a bit hesitant to see this film but was satisfied after having watched it. It's definitely not a modern classic by any means but its entertaining and gets the job done. I would also would say that it is one of Cruise's better pictures within the last handful of years. I enjoy Jack Reacher, a movie which shares the same the screen writer as Edge of Tomorrow in Christopher McQuarrie. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow made up for Oblivion which looked good to me but I was severely disappointed in it. That is one of the biggest reasons I was hesitant about seeing Edge of Tomorrow; I'd thought it'd be a repeat performance as Oblivion. Edge of Tomorrow was not a dud like Oblivion and effectively renewed my hope in any future Sci - Fi flick Tom Cruise may appear in the years to come. He still has the chops at age 52 to be an effective action star/leading man. His closest competition seems to be Liam Neeson who is ten years his senior. Neeson has been popping up in action films pretty readily these days but I digress.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is pretty much a sci-fi/action - thriller version of Ground Hog Day. As most movies do Edge of Tomorrow has its flaws and holes. I did enjoy the fresh concept of how Cruise's character winds up in his seemingly perpetual state of reliving the same day over again and dying each time until he accomplishes what needs to be done. What he's exactly supposed to accomplish via repeated dying and then starting over again leads us as viewers through some twists and turns. We eventually find out and what we get is something predictable. This movie could have ended differently but it would be less happy and probably would have appealed to a lesser audience. Depending on how one contemplates the ending there could be some questions to Cruise's characters actual fate. If somebody is inclined to think a little deeper on the final scene."

","If you see one flick all summer then look no further.<br/><br/>It's not only the best of the season, Edge of Tomorrow is the top release so far this year. It's still playing in some theaters so catch it before it completely leaves the big screen.<br/><br/>Whether you're a film buff or just the occasional theatergoer, you'll love this science fiction thriller. It's riveting, smart, inventive and fun.<br/><br/>With a massive budget, a strong supporting cast of knowns and unknowns, and top-notch special effects; the cinematic experience doesn't get any better.<br/><br/>But it's the story you'll dig most. EoT is similar to last year's Ender's Game by offering an original take on extraterrestrial invasion. The 'mimics' are organic, menacing and wildly compelling.<br/><br/>To pile on top, the plot fiddles with time travel in the smartest way.<br/><br/>Let's discuss discouraging numbers.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow pulled $28 million for third place in the box office opening weekend, behind Maleficent in 2nd place, and The Fault in Our Stars which made $48M.<br/><br/>According to budgetary estimates on IMDb, TFIOS cost $12M to produce, and EoT cost $178M. So far EoT grossed almost $95M, but still tails behind its wretched usurper (TFIOS) at nearly $120M<br/><br/>EoT is making up for it overseas, but the statistics speak for themselves: American moviegoers reward bad dromantic quirkedies over well-crafted science fiction.<br/><br/>This disappoints me.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the film.<br/><br/>A common criticism regards the title. I've heard four separate voices speak out about it. But there's a trend: Nobody ever suggests a better one, or explains why it's poor.<br/><br/>It's certainly better than the title of the novel the screenplay's adapted from, ""All You Need is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka.<br/><br/>Perhaps 'Precipice of Yesterday' is better? 'Threshold of Today' is definitely a downgrade.<br/><br/>Now. If the argument regards the title's inadequacy in capturing the attention of the American viewing audience, I'm listening. It's got to be more than just, ""Edge of Tomorrow is a bad title.""<br/><br/>Tom Cruise never gets enough credit. He stars (as two different characters named 'Jack,' ironically) in two great movies from last year, Oblivion and Jack Reacher. He's acted in at least fifteen fantastic films (and no, this doesn't include Jerry Maguire) most of which he's the leading role.<br/><br/>Quick T.C. top five: Rain Man (1988), Magnolia (1999), Minority Report (2002), Risky Business (1983) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999).<br/><br/>He's one of our finest, most accomplished actors working today. You can add yet another fantastic film to the list and consider him adequately credited.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's acting is perfect, but we don't get enough combat out of her.<br/><br/>Although she's often wielding an awesome futuristic sword, she doesn't dispatch many mimics with it. Probably due to the unfortunate PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>There's a shot of Blunt as she gets up out of a yoga pose. As enjoyable as it is, it happens three or four times and it's one too many.<br/><br/>Another undesirable moment occurs when Nance (played by Charlotte Riley) uses the phrase, ""Could I trouble you for a glass of shut the hell up?""<br/><br/>It's a jarring cliché and her phrasing's not realistic. She'd choose a stronger curse word.<br/><br/>As irksome as it is, one can argue it's a nod to the Nursing Home Orderly played by Ben Stiller in Happy Gilmore. This interpretation's a stretch, but it's preferable.<br/><br/>All in all, these are small scratches on a fresh finish; unworthy of dwelling upon. What's worthy of dwell is the ending. (Beware, a spoiler follows.)<br/><br/>Something doesn't add up. According to screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie the filmmakers only solidified the ending while shooting was underway. Some of the backlash responds to the 'happiness' of the movie's conclusion.<br/><br/>I'm more concerned with the pre-established rules of the fictive universe, and how the time reset could work in such a way on the mimics' final day. There's no precedent to suggest the time interval would increase upon the aliens' destruction.<br/><br/>Again, this is neither here nor there.<br/><br/>Whichever way you slice it, Edge of Tomorrow is terrific.<br/><br/>I can't wait for Edge of the Day After Tomorrow, where the mimics rise again and develop flight capabilities. Let's get Blunt in jet-propelled boots, and give her a second sword, just in case."

","What I am about to tell you sounds crazy. But you have to believe me. You see, this isn't the first time I've seen this film. In fact, I've seen it more times than you can count. I know it stars Tom Cruise as Major William Cage, and I know he's sent to the front lines of a French beach invasion to fight the alien invasion. I know Emily Blunt stars as Rita Vrataski, aka The Angel of Verdun, and I remember her saying that what happened to Cage happened to her. I remember seeing Bill Paxton as Master Sergeant Farrell, and he was stealing every scene he was in. In fact, so was Emily Blunt. I remember being blown away by the action sequences, and the opening scene distinctly reminded me of the Omaha Beach scene in ""Saving Private Ryan."" I also remember being pleasantly surprised at the amount of humor in the film, and how it never felt out of place. I know the first time I saw the ending, it felt odd, but when I woke up, I looked back and realized it couldn't have ended any other way. What's the last thing I remember? Thinking that this was one of the best films of 2014. Time to reset."

","Excellent! It was an Alien Invasion but with a Groundhog Day premise, and a subtly handled love interest. Cruise was very good. The effects were great, the action was great. <br/><br/>Granted, the premise was impossible. Where would the memories be kept? But given the premise, it develops smartly from that. In fact, the cleverness of the solutions, and the cleverness of the presentation, deliver lots of those delightful ah-ha moments.<br/><br/>Like Groundhog Day, it isn't easy presenting a moving one-day romance. But they come through again!<br/><br/>I guess I'm a sucker for that premise. Groundhog Day is in my top 5, this is probably in my top 20, Memento, in a related vein, would be in my top 100.<br/><br/>In the last 20 minutes, I kept thinking, ""Don't let them screw the ending!"" They pushed the envelope a bit. It was tough to swallow, but I got it down and felt satisfied."
"muttsnutman","9","0","2","16 July 2014"," Great entertainment, lots of noise and violence, but none of it glorified, gripping...
","OK, So only 9 out of 10 'cos nothings perfect, right, but this comes close. Most 'sci-fi' based stories expect you to swallow 33 unbelievable things before breakfast, but this really has one simple premise - Time can be reset. Literally everything else that follows (precedes/repeats :-) ) makes sense if you swallow that one piece of hokum.<br/><br/>For the first time IMHO, Cruise actually comes across as a believable hero and makes it work and Blunt is naturally as competent as always. The camera work is slick and suitably frenetic in the action scenes without making you feel that they are cutting and jumping for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Although these 2 carry the film because of the nature of the screenplay, all of the subsidiary characters were credible and there were none of the stupid 'cannon fodder' people shoe-horned in just to fill space. Even the brief cameo parts had dialogue which either keyed on a plot point or threw up something to make you think, like ""What do they want?"" just when you were wondering where the movie was going.<br/><br/>I think the soundtrack must have been OK but since I was glued to what was going on for the hundred and something minutes, it didn't really register what the music might have been like...<br/><br/>By today's standards the movie was relatively short, but it filled the time with meaningful action and/or dialogue and did not contain the usual load of redundant filler. Sorry, but slow fades, lingering meaningful pans across the battlefield and aesthetic sunset scenes are fine in the right dramatic circumstances, but in a narrative action movie - no way Jose! <br/><br/>When I first saw The Matrix I thought 'Original, exciting, fun' and Edge of Tomorrow is as good, and maybe better. Looking forward to watching it again to see what I missed. <br/><br/>Recommended Highly."
"sunshinebeachcinema","8","0","2","15 July 2014"," Tom Cruise has still got it in this superior time-loop sci-fi action extravaganza.
","When the trailers for Edge of Tomorrow first appeared, they deceptively showcased a generic sci-fi blockbuster awash in a flood of similar fare with zippy names like Divergent or Transcendence. It didn't stand out. A friend quipped that someone should just invent a mech-suit so people don't have to keep making movies about them.<br/><br/>I could see where he was coming from – we've seen it all before in Elysium (2013), Avatar (2009), District 9 (2009), The Matrix Revolutions (2003) and even Aliens (1986). Meanwhile, what appeared to be a sci-fi D-Day scene caused my brother to dismiss the film as Saving Private Ryan (1998) with aliens. This is absolutely true; there's no coincidence that Edge of Tomorrow was released the week of the 70th anniversary of the D- Day landings.<br/><br/>So it seems derivative, but it is surprisingly creative. It manages to bring the best of these elements together and successfully decant them into what is, after all, an original film. It's not a sequel to anything else, it's not part of a franchise, and that's always something to be happy about. It comes from director Doug Liman, who has directed many original action and sci-fi films, including The Bourne Identity (2002), Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) and Jumper (2008).<br/><br/>As suggested, the conflict is evocative of the world wars (including both the D-Day landings and references to a decisive battle at Verdun) with a futuristic twist. An alien menace has decimated Europe and is poised to invade the United Kingdom, and we're thrown into the action on the eve of the last desperate attempt by NATO to push back into France.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars as Major William Cage, showing us once again that he still knows how to star in a blockbuster. Cage is not a real soldier; he's a PR man who thinks he's there to sell the war to the public. He begins with typical Cruise charm and confidence, which then shatters when he's sent to the front line by NATO commander General Brigham (Brendon Gleeson, the first we see of the film's solid supporting cast).<br/><br/>He ends up in a squad of oddballs (squadballs?) under Master Sergeant Farrell (Bill Paxton, who was in Aliens). Everyone has mech-suits, because it's the future and it's cool. Cage can barely operate his, and swiftly ends up on the receiving end of an alien mandible. The alien special effects are high quality; they are scary, inhuman and move smoothly but unpredictably.<br/><br/>But it's not all over, he's entered a time loop, which resets to the night before the battle each time Cage is killed in action, which he is, again and again. Ultimately, he is able to use this ability to turn the tide of the battle and the war by incrementally improving each day, both by developing his skills and finding out how to beat the aliens.<br/><br/>However, he couldn't do a thing without Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who was doing the same thing until she lost the ability. She's a believably hardened veteran, and a hyper-competent warrior compared to the initially bumbling Cage. Though Cruise is the star, she takes the lead in the developing relationship between the two characters, even if he has to meet her for the first time every day.<br/><br/>The time loop inevitably draws comparisons further potential source material, in this case the classic Groundhog Day (1994). It's also evocative of playing a video game; loading from a previous save point and attempting to beat the same impossible level over and over.<br/><br/>The film plays off the natural humour created by such a scenario, but it is often very dark, as Cage must die each time to reset the loop. Yet the humour works well and is perfectly balanced with the action and desperation of the larger campaign.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is based on a popular Japanese novella called All You Need is Kill, and some of the aesthetics, including the mech-suits and Vrataski's impossibly huge sword evoke this origin. There's another nod when the incompetent Cage gets his suit's language stuck in Japanese.<br/><br/>Indeed, it is a global film, not just the American affair featuring Tom Cruise that it might have been. There are plenty of European actors, including Blunt, Gleeson and many of Cage's squad. The opening sets the scene quickly with a composite of BBC News footage, and the film is exclusively set in England and France, with deserted, destroyed and military occupied scenes of London and Paris among the most powerful.<br/><br/>Cage's character development is an excellent deconstruction of what we expect from Cruise as an actor. He starts out with a confidence built on cowardice, but is thrown completely out of his comfort zone. Over the rest of the film, the character works hard to attain a typical Tom Cruise level of action hero, which he doesn't attain until the climax."

","First of all, the people that hated all agree that the story is ""unoriginal"" and ripped off of other big movie hits.

I don't understand the people that do this, they don't watch movies, they compare them in their own deviated and apathetic terms.<br/><br/>I read All You Need Is Kill, both the light novel and manga, and incredibly I believe Edge of Tomorrow to contain a much more established and powerful plot than its counterpart. The ending especially is well done in the movie.<br/><br/>If you watch the movie and position yourself as the main character, you will understand why this movie is 10/10, rather than thinking the movie is only decently good, or, like some people, is terribly bad and unoriginal (I seriously don't understand why these people even watch movies)."

"CinemaCocoa","8","0","2","12 July 2014"," Original premise AT LAST! Solid action science fiction!
","Tom Cruise continues to show us he isn't getting old by strapping on a gun-totting exoskeleton to blast some aliens. But luckily for him his co-star is excellent and the film's implementation is entertaining.<br/><br/>In our very near future aliens arrive via meteor shower. Before long the entirety of greater Europe has been reduced to an infested wasteland. The military of all major countries amass around the borders and attempt to push the expanding tide back with state of the art weaponry. Cruise plays William Cage, a military spokesperson who is drafted against his will, only to get himself killed in the final battle. However, through unknown means he finds himself reliving the day, again and again, each time he dies.<br/><br/>This sort of thing has been done before, from Source Code to Star Trek television episodes, the hero trapped in a time loop offers an affordable bit of entertainment with the reuse of sets and even dialogue. Luckily, I'm a sucker for this sort of story. Think Groundhog Day mixed with the visuals from the battle for Zion in Matrix Revolutions. Based off a Japanese graphic novel called ""All You Need is Kill"" (originally the film's title until it was changed to suit wider audience appeal... sigh...) the film starts out with contemporary settings and a very un-Cruise like Tom Cruise. His character is a downright coward, and we see him trying to shrink and squirm his way out of army recruitment. This was a great way to start as it proves that maybe this film will be unique. Then you have a literal montage of Cruise dying... a lot! As is the film's gimmick; Cruise must learn (and in turn inform the audience) about the mysterious alien invaders through the only way he can: by fighting through a hopeless battle over and over again. He finds help through Emily Blunt's character Rita, a veteran in this future war and quite probably veteran show stealer. Certainly Cruise's continual deaths are the funniest thing he's done in a long time (take that as sadistically as you want!) Blunt's grim reality is a great foil for him, especially when she must... instigate his day's repetition.<br/><br/>It does have some cliché of course. The unit that Cruise's character is settled with could be replaced by the Saratoga's marines from Aliens, and I've already mentioned how the entire premise has been done before. The way the story naturally develops does mean that our lead hero becomes more and more Tom Cruise-like too. It is perplexing, but the more interesting character is seen to be slowly replaced by the all too familiar film star. It also has a terrible ending that reeks of massive cop-out. Far from the worst I have seen but certainly up there, a very unsatisfying end after everything that had happened. The action is also far too frenetic. Coupled with the aliens appearance being very, very fast and covered in tendrils, it is incredibly difficult to see what is going on! I only saw this in 2D but I am grateful for it... this mess would induce a headache in 3D.<br/><br/>But, it proved good entertainment and as a sci-fi fan I enjoyed it. I laughed a lot more than I expected to and I would consider it well above average."

"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","0","2","11 July 2014"," It may be flawed, but it has a lot of infectious fun with its concept.
","In the summer battleground of uninspiring franchise blockbusters, it's refreshing to see a film like Edge of Tomorrow putting up a fight. It may also be based on a comic book much like the rest of what's in vogue, but its ideas, if familiar, are approached in a compelling and risky way. At a time when it seemed that the film would slip under the radar I'd always secretly supported it because I liked the cast and plot. By the time that it indeed slipped, it managed to quickly gain a following of devoted fans similar to those that latched onto Pacific Rim and Dredd. Unfortunately, I was unimpressed by a trailer I saw at the cinema and lost my anticipation. The enthusiasm of its fans pushed me back to check to see if my original hype was justified and I was delighted to find they were right, at least to an extent.<br/><br/>Granted, this is Doug Liman behind the lens, director-for-hire for such films as Mr. and Mrs. Smith and The Bourne Identity. They may have burrowed a place in contemporary pop culture but the films themselves leave a lot to be desired and their actual experience seems to be forgotten. Edge Of Tomorrow both thrives and suffers under his guise, though it's fair game to say it's his strongest work since Go. It's a tonal problem, most prevalent in the clichéd setup of the first 20 minutes. It's a film that really needs its concept to begin until it can work. After a second-rate Pacific Rim style background montage, it can't decide whether to take itself seriously or not and it ends up treading a fine line of cringeworthy silliness. However, as always with Liman, he's fortunate to work with great writers that know the best place to take it.<br/><br/>It's a film that has fun with its concept, and then takes it to the next level. It's not a new idea, most famously used in Groundhog Day and most recently in Source Code. Perhaps its closer to the video-game style respawn ability in films such as the terrible 2008 Wanted. Fortunately, despite this fundamental handicap, Edge Of Tomorrow still has its stakes that it smartly raises. It even takes us to the grind of trial and error, something very uncinematic that Liman and Tom Cruise make work. As it hits the target it spends half the film aiming for, it pushes it further and is more fulfilling for exploring more ideas. It's a tight film, yet loose enough to play around. It would be a flaw in any other film, but not here. That does lead us to becoming disconnected and frustrated with supporting characters and hitting checkpoints, but it doesn't make it any less entertaining. <br/><br/>It's been great to see Tom Cruise make a slight comeback after an underwhelming second half of the last decade. Mission Impossible 4 was the best of the series and Oblivion was a compelling surprise. It's odd to see him subvert his reputation and begin his character arc as a coward and then naturally evolve into the Cruise from the rest of the action movies we know. While initially unsympathetic during the flat first 20 minutes, when he is then put into the situation of being able to relive the day it shows that it was the best choice for us to sink into his shoes. I do like Emily Blunt but I disliked her representation in the trailer. It was the main reason it turned me off. However, in the film she's ideal, and her steely sense of humour works. There's a subtle tenderness in their chemistry that does the writing justice, especially for the moral dilemma in the film's best moment at its centre. That's the point where the film won me over.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the supporting cast are incredibly tedious. They're caricatures of soldiers. They're not supposed to get a chance to shine but when their moments are forever repeated, you hope for them to grow on you eventually just like Cruise and Blunt. It's why the film always feels flawed yet always entertaining, with not everything exactly working while one thing is executed brilliantly. But that tone that's initially clunky becomes consistent and eventually part of its charm. I have to say that I liked its bittersweet ending whereas others didn't. In that second half Edge Of Tomorrow takes it to a scale where it feels like an epic, and I'm very impressed with Liman for reigning it in and writers McQuarrie and Butterworth's for finding the emotional core. These gritty special effects certainly beat any Transformers movie though special suits like the one in District 9 will never engage me. It's a fun, occasionally emotional, utterly grossing, but ultimately imperfect blockbuster to make the summer complete.<br/><br/>7/10"
"arvindsasikumar921","8","0","2","10 July 2014"," Awesome!

The script, plot development and above all the direction were awesome. The graphics was good too. The occasional comic reliefs didn't disappoint either.

","I think the first half of this is easily better than the second. Oh sure, the second is decent enough entertainment, although it gets to be a little dull at moment. The less action-packed first half though, just provides more entertainment. It sets up the characters better, not to mention it has quite a lot of humor. The humor is what did it for me, really simple but very clever comedy that did have me laughing out loud more than once. Cruise is pretty effective in the lead role and he lens the humor a tone of ridiculousness that only makes the film more fun. This isn't anything great, if only decent, but it's definitely worth a watch."

Either because he died (seen by Omega as an Alpha died) or Omega itself got hurt, Omega decided to reset.

"khanbaliq2","7","0","2","8 July 2014"," This gripping and well-acted science fiction film leaves an impression.
","Edge Of Tomorrow is definitely one of the must-see films of this year. Director Doug Liman infused this military science fiction story with his distinct action style. But as good as the film is (I can even call it inspired) it's still dragged down by Liman's lack of artistry and his inability to create a clear narrative. Edge Of Tomorrow is a good-looking film. At times there's some very impressive imagery, especially in the action scenes. Shots of Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) come to mind. But, overall, there isn't much to look at except for the metal suits. The film starts out rather slowly as the viewers are introduced to an alien threat (the Mimics) and what is being done to fight them. William Cage (Tom Cruise) is there from the beginning, though his character becomes interesting only later. The story begins developing once Blunt is on screen. She's magnetic in her role as Rita and clearly the best feature of the film. This is one tough woman that one can actually admire. She looks like a heroine but, in addition to her determination, Blunt also brings some vulnerability to the character. This shows that there's more to her than being a soldier. I didn't really expect Blunt to deliver a good performance. Her previous work in Hollywood films didn't show much. I haven't seen any of her work in English productions. Edge Of Tomorrow is an American film but for some reason it takes place in England and in Europe. Almost all of the characters are English. The film clearly reaches its peak in the middle. That's when the best most exciting action occurs. That's when Cruise's character begins to develop. That's when the story gets most interesting. The Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka was the inspiration for Edge Of Tomorrow. Surprisingly, except for the main characters, there aren't many changes from the light novel. The story is basically the same. William Cage (Keiji Kiriya in the light novel) gets caught in a time loop where he wakes up one day in the past after having been killed on the battlefield. Cruise is playing against type here because his characters is a coward for most of the film. The repetitious concept is used as a means of exploring the protagonist's deeply flawed nature and reluctant push for self-improvement. As for the other characters, I could care less about them. Time is spent on developing them too, but they're not a memorable or even a likable bunch. Because of its action and sense of urgency Edge Of Tomorrow is similar to The Bourne Identity (2002), which is another Liman film. However, it also contains some humor, making it seems similar to Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) too. It's better than both of those good-but-flawed films, so it's a summer release that I definitely recommend."
"Ejwmovieboy","9","0","3","8 July 2014"," Edge of Tomorrow is shockingly Doug Liman's most impressive work yet!
","Tom Cruise and everyone that was apart of last year's disappointing Oblivion must now wish their film was Doug Liman's shockingly impressive sci-fi extravaganza and it's called Edge of Tomorrow. First of all, who knew this film would be good at all after the preview promised another film from the director of The Bourne Identity and Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Those films were good, but did they mention this is the same director of the ridiculously bad film Jumper? He also did another film with Naomi Watts called Fair Game, but it didn't do well at all in the box office. Watts' amazing performance overshadowed Liman's direction. After the way Edge of Tomorrow turned out, I completely forgot about Jumper and Fair Game as this is Doug Liman's best film yet. His direction is noticeable this time and at its best. This film proved that he knows what he's doing not just with action, but with making a feature length film without any distractions. Besides the Groundhog Day concept, the screenwriters actually used the concept to a sharp advantage by not being overly repetitive and continuing this original film's amazing story without being boring or eye roll worthy. Of course, the special effects are absolutely amazing, but we all expected that from a Liman film. Being thrilling with some of the best war scenes you'll see on the big screen this year, not news at all. What shocked me is how the story glued my eyes to the screen and I did not want the story to end. Tom Cruise has to die and replay the day he went to his first battle in an alien invasion. These aliens are terrifying and dangerous and not humans in disguise like Oblivion! A huge kudos to the amazing screen writing team and Liman for bringing this story to life in an actually unblinking fashion. The battles were one thing, while the story unfolded and unfolded. I am beyond impressed how gripping and also how funny the film is. I laughed with the film as the replay concept is cleverly executed through the editing. One of the writers, Christopher McQuarrie is the mastermind behind Usual Suspects, so there is some great dialogue to entertain us as well! Great job! And, who knew this film could be unpredictable? I sure as hell didn't. This isn't Marvel where you know there will be a sequel (which is unfortunately announced before any of those films come out anyway) and the hero will win. Blah blah blah and boo! This film is not like that at all. No sequel. A closed ending for once! So far, it's 2014's gift to the globe in the originality department. Woo hoo! Spike Jonze's Her was last year's gift, and so far, Edge of Tomorrow can be added to the short list of original films of 2010s in the era of Hollywood's recycled ideas. At least, this time, the recycling of ideas doesn't have to bring big time actors down with them. Tom Cruise will always be a blockbuster superstar, and he continues to chew up the screen with his never ending charisma and reminding us why he can play an action hero uncannily. The man is a great actor no matter how crazy he comes off in tabloids. This isn't Mission Impossible where he somehow solves the ""impossible"" mission no matter what. In other words, not too much as at stake when the title gives you false hopes. Edge of Tomorrow forces you to fasten your seat belts as this is Cruise's most impossible mission yet while more as at stake than imaginable! Cruise convinces you to cheer for him again, no matter how many times he dies. Speaking of which the lack of times he dies or somehow comes back to life (cough Mission Impossible III cough), Liman must have had a blast killing him because he reminds me of the immortal Marvel heroes and their lack of death. At least George RR Martin understands what I mean, because it creates more unpredictability than just pure entertainment. Unpredictability creates more of an experience, and more reasons to spend 12 dollars on a movie in theaters. Seriously! Anyway, back to the actors, which is the other standout in the film and her name is Emily Blunt. She is one versatile actress. I think she may have done every genre so far, and she gives us a very believable performance in the action genre. Her and Cruise have great chemistry, as he does with almost every actress he works with. Emily can do anything, and she is nothing short of bad-ass in the film We'll see her in the musical genre next with Into the Woods. My expectations have skyrocketed for science fiction again with Edge of Tomorrow. My only spoiler free complaint is I wish the ending wasn't what it was. Could have been better, that's all I am saying. At least, the final act was insane, and not what most films have been these days (great beginning only to be ruined by the entire second and third act). Screenwriters can still write original science fiction and I am glad Doug Liman could bring it to life. Thank you Edge of Tomorrow for one helluva ride! Please see ASAP!"

","Director Doug Liman (Mr. & Mrs. Smith, The Bourne Identity) takes us through the minefield of a genre of time-travel and beautifully delivers a captivating, sci-fi action-thriller. In the near future, Earth is at the apex of a bloody war with an invading alien hive mind. <br/><br/>Major Cage, played by Tom Cruise, is a strictly behind-the-desk military officer with a phobia for combat. This is a remarkably great place to start off the movie since familiar fans are used to Cruise playing highly skilled lead action characters; it's wildly entertaining and a nice change of pace to see Cruise start out in a more approachable personality. Cage is stripped of his rank and forced into combat. In a turn of fate, he inherits the alien power to control time; every time he dies, the day resets (like Groundhog Day) and only Cage has full recollection of the events. <br/><br/>He meets super-soldier and polar opposite Sergeant Rita Vrataski, played by Emily Blunt, who helps him understand his power and trains him into a combat-hardened soldier. They work together, repeatedly dying over and over to end the war. <br/><br/>The romance between Cage and Vrataski is woven into the plot seamlessly; it doesn't take away from the bigger picture (like Shia LeBouf's character in the Transformers series), instead it elevates the stakes and enthralls the audience.<br/><br/>Music is spot on and the special effects provide plenty of eye-candy without taking away from a great story; as expected from a high budget sci-fi thriller. **Possible SPOILER** The climax grips the audience once Cage loses the power to relive the day and has one last chance to defeat the enemy. The ending note is sweet and satisfying but may leave highly technical moviegoers feeling inadequate as is the inevitable case with all time-travel movies."

I still enjoy all his movies, from his worst (Lions for Lambs, MI4), his overrated (Top Gun, A few good men), his underrated (Cocktail, The Firm) to his best (Last Samurai, Rain Man) simply because he is such a comfortable and elegant watch, easy on the eye and ears. And he can act.<br/><br/>I won't spoil much in this review, but I am sure you will enjoy this short action-packed movie.

","It blows my mind that some inane comic-book tripe like Transformers is topping the charts and not the intensely action-packed yet highly clever and witty ""Edge Of Tomorrow"".<br/><br/>If you hate knowing anything about a movie before seeing it, then just go see it. But without revealing any spoilers, I can say that unlike most extreme action movies, this one actually has excellent acting, lots of laugh-out-loud moments and not since the TV series ""Breaking Bad"", with the evolution of the character Walter White, have I seen such a great character-arc.<br/><br/>This is the best movie I've seen in quite a while, and I'd say the best Sci-Fi action flick ever...period. Definitely Tom Cruise's finest performance and Emily Blunt is the first convincing female killing-machine I've seen in a movie. I say that as much for her attitude as for her battle scenes.<br/><br/>I wanted to see it as soon as I saw the trailer for it, but it turned out to be so much better than the trailers led me to believe. It is simply an amazing movie. Seeing it in 3D is just icing on an already delicious cake."
"siru-tirronen","8","0","2","3 July 2014"," Smart action film. Very enjoyable
","Simple plot, great actors and well timed comic. Those are all you need for a summer blockbuster. Nowadays movie world suffers from inflation of robots (like Transformers) but Edge of tomorrow gives us hope that maybe good science/action films are not dying extinction. Tom Cruise is Cage who doesn't have any kind of military training but still he ends up to be in the front line of the final battle( which reminded me a little bit of Battle of Normandy). Of course the thing is not so easy and because something happened to Cage he will get to ability to start the same whole day new again and again and again... Only one who can help him to save the day is Rita, the hero of the Verdun strike. How many versions you could make one of your days if you could live one day again and again in your life? Hundreds, thousands, maybe millions. Edge of tomorrow shows us those options. Finally it's like game: you do it again and again until it will work out. You get frustrated, angry, hopeless, hopeful and finally empty. When you think it more it's a horrible ability. You never get rest, you can't end the cycle. Your only choice is try again and again. I liked very much of Tom Cruise's performance. It was funny to see how his character developed during the film and this is only my opinion but I think he has now much more charisma than when he was younger. He doesn't overact now also. I have never before seen Emily Blunt's acting but I read that this was her first action film and she was really good. She wasn't a cliché military woman: her performance was delicate and her and Cruise's chemistry was great. The were also surprisingly funny together. But why I only give this film 8/10? I really wanted to give 9, but it has little flaws. First of all Cage has to die several times. How he still doesn't have any mental problems is big question for me. I think anybody will be very traumatized if he sees himself and people who he cares for to die again and again. And the ending was little hasty and easy compared to planing how they could win... but it is great movie. You can watch it 2D or 3D. In both versions the visual design is great."
"mmanderson96","8","0","2","2 July 2014"," Refreshingly New
","Edge of Tomorrow is a concept we have all experienced, but which is completely new to the screen. Just like when playing a video game, Cage (played by Cruise) must play and replay the same day over and over until ""beating"" it. The concept is so relatable. Cruise does a wonderful job at displaying the utter frustration of trying a ""level"" over and over again but never succeeding. The concept is so relatable, and yet so new to the movie screen, that it felt refreshing. Both Cruise and Blunt do marvelous jobs acting in their respective roles. The director did a wonderful job at replaying the same day over without making it feel monotonous. All in all, the movie was underrated, but is still really great. I highly recommend seeing it!"
"ericbobg","9","0","3","2 July 2014"," The best original blockbuster action movie of the summer!
","Read my full review here: http://ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2014/07/edge-of-tomorrow.html<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is the first original action blockbuster of the summer and likely to be, of them all, the biggest success. The others would be Snowpiercer and Lucy, both of which seem pretty unique and come from directors with solid reputations (the former comes out in August and the latter started in limited release last week). The premise and plot of this film feels familiar, like its been pieced together from varying parts of iconic blockbusters from the past 25 years, but it tells its story so well that you don't mind. The most oft made comparison is as a sci-fi action iteration of the masterpiece Groundhog Day. And rightly so. There's something in that idea of reliving the same day - of realizing the potential for change that exists inside of 24 hours - that is rich with story-telling potential and that sparks our imagination. Cashing in on that curiosity, Edge of Tomorrow delivers plenty of entertainment as a smart, fun, and emotionally-engaging summer blockbuster should.<br/><br/>In the near future Earth has been hit by a meteoroid containing an alien force that proceeds to attack the human race, taking over much of Europe. A global army is amassed and a special tool, a mechanical suit, turns the average enlistee into a super-soldier, better equipped to fight what are called Mimics - quick, multi-armed, mechanical-seeming aliens akin to the sentinels from The Matrix. Emily Blunt plays Rita, the femme fatale public face of victory for the war against the Mimics. She's a legend, known for having killed over 100 mimics in one battle - she's called as the Angel of Verdun to the reverent and the Full Metal Bitch to the fearful adoring. As the most decorated warrior of the force, and as an icon among soldiers, she holds a special authority, like the Achilles of her time.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Cage, an officer that specializes in PR, spinning stories through multimedia campaigns to help fight the war of public opinion for the army and its leadership. He's a bit slimy at first, but because he's Tom Cruise you can't help but love him. After miscalculating the moral compass of a general, he winds up powerless, reduced to the office of private, labeled a deserter, and with orders to join a D-Day-type invasion happening on the coast of France the next day. He's not the type to fight but you realize that he's going to end up in battle and there's nothing he can do about it. Within a few minutes of joining the battle he dies. And then he wakes up right where he was the day before - about to get processed and assigned to his unit. This shouldn't be any surprise - it's the basic premise of the movie. You can get the details when you watch it, which I recommend you do - but basically he needs to relive this day again and again, ensuring it ends with either his death (causing a reset) or the destruction of the entire enemy force. Fairly early on he confronts Rita and establishes that she's been through this before (although she lost this ability) and that she thinks he can help win the war.<br/><br/>I'll mention Groundhog Day again because much of the second act plays out similarly. You'll have a lot of fun seeing Cage attempt new tactics to advance farther in his mission. After establishing a routine to get the attention of Rita, they set to training and planning the best way to destroy the mimics. Unlike the Bill Murray comedy, though, instead of ending each day after a full 24 hours, Cage's day must end with his death (much like Source Code). This reset-by-death brings a freedom to him that only comes from the knowledge that you can try it all again tomorrow. And this is where the real magic of the situation starts to change Cage and his approach to life and those around him, especially Rita. The confidence he has in confronting those things he's already done over and over again translates into an ability to more expertly deal with the situations that result from his success at getting closer to the goal. We can see that Rita has already reached this level of existence and is glad to have someone who understands.<br/><br/>The real reason we love a movie like this is because we like to imagine taking on every day as if we were an expert at that day. Surely some days feel monotonously like every other day and perhaps we'd like to imagine being put in a situation where we are forced to confront life with a different attitude. Whether or not every day of your life is just the repetition of a routine, the reality is that each day truly is an opportunity to make a world of difference, and just like Phil the weatherman in Puxatawney, PA, realizes the only one trapping you in life is yourself, Cage comes to take control. In the third act the certainty of his regeneration comes into question and the lasting nature of the decisions he makes sets in, but he has a new perspective with which to make them.<br/><br/>The action is straightforward with no shaky-cam because the story demands you know what's happening. The editing style is quick, avoiding the need to repeat sections of the day beyond what is necessary, while rarely devolving into an extensive montage, which the film could easily do. The audience isn't always told which iteration of the day Cage is experiencing and so you're never sure if this is the first or the fifteenth time he's been in this situation until you see it play out. Both Cruise and Blunt play their characters supremely well with convincing chemistry and earnestness."
"robertbell84","8","0","2","30 June 2014"," Better than Groundhog Day?
","Not really, because other than the idea that both films are based around the idea of the lead character living the same day over and over they are very different films. <br/><br/>While not the biggest Tom Cruise fan as late, I did like MI4 but really didn't like Jack Reacher (insert your own joke here) I was very surprised how much I liked TC in this film. Without giving away too much, Mr. Cruise finds the power in which he may be able to win the war against an alien force (in which we don't learn too much about) but what we do know is that Cruise has a great arc and there are a few surprises along his journey. <br/><br/>If you are a sci-fi fan this is a must see. The most surprising thing of all is what a great Director Doug Liman has become, from Swingers he's come along way baby. <br/><br/>See for the effects, story and great characters."
"rjsf96","8","0","2","30 June 2014"," A Summer Blockbuster with Brawn and Brains
","On paper Edge of Tomorrow does not sound so special - it would seem to be a retread of other films. It is in basic terms another action vehicle for Tom Cruise to hold upon his shoulders as the lead. What sets it apart from it's adversaries is that it is incredibly unique and wholly its own. The director - Doug Liman of The Bourne Identity fame creates a film that has an intricate, complex and compelling structure. <br/><br/>We see Cruise as Major William Cage a member of the United Defence Forces who is called to London to meet with the general; whom states his intention to combat what is known as an alien race called Mimics who have taken over the majority of Europe. The General tells Cage he will be leading the other soldiers of the Unit to war. Cage refuses and well you can guess what happens. Stripped of his rank he is sent on the eve of the battle to an operating base and the following day bloodshed ensues. Cage dies and mysteriously reawakens at the operating base the previous day. He dies and is reborn, again and again and again. Each time trying to learn from his mistakes and help the soldiers win the war. <br/><br/>In this sense the film resembles a well worn concept, which has helped many films out in the past - that of repeating a particular incident, until it is done correctly. Films such as Groundhog Day and Source Code. It is refreshing because this could easily have been a cash grab, depriving teenage boys of their pocket money until the next Transformers flick hits the big screen. It is to my absolute delight and extreme pleasure that I can say this is not at all the case here. The concept is given a fresh, invigorating use which is not wasted. It turns it inside out and makes it as good as if not better than the films mentioned above. <br/><br/>It could have turned out as messy as Bay's ill favoured franchise if it was not for the clever, witty script that relishes giving its characters and Cruise's in particular that key human element, which without it the film would be lost. Also deserving of merit is the narrative structure which worms its way in and out often looping back upon itself and shaking the audience with anticipation, every twist and turn it throws at them. <br/><br/>The action is exhilarating and is bound to keep your pulse pounding until the credits roll. You can actually tell what is going on! Which in the 21st century is something of a marvel when one considers how many action films are littered with poor editing and bad framing of shots. Liman knows how to direct a great action film and all that is here showcases his talent for the genre and knack for it all. <br/><br/>The film knows what it is to feel alive, making it feel fresh and brand new. Cruise and his eventual trainer played with the required fierceness and stunning dedication to the role by Blunt is one of the key elements to elevating this film above the likes of an average action flick. They both own their roles and you can completely buy their character's continuing development and feelings throughout. <br/><br/>Liman proves that an action blockbuster can have brawn, brains and a human heart. This is no small feat considering the mostly lifeless and soulless work that is on offer all the time at your local cinema. Take this lively reinvention of the genre as to what the director can achieve and the possibilities seem endless. How Liman will top this is anybody's guess - but I for one will be there at the front of the queue as soon as he is helming another action film."

","It was a reasonably entertaining flick and the 32 ounce IPA I bought at the theater certainly helped. The special effects were excellent but the movie wasn't entirely focused on eye candy - maybe 80% of it was. Tom Cruise seemed uncomfortably convincing playing the role of a sniveling coward and a much younger man. I thought Emily Blunt's performance was good. Its hard enough accepting naked time traveling tentacled spinning monsters with lights coming out of their gaping mouths yet Ms. Blunt did a not too awful job convincing me that a 5'7"" skinny well manicured babe is the baddest soldier on the battlefield. Is anyone else sick of Hollywood's insidious need to impose their PERVERTED POLITICS on us? I'm surprised they didn't mention global warming or sneak a Prius in some of the screen shots. I thought the ending was totally predictable but I wasn't disappointed by it. <br/><br/>I only gave it a 6 because they shouldn't get credit for the excellent beer I drank during the movie."

"lothos-370-690020","Null","0","2","21 June 2014"," Good start, Good start, Good start, let down ending
","Roger Ebert once said ""games will never be art"", I would argue that films like this prove that most mainstream films don't qualify as art. The only surprise was how quickly the film did a 180 and went from a potentially new and interesting character for Cruise and a reversal of the hero heroin roles. There are plenty of examples in both the film and game world where, a successful endeavour spawns hundreds of cheap ripoffs, Edge at least has the distinction of not being cheap. <br/><br/>Acting is fine, special effects are indeed special, but what I went looking for quickly descended into mediocrity and playing it safe. The film starts well, Cruise for once, isn't the typical hero, he is more an anti hero, I was expecting something intelligent from Hollywood for once, perhaps finally 14 years into the 21st century we might have a mainstream film where the male lead is rescued by the female lead, but looking back, I realise how incredibly naive that was, and I strongly suspect it will never happen. Given a choice main stream media will always choose the safe option, for fear of loosing money. Despite the fact that films make the vast majority of their money in the first few weeks of release, and most people make their choice to see or buy regardless of other peoples opinion, so a risk wouldn't really be a risk.<br/><br/>Despite this fact Edge ticks all the obligatory boxes, big name actor check, big budget check, special effects fest check, but a real opportunity for Cruise and main stream film making to challenge and grow was missed. Instead of an anti hero who has to rely on the woman, Cruise becomes the typical action man character he's always portrayed. Instead of a strong female lead that who isn't eclipsed by her co star, she's there as love interest. The biggest let down was the last 20 minutes, where the matrix ripoffs came thick and fast. Plot descended quickly between expendable extras who presence was barely needed, Cruise suddenly able to take bone crushing, organ squishing injuries in his stride, and the female lead deciding hes the one for her despite them only just having met. The ending made no sense and felt like the story had been rewritten to incorporate a happy ending that was never intended in the original script. The one thing that elevated it, was the script, good writing, with a few laughs and well rounded characters kept my interest, and it was only in the last few minutes of the film that this too lost credibility.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel more let down because of the great start and great writing, which lifted my expectations. If the film hadn't relied so heavily on clichés and unoriginal choices towards the end this could have been a great film. If anyones listening, how about a directors cut, with an ending that better reflects the reality portrayed in the first half of the film."

","I really wanted to like this film and I did, just not as much as I wanted to.<br/><br/>It is solid and apart from a section in the middle when it bogs down a bit is very entertaining.<br/><br/>Slight spoiler follows.....<br/><br/>The ending is actually quite clever but only if you actually think about it, on the surface it comes across as a typical pat Hollywood ending. I think this has probably hurt the film a bit in reviews as most audience members won't bother to think it through and understand it.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a look but maybe wait for DVD."
"aquilario-434-927602","5","0","5","20 June 2014"," Groundhog day meets The Matrix
","Edge of tomorrow (EOT) is ""Groundhog day"" meets ""The Matrix"". The whole first half felt as if I were playing and arcade video game: learning by heart (by rote, actually) the routine of the game in order to remain alive, which means trying again and again. Although this may seem potentially discouraging, the film keeps a good pace, and the constant repetition that ex-Major Cage has to put up and come to terms with allows him for some funny, witty lines and scenes. Suspension of disbelief is of the utmost importance in order to keep up with the plot. How else can the viewer give credit to Dr. Carter's wisdom and prescience concerning the Omega's behavior? Notwithstanding this, I was quite skeptical about the first spot where the Omega is looked for. I do not know such snowy mountain ranges in England, or in Scotland, for that matter – the Ben Nevis, which is located in the north of Scotland, is the highest peak in Great Britain, however it does not look like anything as the Omega's supposedly first hiding place. The battleground scenes are certainly spectacular, however, I was slightly put off by the Mimics' looks, which made me feel at times I was once again confronting the sentinels of The Matrix. All in all this is a rather entertaining (I did doze every now and then) and very complicated love story between two characters who happen to live some excruciatingly complicated circumstances. Finally, I will grant the Omega this: he knows where to choose a fine hiding place."
"urx100","9","0","2","19 June 2014"," Live.Die.Reinvent
","On behalf of a huge sci-fi community I would like to CALL OUT to Mr.Liman and ask could it be POSSIBLE for ONCE in movie-making HISTORY to LIVE.DIE and REINVENT the third act just for the pleasure of all movie geeks out there who are so desperately seeking for Sci-Fi Gems that truly satisfy until the end credits start to roll. <br/><br/>I am no filmmaker, but as a movie fan I can tell that this movie really deserved to treat its main antagonists and protagonists in a much more sophisticated way, especially towards the end. And for that reason I feel that I - Mr.Nobody vs the Hollywood - have the responsibility to shout out my vision of how the events should have unfolded in the third act. <br/><br/>Call them pick-ups if you will. The point is that no film is truly finished until you do not feel it in your heart. Best example would be a certain Oscar winning fantasy trilogy that went back to the studio for more filming as the dust from the award ceremony was still settling. Clearly the result was even more pleasing for all sides and the extended story allowed the director to remain true to his vision. <br/><br/>But before I jump into that there are some thoughts I would like to get off my chest. The main thing that bothers me with the third act is how typical and rushed it all feels. Hijacking a single transport-helicopter-thing and successfully navigating its way into deep enemy territory without a single enemy sighting and even reaching the Omega without any need for live.die.repeat sounds just tooooooooooooo easy especially if for the first two thirds of the movie the antagonists bombed planes out of the sky, while plotting and planning their socks off in order to annihilate the whole human race, hell it was pretty clear that they had lots of experience on doing this world conquering stuff before. <br/><br/>So to put it Bluntly, just Cruising to Louvre seemed to feel as the screenplay lost all of its RESPECT towards the seasoned movie viewers and their ability to think intelligently. I really believed that this could become as legendary a film as the Terminator if it would hold up until the end <br/><br/>For clarity I would like to point out that my proposed ending is not meant to be THE Best. Still I believe it is a good starting point for reinventing an ending that respects the best episodes of a visionary sci-fi show such as ""Outer Limits"", where you cannot be quite sure what the future holds, while Hope for a better tomorrow still lingers on. And for me this is more human than a typical kill-the-monster-leave-the-cinema-think-of-dinner type of closure. For the record, I truly believe that with a bolder and wiser ending this movie has what it takes to be a rare find, a true Sci-Fi Legend. <br/><br/>I can truly say that I was in awe of the clever storytelling put forward by the acting, screenplay, camera-work and editing up until our protagonists were left unconscious in a wrecked car somewhere in the streets of London. From that point on what it all boils down to is this, Cage and Rita know that their only advantage over defeating the mimics is gone so they are left with the option to sob like little babies until the mimics reach London and they die an agonizing death OR they try to reclaim the power of resetting the day and still die and agonizing death as we all witnessed when Cage committed the first suicide attack on an Alpha. During the movie the glowing blue monstrosity borrowed screen time at least in two occasions, in beaches of Normandy and in the mountains somewhere in Germany. Now the latter is a tricky one to consider as Cage lost its powers, so the ambush is probably not there anymore, this is backed up also by Rita's close ""miss"" in a different location altogether. So again we're off to the sunny beaches of France. As the movie is based on repetition I do not see any harm in hopping on the same ride to Normandy one last time as the stakes for our protagonists have changed quite a bit from the beginning of the movie. Then they were both hopelessly outgunned and with no real agenda other than try to stay alive, but now they are a deadly strike-force with a do-or-die attitude on a suicide mission to save the human race. Using Rita's words of a one-way ticket I would boldly go for the grand failure of the suicide mission, spiced up with a twist where Cage dies while trying to prevent an Alpha from being hit from a distance with Rita not in position to be covered by the blue goo. This glitch would ultimately get also Rita killed by the Alpha and as the screen goes black making us think that it's all over it suddenly jumps back into life with screams as a soldier is woken up from a nightmare where he/she starts wildly to scratch his/her face as to get rid of something that was stuck on it. Screen turns to black, end credits roll, and yeah even the original song can play on. <br/><br/>So as you quite possibly guessed, the soldier was killed and got some neat reset powers as a bonus, meaning also that the war continues in another loop, with a possibility that this soldier finds Cage and Rita or not. Hope lingers, but the ending allows us to think of our own solution to the war, or even wait for a bloody sequel <br/><br/>Dear Mr. Liman I truly believed that your time as an independent filmmaker would give you the Edge on finding a truly sharp and unique way to finish the film. After reading this I wonder Could you and Will you Reinvent?"

","That was my next to reflex reaction when reading the basic plot summery. So with some trepidations I decided to give it a shot and despite the fact that I think the ending is too Hollywoodian, I still find the film to be of a very high quality. It starts by presenting the leading character as a complete jerk (not to use stronger language), and I was really thinking, here goes another Groundhog Day, well I was wrong. It has a surprisingly solid plot, with solid movie reasoning, nothing is in the story without a purpose, and every minute on screen makes sense. This fact by itself, elevates the movie by a notch or two. The acting is superb, and Tom Cruise does deserves better recognition for his talents. Emily Blunt is even better, and both Brendan Gleeson and Bill Paxton are perfect in their roles. But the entire film simply leaves no plot holes I can think about, and for me that's a real refreshing change. When everything else is keeping up with the plot - that is, the characters, the acting the pacing the CG, well I thought it almost deserved another ending and I would've given it a perfect 10. But as it is, 9 will have to do."

","What if, in an almost video-game-like fashion, a soldier could respawn after death over and over again and relive the same day? Surely, he would learn and alter the events over and over, and continuously hone his skills until victory is achieved. Based on the Japanese novel All You Need is Kill, this film brings this unique premise to life on the big screen.<br/><br/>The film wastes little time in the set-up, before the big battles commence that pit armored men against crazy tentacled aliens. It is a pretty hectic and hard-hitting struggle as is. You'd think these scenes would get repetitive if the main character keeps having to relive this, but the film keeps the backtracking short, so that it always explores new directions in the narrative. As a result, the action remains frequent, but is always varied. All the different tangents lead to a suspenseful and satisfying finale.<br/><br/>Given the film's premise, it is an inherently interesting idea. It probably could have come off as generic, clichéd, or repetitive in lesser hands. Fortunately, the story is well-built and well-told in this film, not only because it keeps things brisk and varied, but also because it has endearing characters and a strong attention to detail. There are a few instances where I questioned the plausibility of certain things, but it doesn't stop the plot from holding up.<br/><br/>The film features good and straightforward photography. Editing is pretty good, especially in the way it can string together multiple recurrences of a scene (to show progress, or sometimes for humor when the character dies a stupid death). Acting is not bad; Tom Cruise isn't always endearing to watch, but he does have moments that help us sympathize with his situation. Emily Blunt delivers a solid performance. Everybody else is alright. Writing is not bad. This production has pretty good and gritty-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Locales are surprisingly interesting. Music is alright (the end credits song seems out of place though).<br/><br/>This is kinda like what you get if you cross The Source Code with the Resistance: Fall of Man video game. It's a pretty solid piece of military sci-fi that's certainly better than average, offering its fair share of intriguing storytelling and rip-roaring action.<br/><br/>Recommended!<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)"

","All of the ideas in the film are familiar and repeatedly used before in major Hollywood film but director Doug Liman has done a mix and match brilliantly by adapting from the original novel and then recombining the elements from The Source Code with alien invasion into something refreshing which audiences have not seen for a long time throughout the cinematic experience. While it starts off a bit slow with the usual style of mission impossible and a little bit of video game effects, it builds into a cool and thrilling adventure thanks to the great inspiring yet emotional chemistry between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. With addition of some smart dark humors, chilling action scenes, strong scores and stunning visual effects during repetitive death/ life, the film has turned out as a successful and entertaining science fiction for this summer."

","I didn't know what to expect from this movie, and I've seen a few ""time-loop"" kind of movies so it wasn't that shocking of a thing. This movie wasn't extraordinarily different than those other ones, but I really liked it. I have nothing bad to say about it.<br/><br/>At first, things were moving kind of slow, I was a bit confused, and it seemed kind of plain. But along the course of events, characters show more depth and the movie gets more interesting, which is what to be expected in a movie!<br/><br/>While I was watching it I wasn't really judging the production of the film, but rather just watching, paying attention, and enjoying it. However, looking back at it, I do think it was nicely executed! The story was nicely told. I did find myself full of suspense at some points and invested in the characters. The actors did great jobs! <br/><br/>For the storyline, I kind of expected that kind of storyline. As events unraveled, I just predicted some things. For me, it wasn't completely like ""woah so unexpected"" but it wasn't boring or generic. They also pulled out some things that made me go ""WAIT WHAT."" So I'd say it was pretty enticing. <br/><br/>This movie left me satisfied and happy with everything. It's not one of those movies that I super duper love and keep it close to my heart or anything, but I did really like it and have nothing bad to say about it!"
"beeblebrox-2","8","0","2","15 June 2014"," Even better than I expected, and I expected quite a bit
","I had expected ""Edge of Tomorrow"" to be good based on a certain level of buzz I'd heard (something I typically try to avoid since I prefer to go into the theater with an objective eye). But what I didn't see coming, was for it to exceed what expectations I did have. This is way more than an action SF film. <br/><br/>Indeed, this is as much a science fiction mystery/war drama as anything. The story has plenty of action to help sell it for international audiences but the plot development is clever and subverts expectations resulting from audience familiarity with Groundhog Day. How it subverts those expectations would be a spoiler but suffice to say that writer, Christopher McQuarrie, builds a very sophisticated approach to the time loop concept that Groundhog Day never explored. <br/><br/>Cruise carries the film with a performance that reminded me of his efforts in Vanilla Sky (probably his best acting ever) and Minority Report. He has to evolve as a character through the course of the film and does so believably. <br/><br/>Of course, Cruise has had a series of exceptional outings over the last few years with MI:3, Valkyrie, MI: Ghost Protocol, Jack Reacher, and Oblivion. Those well-considered script choices over the last decade (with the exception of Lions For Lambs and Knight and Day) are reason enough to check out EoT. But if you need another excuse: Emily Blunt. She and Cruise develop a special chemistry despite the compressed time-frame the movie has to work inside of. <br/><br/>The dramatic elements were well written and acted, the SF mystery components were air tight, the time loop aspects were masterfully executed, and the boy/girl story was surprisingly poignant. <br/><br/>Then there was the action. What I especially liked about these sequences were that they moved the story along instead of being the typical Hollywood action set pieces that play out nonsensically in recent films like Transformers [# take your pick], Iron Man 3, The Hobbit: DoS, or Godzilla. Rather, here we see battle scenes in a war and these scenes are necessary to advance the plot (rather than bring it to a halt).<br/><br/>A final thought; it's not giving anything away to say that the Cruise character, Cage, dies several times during the course of the story. Those deaths are NOT funny and many are tragic. But for some reason, several immature people in the theater audience laughed out loud at those moments, even though they were never played for laughs. If you have not seen the film, I recommend it highly but please don't laugh in inappropriate places in the film. Other people will think you're an imbecile. Thanks in advance and enjoy!"
"Bart-1992","8","0","2","15 June 2014"," Just an enjoyable action movie
","Edge of Tomorrow is not a very good movie. But that's fine. It isn't trying to be. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it doesn't pretend otherwise. The movie is just fun, a nice way to to spend two hours. And ultimately, it's a hell of a lot better than Cruise's previous not-so-nice-to-mankind-future movie Oblivion. <br/><br/>The storyline is not too difficult. There are evil creatures, they are spreading and we, men, have to kill them or they will kill us. There's nothing else for it really; the movie doesn't bore us with a painfully unrealistic explanation about how and why the creatures came, what their purpose is and why they are hostile. They just are, and I quite liked that approach. Furthermore, we have a time loop, in which the protagonist relives the same day over and over again and improves his skills by doing so. Not new, not original (Groundhog Day!) but it's handled well and the results are quite funny. <br/><br/>The one big mistake in the movie is the ending, which is, I have to agree with some of the other contributers, quite cheap and disappointing. Other then that, it's a fine movie and well worth your time. Nothing is wrong with the acting, with Cruise at strength and Blunt keeping up nicely. The casting directors gambled, giving Blunt the role as female lead action hero, but they gambled well. The movie also contains quite a bit of humour and the special effects are done nicely.<br/><br/>I give this movie a solid 7 out of 10. It's not great, there's no message, but with a fistful of popcorn it is a rather great way to spend some spare time."

It's got a good plot, action, humor, intense, fun, and solid performances! The performances by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are what drives this movie to enjoy it and feel connected to the characters. Don't watch the trailers if you haven't, because they give a different vibe and perception of the entire movie. When you have watched them, you'll think that it's another Oblivion. or a mix of Groundhog Day and Source code. That's what I was thinking when I saw the trailers. But I can tell you that It's not. Sure it has the elements of those mentioned movies, but you will be surprised when you see it. It's not a masterpiece, but it's fresh, fun and great to enjoy. Go see this great film in theaters.

","Edge of Tomorrow centers around Major William Cage (Cruise) who, after dying in battle fighting alien creatures called Mimics, begins to relive the same day over and over. But, when Rita Vrataski (Blunt) reveals one the battlefield to Cage that she knows more about what's happening to him than he does, they work together through the ""resets"" to try and stop the Mimics from wiping out humanity.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow isn't a completely original story, but how it's crafted and written is very original, as is the take on the time-travel-like premise. Doug Liman's direction is easily his best by far, constantly changing the tone from light-hearted fun & action to deep, emotion- driven conflict. The very first battle sequence when the troops land on the beach is absolutely breath-taking, and mirrors that of Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' with horrific accuracy. The performances by all the actors and actresses were amazing, but with our two leads obviously stealing the show whenever they're on screen. The chemistry between Cruise and Blunt is fantastic, and you feel attached to both characters within seconds of them meeting each other. The script was great, blending gritty, phenomenal action scenes with hart-felt emotion and laughs. That's right, genuine comedy is thrown into the mix of jaw- dropping action and visuals, of which deserve multiple awards. The creature design of the Mimics alone deserves multiple wins; they're honestly on my Top 3 most frightening alien creatures in film. The cinematography is wonderful, the musical score is fitting and worth a stand-alone listen, and the film overall is an epic feat of brilliant story-telling. I personally just wished the ending was a bit deeper and more emotionally satisfying, but since it was a definite ending, i still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow was not just an amazing movie, but honestly a kind of experience. I felt like i was with Cage the entire time, going through the same horrific day. I felt his pain and frustration during training, going from a coward to a battle-hardened warrior; Cruise proves once again he's one of the best actors of our time, and Emily Blunt one of the best actresses of our time. I really hope Cruise and Blunt work together again, because they were so brilliant together."

","As a great fan of movies, I watched many of the popular ones this summer. I had high hopes for Godzilla but I dozed off in that one. then I watched X-men and I dozed off as well. Maybe it's just me or me getting older, but i like my movies with action and some thought. edge of tomorrow delivered on those two. i maybe bias since i have always been a fan of tom cruise action movies and i really hate when people just want to see a man fail. so i went and supported tom and saw this movie. It's a really fun ride. be it action scenes or talking scenes, you are never really ""bored."" in the movie, the conversation was smart and the action/cgi felt very realistic. it kept the audience involved in the plot. you care what happens to tom and emily. and i think that's where it really delivers. you have an action movie but you care about the action that is taking place to the characters and between the characters because the conversation and chemistry between the two characters are realistic. so bravo to the movie and tom cruise! yes, i know this movie did not make a gazillion dollars in the first weekend but i am optimistic that it will have legs. i have been a fan of IMDb since I was in college (ie 10 years ago) and visit this site so so frequently (maybe too much). This was my first movie review post. And main reason why is because there are a lot of cynics out in the world that become ""happy"" when they see others fail. I know some people do not like Tom Cruise and everyone is entitled to their own opinions. But there is such frenzy in the media to want to see Tom fail and I think that is really unhealthy for a person and society. Okay, apologize for my rant, movie is good. go watch it!"

","Edge Of Tomorrow is one of the best movies of the summer so far... It has great elements adding up to equal a great movie. Acting was not an issue at all, Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt did a tremendous job in this movie. I am usually not a fan of futuristic kind of movies, but it had great suspense like in Source Code and some comedy like Groundhog Day. It had great action scenes featuring aliens that were WAY cooler than the aliens in Tom Cruise's 'War of the Worlds'. If you like plenty of suspense, action sequences, aliens, explosions... then you're in for a treat with this one. I would go see it, it's not as bad as you may think.

"siderite","8","0","2","14 June 2014"," Between brilliant and dumb
","It is difficult for me to rate this film. First of all it is well acted and with decent special effects. The idea is interesting even if not terribly original and the film is well made. However, the movie has the problems commonly associated with ""Groundhog Day"" movies: it has to show you the repetition in time of certain events, even if you got the idea from the first two shots. All the time paradoxes are, again, an issue in cases like this. Then it has the problems commonly associated with invasion movies: aliens are immensely powerful, but childish in their intelligence, feral and inhuman and impossible to communicate with in a decent manner and they also have some common source of their power which can be destroyed so they would be defeated. Don't worry, I am not spoiling anything, you know everything I just wrote from the first quarter of the film, but you still have to watch the rest of the film to actually see it.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, a well made film that brings almost nothing new to the table. Based on the level of the details that you like, you can make the story into a small episode in a series, a movie or an entire season of something, however the basic premise and what you effectively learn from it remains the same. It left me with a strange feeling because I both enjoyed it pretty much, but I also got that nasty cliché feeling all the time while seeing it.<br/><br/>I recommend it, but don't expect too much."
"alishahmohd","9","0","2","14 June 2014"," Great Sci-Fi movie and good performance from Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt
","Edge of Tomorrow is a really fun Sci-Fi flick, which offers both excitement, it will have you hooked to your seat from the beginning to the end and it also has good humor and many funny scenes. But that is not all this film also has some really good action sequences, along with an interesting and intriguing storyline. A guy is reliving 24 hours of his life again, again and again, because when he dies the day the resets, and he wakes up in the camp where he was 24 hours earlier having already witnessed everything before.<br/><br/>I am always fascinated by Sci-Fi movies which are based on around time travel, Back to the Future I is one of my favorite films ever, its sequels while not living up to the original were still fun to watch, there are also many other good films based on time travel like Groundhog Day, Source Code and Looper. There are others in which the time travel concept existed but grew tiresome or was just not that interesting, films like Peggy Sue got married, Time Machine (2002) and Midnight in Paris are films based on time travel that failed to hold my interest. Fortunately Edge of tomorrow ranks among the former not the latter and is one of the best films released in 2014 so far.<br/><br/>Many actions scenes are brilliantly shot, the fight scenes between the army and the mimics are really well done, the dialog has humor and also carries the plot forward. Tom Cruise is fantastic as Officer Cage, he performs many great action sequences, provides humor to the film and also helps carry the film, Blunt serving as the female lead and his Love Interest also does an excellent job. Blunt's role as Sergeant Vrataski is that of hardened female soldier, who single handedly killed many many mimics in the battle of Verdun she is not your typical female in action films who needs the hero to protect her, she is fighting soldier, Blunt also trained hard for this role and she delivered. The supporting cast is good, it was awesome to see Bill Paxton in this film and the scenes between him and Cruise were really good. The actors who played the J Squad also do a great job.<br/><br/>The film's premise about Cruise knowing all of his friends for hundreds of days and them barely knowing him ads a lot to the film and also made the angle between Cage and Rita Vrataski more than your average love angle and also made for some interesting interactions between them. I also applaud the attention to the detail in this movie, many scenes that are repeated are 100% accurate to the last dialog, watching these scenes unfold again and again also makes this film more intriguing. The sound effect and music is also good and suits the film.<br/><br/>My minor problems would be that the film starts to drag a little in the middle before Rita and Cage make it to farmhouse, the movie then once again picks up after the farmhouse scene, also seems like by the end the film started skipping many important loops, for example, Cage having already been at the farmhouse before many times, when we first saw him there, he had already been at the General's office many times, when we saw him go there with Rita. This kind of creates some ambiguity and confusion and I feel this film should have at least added some quick scenes of Page's earlier visits to the general's office and the farmhouse rather than just showing the scenes in which he actually succeeds, it would have added to the movie in my opinion. <br/><br/>I have a mixed opinion about the ending firstly, it kind of leaves you hanging about the relationship between Cage and Rita, leaves you hanging on the edge of the final battle between Mimics and the soldiers in France, it is also one of those cliché endings where nobody really dies, and everybody is happy, but at least they did not go all the way and have Page and Rita reunite share a passionate kiss at the end of the movie that would have been so cliché, instead they just cut to the credits at their final meeting. Perhaps Page sacrificing himself or somehow surviving and waking up in a hospital bed and being declared a hero would have been a better. But maybe thats the point of the movie to leave you hanging and thinking what is going to happen tomorrow and creating some ambiguity, leaving room for interpretations rather than providing a straightforward ending. <br/><br/>Overall Edge of tomorrow is a great action flick, which will keep you on the Edge of your seat from it's start to it's finish, i am shocked to see Cruise in such a great action film at this stage in his career, this is a film which offers humor, entertainment, good acting and storyline, even if you did not read the book, you will find this film entertaining. One of the best films of 2014, and a must watch."
"isabelle-frater","8","0","2","14 June 2014"," A good take on Groundhog's Day
","This movie is like a sci-fi Groundhog's Day in many regards. I have been a great fan of the formula. Especially in the 90s, it was sort of required that every TV show has it. Xena, Stargate SG-1, Buffy are some memorable examples. The formula is this: a person gets stuck in a time loop for some reason. The only way he / she can get out of it is by solving why they got into the loop, and changing something about their life. It usually requires learning some new ability as well. A problem that this formula can have is that it becomes boring after a while. I remember that the Xena episode had this problem, because she was doing the same thing too much. Stargate changed this by putting some funny elements into it, like when O'Neil played golf at the Stargate. What this movie did to keep it from boring was the huge learning curve that Cage (Tom Cruise) went through, and his romance with Rita (Emily Blunt).<br/><br/>The story itself is not boring at all. From the trailer we can gather that it's about an alien invasion. We don't get to see the actual aliens for a while at the beginning, and the anticipation is a real adrenalin rush. The loops were done in an interesting way, and even a bit of humour was put into it. The explanation for the loop didn't seem too far fetched. In many regards, Cage is a classic Tom Cruise character. He flies a helicopter. He rides a bike. He has a gun. He wears a uniform. He broads in a pub with a drink. He is the hero. Cage does have character development, because while he starts out as a man concentrating on survival, he becomes someone who knows that sacrifice is the most likely outcome for the good of all. Rita is kick-ass character. I really loved her a lot, and Emily was great at it. I haven't seen her do an action movie before, okay, maybe Looper, but her character was different there. I really thought she stole the show for me.<br/><br/>Overall, a really enjoyable movie. It has some surprises that I didn't see coming, which is pretty unusual. I recommend it not just for sci-fi, but also plain action movie fans. The romance is not too much, barely there actually."

It is a great action movie, but with a very enjoyable touch of comedy, with many moments with humor. CGI top-notch, it never degrades tawdry. It is a science-fiction movie with a nice female hero,well played by Blunt (as usual, she is a guarantee in a movie), who is not backing somebody else. This is very refreshing. It is not a ""Cruise-movie"", even if he acts good, so do Paxton and Glesson.

"svanlijnden","8","0","2","14 June 2014"," All You Need is Tom Cruise?
","Edge of Tomorrow is based on a novel with the more oblique but interesting title All You Need is Kill. Aliens land on earth and seem hellbent on conquering the planet, wiping out humanity as they go. People fight back, but the enemy always knows their next move already and keeps pushing forward. Then something strange happens to the high- ranking Bill Cage (Tom Cruise). He keeps dying on the battlefield and reliving the same day over and over again. So, what's up with that, and can it help turn the tide against the invaders?<br/><br/>I don't know what the tone of the novel is, but the movie turns into a darkly comic SciFi-variation on Groundhog Day. It's not often that shooting your lead character in the head becomes a running joke. (The psychological fallout of getting violently killed again and again is not explored.) It's not all laughs however, the other frame of mind here is 'epic action movie'. The Grand Finale is a disappointment in that it overloads on fast-moving special effects shots, making the characters seems less like humans and more like sprites from a video game. It is still fairly tense because of the build-up before then, but it becomes clear that the laws of physics - and believability – have been suspended for the sake of spectacle. Something smarter and more low-key would have served the story better.<br/><br/>It's just as well that Cruise's character starts off as a douche and only gets sympathetic as the movie progresses. You don't have to like him at first, you can slowly work up to it. And Cruise does win you over – mostly - though I can think of a list of actors I would have preferred in the role. Emily Blunt makes for a charming leading lady, although her character is no lady, and all the better for it. The movie runs a bit long, taking its time to set up the Groundhog Day scenario, but stays interesting throughout. The internal logic makes less sense the more you think about it, particularly the reason behind the time reset and the way in which the aliens function. But despite this and despite an attack of the stoopids at the climax, the movie is definitely worth seeing. @PopCultJunk"

So far this and Lego movie are the best of 2014. I want to say very little about this movie. I'm sure, as you can tell from the preview and other people saying, it's like Groundhog Day meets blah blah blah or Groundhog day so and so. It has to do with time loop and aliens. Say what you want to about Tom Cruise, whether you love him or hate him, he gets some pretty good rolls. I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, but he's really good in this. My favorite is Emily Blunt, she is a force to be reckoned with. I've always been a fan of girls in movies who kick butt. This movie pulled me along so well. It was well edited. The pacing was perfect. Never once did I get bored. In fact towards the end, I was sad it was almost over. I wanted to see more details. I bet they had to shave off some really cool scenes. The 3D is some of the best I've seen in a while. It was funny. I laughed several times. The only awards it will ever win are technical awards. It might be nominated for sound.

","Taken from the novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, ""Edge Of Tomorrow"" is ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Source Code"" meets ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Starship Troopers"" with much of the structure and style of a video game. If that makes the movie sound derivative, it is - but it remixes these old elements in a flashy new style. The basic storyline is that Continental Europe has been taken over by metallic octopus things called 'mimics' that seem remarkably easy to kill one at a time but come in such numbers and farsightedness that the invasion of the French beaches by the UK-based United Defence Force fails and then fails again and then fails again ...<br/><br/>At the heart of the action is Tom Cruise as military PR man William Cage who - in a nice variation on his usual roles - wants nothing of this heroics thing. Whatever people say about Cruise, he is still a genuine star who carries any film in which he appears. This time, he has a strong female companion Rita Vrataski, the pin up soldier of the war, in the delightful shape of Emily Blunt who is rapidly acquiring star quality herself. She is really good and looks great dirty. The director is Doug Liman who gave us ""The Bourne Identity"" so the cutting is ferociously fast and furious.<br/><br/>It's all pretty ridiculous, with the repeated scenes and the frenetic editing verging on the irritating, but it's carried off with panache and pace and it's certainly so much better than Cruise's last sci-fi outing ""Oblivion"". From Cruise landing in a helicopter in the middle of London's Trafalgar Square, it looks and sounds terrific and I enjoyed it on a giant screen at the newly refurbished Empire cinema in London' Leicester Square."
"abouhelier-r","7","0","2","13 June 2014"," Edge Of Tomorrow
","An officer finds himself caught in a time loop in a war with an alien race. His skills increase as he faces the same brutal combat scenarios, and his union with a Special Forces warrior gets him closer and closer to defeating the enemy. <br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow is based on the novel All you need is kill written by Hiroshi Sakurazaka and also adapted as a manga by Ryousuke Takeuchi. This film is directed by Doug Liman, best known for Bourne Identity which I really loved back then. It was a very good franchise starter depending on Liman style. My biggest fear was that this style won't go that well with this type of sci-fi epic movie. But surprisingly I was wrong. Edge of Tomorrow has a very different style than Bourne, with long takes and big action shots. It's an non-stop action movie from beginning to end, as well as incredibly entertaining and at the same time very funny. The humorous is that he has to relive the same day over and over again. However they manage to keep it not repetitive at all, which is really hard especially with this kind of story lines. They make it feel new and in a solely different way each time. In fact, they found a good way to make those repetition scenes entertaining, by going for the comedy of the situation rather than for the drama. Plus, special effects are solid peculiarly the alien are looking great. Moreover, Tom Cruise delivers a good performance, he's funny and in the meantime sells the drama. I can't help myself to make the parallel with Oblivion as he's always committed to his action roles and always really good at it as well. There is a chemistry between him and Emily Blunt, who is also completely badass. However, when we start to think about it the unbelievable thing is that every time he's talking with her she knew him for a few hours so she can't really get to attached, but on the other hand Tom Cruise' character doesn't feel that way because he's met her many times and the viewers feel that way too; that's why we can fall into it easily. Finally, the suspense and tension of the third act is so palpable. Edge of Tomorrow is relevant for today's audience as it deals with the detachment from which we view war through today's media. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is a solid smartly constructed movie which feels refreshing, intriguing and reliable."

There's a double twist though: first, Cage is framed as a deserter and a low-ranking grunt, then, he becomes stuck in a time loop forcing him to relive the ruthless slaughter over and over again. There's a lot of reasons why this film might not have worked – the concept is ostensibly too similar to Source Code, director Doug Liman hasn't had a bona fide hit in years, Tom Cruise's star wattage is arguably waning – yet this is the best blockbuster of 2014 so far. The masterfully constructed action is surprisingly brutal and grimy, with Cruise's reluctant hero experiencing a whole gamut of vicious injuries and deaths, whilst the computer effects employed to bring the otherworldly creatures to life, in addition to augmenting the set pieces, are simply flawless. Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay (adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel ""All You Need is Kill"") doesn't quite reinvent the wheel as much as it just tweaks and perfects it, adding a few minor twists and turns to the already interesting concept to keep it fresh and unpredictable. Most impressive, however, is how the ""die to reset"" premise is mined for brilliantly shocking and macabre moments of laugh-out-loud humour, largely revolving around Cage's over ambitious attempts to change the course of his day(s). Cruise and Emily Blunt share a remarkable chemistry and subsequently make for a wonderfully against-type pairing; he initially being the useless, pompous prick needing to harden up and she being the badass warrior who can train him in the art of killing. There have been a few excellent blockbusters already this year, but this subversive, tense and exhilarating flick manages to edge out its competition."

","This movie is pure fun but also purely common. As a science fiction enthusiast I give applause to Cruise, lending his fame to the advancement of science fiction based movies, the ideas of a united humanity, though only produced consequently against a subdued violence against a more powerful alien life form. Visually you will be entertained through on screen jokes of the re-live factor as the movie premise, humored as well by the rapture of Emily Blunt fresh take and salvaging betrayal of action star warrior galore. However passed the reoccurring nightmare that is Major William Cage, the theme of war amongst extra-terrestrial life as seen here, Cruise's Oblivion, War of the Worlds, film again, focuses on the uninteresting, personal journey of Cage accepting truth that we are not alone in the face of annihilation. It would be nice perhaps a bit inventive, to see a science fiction movie return to its glory beyond the scope of war solely as human inevitable fight for existence and enter the realm of creativity, examinations of enlightened sentient being outside the arena of the nostalgia gun blazing, tiring struggle, fight, and conquer. See Contact, Jupiter Ascending Trailer, Interstellar."

","I WANTED this movie to be great, as it was my most anticipated movie of this season. It did not disappoint. A very interesting story and plot device gave way to a ""Groundhog Day"" effect that worked well and was engaging as well as surprising. Going through the day the first time once with Cage (Tom Cruise) is interesting because you know you are going to experience many different facets and viewpoints of this day throughout the movie and upon doing so, it was very entertaining and amusing to me. I didn't know what to expect from the antagonists, and although nothing too creative or new is present here with the aliens. You don't get a view of them for a while, and you don't get many views, but it's also not a horribly cheesy addition to the film. The creative time/alien part of the film has some flaws, but if you don't over think it and can suspend reality for a bit, you should not be disappointed."
"georgecoffeynewyorker","5","0","6","7 June 2014"," Quite unusual; Simple but Compelx
","Well what to say about this film. I was previously advised it had mixed reviews. My friend Eoghan said it was brill and to go and see it. IT was on my to see list. Personally, I found the film to be quite unusual. In that it kept going back and forward. There was a bit of comic. The plot was actually quite simple but at the same time, quite complex if you didn't follow it. The plot from what I could gather was that the General(Gleeson), sent Cage(Cruise) on a mission ie on a war to kill the aliens. However when Cage arrived, he was DEMOTED ie was made out to be a soldier instead of a Brigadier or whatever they call themselves. A series of events occurred. The tagline of the trailer LIVE, DIE, REPEAT was defo in the whole line of the movie. Cage Lived, was Killed and then Repeat. It was then found thou, that the reason all of the repetitions was actually to kill the main source of the enemy the Omar which is the brains of the Aliens. The Aliens have invaded the Earth, from Paris, to London, Berlin , etc., etc., So in order to contain or more so kill em,, Cage(Crusie) and the female character - of which I cannot remember the name(Blunt) had to join forces eventually and head would you believe it to the Louvre Museum - Paris, France and submerge and blow up the Omar ie the brains. Overall it was an alrite movie. I probably would go and see it again. But as much as say Dark Knight Rises or seeing my son Godzilla - NO WAY IN HELL. hahaha."
"rtb1961","Null","0","2","9 June 2014"," A Little Militarily Clumsy
","Where the logic of this movie collapses as an all out war between Aliens and the Earth involving the US and it's allies, Russia and it's allies and China and it's allies, is the complete absence of Russia and China in the movie beyond minor mentions, thus tending to create a lack of depth in this conflict. Next up of course was a complete and total lack of fire support in the movie, no tanks, no helicopter gunships, no fighters, no bombers and, no artillery. This is the second battle, Verdun being the first just barely mentioned, which they apparently won but yet a sea and airborne invasion is required, so they must have lost since. Obviously this was done to accommodate the plot to focus upon specific individuals within the story rather than having them disappear with in mechanised, support and air combat. Unfortunately this tends to distort and shrink the conflict, so no longer a final major battle for the earth but more a smaller battle involving direct infantry conflict in non-protective power assist suits (I assume the suits lack armour so that you can see the actors better). This of course enables the movie to be stretched out rather than having an artillery, missile, fighter bomber assault upon the appropriate target, one tiny tactical nuke and it's all over and it allows the bad guy aliens to run around viscously stabbing things with their tentacles. Basically Battle for Los Angeles meets ground hog day. Beyond that not to badly done with good special effects, reasonable acting and, reasonable writing."

","For those of you who've read the synopsis of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and are wondering ""Why would I waste my time with one more dystopian future sci-fi movie which seems to be a barefaced mix-up of ""Groundhog Day"", ""Source Code"" and ""Starship Troopers?"", one piece of advice: break through your initial resistance and go check it out. You'll be surprised.<br/><br/>In spite of the film's deja vu premise, the masterly direction by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity), the extremely well-knit screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects), Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's 2004 novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" and, last but not the least, the smart edition work by James Herbert makes ""Edge of Tomorrow"" unique, and, at some extent, even better than those aforesaid movies that have influenced its plot. Tom Cruise, in his second sci-fi feature in a row (he was in last year's ""Oblivion""), is Major Willian Cage, in an incontrovertibly convincing performance, to the chagrin of his haters, and a ever-so-dazzling Emily Blunt plays legendary super-soldier Rita Vrataski (a.k.a ""Full-Metal Bitch"", lol!), a character who partly steals the show. To boot, we have Bill Paxton, who I always deemed as only an average actor, playing Cage's Commanding Officer in a very outstanding role.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow's action is guaranteed to keep you on edge and clutching your seat all along. The story won't let your interest subside, anticipating the outcome. I can say, this is sheer entertainment!"

"estebangonzalez10","8","0","2","8 June 2014"," The Groundhod Day for Sci-fi fans is here
","""Come find me when you wake up!""<br/><br/>With the releases of Days of Future Past, Godzilla, and now Edge of Tomorrow, I have to admit this Blockbuster season has delivered more than what I was expecting. Many have claimed this film has put Tom Cruise back on top, but I couldn't necessarily make that claim considering I have enjoyed all his latest movies (Oblivion, Jack Reacher, and Ghost Protocol), but I will admit this was another great performance. This time he gets to play a very different character, one who is kind of a wuss and who is forced to train really hard to become a soldier. Emily Blunt is also great as her sidekick and delivers yet another strong and memorable performance. She also has an impressive filmography in a wide range of genres. It is impossible to avoid comparisons with Groundhog Day considering the premise of this film, and that is one film that is hard to live up to, but Edge of Tomorrow takes that clever premise and mixes it with sci-fi action perfectly. This is one of those rare action movies you won't want to miss on the big screen, and one of the few alien invasion movies that truly work. I can't think of a more entertaining experience when it comes to a clever sci-fi film and unfortunately there haven't been many over the past few years, but Edge of Tomorrow has come to save the genre. Director, Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr and Mrs. Smith), has made an action packed film with a clever and funny script. <br/><br/>The script was adapted by Christopher McQuarrie (Academy award winner for The Usual Suspects) and Jez Butterworth from the Japanese novel ""All You Need is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. The story is set in the near future after an alien invasion has taken place across Europe. All military efforts against these aliens referred to as Mimics have been useless as they have nearly destroyed the entire continent. Fortunately for the humans, a recent victory in Verdun through new mechanized suits worn by the soldiers has given them new hope. A UK Special Forces Soldier named Sgt. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) was credited for killing hundreds of Mimics that day and has become the new hero. Taking advantage of this momentum, the Commander of the Western allies, General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson), plans a final surprise attack in enemy territory. He calls for Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) of the US Army to provide coverage for the media with the first wave of soldiers landing on the beach of France. Of course Cage tries to refuse the order considering he has no experience in the field and is only a PR officer trying to sell these mechanized suits to the army. The General gives him no options and forces him to go to the military base where Sgt. Farrell (Bill Paxton) introduces him to the J-Squad, who are deployed with him to the beach the next morning. Cage is a nervous wreck and the aliens aren't surprised by the invasion, so it turns out to be a suicide mission. Before getting killed, Cage manages to kill a giant blue Mimic and is covered by its blood. In the very next scene we see Cage waking up at the same military base being introduced once again to the J-Squad with the exact events of the past day repeating themselves. He gets stuck in a sort of a time loop where each time he is sent to fight at the beach and after getting killed he wakes up once again and has to repeat the mission with the only difference that he becomes more and more skilled.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow may not have an original premise, but it is one that is very difficult to pull off. Groundhog Day proved to execute it perfectly, but many films after it have failed considering the story can grow a bit repetitive and tiresome. It can also be very constricting and you also lose that sense of suspense considering you know that if Cage gets killed he can relive the day again. It is kind of like a video game where you know you have millions of lives and each time you die you get to repeat the game with knowledge of what is going to happen next. However Tom Cruise manages to keep us engaged with the outcome of his character and the premise is explained pretty well. There is a reason as to why he has to relive each day and we find out during the midpoint of the film. I loved the way in which the story was told as we slowly get to learn more about the plot and similarly to a video game we discover new levels the more we move on. Edge of Tomorrow doesn't just rely on CGI and cool looking action sequences like most action films where everything blows up, this time we get a clever script to accompany the excellent action scenes and some fine performances with well developed characters. This is one sci-fi thriller you won't want to miss."
"jdkraus","7","0","2","8 June 2014"," The ultimate analogy of Tom Cruisehe can never die
","""Edge of Tomorrow"" is the ultimate analogy of Tom Cruise's career. He cannot die. He'll just keep coming back to kick butt in movie screens around the world. The new action hero he plays is Cage, a cowardly military officer that is forced into the front lines against an alien invasion. Lacking any real combat experience, he makes up for it in attaining an ability to relive the same day over and over again simply by dying. The idea is reminiscent of the Billy Murray comedy ""Groundhog's Day."" While a similar concept, the movies are vastly different. An interesting, science-fiction, explanation is given for the reason of the daily recycle. It has something to deal with blood--that's all I can say. With each restart of the day, his character becomes stronger and more equipped to vanquish the aliens. He teams up with Rita, the poster soldier (literally) for killing aliens, and who had once shared the same capability as Cage. <br/><br/>The additional cast members are decent. Bill Paxton appears as Sergeant Farrell, an uptight military commander with a short mustache and an even more curt way of saying things. It almost feels out of character for Paxton to play a tough guy. He has developed the reputation of portraying wimps, as seen in every James Cameron movie (going as far back as Aliens). In ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" he completely breaks away from this typecast and he does so with stark believability. Brenda Gleeson takes a smaller role as General Brigham. With only two scenes, he instantly gives the impression of a determined military leader. Not many actors have this strength or capacity like Gleeson. <br/><br/>While the movie's idea is anything but original, it still is a fun ride for the masses. There is plenty of action, impressive visual effects, and well-timed moments of humor. There is never a bland moment in this film. It is always on the run. The film also proves that Tom Cruise, now at age 52, still has the charm, wit, and agility of being an action star. I can feel and sense that there will be many more years for Tom Cruise as a blockbuster hero. Like with his character Cage, he cannot be killed (figuratively speaking of course)."
"shawneofthedead","8","0","2","8 June 2014"," This will surprise you - in a very good way.
","It's hard to know what to make of Tom Cruise's career these days. No longer the surefire marquee name he used to be, he's an aging, fading superstar who makes some brave choices (Tropic Thunder, Collateral) but is also happy to prop up generic - albeit watchable - action franchises like Mission Impossible. Add that to his tabloid-baiting personal life, and it just might no longer be cool to think of Cruise as... well, cool. It's hard to deny, however, that Cruise makes a pretty strong case to the contrary in Edge Of Tomorrow, a bruisingly smart, unexpectedly romantic sci-fi action thriller that's easily one of the best films he's made in ages.<br/><br/>Terrifying aliens known as Mimics are laying waste to our planet, and as troops of soldiers head into almost certainly futile battle, Lt-Col. Bill Cage (Cruise) is happy to lurk on the media front of this war. After an unfortunate encounter with a grumpy general (Brendan Gleeson), Cage is sent to the actual frontlines: not for publicity reasons, but to die horribly. Which he promptly proceeds to do - repeatedly. For some reason, Cage is living a long, terrible, war-torn day that resets itself each time he dies. As he struggles to live a little longer every day, he goes from complete novice to hardened soldier, and begins to figure out just what needs to be done to turn the tide in humanity's favour.<br/><br/>If you're thinking Groundhog Day with a heck of a lot more aliens, death and destruction, you'd actually not be too far off-base - just like Bill Murray's self-centred Phil Connors, Cage actually learns, grows and evolves as a human being while trapped in his occasionally hellish time- loop. There's even a wonderfully rich vein of humour that runs throughout the film, as Cage's unexpected 'gift' gets him into and out of awkward situations aplenty. Once in a while, the comedy dips into the macabre, but is nevertheless unusually assured and very, very welcome in a movie that could easily have played like a dirge full of doom and gloom.<br/><br/>That's not to say that Edge Of Tomorrow is merely a sci-fi version of a comedy classic from over twenty years ago - hardly. As an entry in the sci-fi genre, Doug Liman's film is fresh and exciting, entirely on its own merits. At its best, Edge Of Tomorrow practically explodes with breathtaking action sequences, shot fast and furious with aliens tunnelling out of sand dunes or helicopters spinning through the air, while also peddling some pretty deep, interesting ideas about the mutability of time, self-determination and free will. Liman cuts everything together masterfully, not an easy task when timelines are constantly altered and mashed up in increasingly confusing ways.<br/><br/>Add to the mix Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), one of the smartest and most capable female leads sci-fi cinema has ever seen, and Edge Of Tomorrow really is a winner. Having endured a time loop of her own, Rita is a war hero so effective that she's accumulated a clutch of nicknames: everything from the Angel Of Verdun to Full-Metal Bitch. Repeatedly, she proves herself to be tough-minded, resolute and determined, saving the day - and Cage - any number of times. Intimidating though that might sound, there's as much joy and wonder in getting to know this tough, tender character for Cage as for the audience.<br/><br/>Even more surprisingly affecting is the relationship that springs up between Cage and Vrataski. It's by no means conventional, since technically she will only ever know him for - at most - a day. But he learns more about her each time he meets her, and the mutual respect that develops between the two characters is a delight to watch. She figures out quickly, too, that there's something more worthwhile about Cage than any of us would have expected at the outset. Their battlefield interactions - prickly, sharp and achingly bittersweet - are more romantic than a thousand kisses and professions of love.<br/><br/>As far as performances go - Cruise really is very good as a man who goes convincingly and painfully from coward to hero, demonstrating a vulnerability that one would typically never associate with him. And Cruise's biggest detractors might want to give the film a shot simply because they'd almost certainly get a little perverse joy out of the extent to which his character is put through the wringer. Blunt, an actress who would usually fall far out of the orbit of a sci-fi blockbuster, acquits herself just as well - she fights, tumbles and ducks as ably as Cruise, and lends Rita a sweet, sad soul that easily makes the character considerably more real and appealing.<br/><br/>Anyone expecting another by-the-numbers sci-fi flick from Cruise - following in the footsteps of last year's rather bland Oblivion - should be prepared for something quite different. To be perfectly honest, Edge Of Tomorrow begins and progresses well, but ends on a slightly disappointing note. For a film that trades so deeply in death and war, the final narrative twist can come across as a little cheap and predictable. But that doesn't detract overly much from the rest of the film, which packs plenty of wit, thrills and action - not to mention a thoroughly surprising and very touching romantic punch."
"eddie_baggins","7","0","2","8 June 2014"," Fantastically entertaining but let down by its last act
","As hard as it may be for some, it's time to leave all that Tom Cruise hate at the door and give whatever doubts you have about Edge of Tomorrow the flick. Despite it being an almost forgone conclusion that in Western markets Edge of Tomorrow will flop (with it likely making its money off the Asian market) missing out on seeing this would be a willing act of missing out on one of the most fun and well filmed blockbusters of the year and a movie that until the last hurdle consistently surprises and thrills.<br/><br/>Action genre specialist director Doug Liman does a fantastic job at helming this adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel All You Need is Kill (gee I wish they kept that title) and is wonderfully supported by writing sibling duo Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth along with script touch ups from frequent Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie. That Edge succeeds to the entertainment levels it achieves is due to this perfect melding of thrilling video game like action that throws the audience head first into this futuristic scenario by Liman and the script that was produced. The film fly's the line perfectly between being serious yet not taking itself to much so and I can safely say that the tone of the film produces more laughs and smart scenarios than most so called ""comedy"" films of late. Sceptics that worried of a Sci-Fi like Groundhog Day can rest assured knowing here that the sacred tale of a man repeating a day over and over is well handled here and treated with a fresh perspective. Now while all this should be enough to convince the masses the fact the film stars Tom ""Scientology"" Cruise will still put people off which is a mighty shame considering the man is on as good as form as ever here as at times downright cowardly Bill Cage.<br/><br/>Cage is an extremely interesting character for Cruise to play and Cruise nails the role completely in a character that requires him to be all the things from scared, brave through to downright disinterested. In an age of frequently cookie cutter hero's Cage is a nice change up of the formula. Cruise's Cage is a interesting lead and it's made all the better by Emily Blunt as we've never seen her before as Alien slaying master Rita. Blunt and Cruise create a very believable and dynamic duo that acts as a great pairing for the two. While all these elements all combine so well for this thoroughly enjoyable ride it would be wrong to not mention just how disappointing and lacking the films ending is. Without delving into spoiler territory Edge's last act brings down a film that for all intents and purposes was shaping up to be a nigh on perfect Sci-Fi blockbuster, it's a real shame the team behind the film ended up with a whimper and not a bang for the film deserved to go out in style.<br/><br/>Stunning special effects, an one key cast of likable players, an unpredictable story and some thrilling set pieces litter Edge of Tomorrow making it a must see big screen experience. With a last act worthy of what came before Edge would have another star added to its total but sadly a weak finale brings down an otherwise perfectly constructed Summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>3 and a half re-sets out of 5<br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out -<br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
"sujanfaster","9","0","2","8 June 2014"," Go. Watch. Repeat.
","When I 1st saw the trailer for this movie, I told to myself, ""Ah another futuristic, sci-fi, alien and all that VFX movie"". Considering Tom Cruise's last 2 movies Oblivion and Jack Reacher, I wasn't expecting much from this too. Its obvious that Tom Cruise is a global star and hence, one would not need to read reviews much before coming and watching his movies. Since even I am one of those millions of Tom Cruise's fans, I decided to watch the movie. And I have to say, this is probably the surprise blockbuster of the year.<br/><br/>Yes, if you read most of the reviews here you would find they have used the word surprise. Tom Cruise plays a not so heroic character of Colonel William Cage who is a media relations officer with the U.S army. The world is on the blink of Alien invasion(or war as they keep calling it) and its all across Europe. The US army is planning to stop the war spreading to the Western countries. For this purpose, there are some Super-Soldier weapons which is headed by Emily Blunt who herself is a role model and have won some important battles. When Tom Cruise goes to meet the general(Gleeson) he's ordered to join the forces at the beach in France. Without Tom Cruises consent, he's arrested and sent as a new recruit. As inexperienced Cruise been sent to battle, for the 1st time, surprising things happen. And from then on, only these 3 words dominate the plot of the movie, Live Die Repeat.<br/><br/>With such a futuristic and complicated plot line, there are more chances that things could go possibly wrong. But director Doug Liman has handled it carefully and has put in humor at the right moments so that viewers are not bored. Visual effects are cool and editing is top class. Tom Cruise looks younger compared to his previous movies and good as always. The soldier role suits Emily Blunt really well and makes her look sexier. The other supporting characters don't have much screen space as this movie is most about the 2 main characters. Overall, its a summer blockbuster you don't wanna miss. Heck, you can watch it even 2,3 times."

Went to see an Alien invasion Sci fi movie which has been consistently delivered by Hollywood but was really surprised as the story unfolded.<br/><br/>First of all this time the United states was not under the attack and the Aliens preferred to pay a visit to Europe. The time loop shown in the movie had a witty nature to it (mostly Cruise's interaction with others) which was missed in some earlier time loop movies like Deja Vu, Source code, Looper and the Butterfly effect.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is as fresh as ever and Tom cruise is always epic. The story line is well knit and flows smoothly from one frame to another and the editing is also incredible keeping a high dose of thrill in all the frames.

","Even though you see the lead actors dying, you don't mind it since they live again and again and again. Plus they are two beautiful people whom we all love - Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt! :) It is a Sci-Fi movie based on a Japanese novel - All you need is kill. <br/><br/>After being killed by the alien enemy, Cage (Tom) develops the ability to see what will happen tomorrow, until he dies. Then he wakes up/lives again to repeat the process. He continues to do so until he perfects the art of killing the enemy, an alien kind creature who also has the ability to see the future. Cage meets Rita (Emily) who tells him that she also has been having similar dreams/visions. Deal was to get killed if things were not getting the way they wanted, instead of stay bleeding. <br/><br/>Even when it sounds a little complicated, it is not. It actually gets very very funny. Humour to such an extent that I will put this movie in 'Humour Sci-Fi', if at all there is such an category. <br/><br/>Something new happened in this movie - The 3D effects were really good and amazed me at regular intervals. Yes, I am saying this! Unlike all other 3D movies which I have complained about, this one was good. <br/><br/>I have watched 3D movies in Inox, PVR and Cinepolis. The winner for best 3D glasses/effects is Cinepolis. Hands down.<br/><br/>Like a typical sci-fi movie Edge of Tomorrow has action, drama, comedy, thrill and suspense. It will keep you on the edge of your seat - either making you laugh out loud or out of sheer thrill and suspense. Clearly the winner is the script/plot. Graphics are truly world class and acting is superb - well, it has to be. It's Tom Cruise after all! <br/><br/>I suggest you go for it. NOW! <br/><br/>Confession: I went with an exception that it would be another been-there-seen-that kind of typical American-soldiers-saves-the-world kinda movie but I was pleasantly surprised."

Tom cruise was also cool and likable and kicked ass and he proved no one should mess with him. I found the story of the film interesting and some of the ideas I thought were original. The film is about the human race being at war with aliens called mimics the human race has been at war with them for five years and never won against them so they create these metal suits to fight the Aliens in.<br/><br/>The film really sucked me in and I found it very engaging and the action was great!.if people like Sci-fi Action Then this is definitely the film for them because this film has explosions and gun fights and at times the film felt Epic! and I love these kind of movies. the beginning of the film was a little slow but once the action kicks in the film just keeps going! And from there on it never stops.The films Action Was about 90% out of 100%.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of this movie that Tom cruise has to relive the same day of his life over and over again and he gets caught in a time loop and every time he dies he comes back to the beginning of the day before the Invasion but every time he comes back he gets stronger and more experienced at combat.The aliens have the power to create this time loop and they know everything the humans are going to do before they do. Emily blunts character knows about this time loop too because the same thing has happened with her and she tries to help Tom cruise become stronger and she trains him and I liked the relationship between them, at first they don't know each other but Tom cruise starts to like her which I thought was nice.That definitely gave the film a Heart.<br/><br/>The Film was visually Stunning and it was Epic and the music was good. I liked that the Aliens had the power to foresee the Attacks of the Humans,it was a cool idea and that's what makes them so hard to beat.they were very Tough enemy's and I also liked the design of the aliens they looked very cool and they were very menacing and strong and the special effects were very good too,I barely saw any cgi they looked like practical Creatures.<br/><br/>To sum things up I thought the film had some very good ideas and great action scenes.The film was definitely adrenaline pumping and intense! and there was Never a dull moment,so if people love Badass over the top action and cool creatures definitely check out this film.I thought it was a Great film and I Loved It."

","Edge of Tomorrow gives you almost two hours of really good excitement! Edge of Tomorrow is exiting and have a good story that bring up new elements through the movie. You kinda loose the time in real life because you almost always see the same story in the movie, it's just a bit changed each time. It's good, because you enjoy the movie all the time and you feel like you live in the movie each time he starts over again. The chance you will like this movie is huge, because people these days like this kind of movies that have action, thriller, a cute badass girl the boys love, a handsome protagonist the girls love, a lot of vfx, good graphics and a really good story.<br/><br/>The movie tries to teach us something important, it is shown in the movie that you have to live the life you have, because you might not have 300 extra life as the protagonist, when it is the last life he have that count's the most. <br/><br/>The scenes is wonderful, the vfx are really fine and the characters play their roles good. They have removed a part of the violence in the war to make a bit more child friendly.<br/><br/>Some people says it have a original story and is not based on any other movie. I do not agree to that because you can find parts from the movie to other movies like Source Code, where both protagonist is sent back in time to prevent a horrible future. <br/><br/>What i did not like with the movie is that it is a watch once time movie and then it will be a fine DVD/Blu-Ray standing in your collection. You can watch this movie once or twice, but it is not a movie you will watch several times again and again and again. <br/><br/>A bit fact from the real life. They attack on a beach like the D-Day in World War 2. The movie was released on the year and almost on the day, 70 years after the D-Day. The country they was attacking on the beach was France in the movie. In WW2 was the attack on France too."
"sesht","Null","0","2","7 June 2014"," What's up with so many thinking person's mainstream flicks this year?
","Not just for the masses this one, and its a fantastic trend to see big studios put their faith in talented film-makers to churn out thoughtful cinema in the mainstream milieu.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt can do no wrong, and with this, Liman can be forgiven 'Jumper'. Cruise has always been serviceable, but this one's perhaps his best work in a long, long time (never doubt his sincerity - it shone through even in 'Oblivion'). Also, sci-fi, of the good variety, seems to fit Cruise like a second skin. I'm all for it if he manages to keep churning out flicks like this one.<br/><br/>Quite a bit of thought has been put into the central macguffin, and though it does have a (kinda) cop-out of an ending, the journey there is enormously satisfying, perhaps to a fault. I know the nitpickers are out there trying to second-guess all the work that's gone on into this masterpiece of an action yarn, but I'm happy, and was along for the complete ride even though I was wiped out when I stepped in to watch this one (marathon meetings - don't ask).<br/><br/>Everyone know the groundhog day motif on this one, so no spoilers there. But the reason for its existence was something more interesting than I'd have given credit for from its trailers (even 'Lost' copped out when it came to explaining away stuff, but this one's strangely satisfying on that score). I did Not see that coming, though the final denouement is not all that surprising, and is simple to a fault at the end of it all.<br/><br/>The look of the film is suitably muted in keeping with the milieu and the context, but the converted 3D is some of the best I've seen on-screen thus far. I know the subtleties will be lost on most, but I had fun with all the depth on display, and for once, it was built from scratch, from an in-depth graphic novel that got turned into a suitably dense screenplay.<br/><br/>Bill Paxton, after a long time, has got a real powerful supporting role to play, never mind 'Million Dollar arm'. With lesser screen time, and almost no action scenes to boast of, he owns each and every line he speaks.<br/><br/>The action is supremely spectacular, and the CGI's so good that you won't know where reality ends and effects begin. Never in-your-face, used as much as its needed to be used. I've watched 'Days of future past' one time too many, but I know that I will enjoy re-watching this one over the next few weeks.<br/><br/>And if someone was indeed wondering, the creature design for the aliens is very, very good. Suitably menacing, with almost 100% stopping power, though they're categorized differently for narrative purposes, each and every model is poison.<br/><br/>With 'The Winter soldier', 'Days of future past' and this one, this summer's turned out to be one of the best for nerds and people who prefer a little meat with their bones. Always a welcome sight. Now, to 'Dawn of the planet of the apes'."

","A scared-of-the-war soldier (No, that wasn't a typo error) is forcibly thrown (literally) on a battle field where he has to play tag with aliens and bullets and you can guess the rest. Along the way he meets a girl whom everyone fondly calls ""Full-metal-B**ch"" (That wasn't a typo either). Together they are put in a time loop where they play the same day again and again and again until the director decides to call it a day (No extra points if the movie ""Groundhog day"" comes to your mind).<br/><br/>Based on novel ""All you need is kill"", there is nothing much for the story department and to some extent the screenplay department can relax a bit for the same reason. But flavoring it in the Hollywood crucible with some star-powered cast, this movie has essentially become one of the best sci-fi in the recent times.<br/><br/>Before you decide to vote against me, let me make my stand clear. I go into a sci-fi movie not expecting an Oscar performance or a classy screenplay. On the contrary I expect entertainment with some good-to- recall moments that will make my money worthwhile. Did the movie tick all the boxes, YES.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, as we all know, is Hollywood's go-to-guy when it comes to saving the world. Be it the Russians (in MI-4) or killer drones (in Oblivion) or the ""mimics"" (in this movie"") he has seen them all and killed them all. When the Academy decides to offer an award on the ""most kill category"", we know who the front-runner is.<br/><br/>OK, enough deviations. Edge Of Tomorrow (EOT) is nothing short of an adrenaline drive which doesn't take itself very seriously (which is a good thing) with its own light-hearted moments (For ex. The hero must die each time to reset the day and guess who does it most of the time). Though this dries up a bit towards the end, the story fills in the vacuum with touch-ups from the CG department.<br/><br/>Some of you might be confused towards the end as to how the story shaped itself. But then it's the writer freedom to decide how his story must end. So, that's forgiven.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow: Will leave you on the edge of your seats."

Except for the draggy repetitive scenes in the first half that slowed down the pace of the movie. Tom cruise intro was too good.

","Imagine your life being caught in a time loop in which you die and re- live the same day again and again. With similar movies like Source Code and Looper exploring the idea of time-loop, Edge of Tomorrow goes one step-ahead - mixing time-loop along with alien invasion. <br/><br/>As the Earth is under heavy attack from aliens, a soldiers gets caught in a time-loop during the war in which he re-lives a day before the doomsday. Interestingly, his skills increases as he lives, dies and repeats in the time-loop cycle which helps him get closer to defeating the aliens. <br/><br/>From the director of The Bourne Identify and Mr & Mrs Smith, Doug Liman successfully transforms a complex story into refreshing and intriguing plot which will keep you on your toes throughout. The scenes becomes repeated as same cycle goes over and over but Liman makes it interesting portraying each frame with unique style added with humor. Hats off to the editing making it more crispy and witty. Screenplay is tight holding your attention every second. Cinematography is splendid. Art direction is applauding. CGI and action scenes are outstanding along with nice background score making superior contribution to the finished product. Tom Cruise surprises you with yet another knockout role. The legendary actor is getting better and better with each film. He gives a flawless performance both in action and comedy scenes. Emily Blunt gives an adequate support as a fearless and gallant soldier. Bill Paxton is likable in a small but important role.<br/><br/>Based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel All You Need is Kill, Edge Of Tomorrow is intriguing, enthralling making it to the 2014's must watch movies list.

","I enjoyed this ""play it again ... and again ... and again Sam"" science fiction flick and I think most science fiction fans will also enjoy it. The stars do a good job, the visuals are excellent and the story is interesting and makes you think. There is humor and thrills and even a bit of a love story. Most reviewers compare it to ""Ground Hog Day"" but ""Source Code"" is more comparable. At some point it gets hard to keep track of ""he remembered"" and ""she remembered"" and why, but by then you have bought into the basic premise so you don't really care if you can't figure it out. In some ways Tom Cruise reminded me of the young Alec Baldwin in ""Hunt for Red October"". I never considered ""Mission Impossible"" science fiction but this seems consistent with Cruise's roles in ""Oblivion"" and ""Vanilla Sky""."

","Edge of Tomorrow focuses on Will Cage, a military media relations officer, who gets thrown into the heat of battle wearing heavy exoskeleton suits, against Mimic alien invasion, all against his own will. On the battlefield, he accidentally kills an Alpha, a different kind of the Mimic, and dies right instantly. But he didn't die but instead he repeats his last day. Realizing his new found ability, he meets Rita Vrataski, the war's poster girl tough soldier, and trains under her. It turns out Rita once had the same ability but she lost it at the last battle. Rita tells Cage the rules, that for him to repeat the day, he must die, and also to stop the whole thing, they must win the war by killing another rare Mimic called the Omega. <br/><br/>Cage grows more adept in battle with each day he repeats. One day Cage and Rita make it to a house with a helicopter, a point in time where Cage knows that if they continue, however the way, Rita will die. He tells her this but she refuses to listen. Rita keeps on starting the heli, a Mimic comes out of nowhere attacking it, and Cage goes for his weapon in the house. Cage kills the Mimic but Rita still dies. He then repeats the day but this time, he doesn't get to Rita, although seeing her. He gets past the house and heli point without her and flies the heli to a dam where the Omega is located. Inside he's confronted by an Alpha and dies. The next repeat, he goes back consulting Rita. They then go to General Brigham to get a gadget to locate the real Omega's nest. <br/><br/>They located the Omega in Paris, while being chased by the military. They're captured and the hospital gives blood transfusion to Cage, eliminating his day-repeat ability. Escaped capture, Cage and Rita enlisted the aid of his squad to assault the Omega. Once again Cage asks Rita to stand aside and once again Rita insists on going. After a failed insertion, Cage and Rita manages to break into the Omega nest. They encounter an Alpha. The only way is for Rita to distract it while Cage goes for the Omega, so they do it. Cage drops the bomb on the Omega and it repeats to about two days earlier.<br/><br/>The base story is great. Yes it's not an original story, but a free adaptation of the Japanese graphic novel ""All You Need Is Kill"". Usually we are presented the story of time travel, but this time it's about time repeat. It's like when you play a video game from the early console era, before the save-point development. When you die, you repeat the game, not from the checkpoint or save-point, but from the very beginning. But the advantage of this story is that it has the ability to be non-linear. Here we see Cage going from saving his friend from the falling transport, to not saving him.<br/><br/>The story twists, like the visions turning out to be a trap, are quite predictable to me, but they're still fun to see due to excellent execution. I see also that the editing is done well for this movie. It's because, like all sci-fi movies, problem comes when a complex base concept is being done with a fast tempo. People, especially those who have, pardon my addressing, inferior capacity, may lag behind. This was what happened with The Matrix (1999), many people watch it repeatedly, not out of liking it, but out of curiosity because they don't get the concept on their first time watching. The editing here is good that it eliminates this problem. Less experienced viewers may again lacks when it comes to the times when Cage asks Rita to stay behind, but seasoned sci- fi watchers will get it faster.<br/><br/>The action is good. But for me, the action may not be the movie's main attraction point. The suits do make the characters look cool, but at the same time they make them harder to move agile in a cool way. The action is quite saved by the visual effects showing the Mimics being speedy and agile, drastically increasing the dramatization of the action sequences.<br/><br/>A senior Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt is a good recipe of a cast selection for this movie. Here Emily proves herself capable to handle even action sequences. A bit of a role for Brendan Gleeson doesn't hurt either.<br/><br/>The acting is great. It's funny to notice that this is one of the rare movies where Tom Cruise rarely do his smug grin, LOL. I personally think Emily Blunt handles the scenes and character greatly. Hr facial features fits perfectly into the tough soldier face, when compared to the many smiles she does in The Adjustmen Bureau (2011).<br/><br/>The costumes and make-up departments did a great job. The suits look great in making the soldiers look tough, although they don't look so agile and nimble. The make-up of the faces in the battlefield is also great, not too bloody, instead being of enough dirt and soot. Sets are beautifully made for this movie, even the ones in the battlefield, like the house with the helicopter. The music scoring is just enough to build the mood and not taking the focus out of the scene.<br/><br/>Overall from me a score of 8 out of 10 is deserving for this movie. I personally do recommend you to go and see it. It won't be a waste of your time and money."
"Catrician","8","0","2","6 June 2014"," Quite possibly the best Sci-fi film since Starship Troopers
","Among the various (shallow) criticisms, witticisms, and remarks that can be found against modern mainstream American cinema, there seems to always be at least a bit of common ground: a lack of diversity among everything from plots to race to the general appeal of the films. That being said, myself being bitter with the way cinema has turned out today in spite of the countless technological innovations even within the past five years or so, I still have some hope for blemishes of brilliance, of which Edge of Tomorrow certainly wields.<br/><br/>There are many shallow, Twitter-esque ways to sum up Liman's film. Groundhog Day but with war. Something something something Starship Troopers. Some combination of the two. But these do not effectively do justice to what is, in fact, an exceptional movie, confident in its own quality while acknowledging its inferiority to previous films.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, there is an age-old Citizen Kane reference with the use of newsreels to accurately describe the events that will happen in the film. One could say that, from the get-go, Edge is a fully realized film capable of paying homage effectively without the need to overdo it; that is, nobody in the film complains about how the Mimics resemble the bugs from Starship Troopers, nor does anyone use one of those age-old Terminator quotes we all love to hate. No, Edge is something different; it is exceptional in its way to utilize the crisis from Groundhog Day, the incredible energy and tension from The Terminator, even the aforementioned newsreel footage derived from Citizen Kane. Edge has, in this way, done something special: it has, once again, transcended the summer blockbuster by the simple way that it knows what it is doing. It's not quite Repo Man self-conscious, though it is at the very least intelligent. <br/><br/>Another common complaint of this new cinema is a lack of thought- provoking in most modern films. Edge has a moderately difficult plot to understand, but nothing that can't be explained relatively easily after viewing. So does Edge suffer for this reason? I say that, since it already has established itself as having some form of intelligence, this is not important. Edge knows what it is doing, and it does it very well, largely due to the bravura performance of Cruise; watch out for the middle ten minutes or so, Cruise has never been better."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","2","6 June 2014"," More video game than time warp
","In reviews of ""Edge of tomorrow"" the title ""Groundhog days"" probably appears more often than the title of the movie reviewed. There are also other movies with variations of the theme. For example, Drew Barrymore's character in ""50 first dates"" wakes up every day with complete loss of memory. Although this is technically not repeating the same day, the effect is similar. In any event, if I were interested in quality science fiction, I'll read Isaac Asimov (e.g. ""The end of eternity"" if time is the subject matter interested in). While ""Edge of tomorrow"" does make an effort to explain why the protagonist repeatedly wakes up after being killed in battle to start the same day all over again, the audience will do better to simply take the angle of a video game: when your character is killed, you just start again. This is easier to understand.<br/><br/>The other aspect about this movie is war against extraterrestrial invaders. Among the multitude of similar movies, the closest comparison is probably ""Battle Los Angeles"" (2011), at least in the sense of having very little preliminaries â€“ the audience is plunged right into the critical moment of Earth's and humanity's survival, with little background on the enemies other than they are here to annihilate us. All sweet and simple.<br/><br/>So let's set the scene. Enemy: unlike the humanoid forms in ""Battle Los Angeles"", this bunch here is giant-squid-shaped, menacingly all metallic, with a proliferation of tentacles and a mouth of razor sharps teeth to boot. Friends: the customary collection of tough army guys with one token army gal (not counting the heroine). Protagonist: brilliant army P.R. man Cage (Tom Cruise) who unfortunately is a complete rookie when it comes to front line action. Heroine: iconic fighting-machine-like Amazon Rita (Emily Blunt).<br/><br/>The details above have just about covered the story line. Sent to the front line, through repeatedly being killed and coming back to ""reset"" the day, Cage accumulates knowledge and courage, in equal measures. Added to that is a growing relationship through working with Rita who had experienced the same phenomenon as Cage's but somehow ""lost"" it. The only way to win, they find, is to locate a queen-bee type of these aliens and destroying her. Two things earn the movie's cut-about-others rating from critics and general audience alike. First, it's the filming, which includes the deft telling of repeating events without becoming a bore and the excellent action sequences. The other thing is character development, which provided Cruise an opportunity to do some very decent acting."
"harsh-kabeer1","8","0","2","6 June 2014"," Smart and engaging
","Edge Of Tomorrow is enjoyable, but not thoroughly. It is funny, smart and engaging as a sci-fi action movie with Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt at the helm, but it bumbles when it is trying to tell a humanist story, something that Source Code did quite efficiently. The opening battle scene is reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan which is great, but I hoped for Schindler's List like epiphany for our hero in the middle. Screenplay does provide for some cathartic moments (but wasted) and there is a beautiful love story hidden in Edge Of Tomorrow that fails to bloom on the screen, and all that is due to Liman's inefficiency in dealing with them. All said, this sci-fi coated Groundhog Day-ish movie that justifies its admission cost and is popcorn-y enough to thrill and entertain us. P.S. For video game players and Crysis players, there is a sort of deja vu."
"zhaohan_dong","8","0","2","6 June 2014"," Great Rhythm, Not So Deep and Complex
","Glad to watch the film on the first day of release (though not premiere). I went to watch it with my friends. In fact, I rarely watch Sci-Fi and action movies since most of these films generally shares the same chasing, fighting, and so on. My first glimpse of the poster was: Wow, this must be another one. But while watching, it really gave me a different perspective.<br/><br/>The director, and the screenwriter have a great control of the movie's rhythm. Throughout the film, Major William Cage (Cruise) keeps going in the time loop of the day. To make people understand his situation, the film concentrates on his loops in the start. The number and rhythm of the repeated shots of time loop are well controlled, first slow and many, then keeps pacing up and brief, making people understand the whole story and at the same time, leave out something to keep the audience interested. I was surprised of this when I was just about to get bored, the story kept going on with a dramatic twist. They're really skilled enough to do that impossible work!<br/><br/>But one thing I don't know for sure is that how can they simulate the effect of the metal suit. I don't think that currently we can build such a sophisticated machine.<br/><br/>If there's something to be criticized, that must be the depth of the story. What's more beyond the humanity shown in the film? I feel that I cannot answer this question. Yes, humanity is great. Yet the film's notion has almost no inspirational spirit to us. That's what I think, the whole industry should concentrate on, to get more bucks, but also enrich the audience's mind.<br/><br/>After all, this one is worth watching."

"karan_sunny_5","8","0","2","6 June 2014"," Blockbuster of the year
","This military science fiction shooter draws key audio-visual motifs from a battery of established grand-daddies in a variety of genres: fantasy (LOTR), military (Saving Private Ryan's shock-and-awe beach bombing and Full Metal Jacket's bunker vernacular and the self-aware-hat-doffing All-Metal exoskeletons), body-moulded extended prosthetic body suit and tentacled mimic aliens (obviously Michael Bay's Transformers) and time- travel fatigue (Groundhog Day and more recently, Source Code) and the resultant mash-up still manages to surprise and entertain for its runtime because of immaculate casting and pincer-sharp focus of slickly shot screenplay. <br/><br/>The trajectory of the main protagonist, a clumsy, blood-fearing military man who's propelled slowly into purposeful action hero really makes the viewer invested in the film at a deeper level. Tom Cruise does not get a note wrong and imbibes even the more difficult fringes of this new action-hero-persona like humour, irony, understated romance and most importantly the fatigue from the incessant time travel completely and makes Cage stand out. The film's other joy is that being designed in the post-feminist set-up, the other gender gets as much ballast as the hero. The heroine (Emily Blunt, fierce!) has gone through everything our hero is going through in front of us. She has entered into a realm of legend and with this bumbling potentially-macho disoriented male entering the scene, it's up to her to train him to a level of ability that makes him safe to be towed along in the final reckoning. <br/><br/>There are close to 200 back-and-forth trips, and with three of them patiently ran-through in the terrific opening, the screenplay milks the rest for fatigue-filled allusions, for slapstick and humour from knowledge and for gravitas and pathos of prescience and pre-sentiment with immaculate ease.<br/><br/>For the final act, we are given rest from the incessant creases of time- travel and launch into a linear blast-it-all resolution. My one gripe is that this supremely well-executed film could have had more transparent politics. It uses the military, engages with the aliens in militaristic fashion, name-drops countries like Britain, France, Russia and China, places the mega-ton rotating Sauron's eye-like ""Omega"" mother time- setter under the Louvre, mentions THE resistance-free march of Russians and Chinese across the European sub-continent aided by UK and yet, no parallel between this created and the real geo-political universe could be convincingly drawn. <br/><br/>While appreciating and delving into the masterpieces at the Louvre is a sort of time-travel for all viewers, but aliens making it their hub and producing planet-decimating, time-manipulating mimics from beneath this supremely visible man-made landmark seems to be an uncertain choice with unnecessary temporal detail. Also, the ultimate resolution rather than grounded in pure science fiction, like Source Code, is more at home in hokey fantasy that relegated the whole product into fantasy-nerd gamer- boy territory. Which is a pity, because Liman with his team do hold your attention better than any other blockbuster this year. Well worth a watch!"

","The trailer for this movie didn't do it justice. It made it look like an OK sci-fi action film. Edge of Tomorrow is a quality Sci-Fi action film. Tom Cruise was his usual brilliance here, he seems to make his characters believable. Emily Blunt is equally good as a tough soldier and her and Cruise connect on screen very well. Doug Liman directed the film very well, the action sequences are very visceral and well done. He also paced the film well, making the frequent death of his main start entertaining and non repetitive, that's not a spoiler as it is well stated even in the trailer that Cruise's characters dies... A lot. The Alien race in this film are not extremely well developed characters but this gives the Human story more focus. There are moments are humorous character interaction also. All in all this is a very good sci fi film, maybe the best in a while. 8/10"

","started in the 50s when my mother would drag me along because she couldn't find anyone to babysit me. so i'd get taken to movies like 'bridge over the river kwai', 'ten commandments', 'ben hur'... i consider myself to be able to hold my own in a conversation about films(from not only America) over the last half century...earlier than that my knowledge is patchy(not to be confused with A-pache, cowboy). i'm telling all this to try and validate my knowledge of storytelling somewhat. i'm with the camp that said they were surprised at how much they enjoyed this movie. those that criticized it(i didn't see a whole lot...but, then again, i only looked at the first page. and there was at least one. i feel the need to negate those negative). sure...i REALly didn't like the ending... but i'm talking the last few minutes. otherwise it was, aside from the initial few minutes of getting us familiar with cruise's character, solidly entertaining. you critics out there...again, i invite you to do better. even just the writing part. obviously you think you can write a good review. so let's see what you REALly got. i already know what 'edge of tomorrow' holds...and despite my really not liking aspects of the film, i wouldn't hesitate recommending it for anyone that's attracted to an action sci fi(more emphasis on the action, but enough sci fi to add extra torque...)."

","The plot is known from the trailer, half an hour through the movie you already know everything and the end is guessable. But getting to the end is very entertaining.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie is perfect. No unnecessary scenes were repeated. You could clearly see how the plot advanced from A to B. And at the end, it felt short despite being almost 2 hours of length.<br/><br/>The leads were perfect as well. They had the necessary on screen chemistry between them, and the difference of age was not so visible. I liked Emily Blunts' English accent, it sounds very sexy. As for Tom Cruise, he is the one who pulls it through. He just doesn't know how to disappoint.<br/><br/>Visuals are fantastic. Aliens are very interesting and I found them to be quite original. Sometimes however, the camera movement was very quick, and it wasn't always clear what is happening during the fight. I saw the 3D version, which had its interesting additions but I don't think it's a must.<br/><br/>Edge of Tomorrow doesn't have romance, which is quite unusual lately. Lead characters had an affection towards each other, but it didn't evolve beyond that. I thought it was good (no unbelievable love story in the middle of nowhere), but maybe that's why my wife wasn't as entertained as I am."
