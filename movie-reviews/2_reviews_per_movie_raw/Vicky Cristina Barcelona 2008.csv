","Everyone acts very well, and the whole film would have been really good if it hadn't been for this weird narrator the whole way through who sounded like he was telling children a story even when saying things like ""they went to bed together"". It was weird. I also feel if it had been more dialogue based we could have got a greater grasp of the characters. I watched it without subtitles but understood the relationship of Juan Antonio and his ex-wife (mostly spoken in Spanish) than I did of Doug and Vicky which just seemed to lack a huge amount of depth. There needed to be some redeeming feature Vicky and Doug's relationship.<br/><br/>Anyway well acted but yeah the narrator ruins it. Javier Bardem is amazing as usual."
"NRiviera","2","43","57","18 February 2011"," Woody Allen Goes on Vacation
","Vicky Christina Barcelona may be the laziest movie I have ever seen. Not necessarily the worst movie ever, but I don't think I have ever seen so many talented people put in so little effort (with the exception of Penelope Cruz). I mean, I fully understand why Woody Allen would want to spend several weeks in Barcelona with three beautiful women, but I don't know why he bothered to put film in the camera and call it a movie. <br/><br/>The central hope of the movie is that constant references to Gaudi, Miro, and how Vicky is getting her masters in Catalan identity (BTW, if you Google ""masters in Catalan identity"" EVERY result is about this movie, which tells you how bogus that is) will distract you from the fact that this movie basically recycles the two most tired clichés of late-nineties soft-core porn: Sexually conservative woman meets a tall, dark stranger who makes her question her life AND sexually adventuresome woman meets a tall, dark stranger who helps her experience increasingly exotic thrills including (gasp!) lesbianism. Strangely these two plots never really intersect, which is particularly odd since the tall, dark stranger is the same for both of them. <br/><br/>Other than the pretty Tourist Board shots of Barcelona, the main dramatic thrust of the movie is how Vicky thought she had her life planned out, but a tryst with the exotic Spaniard has made her question everything. How do we know this? Because Vicky actually says things like ""I thought I had my life planned out, but"" And not just once, but she says it to the Spaniard, she says it to Patricia Clarkson, and she says it to a classmate from her language class, who is introduced for the sole purpose of giving Vicky one more person that she can tell. Oh, and in case you still missed it, there is a ludicrously intrusive narrator who explains it all to you again and again. Why is Vicky suddenly dissatisfied with her entire existence after one quick roll in the grass with the Spaniard? No real reason is ever given, other than that the rule of the cliché is that intelligent American women are all sexually repressed with boorish husbands. <br/><br/>I'm sure that the stilted dialog is meant to make it feel ""theatrical"" and the oppressively obvious and distracting narrator is meant to be ironic (like the Greek Chorus in Mighty Aphrodite), but without any real plot, characters, or motivations, it just adds to the sensation that you're trapped for ninety minutes while someone tells you about a mediocre movie they once saw."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","247","364","15 August 2008"," A triumphant effort from Woody Allen
","Although this film has bizarrely been described as breezy summer entertainment by some top critics (which leads me to wonder if they saw the same movie I did, or just the first half hour), ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is the closest thing to the sort of examination of relationships that Allen became famous for in quite some time (""Anything Else"" counts, I suppose, but lacks the sharpness this film has), and although it is far from as weighty as some of his dramas or even some of his comedies, this is his first really inspired script in a while, featuring a cast of detailed, well-developed characters, some razor-sharp observations on relationships, and a wicked sense of humor.<br/><br/>Although I never thought Woody's work this decade was particularly poor (other than ""Cassandra's Dream"" and although I'm in a minority ""Match Point""), it has mostly been completely inconsequential and almost entirely dependent on broad characterizations and heavy plotting rather than real people and awkwardly comic situations (which has always been Allen's strong suit). A career-best performance from Scarlett Johansson, a wickedly entertaining turn from Penelope Cruz, and the absolute revelation that is Rebecca Hall form a great cast along with Javier Bardem in a role that may surprise the majority of the American public (well, for most of the movie, anyway). You can feel Allen's mark on their mannerisms, but they all seem to disappear into these characters, that's how good they are.<br/><br/>I'm keeping this as spoiler-free as possible, because it's really worth going into the theater not expecting anything in particular and savoring the film's often unexpected but never contrived plot twists and turns. All you should know is that Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) go to Barcelona for the summer and things get complicated when they meet a charming, mysterious, and rich painter (Javier Bardem) and he makes a rather upfront proposition to both of them. It's best if you know nothing of how Cruz' character impacts the film prior to watching it.<br/><br/>In relation to Allen's other work I thought it was interesting that he never attempted to analyze sex. The whole movie is in many ways about sex, and there is a lot of the expected philosophical and psychological examination of the relationships between the characters in the film, but sex itself is never analyzed as it is in much of Allen's work, and is instead treated as the impenetrable mystery it is. That said, Allen's script is extraordinarily nuanced, something that I haven't expected from his writing in a while. Sure, the characters still represent opposing romantic philosophies, but there's a spark in the writing that makes these feel like real people as opposed to mere characters. That spark, that chemistry is there throughout ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", it's there in the vibrant cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, it's there in the performances, it's there in the shot composition, and it's there in the editing, and in pretty much anything else I haven't mentioned yet. <br/><br/>The first forty minutes or so of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" may be the sort of romantic comedy (very good romantic comedy, at that) that the advertising campaign seems to suggest it is, but for the rest of the film there's the sort of pessimistic optimism that colors much of Allen's work (if that makes sense, pretend you didn't read it if it didn't), and let's just say it doesn't end well for these characters. There's real complexity and intensity in this film, and all I have to say is this: Woody Allen is back, the perceptive, intelligent examiner of the human heart, that is, not what we've had for the past while. To say this is one of his best films would be ignoring the fact that through the 70's and 80's he pretty much made nothing but great films, but I can at least say that this is on par with some of his better work.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"WriterDave","9","173","255","21 August 2008"," ""I'm famous for my intolerance.""
","Vicky (a neurotic and sexy Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (a neurotic and gorgeous Scarlett Johansson) are two American tourists in Spain examining their differing views on love in Woody Allen's breezy and alluring ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". Amidst a tempestuous summer in Barcelona, the ladies are both seduced by a free-thinking painter (a perfect Javier Bardem) whose own life is complicated by his still passionate relationship with his ex-wife (a devastating Penelope Cruz, who has never looked more beautiful).<br/><br/>Much like the change from New York City to London invigorated Allen in ""Match Point"", this vacation to Spain has revived some of the director's more artistic aspirations. The scenery is postcard perfect but drenched in that same dizzying lushness that made Allen's view of NYC so intoxicating in ""Manhattan"". The churches, the homes, the art museums, the countryside, the intimate city streets and touristy details make you feel like you are visiting Barcelona along with Allen and his cast.<br/><br/>There's also sharpness to the trademark Woody dialog that has been missing for quite some time. Like all of Allen films, this one is endlessly talky, but there's some great subversion when certain lines that seem like throw-aways actually pack a punch when given a second thought. When Bardem first attempts to talk Johansson's character into bed, he says something clichéd about her being hard to please. Quick witted, Johansson replies, ""I'm famous for my intolerance."" She says it casually, but it packs a bite as it's the complete antithesis of her character's outward desire to be someone who rallies against cultural norms, and she presents herself as someone who is easy-going and tolerant of all.<br/><br/>Allen also displays a keen sense of pacing when he creates tension in his build up to Cruz's appearance after her character is endlessly talked about but never seen until about half way through the film. When Cruz finally arrives, her moody whirling dervish of a performance is the perfect spice to liven up the soupy proceedings. Her seething, fiery line readings combined with looks that could kill make her the front-runner for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars.<br/><br/>The baseline archetypal characters are essentially clichéd, but the way in which Allen handles all of their interpersonal relationships is fairly sophisticated and entertaining even when it grows absurd. There is of course that kiss between Scarlett and Penelope but also some moments of Lynchian-lite when Allen photographs the brunette Hall and blonde Johansson similarly to make them seem like they are two sides of the same woman. There's even more weirdness when die-hard Woody fans realize that in some perverse way Scarlett Johansson's character is the ""Woody"" part--as in any film he does not star, there is always one character who represents the part he would've played had he been in it. However, film buffs will enjoy some of the nice touches like when Hall and another go to see Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (one of my all time favorite films) or the repetitive use of a Spanish guitar in the soundtrack whenever Bardem and Hall get together. But then there's the mostly unnecessary voice-over narration that fills in expository gaps and shows Allen can still be a lazy tactician.<br/><br/>Woody Allen has always been an acquired taste, even more so in his latter years when he sometimes forgets how to provoke, but his fans should be delighted with this latest European flavored effort. In the end, you'll feel like Javier Bardem is the luckiest man in the world, Penelope Cruz is operating at the echelon of her appeal, and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, well, they'll always have Barcelona."
"greenbeavervideo","2","51","72","30 June 2009"," If you ""don't get"" Woody Allen, this movie won't help.
","There were three things that bothered me about this movie. 1) Woody Allen, whose controversial relationships are well-documented, has created a movie promoting a judgment free world where people should do as they please with their relationships. Nothing wrong with that, but why does he need to put down conventional lives and relationships in order to do so? He mocks conventional life styles as mundane and torturous. Two male characters are negatively portrayed because of their huge sin: being boring (gasp!). You would think that a man whose movies are found to be boring by 95% of the population would be sensitive towards that label.<br/><br/>2) The writing when it comes to the characters. They all talk the same, use the same vocabulary, and posses the same wit. Maybe for New York intellectuals who only hang around each other that might be the case, but for the rest of the world, that's not the case and it makes for a rather unrealistic movie. Take the character of Juan Antonio as an example. When he introduces himself, he struggles with his English and fumbles for the right words, then two sentences later, he uses the word ""subterfuge"". What foreigner do you know who struggles with the English language and who also use that word? What native English speakers do you known who uses that word? Again, this is because all the characters are written to speak the same.<br/><br/>3) The story. At the end of the movie, all of the characters are exactly at the same place they were at the beginning of the movie. You could argue that Vicki's character views her life differently, but yet she's still following the same actions she did at the beginning. In essence, you just wasted your time watching this movie, for all of the weaving the story tries to do, in the end, you are back to where you started.<br/><br/>The cinematography was nice, but outside of that, not a good movie."
"katiemeyer1979","8","98","152","5 September 2008"," Entanglements Woody Style
","Barcelona is recognizable enough and exotic enough to frame the latest complication from Woody Allen. Allen himself claims to care very little about films. He doesn't consider them the center of his life. Strange, because I do, Woody Allen without his films is...well I don't know who or what he is. Here he ventures again outside New York in a shape and form that reminded me a little bit of Jacques Rivette. Scarlet Johansson and Rebecca Hall, as the blond and the brunette of the title, make a great pair of opposites or seemingly so. Javier Bardem is the artist that comes to ruffle their world and the spectacular Penelope Cruz (getting better and better with every movie) is the hysterical side of the artist's past. We spend a great deal of time sitting at tables eating and drinking while a voice over guide us through their physical and emotional journey. I was delighted, entertained ever aroused. Woody Allen keeps surprising and he's got it whether he cares about it or not."
"thankyoumrwilly","9","221","361","13 August 2008"," I've been waiting for the past 7 films to find the old woody.
","I just got back from a free screening of this movie. Wonderful, brilliant, thought provoking, funny, great story in the way only Woody Allen could do. The acting was great, the writing was great, the story was great. As well as the fact that it wasn't a poor rehash of Crimes and Misdemeanors like Match Point and Cassandra's Dream. So refreshing on all levels. Javier Bardem embodies the character and truly allows me to forget about his role in Old Country. Patricia Clarkson, a gem as always. The girls were all great. Had not been impressed with Scarlett Johansson since Lost in Translation and was bored with her work in the last of his films but she held her own and did the part great. Penélope Cruz was wonderful, vibrate and funny especially when doing the Spanish. At 71 the man still has it and has rehashed the place in my heart where I hold his wonderful art. Simply happy and fulfilled. Thank you Woody!"
"paurullan","3","81","128","23 September 2008"," «Mediocre» is the word that comes to my mind
","To be true, I really enjoy Woddy Allen's work. When I heard that this film was on making the first thing I thought was «gotta see it». And to be sincere too, I was very disappointed for the results. <br/><br/>Even only lasting an hour and a half it felt very long. None of the action is plausible, none of the interpretations are convincing and none of the characters are fully developed. The soundtrack keeps going most of the film and it becomes so noisy that goes from interesting to a nuisance. I am sorry to bash the film this way but the script felt so childish as it was written by a teenager in love. There is no really turn-over in the history, no surprises, nothing new under the sun. The darkroom scenes were some kind of fan-service, the bed scene with Scarlett was lengthy and poor and character of Vicky feels mostly dull.<br/><br/>The film would have left me a better taste if at least Maria Elena seemed truly mad: when Cristina tells them she is leaving Maria's reaction goes down to sadness because a sexual lose. What comes to the spectator's mind is «this is wrong, it seems that Woddy Allen just wanted to film these to women, not to make a film». In a word, this film feels like a high school project more than multimillion production. <br/><br/>I cannot really understand what all these eight-star reviewers feel for it."
"doughboynyc","7","132","217","15 August 2008"," It's not all that, but it is a good bag of chips!
","Vicky Christina Barcelona isn't quite the work of genius that several critics are making it out to be, but it is Woody Allen's most solid film in nearly a decade and by far his sexiest.<br/><br/>I will admit that the claims that it's his best movie in 20 years may have raised my expectations unfairly. After all, the past two decades has brought us Sweet and Lowdown (inspired Sean Penn and Samantha Morton), Another Woman (inspired Gena Rowlands), Husbands and Wives (inspired Judy Davis), Bullets Over Broadway (""Don't Speak!"") and what, in my humble opinion, is his most extraordinary film ever: Crimes and Misdemeanors.<br/><br/>That said, there is much in the film's Plus Column. Bardem has never been sexier in English. Rebecca Hall is a sublime revelation. Scarlett Johansson does her most consistent and least grating work since Girl With the Pearl Earring. The supporting cast is a treasure trove of great character actors: Kevin Dunn (usually but effectively charmless), Chris Messina (a complicated mix of sexy and dull), Pablo Schreiber (virtually a cameo), and Patricia Clarkson (earthy, tragic and terrific as always).<br/><br/>And then there's Penelope Cruz. Incapable of wrong-doing in my eyes since All About My Mother, she is everything you've heard she is. At first, the character appears to be another version of Rahda Mitchell's bad Melinda only dark and Spanish. But she evolves and blossoms, like a mushroom cloud in slow motion.<br/><br/>The story is simple and the structure is a bit unwieldy. As a result, the film feels longer than it is and while it does saunter, it's never boring. The screenplay seems more concerned with re-arranging the configurations of lovers and exploring its themes than it does with sustaining the dramatic tension.<br/><br/>The films only significant, though ultimately not fatal, flaw is Miss Johansson. For the legions who thought Javier Bardem could generate romantic and sexual chemistry with anyone or anything, well, I have bad news. When she is sharing the screen with both Bardem and Cruz, Johansson's limitations as an actor and as a screen presence.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, Vicky Christina Barcelona is still a worthwhile endeavor. An enjoyable romp filled the requisite angst and passion of Woody Allen's better efforts. Best of all, there's Spain and Barcelona. The landscapes, people and architecture provide even more spectacular real estate porn than Melinda & Melinda. Not only does it make you want to go to Barcelona, it will make you feel like you've lived there and loved it.<br/><br/>Despite its unevenness,"
"nazztrader","2","72","114","21 December 2008"," Stiff, unappealing, unimaginative... where did old Woody go?
","Some have commented about the use of a narrator. Yes, that was lazy and intrusive, but not nearly the worst part of this boring mess of a film. And I wouldn't care if Woody Allen wasn't the director and writer - at this point I just watch films for what they are, not who was involved in making them. I found myself trying to stay awake while watching it, but when it had my full attention, I found myself amazed at the flimsiness being presented. Boring, self-indulgent people walking around a beautiful city, not knowing what they really wanted out of life, not really interested in anyone or anything else, except for what it meant to themselves.<br/><br/>And yes, Johansson's performance was quite bad, as others have mentioned, but it actually was consistent with the tone of the film, if that's in any way a ""positive."" There was a turning point, however, which I thought might save the film, at least to some degree, and that occurred when the Johansson character decided she no longer wanted to be in the menage a trois situation. When the viewer isn't given any reason for this decision, I had to laugh, because that was the final confirmation of my thoughts up to that point. Like Johansson, the paintings, which were just AbEx rip-offs, reflected the lack of overall depth the viewer is compelled to endure.<br/><br/>These are just unappealing, narcissistic people I would not want to know. Their only goals in life concern self satisfaction, and the viewer isn't even given a reason why this is the case. Is it that Woody himself is now like this and assumes everyone else in the world is? That's really the only somewhat interesting thing that I took from this film. Unlike in some of his early films, there is no sardonic wit here, or anything else that would allow us to find something special about this. If someone else had given us this film, especially if it was a young person, I'd think that this person had a lot of ""growing up"" to do. The people in this film are the kind of bit-part characters that the main characters in Woody's best films would make fun of !"

","First of all i would like to say that I'm a big fan of the old woody Allen , i mean the great director/writer woody Allen , who created in over thirty years in the business some of the most romantic , funny . dramatic , masterpieces that shined in Hollywood starting from Annie Hall , to Hannah and her sisters , Mighty Aphrodite , and last but not least Sweet and lowdown . But the new woody Allen has produced many unbalanced , mildly funny , and romantically dead movies such as Melinda and Melinda which was acceptable , but not a woody Allen material , Hollywood Ending which wasn't so bad as well but wasn't good either , and this year his latest film came out and i had mixed feeling about it , i was frightened that another disappointing movie from the master Allen could destroy my love to his earlier masterpieces , and unfortunately , it was even more disappointing than i could ever imagine . <br/><br/>The movie's basic concept is actually more similar to a combination of Baywatch and Desperate housewives , but apparently with higher level of acting . It's about two amazingly beautiful women Vicky (Rebecca hall) the committed ,engaged , and somehow mature woman who chose Barcelona to get her masters degree in Catalan Identity , and Cristina(Scarlett Johansson) , the spontaneous , free spirited , less mature who came to Barcelona in a self finding journey . Vicky and Cristina Meet Juan Antonie the passionate painter who suffers after a bad split from his girlfriend Marie Elena who tried to kill , Juan Antonia has an affair with Vicky, before he gets involved in a relationship with Cristina , then Marie Elena comes back in the picture and lives with Cristina and Juan Antonia , after she tried to kill herself . However i can't see the whole point of the movie , and as i said before the movie is an odd combination of Baywatch and desperate housewives ,because so many affairs happen during it's kind of short length , and it's basically about good-looking people showing off on screen with good acting skills , but no real sense of the movie . but Despite that Penelope Cruz managed to catch the eye with a very good performance that actually was the most and only beautiful thing in the movie . <br/><br/>In The end i really hope that Woody Allen comes back to what he did before making great movies and entertaining , and making millions of people all around the globe laugh ."
"jrwygant","2","41","63","4 October 2009"," embarrassingly bad
","""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" will be praised by the few remaining Woody Allen fans and condemned by the rest of us, whose model for drama is derived from classic Greek theater. The demands for statement of circumstance, a crescendo of conflict rising to a crisis, a resolution of the crisis, and a brief concluding summary are missing from VCB. The convention of character change -- Othello changing into a wife murderer, Hamlet deteriorating into madness, Scout's discovery of important life values in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" -- is also missing. The usual expectation that minor characters are introduced into a story if they have some purpose, is ignored. And of course, the common convention of a plot, as opposed to a vignette, is nowhere on the horizon. The extensive use of anonymous voice-over narration does not salvage this wreck and only leaves the audience annoyed and patronized.<br/><br/>It is worth speculating that if someone else had proposed to make this same movie, someone previously unknown, it never would have gotten financed.<br/><br/>Vicky and Christina are not believable from their first introduction. That the stiff and conservative Vicky would have traveled to a foreign country with the impulsive and directionless Christina to spend two months together is inconceivable. Given that the initial premise fails, the rest is an embarrassing exploration of an old man's fantasy about two young women.<br/><br/>At one point Vicky meets a young man in a language class, another possible diversion for her. Although he seems dramatically interesting, he disappears after his one brief scene. His exchange with Vicky adds nothing to her self-awareness or any other aspect of the movie. The scene could have been cut entirely with no consequence except elimination of any expectation in the audience that the young man might have some purpose in the film.<br/><br/>When the endless display of self-descriptions by each of the characters becomes tiresome to all, including the characters, we experience a classic ""deus ex machina."" Maria Elena is dropped into the little that remains and fires off a few sobering rounds.<br/><br/>The movie ends pretty much where it began. Vicky is the same Vicky, conservative, now married, willing to make the same compromises she has always made. Christina is still floundering around trying to discover herself. Whose movie was this? Was it Vicky's or Christina's? In the end neither of them holds our interest."
"jzappa","9","119","200","13 October 2008"," An Open-Minded, Nonjudgmental Portrait of the Boundless Scenarios In Which Love Can Be Found
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is among the cream of the Woody Allen crop, in the midst of Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Match Point. It may even be a wiser film than any of them. What Woody has done throughout his film career is seek the answers to his own life questions in any number of ways. Some later films contradict the philosophical implications of previous ones. Some reaffirm them. His foremost theme has always been the complications of love and sex, and this ultimately genre-less film that I suppose could be considered a romantic seriocomedy may be his magnum opus of his sexual and romantic revelations.<br/><br/>Vicky, played by Rebecca Hall, and Cristina, by Scarlet Johansson, go to Barcelona for the summer, settling with Vicky's distant relative (Patricia Clarkson) and her husband. A Narrator, present all through the film, the particular matter-of-fact likes of which Allen has never before used, illustrates the two friends: Vicky is no-nonsense and conservative in her attitude toward love and commitment, engaged to the dependable but less than passionate yuppie. She is in Barcelona getting her masters, and is deeply stirred by Spanish guitar. Cristina, in contrast, is impulsive and irresolute of what she wants in life. She is just out of a relationship and wants to forget about her experience making a short film about Love, perhaps a nod to Woody's own admitted negative reflections on his previous works.<br/><br/>At an art exhibition, these two symbolically contrasting women observe a notorious painter, played with suavity and charisma by Javier Bardem. Cristina is immediately fascinated with him, and grows captivated when she and Vicky learn that he has undergone a violent relationship with his ex-wife. Later, the girls spot him in a restaurant, where he stoically approaches their table and unexpectedly invites them to go along with him to Oviedo, where they will tour, wine, dine and, with any luck, make love. Straight away Cristina consents, Vicky refuses, but Vicky is is ultimately persuaded and the twosome go with the self- designed artistic and drifting romantic on a small private plane through a rainstorm.<br/><br/>What follows is a free-flowing rectangle of romance with any combination of Bardem, Vicky, Cristina, and Bardem's unmanageably volatile ex-wife Penelope Cruz, who deserves an Oscar nomination for her work here. There are many ways in which the two American women change for the better and change not at all. One facet of the story is a clash of conventional American and liberated European cultures. Another is spiritual freedom, signified by Vicky's conventional reticence and thus conflicted feelings that she may be missing out on so much, and Cristina's mutability. A lesser title for the movie but an apt one nonetheless could have been Why Not?<br/><br/>Woody is expressing through his characters his urge to be free of all psychological and emotional restrictions. In any case, characters as open as Scarlett Johansson and Javier Bardem's seem to need similarly adaptable significant others. I find it interesting that Louise Lasser, Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow, Woody's women, all brought out their inner nebbishes due to intimate involvement with him, as in his eagerness to lift a lover's state of mind, he ends up, sooner or later, virtually turning his woman roughly into a female version of himself. Johansson and Hall's summer in Spain, if anything, releases them from the sludge of mediocrity, particularly that which results from fear and common custom.<br/><br/>By saying all that, I have not even come close to giving anything away. The way things turn out would hardly make sense to characters like Vicky, or her fiancé, and that is what makes it a natural flow from the heart. Woody Allen's brilliantly written, guilelessly directed and convincingly acted Spanish debut-and-swan song is not a comedy for the same reasons as nearly every other comedy Woody has made. It is a comedy essentially because of the culture clash. The film depends on our reactions to things that really are not inherently funny except to unaccustomed eyes. Likewise, the bewildered Americans are just as funny from the other side of the gamut. Without any doubt in my mind, this is not only Woody Allen's best film in years, but one of his very best of his entire 42-film, 42-year career as a writer-director of consistently good films."
"mikes2001","2","20","29","10 June 2010"," Not good. Not good at all.
","I've mostly stayed away from Woody Allen movies from the last 20 years because my few forays into things he's done in that time (Anything Else, Manhattan Murder Mystery) were not pleasant. Add Vicky Cristina Barcelona to the pile of unpleasantness. This movie is bad. I can't understand the folks who raved about it and gave it a 10. <br/><br/>What parts of this movie could have possibly warranted a 10? <br/><br/><ul><li>The boring narration that repeats the action we've just seen or are about to see?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The stilted dialogue of Rebecca Hall in the scene where she first meets Javier Bardem and acts exactly like Woody Allen? Woody should have been sitting in that scene!!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Any scenes featuring the stereotypical boyfriend of Rebecca Hall?</li></ul><br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a 2, and that's because I'm giving 1 point for the arrival of Penelope Cruz, who first appears in the movie at 1 hour and 14 minutes into it. I know it took that long for her to appear because I checked the time on the screen. Her appearance completely wiped away anything that happened before in the film. Thankfully!! (Maybe that accounts for the high marks!?!?) This movie would have been better served if all of Scarlet Johansen's screen time was given to Penelope Cruz. But then we wouldn't have seen the kiss between these two, which accounts for the other point I'm issuing. Penelope is the only reason to watch this movie, but it's not enough to compensate for the crud around it. Javier Bardem was good, but I can't give this movie more than a 2, so I'll make it up to him elsewhere. <br/><br/>For young folks out there who've heard Woody Allen's name and have wondered about his movies, please stick to things like Hannah and Her Sisters and all of the other movies he made before that time. Those are wonderful. The dark ones, as well as the early funny ones if you know what I mean!! The stuff he's been churning out robotically in the past 20 plus years are mostly dreadful. It's sad, really, what's happened to Woody. Can't he just go away? I use to feel sad when I read about a writer or director who hasn't made a movie in many years and I wondered why they went away, or how enjoyable it would be to see them again. But like an athlete, creativity has a lifespan, with peaks and valleys along the way until the eventual final decline. The artists who stopped making movies once their artistry declined were smart. I'm sorry to say that Woody's final decline happened many years ago."
"hupomone","4","39","62","1 September 2008"," unrealistic male fantasy
","The problem with VCB is that, about half-way into the movie, we are presented with such an over the top, unrealistic scenario, that the only people that could possibly buy it are people that have no experience dealing with real women in the real world. This scenario begins the moment that Javier brings his mentally ailing ex-wife Maria into his house, which he already shares for the time being with current girlfriend Cristina. Cristina is somewhat perplexed. Javier explains that Maria will have to stay with them for a little while. How long? Javier explains, ""a few...months"". Believe it or not, Cristina, though intitally frustrated and angry, accepts the arrangement.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, these are not rednecks from a trailer park in Alablama. Cristina is not an inbred hillbilly, nor is she suffering from any kind of apparent neurotic low self-esteem or psychosis. She is presented in the movie as an intelligent, cultured, incredibly attractive woman. So I ask Mr. Allen, in all seriousness, what woman has he ever known...what woman has any of us known, that would not have immediately walked out that door and never come back once Maria was brought into that house to stay for two months.<br/><br/>So this is the main problem with this film, it's not a problem of morality or ""liberalism"" or anything else of that nature. It's assumed any fan of Allen's who has walked into this movie has at least somewhat of an open mind. The problem is one of realism. (and by the way, since the movie is not particularly funny, we cannot accept the movie on those terms either). The normally socially conservative, committed Vicky sleeping with Javier in a moment of abandoned passion is realistic....Cristina agreeing to Javier's crazy ex-wife staying with them, and then even forming a sexual tryst with the two of them isn't realistic, it's what a psychotic person does. The movie surrounds this ridiculous set up with gorgeous scenery and skilled actors, but it doesn't help. All we can do is accept that fact that this is strictly male masturbational fantasy from a once skilled director and writer."

I always look forward to Woody's writing because he is the best. The film just looks beautiful from the way it is shot.

","When will Woody Allen get over his ridiculous obsession with the pretentious rich? It used to be that he wrote for the masses, albeit the educated, urbane masses. So maybe he just needs to get back to his New York roots (again), but for the love of Gene Shalit, could he please stop turning in such bland crap? Does anyone else remember when Allen had a real knack for snappy dialog? For characters who seemed as real as the veins on your hand? When his movies were clever, not predictable? When each movie contained a rich, vibrant atmosphere that drew from both negative and positive aspects of The Big Apple? Or did I dream about all of those movies? Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a big dud. It's about a love/lust pentagon that involves titular friends (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannson), on vacation in the titular town, who encounter Bohemian painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). But Vicky's engaged to a sanctimonious tool (Chris Messina), and then Juan Antonio's unstable ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) shows up as well. And it being Spain, everyone's got lust on the brain, and there's plenty of partner swapping.<br/><br/>To begin with, the movie's far too talky. True, many of Allen's early movies were just as reliant on dialog, but in those cases - I'm looking your way, Annie Hall and Manhattan - the dialog was florid and witty. Here it's dull and placid. So you get these long stretches where two of the characters, whomever they are, will talk, and talk, and talk endlessly about whatever their current situation is, without doing much about it. These people are the poster children for passive-aggressive behavior; even when they do act on something, it's devoid of passion and meaning.<br/><br/>Except, of course, when Cruz shows up. Before we even meet her, Maria Elena is shown to be idolized by Juan Antonio, even after she stabbed him with a knife. She's shown as this fiery charmer with whom the charming Juan Antonio had a love-hate relationship, and when Cruz finally does appear on screen, you can see the attraction and tension between them. This is partially because of how well Bardem and Cruz work together here but also because the other actors have virtually no charisma, not even the free-wheeling, carefree, doesn't-know-what-she-wants Cristina (Johannson).<br/><br/>But it's not just the talkiness and the lack of passion, it's the fact that this is a Woody Allen movie that behaves more like a John Badham movie, a movie that is virtually indistinguishable from other movies in the genre 0 in this case, romantic melodrama, I assume. On the plus side, it's not as horrendous as Allen's Match Point, which started out as a romantic melodrama and then inexplicably transformed into a deranged-stalker/murderer movie, but that doesn't make this a good movie by any stretch.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's a bit unfair to compare this to Allen's old movies, since everyone evolves, but I do wish he'd come back to writing about middle-class characters instead of these well-to-do, conceited knuckleheads. Watching his upper-class fables reminds me more of Merchant-Ivory dramas than anything else, and perhaps we should leave those movies to the likes of Merchant and Ivory, or Whit Stillman. This is a costume-drama period piece sans costumes or, uh, a period. It's wildly predictable - you can guess the sexual permutations about 20 minutes early - and a boring footnote to the master's long career."
"albertoveronese","1","18","27","7 December 2010"," Woody Allen, the missing ingredient
","Throughout the years I've become less interested in Woody Allen's work and if this is his worst film I quite hope it is. I wouldn't have remembered about it, if it wasn't for a phone conversation I had with a friend short after I saw the film (Vicky Cristina Barcelona was on ARTE France/Germany). The beginning of the movie is a bit bland and uninspiring, but good enough in the middle of a boring evening. So I think: – it's about time you watch a Woody Allen film again! A male narrator voice explains the events on the screen in terse sentences; as I continue to watch I become more intrigued, and halfway though I even forgive the lousy tourist ride around Barcelona (thou I never was in Barcelona, the film doesn't tell me anything I already know about the city). I remain motionless seated on the couch with my eyes open (longing for a change of scenery), in case there's more to it. And then suddenly -it- happens! Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz) holding a gun (imitating Allen's neurotic gimmicks) tries to blast away her love Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem)... what? do I hear the narrator voice again? oh, the blow of mercy – yes, the narrator's voice comes on again and announces with pathetic contrivance that Vicky (Rebecca Hall) returns home to have her grand wedding to Doug (Chris Messina)... Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) continues searching... maybe Allen just had enough and needed an easy way out to end the movie. Mr. Woody Allen, I'll go to your movies, but you'll have to seduce me."

","Principled monogamists may not like this film. Not only does it show its primary characters in relationships with multiple partners but, with one exception, they are quite open with each other about it. Allen suggests both that romantic happiness is best achieved with more than one person and that it is necessarily ephemeral (I wonder what his young wife, Soon-Yi Previn, thinks). He says in a Los Angeles Times interview with Rachel Abramowitz that Vicky Cristina Barcelona is, ultimately, ""a very sad film."" <br/><br/>If so, it may be the brightest sad film ever made. All of the actors are at their best and make immediate connections with the audience. With the exception of an unnecessary voice-over narration (in which Gaudí is mispronounced with stress on the initial syllable), the self-conscious affectations that haunt some of Allen's films are absent. Fine actors are allowed to speak for themselves. According to the Abramowitz interview, Allen ""never talked to the actors, other than to give them stage directions."" The resulting feel is often one of brilliant improvisation.<br/><br/>The complex romantic relationships among its four primary characters are what the movie's mostly about and I won't spoil it by going into them. Patricia Clarkson, however, deserves mention for her role as Judy Nash, the middle-aged wife of an American couple who are friends of Vicky's parents and with whom solid Vicky and impetuous Cristina stay in Barcelona (though Cristina soon moves in with the charismatic artist, Juan Antonio). Judy is married to a dull but steady man, somewhat similar to the man that Vicky is about to wed. Vicky confides to Judy about her uncharacteristic fling with Juan Antonio. Judy advises Vicky to reap her passion while she can and arranges another meeting between the two. All of this is low-keyed and entirely believable.<br/><br/>As the movie's title suggests, it's about Barcelona as well as Vicky and Cristina. There are many outdoor shots of the city, especially of Gaudí's Park Güell. They amount to more than a minor travelogue because structures that are usually photographed in isolation appear with everyday crowds of people. Like Bruges in the movie In Bruges, the city is more than scenic background. Though never mentioned explicitly, Barcelona's anarchist past bubbles to the surface."

","Here's a word I despise using in reviews: boring. But, I seriously can't avoid describing 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' as just that: boring. Probably because I've never been a Woody Allen fan. Well, you're either a Woody Allen fan or not, an Adam Sandler fan or not, a Jim Carrey fan or not, or even a Stanley Kubrick fan or not. (Personally, only of the ones mentioned, I'm only a Carrey fan, but only for about 70% of his films.) 'Vicky' seems just to be a simple story of two different, but best gal friends on holiday in Spain who both get seduced by a completely lost, and drama-followed painter (Bardem.) We learn of their loves/likes/dislikes and definitely unhappy lifestyles they either are leading or will live. Everyone is lost, unhappy or despicable. Barely a character will think twice about having an affair, a destructive threesome or someone else's feelings. In fact, the only character you feel for, or maybe supposed to care about is Chris, the finance/husband of Vicky, much like John C. Reilly's character, Amos, in 'Chicago'  both Amos and Chris are the only respectable characters/spouses in their movies and both are completely oblivious and naïve. Yet, we get to watch them get lied to, stomped on and kept in the dark throughout. Granted, both title characters did what they could with the material they were given, but the real reason I watched was for all the Oscar buzz concerning Penelope Cruz. Yes, she was good. Great? Not really. My vote still leans towards Marisa Tomei in 'The Wrestler.' And you have to stammer through the first 50 out of 96 minutes to finally see Cruz. Aside from her performance, I'm not surprised no other nominations were handed out. Oh, yeah, they were probably just as bored as I was."

As so many others have pointed out in these posts, the characters, without exception, are self-indulgent, spoiled, unlikeable hedonists who occupy their own tiny, self-absorbed worlds. While art, romance and relationships are intended (I suppose) to be examined and appreciated, the film succeeds only in trivializing and ridiculing anything of real value and merit.<br/><br/>The film lacks any stamp of Allen's typical wit and humor. In fact, I'm hesitant even to call it a comedy since it would be cruel to laugh at people so vacuous and pathetic. Sadly, the script gives the normally stellar cast precious little from which to create believable characters -- the result being a hodgepodge of clichés and stereotypes.

Not only is she unable to portray any emotion or moment realistically, the story lacks any true message or beauty beyond the surroundings. The narrator seems completely out of place and is painful to listen to when images could speak so much louder than his words. While there are brief flashes of light in which a thought is touched on, none are developed. Also, the characters themselves lack true development. None seem to grow from their experiences, simply filling stereotypes and lacking true human psychology.Overall this movie was a bitter disappointment."

However, I found the dialogue banal, the sense of drama non-existent and the narrator beyond annoying. The humor, if there was any, passed me by.

Since Antonio Banderas is old news, our readers chose masculine Javier Bardem.

They also chose Scarlett Johanssen because they would choose her in pretty much any film. And let's have all these beautiful people indulge in wine tasting, flying private airplanes and picking blackberries for breakfast while they muse about art and love, because that's apparently how hot-blooded Spanish painters spend their days in Barcelona.<br/><br/>Allen fails to show the flip side of this fairy tale-like Spanish life style, fails to show a sudden twist, a funny moment, his trade mark wit, or at least a hot threesome scene.

"bob the moo","Null","49","94","26 December 2008"," An excellent Woody Allen film that comes from a smart and sexy script, delivered with beautiful filming and strong performances from all
","I watched this film a few days after I had seen Allen's previous effort, Cassandra's Dream, and I must admit that I was going through a bit of a spell with him because, over the last decade I have almost had to defend his films that I have liked, while also acknowledging the man that are average or worse. However, like Spike Lee, I rarely find a film of his that isn't worth seeing  whether it is any good or not being another question. Vicky Cristina Barcelona was out in the US and the fact that I had access to a Woody Allen film suggested that it was better than some of his more recent work (a lot of which I never got the chance to see in any cinema) but I was also wary because this film was well-known for one specific thing and I figured that perhaps it was being helped by that, with the studio hoping the ""A Woody Allen film"" tag wouldn't put the teenage male crowd off paying to see what they came for!<br/><br/>I needn't have worried because it is like the man behind Cassandra's Dream and this film cannot be the same person. It is a excellent film and one that Allen's fans will love and perhaps, just perhaps, it may even be good enough to win over those that wouldn't give him the time of day far less the price of a cinema ticket. It helps that the film is firmly back on themes that Allen has done so well in the past  matters of the heart, of passion, of love, of lust, of marriage. The whole film plays in its entirety just like one of the many ""discussion"" scenes where the characters discuss these matters over coffee etc and it is this consistency that makes it such a joy because what we see minute to minute engages and that is pretty much what we get from the film as a whole  but not as a sum of the parts but as the whole producing the same as the parts but in a different way. This interests me and it is delivered with a colour and flamboyance that somehow never takes away from the intelligence and thoughtfulness behind the writing; I'm not sure how he did it because the narrative is so wild that it could easily have been silly, but he holds it together without it even looking difficult.<br/><br/>The use of a narrator concerned me at first  particularly since I had just seen Allen S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G everything out in big dialogue chunks in Cassandra's Dream but on the contrary here the narrator is used to link and mostly compliments by being droll and being a great voice (good casting job there). The cast are what will attract an audience to this film and, beyond them just being some very big names, they are all excellent. Bardem is just so effortlessly sexual and sensual that he perfectly fits Allen's writing of this passionate, creative love versus the steady and frankly dull love of Messina's Doug. Hall essentially takes the traditional Allen role but makes it work more than others trying it have done. She doesn't take the mannerisms so much as getting the character right and she is the heart of the film, thrown between passionate love and reliable love. No question which Cruz represents and she does it really, really well. Out of sight for the majority of the film she strikes like a thunder storm, totally wild and full of fire  but not to the point where she is unattractive or not tempting, which would have taken away from what she was trying to be. Johansson is easily the least of these talented names but even she does well; I won't say brilliant but she was good. Again, Welch was a good choice for narrator and I always enjoy Clarkson even if she has limited times to shine here.<br/><br/>Allen's direction is really good in regards the actors but of equal note is how he and Spanish cinematographer Aguirresarobe have delivered Barcelona to the viewer. The city contributed towards the making of the film and on the evidence of this it will be money well spent. The city looks beautiful, with great landscapes, plenty of colour to match the passion and a real sense that this is a place where art, passion and inspired sex is all around. Beyond being just wallpaper, this is of course a key part of the film's world and it is another part of the reason that this hooked me so easily.<br/><br/>Vicky Cristina Barcelona will likely be gushed over in the same way that any recent Woody Allen that isn't rubbish is hailed as a ""return to form"" etc. On this occasion though, such praise is not a knee-jerk but fully deserved. The film is intelligent, passionate, comic, free-flowing and enjoyably light. It looks the part and the cast take the natural, smart script and make the absolute most of it. I guess if you dislike Woody Allen then none of this will matter but to those that even have a liking for his better work, this film will hit the spot. It has been a while since I have had the words ""excellent"" and ""Woody Allen film"" together in the same sentence, but this is an excellent Woody Allen film."

","Although I enjoyed ""VCB"" more than any of Woody's movies since, say, ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" I was stunned at the amount and sterility of the voice-over narration. I'm of the (widely-held) opinion that narration should be used on the rarest of occasions and sparingly when it is used. Not only is there way too much of here, for some reason Woody chose an actor with no character or familiarity at all. It was as if Woody instructed the theater managers to have a descriptive audio feature installed so the entire audience could hear...as if he'd made the movie for the blind! Voiceovers, if they're required, should neither explain what the action on screen is, nor what is going on inside the characters' heads. ""VCB"" fails on both counts. And it's a beautiful movie that's ruined by it! Here are three recent examples of well-done VO, IMHO: The Coens' ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (also starring Johannson, as it happens); Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby,"" which is responsible for the terrific payoff at the end; and Scorcese's ""The Age of Innocence."" (Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" is the perfect all-time example of VO.) The first two are VO's of characters within the film, while the third is by Joanne Woodward, whose work adds wonderful flavor and texture to the already sumptuous images without overwhelming them, and it helps keep the viewer within the time and period, bringing the voice of Edith Wharton herself voice to life. I'm knocking 3 points here because of ""VCB""'s poor use and uselessness.<br/><br/>I suppose what fuels my displeasure more than a little bit is that I realize that Woody Allen has completely ""goyed"" himself; there's none of his wonderful Jewish witticisms and insights - and JOKES! - of his classic '70's/early '80's period. He's had WASP envy of rich Manhattanites for decades, from ""Interiors"" through ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" finally reaching full assimilation with ""Match Point."" ""VCB,"" even though it takes place in an exotic locale, proves that Woody is a full fledged WASP; you can't even tell he's on the outside looking in anymore! When I got home I had to watch ""Manhattan,"" which, after 30 years, is just as beautiful and engaging as it was when first released, and is one of the great romantic comedies of all time, even more so than ""Annie Hall"" (wait...maybe that's where the symptoms began, back in Chippewa Falls!]. Woody's VO at the beginning of ""Manhattan"" is describing the main character of the book he's trying to write: ""He romanticized New York all out of proportion..."" Woody Allen has succeeded in doing so with ""Barcelona."" The running joke in ""Stardust Memories"" was the complaint of Sandy Bates' (Woody) fans that he should make more movies like his ""earlier, funny ones."" My complaint: how 'bout making some more like his earlier, GOOD ones."

","From the first minute I was irritated by the voice-over of idiotic narration that simply broadcasts hideous laziness on the part of Woody Allen. Why would he assault us this way? What does he think he added? He apparently just wanted to make subtle showing of character unnecessary -- but then why bother making the movie at all? Let's see: Maybe he thinks no one can make Scarlett look as good as he can. Or maybe he thinks Javier Bardem is overrated and set out to prove it by forcing him to talk like a robot and squelch all his sexual power. Oh, I know: maybe he just wants to show that he's such a genius that it doesn't matter what the actors do; they're really little more than mannequins, really, for him to hang his designs on. I imagine him squeezing the spirit out of the greatest actors alive, and can't understand why superstars like Bardem and Cruz would agree to work with him. Except for Penelope Cruz, Allen has managed to turn his whole talented cast into body-snatched versions of himself, as usual. I'm fed up with him."

Javier Bardem is one of the sexiest men, and best actors, alive. Penelope Cruz's is a living Barbie Doll. How could Allen take these two sexually attractive creatures and build a lifeless, bloodless, dry as dead leaves, utterly boring, inept film around them? How long has Allen been making movies? And yet he commits a cardinal sin that the greenest tyro is warned against: a movie is a *movie*, not a book. Let your movie tell your story. Don't provide voice-over narration. There are exceptions of course; film noir, for stylistic reasons, relies on voice-over narration.<br/><br/>But why, in this pathetic, amateurish exercise, is there a nerdy, dispassionate, uninteresting, flat, white male voice horning in on the action, and narrating almost every scene? Two beautiful young American girls get into a taxi cab at a Spanish airport. The narrator, sounding like an antiseptic-soaked cotton swab, there to remove you from any suspension of disbelief, or involvement, you may have been able to conjure up, announces, flatly, ""Vicky and Cristina are two beautiful young American girls. They are getting into a taxicab at a Spanish airport,"" or some such cloddish, invasive, commentary.<br/><br/>Did Allen do this because he knows he is too old and too marked by his tabloid love life to appear in his own movies? And, so, rather than having to watch Allen on screen, directing everything, including the viewer's emotional response, with the fury of a puppeteer who doesn't much like or respect his own puppets, but, rather, envies them their youth, beauty, and sex appeal, and so makes them as ridiculous and empty as possible, we have to endure this grating voice of voice-over narration? I mean, really. You're a filmmaker. You are blessed enough to have *Javier Bardem* and *Penelope Cruz* in your movie. What degree of arrogance, of cluelessness, would lead you to believe that the audience needs to be *told*, by this nerdy little American male voice, what Bardem and Cruz are thinking, feeling, doing, when these superb performers are on screen, acting everything out with their top notch talent? Anyway, the plot is a bore, and utterly without insight. The movie is all about screwing and it says nothing new or true about love or people or relationships. The viewer is given nothing to care about, to cry over, even to laugh at. Watch the movie Allen was trying to make, ""Jules and Jim."""

"Gyran","1","13","22","20 May 2010"," Whatever Doesn't Work
","I find it paradoxical that Woody Allen's worst films, such as Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona are currently the only ones that are box office successes. His better films are mainly viewed by just a few people in New York, the West Coast and France. Woody's films are erratically released in the UK, so I saw this after his later, much better, effort Whatever Works.<br/><br/>Basically, this is yet another remake of Manhatten. The difference is that the emotionally retarded, selfish characters in Manhatten are funny. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is meant to be serious drama. At least I think it is since I did not crack a smile in the entire 96 minutes.<br/><br/>We know from the films that Allen made in the UK that he has a tin ear for British English and he sets his stories in a bogus England that has never existed. I suspect that his Barcelona is equally bogus. The film looks like a 1950s travelogue. It has an inept voice-over and some irritating travelogue-style incidental music. The voice-over does not tell us anything that we cannot see: ""They particularly enjoyed the works of Gaudi"" (shot of Barcelona Cathedral) ""and Miró (shot of Vicky and Cristina admiring a Miró. ""They strolled past the church in the wonderful summer night air while people celebrated"" (V&C walk past a church while people light fireworks. ""finally winding up about midnight in a little restaurant"", (we see V&C sitting in a restaurant).<br/><br/>Juan Antonio, played by a bemused-looking Javier Bardem, takes Vicky for a meal and, at the end, says: ""Would you like to go to hear some wonderful guitar tonight?"". Cut to a scene in a candlelit garden where a small group of people listen rapturously to a guitarist playing Albeniz. It gives the impression that there are guitarists continuously hanging around Barcelona gardens on the off-chance that someone might want to hear some wonderful guitar music. This level of bogusness makes me wonder whether I am being naïve about Woody's New York films. Maybe they are equally bogus.<br/><br/>Maybe Woody directed this on autopilot while he was thinking about the plot of Whatever Works. Vicky actually says ""Whatever works"" in response to the revelation that Cristina is enjoying a threesome with Juan Antonio and his ex-wife. There is the same ludicrous plot development where Cristina's holiday snaps get elevated to the level of great art. It is funny in Whatever Works but preposterous here. It only serves as an excuse to get Scarlett Johannson and Penelope Cruz into a darkroom for a bit of lesbian action. This being a Woody Allen film there is no on-screen sex so what we have is a film with soft-porn production values but without the soft-porn.<br/><br/>The actors struggle throughout to make sense of the ludicrous dialogue. Rebecca Hall is the most successful. At the beginning of the film she looks as though she could be a worthy successor to Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow as a Woody Allen muse but eventually even she too is submerged in a sea of implausibility."

Cristina is game, but Vicky is not, but the point here is the dialogue that took place in this exchange was the best give and take in any movie that I have heard in a long time. And,I thought: Woody is back. <br/><br/>But, like a lot of comedies where the best stuff is in the beginning and then peters out as the movie goes on, the same thing happened here.

Woody was back only for the first 10-minutes of this movie. After that there was no hook and he gave up. <br/><br/>Whoa!

And mostly there 's no interest at all for Spanish culture, history and society. Barcelona becomes a small fantasy world. While this vision - a world whose borders are defined by the status of a middle class on the verge of extinction - worked perfectly in his early masterpieces of the seventies and eighties, here becomes flat, boring and mostly annoying.

Because of the detachment, some viewers might feel adrift -- as it is, I enjoy movies that just show me stuff without telling me what the author thinks is right.<br/><br/>As nice as it all was, I don't get the award buzz.

The first half hour of the movie is annoyingly disjointed, as it is frequently punctuated by a very unnecessary American narrator, pointlessly telling us about who the characters are and what they're doing, instead of allowing us to understand them through an old-style technique called 'acting'.<br/><br/>The character of Juan Antonio's wife spends the entire movie screaming, telling us more about Allen's own relationships with woman than about the characters in this film. And again, we don't care about her - we just wish she would shut up and go away. The only character that isn't 2-dimensional is Vicki's husband - he's so flat he's 1-dimensional. The term ""cookie cutter"" is used by the characters, and that could not be a more ironic description.<br/><br/>The cinematography is lovely and there are some great shots of Catalanian architecture, including La Sagrada Familia (studied intensively by Vicki yet who still refers to it ignorantly as ""Gaudi's Church"").

Allen almost always writes love triangle and most times fails to express some deeper meaning through the life of main character. Some writer from the 'Bold and the Beautiful' could have made the script for Vicky Cristina Barcelona.<br/><br/>Woody Allen makes a film in a year - for some incomprehensible reason.

If you're going to tell a story, at least try to make it interesting and ease off on the use of narratives. The characters in this story are uninteresting, uninspiring and unlikable and if you were trying to create another Sideways for women, it does not work. Your movie lacks the freshness and zest that made Sideways so wonderful. Relationships come and go, people are fickle and confused and are chronically wanting more to fill in the emptiness. We already know that and you don't have you take it upon yourself to try to drive these points home because frankly who can like a movie that goes out of its way to make people feel sad.<br/><br/>Also, your movie deals with issues such as marital infidelity, mental illness, cultural conflict and anger but does so in such a heavy-handed and pedestrian way that by the time the movie is over ... and in this movie time drags ... nothing has been resolved, everything is a mess, the characters go on with their lives and the conflicts persist.

"Galina_movie_fan","9","18","36","25 August 2008"," Woody Allen's Spanish Triumph
","""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" (2008), a new film written/directed by Woody Allen, is a charming dramedy/romance that takes place during one summer in the capital of Spanish Province, Catalonia, Barcelona which is known as Antonio Gaudi's city. Allen has moved even further away from Manhattan but in his new film, the characters and their dilemmas remind a lot of the Manhattanites from his best pictures with their neuroses, search for love and meaning of life, and their ironic dialogues. We also meet two Spanish characters here played by Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. Bardem's Juan Antonio is a popular bohemian painter who would take a serious place in the lives of two American tourists, young women named Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Christina (Allen's current Muse and inspiration, Scarlet Johansson. He is certainly in love with her voluptuous figure and especially her sensual lips. The male characters in at least two his films with Ms. Johansson repeat the same exact compliment to her lips. Time will tell if she ever gives performances as memorable, moving and subtle as Diane's or Mia's or Dianne's). Cruz was easily the best part of the delightful movie. As an estranged wife of Bardem's Juan Antonio, she created the force of nature out of her character. She was unbelievably good - crazy, sexy, beautiful, passionate. She and Bardem stole the show and redefined the term ""On screen chemistry"". Forget Vicky Christina - it should be called Maria Elena Barcelona - after Cruz's character. To her belongs the most hilarious ""A deus ex machina"" scene in the end of the movie that I've seen for long time. Penelope Cruz MUST play in either Spanish movies or in Woody's movies. She reminds me of a Greek mythological hero, Antaeus, the son of Earth. As long as he stayed on Earth, she would give him power and strength to fight Heracles, the greatest hero Greece ever knew. Once Heracles pulled him off Earth and kept him on Air, Antaeus' strength was gone. When Cruz plays in her native language in her Country, she is magnificent. When she plays in inferior American movies, she is nothing but a pretty face and a nice body. It was fun to see how good and effortless Bardem is in a romantic dramedy after his scary Oscar winning turn with the bad haircut and deadly air gun in ""No country for Old Men"". There is also Patricia Clarkson in a supporting role, talented, reliable, and subtle. Barcelona is a dream. I've been there in 2000 and I still regret that we had to leave to continue our tour. The Gaudi buildings and Park Güell are alone worth the price of admission. Spanish guitar music would kill you softly with its melodious passion. What is there not to like? For this Allen's devoted fan, ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" is a dream come true.<br/><br/>It is interesting that Allen himself considers Vicky Cristina Barcelona ""a very sad film."" Yes, it is sad because like in many Allen's films, the characters would not get the answers for their questions. And being truly, deeply, madly in love would not make a couple happy because mad love creates such charged and heated atmosphere between them that they simply can't survive in it. The words of another famous cynic come to mind, ""A Man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her"", and this is a sad realization. What is not sad, though that Allen at the age of 72 still knows how to make a marvelous movie, to which his Spanish project is a glorious proof."
"tabuno","6","2","2","20 January 2019"," Overly Intellectualized, Forced Drama
","6 February 2009. Vicky Christina Barcelona The title of the movie refers to the names of two young women, Vicky and Christina who visit Barcelona Spain and encounter an attractive, brash, seductive, and articulate Spanish man who raises doubts and well as insights in these women. Unfortunately the movie is severely hampered by a distracting, unnecessary voice over, opens earlier with a nice but repetitious musical rendition, and the overly incessant voice of Woody Allen who wrote and directed the movie. It is almost inescapable from experiencing the women artificially parroting Mr. Allen's unique way of thinking and talking which only adds to the awkwardness of the movie.<br/><br/>The voice-over is so basically repetitious explaining most of the particulars of what is going on in the movie that it interferes with the acting and expressive ability to allow the performers from telling the story. The movie experience is like having to sit through to separate and parallel portrayal of the same events. The voice-over only serves to either implicitly send out the message that the audience is either too dumb to understand what's going on or the actors are so bad that they can't perform sufficient to relay the story by themselves. A good example is the severe but perhaps unjustified criticism of the voice-over narrative (relatively scarce actually) in Blade Runner (1982) which in that movie provided additional mental thoughts of Harrison Ford that added substance to the movie instead of just supplanted or stated the obvious as in this movie.<br/><br/>And why the use of the flashback to reveal an additional relational subplot? To its credit, Vicky Christina Barcelona eventually evolves into a more in-depth and meaningful look at the consequences, complications of relationships often overlooked or skimmed over in other dramatic or romantic comedies. However, this relational ""situational"" marriage theme was also explored with the release the same year (2008) of ""Revolutionary Road"" with as much or more intensity or cinematic impact dealing with a 1950s period piece starring Leo DeCaprio and Kate Winslet who are provided with a script that allows them freedom to act the roles and lives they are portraying instead of Allen's intellectualizing musing of these deep relational uneasy themes.<br/><br/>The last part of the movie is cinematically different from the rest of the movie, more hurried, more explanatory, more quickly edited - sort like pushing out a work in progress. By the end, this rather long slice of life piece ends up dissatisfying unable to quench the thirst of an experiential series of events, and neither do the characters in the movie."
"ElMaruecan82","8","2","2","25 January 2018"," Behind every great lover, there's a city...
","In ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"", Woody Allen reinvents the notion of schools of loves through the conflicting visions of two friends in their early 20's, visiting Barcelona for the first time.<br/><br/>
Rebecca Hall is Vicky, the sensed and practical one, she's no less romantic than the average girl but she has loving rhyming with living, she takes love seriously and so her coming marriage with Doug (Chris Messina) a young junior manager who, if not the fire of senseless passion, doesn't lack the promising capability to be a good 'provider'.<br/><br/>
Scarlett Johannsson is Christina, the passionate Ying to Vicky's wise Yan, she's an idealistic woman who envisions love as a sort of omelet that doesn't go without breaking eggs, there must have a good deal of suffering and hurting, proportionally to the heights of passions to be reached. She didn't find the true love, but she's still at an age where questions have the edge over answers. And it's interesting how their occupations reflect their personalities.<br/><br/>
Vicky is a linguist who came to Barcelona to study Catalan identity, Christina is an aspiring director or photographer, an artist to make it short. The two girls have fundamentally opposed views on love, but they won't amount to much in Barcelona, the third side of a fascinating love triangle. After having romanticized the Big Apple and then deconstructed its romantic myth, coming totally full circle with his cherished hometown, Woody Allen embarked on a European trip in the early 2000's and the halt in Barcelona was certainly one of the most notable and inspired. <br/><br/>
With three dozens of movies on the clock, Allen sure acquired a unique talent to make a city feel alive through the film, and with the Gaudi signature, the cathedrals and the restaurants open at midnight, we know it's a matter of time before any convictions is swept up by the romantic mood of city. Indeed, with a town like Barcelona in the backdrop, half a Casanova's work is done. And when Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio comes and proposes the girls a little trip to Oviedo, granted he embodies all the suave charm of the Spanish lover, but he's like endorsed by the hypnotic beauty of the city. <br/><br/>
It's an old trick many womanizers apply, at a time where you had to cruise and be charming on the spot, not behind a screen, they generally went to the spot flourishing with tourists. Any lady-killer could stroll in Paris in Luxembourg Gardens during summer, a free visit to an English tourist enamored with the city would be the kind of proposals that'd rarely encounter a ""no"". But while Vicky can see behind the game and Christina just get in the flow, and before we know it, the 'no' became a 'yes'. Not sure the trick would work in America with all the sexual harassment talk but in 2008, everybody found it romantic ... so it's not just a matter of geographical context.<br/><br/>
The trip doesn't follow exactly the trajectory we expect, or maybe it does, but just take a little detour, allowing the complicity to blossom between Juan Antonio, the tormented artist and Vicky. Juan Antonio had struck Chrsitina's attention because of some backstory about the conflicting relationship he had with his ex-wife, but the character he shows to Vicky is oddly matching her own approach to life and art, to the point that her attention toward her fiancée gradually slips. <br/><br/>
The trouble with cities like Barcelona, cities with a soul, is that you can't tell to which extent they influence your perceptions. Does Vicky appreciate Juan's company because she's in the perfect context for that, holiday, summer, relaxation or is the attraction genuine? To complicate things a little, her fiancé comes, to celebrate a first wedding in Spain, while Juan gets back to Christina. Something very interesting happens then in the mind of Vicky, that doesn't need any fancy analysis, it's summed up in one exchange: Juan says she and her fiancé are made for each other, and in a typical Allenian move, she's offended.<br/><br/>
Why is that serious relationships or ambitions that imply steady comforts are perceived as negative? To the film's defense, this is not what ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" advocates, it does provide a nice glimpse on Spanish Bohemian life and I don't know anyone who wouldn't be tempted to live with a glass of wine everyday, painting and making love or living in a ménage a trois. In the very context of the film, it is appealing, but the antidote is clearly provided by the fourth and most memorable character of the film, Penelope Cruz as the ex-wife. Earning her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, this is not just a credit to her talent but to her weight in a rather lighthearted film.<br/><br/>
Before her entrance, the film made an effort to portray Juan as an attractive man and men like Doug as boring and ""knowing nothing about passion"" and only leading to failing and hypocritical couples such as the one formed by Chris Dunn and Patricia Clarkson.. If the film doesn't strike for its subtle characterization (Allen generally excels in this game even for minor characters), at least it provides a character who's so passionate you just want to take the next plane not to New York, but to Alaska. As Maria Elena, Penelope Cruz plays a jealous, envious, suicidal, possessive, luscious woman, who takes art to a level of destruction and destruction to the level of art, to the point that what starts like a sensual adventure with three people finally prompts Christina to pull herself together and leave.<br/><br/>
It is a credit to Allen for not having surrendered to a total triumph of passion over reason, the ending suggests that when it comes to love, nothing is really what it's all cracked up to be and sun is always sunnier in the other side of the Atlantic, especially under the sky of Barcelona."
"classicsoncall","7","2","2","19 October 2017"," ""What do you want in life besides a man with the right shorts?""
","Anyone else get the impression that Javier Bardem's character Juan Antonio had no interest in anything but sex? If you didn't perceive that along the way, then it becomes more than evident when he seduces Vicky (Rebecca Hall) the final time, regardless of her conflicted feelings and potential collapse of her fledgling marriage. If anything, the movie's theme can be best summed up by the character of Cristina (Scarlett Johannson), who the fiery Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) pegs as possessing 'chronic dissatisfaction'. That struck a chord with this viewer, as I'm sure many people of both genders are struck with a semblance of chronic dissatisfaction in their lives or careers. In this picture, it appeared that the condition applied to just about every principal and ancillary character, except Juan Antonio of course, since he found ways to satisfy himself virtually every day of the week.<br/><br/>This was a different kind of role for Bardem, hard to reconcile against his relentless assassin turn in ""No Country for Old Men"". He was just so smooth, one could actually envy him. But it's Cruz who gets my vote as the fulcrum on which this story pivots, just catch her expression when she arrives with a pistol to take out Juan Antonio. Wow! Such brazen hatred in someone so lovely. I don't know if that was enough to earn her the Best Supporting Actress because she wasn't on screen that long, and not until the latter half of the picture, but for the amount of time you saw her, she presented an amazingly complex character.<br/><br/>But when it all came to an end, it didn't seem like there was anyone left better for the experience. Life is like that sometimes, so I guess loose ends have their place. The one thing I could have done without in the story was the droning narration by Christopher Evan Welch. I found it more distracting than helpful, tending to lower one's expectations for something exciting to happen. What I would have liked was something larger written for Juan Antonio's father Julio (Josep Maria Domènech). He looked like a character waiting to happen."

Woody has entered Almodovar territory, physically, sexually and emotionally. Cruz merely has to show up in her passionate Almadovar kit. She's an emotional basketcase, a sexual genius, a painter.<br/><br/>The third woman is the new bit in this equation. She's the most attractive, the most self aware. Where the film is sets about watching the exploration of selves in place, she is a student of that place. She is the one who sees and fears and yet indulges. She is the true love, or rather her existence is what makes love possible.<br/><br/>Her occupation is the ""study"" of Catalon culture.<br/><br/>The radical observation here is that she leaves the place, this empowering it.<br/><br/>-- and of course the third grand element is not that this is Barcelona, but Gaudi's Barcelona. The place is only accidentally a physical place. It's really a spatial philosophy that suits (and indeed invented) the notion of superimposed ambiguous sexual emotions on space.<br/><br/>We are, for all the womanly registration scenes, in Gaudi spaces, either physically or by reference. Energies from the soul recorded, enticed and charmed from the forms we see in two dimensions.<br/><br/>If Woody ever were to do a three D movie, this would be the one. Alas, he passes. And he omits the most complex and life- changing place, the crypt of the unfinished chapel. Shame on his advisers.<br/><br/>This is essential Tedg stuff. Introspection. Complex love, it's relationship to attraction, what it means to be a woman and how that can be traced in cinematic architectural sex.<br/><br/>As a Woodyfold, it ranks with my other subtle favorite which it may well replace in my pantheon of essential films ""Sweet and Lowdown.""<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","As a man who married his own daughter, Woody Allen is not someone whose views on women one would want to feel comfortable agreeing with. Finding contempt with his opinions is made easy by this astonishingly juvenile movie in which he attempts to make us believe that he is celebrating the complexity and variety of women and their needs, wants, and passions, but ends up painting all four women in the story as exactly the same. All women, according to this movie, are eternally discontent, unsatisfied with any semblance of stability or balance, and crave only danger and chaos, whether secretly or openly, whether they live it or just dream of living it but don't dare. It is a disturbing all-the-same-once-you-scratch-the-surface view of half the human race that is matched only by his similar one dimensional portrayal of Europeans (i.e. non-Americans). They're all the same aren't they - but they're not like ""us' so who can figure 'em out? Hey that's a great basis for a comedy. Isn't it? A sick movie by a sick man."

Penelope Cruz's character was somewhat entertaining, but that was about it. I may have laughed once or twice. Barcelona is beautiful, but the location feels false and imposed upon the movie to make it more interesting.

","I liked one third of this recent Woody Allen film, the Barcelona part. I've visited the city two or three times and shot in golden light, it's beautifully brought to the screen in all its Gaudi and Miro-Inflected glory.<br/><br/>Unfortunately his actors keep getting in the way of the scenery and worse they're talking the most pretentious nonsense and acting out the most ridiculous story you could imagine. It all starts in a Barcelona bar when two rich and supposedly intellectual adventure- seeking American tourists catch the eye of a swarthy Spaniard who immediately abandons the company he's keeping to proposition the pair of them by inviting them to join him on a private plane ride to Ovieda where he confidently asserts he will sleep with them both. Well girls, the Spanish word for ""Police!"" is ""Policia"", which is of course what anyone else would shout under the circumstances, but in Woody's world this is plot development so naturally they go with it and of course it duly happens. Did I mention that Javier Bardem as said Spaniard is a temperamental artist with a complicated love-life and that Scarlett Johannsen as the free spirit of the two girls is a short-film director-cum-photographer and that Rebecca Moore as the passive, vulnerable one has a degree in Catalan? So everyday, as ever in Allen's films. All the time he's with them, Bardem talks about about the stormy relationship he had with his ex-wife which is when you realise that Penelope Cruz must turn up soon and sure enough, she does, having failed in an overdose attempt and now keen to start a ménage-a-trois with Barden and Johannsen. <br/><br/>Okay, I can't write this anymore, my memory's hurting at the remembrance of it. This is an absolutely awful movie from a so-called master-director who has lost all sense of timing, finesse and skill. He even employs a narrator (again), an actor with a voice uncannily similar to his own younger-self to move the story along or tell us how his characters think, which in retrospect is helpful as the viewers need all the help they can get to follow the convolutions of the story here. If Woody wants to regale us for the umpteenth time about the relationship between the sexes, with a little twist contrasting western reserve and Latin passion, he has to do it with a better written, played and directed piece than this. It's an absolute mess, trite, contrived and about as far removed from reality as I am from the moon. <br/><br/>Oh and that little flamenco ""Barcelona"" number will drive you crazy too, by the end."

","I had high hopes for this film, even though I could see before entering that it was only being played at a small number of venues nationwide. Of course, the pre-release buzz about the explicit sexuality was grossly overblown. Oh boy, we get to see Penelope and Scarlett kiss. The basic initial setup for the movie seemed promising enough. You had the Spanish male painter, who previously had been in a tempetuous romance with Cruz's character. Their dealings had to be severed since there was no possible way they could get along. He was transitioning out of Cruz into Christina when Vicky starts attracting his attention. Vicky is the quintessential left-brain female (i.e. driven by logic, order, & rationality). However, the painter is conflicted because he had initially rebounded onto Christina before noticing Vicky. Now, the implicit catfight that is expected never materializes. Instead, we have the farcical threesome relationship where everyone is happy, no one wants too much, and everything works out. The hugest canard of all foisted upon the audience is that the two females engaging in kissing and miscellaneous eroticism toward each other could engage in a one-time dalliance without any long-term alteration of either person. I guess, if Woody's idea is to change reality, he's going to have a lot more to do than put out a single act and idea in a movie to alter things. Christina, on the other hand, is the prototypical right-brain female guided by feelings and creative pursuits. Javier employs a number of devices to illicit sexual desires from both Vicky and Christina. However, Penelope's character re-enters the picture to make the waters more murky. The movie was meandering around trying to find a sensible conclusion to this threesome's predicament when it just abruptly ends. It hearkens back to the early 70's when films had crazy, abrupt conclusions that had people exiting the cinema scratching their head. In this case, they are scratching their heads both trying to figure out both why the movie ended as it did and the more important question being how had they had been suckered again into believing that stars as big as Scarlett or Penelope would show anything or be in any demonstrable way explicitly sexual. I guess if you just want to see pretty women this is fair. However, you can see them without going outside your home (previous movies or internet pictures). This movie can be summed up as a marginal DVD rental at Blockbuster. I guess this film was not viewed positively by me since I had recently seen the exquisite Fay Ann Lee film ""Falling For Grace"", which was almost flawless. Compared to that, Woody is lucky I even threw him a bone with the DVD rental. Be very careful that you don't get too disappointed with this one."
"Absyrd","9","14","30","25 August 2008"," Classic Woody
","Who knows what to expect from Woody Allen? Most of the films he's made this decade have been pretty unpredictable, and suspiciously Allen has agreed with the public reaction regarding most of them. I thought Melinda and Melinda was a fine, worthwhile effort, Scoop was just mostly mediocre, Match Point was the best film of Allen's career, and Cassandra's Dream was easily the worst he's made. So considering his recent schizophrenic attitude, I wasn't sure where I'd go with this film, but I was still looking forward to it, mostly for Cruz's supposed Oscar-worthy performance and, well, you gotta give the guy credit after so many years of brilliant comedies, and even his failures being interesting failures.<br/><br/>The film centers around two best friends (Vicky and Cristina) who decide to spend the Summer in Barcelona, and while there they are both faced with romantic conflicts with an artist, Juan Antonio, who has invited them to his home for the weekend to get to know each other and have sex. But it's not a love/hate, conventional jealous-romance-plot, it's situations are entirely human and almost brooding in a sort of loosely ardent manner. A lot goes on between their relationships, especially with Cristina, who develops among the strangest love circles ever put on film which I'd rather not give away. Vicky, who is about to get married, forms a sudden attraction towards Juan, but I never really saw it as sexual attraction, but rather as an escape from the knowledge of the desolate reality of commitment. Oh, and did I mention Juan's psychotic manic-depressive ex-wife eventually comes into the picture? Despite the absurdity of the entire situation, the whole thing is executed with definitive authenticity. Part of that may be because of the natural dialogue, which was right off the bat the obvious work of Woody Allen. The perfect dialogue combined with the absurdity of the situation created several absolutely perfect moments of comedic timing. It's characters are smart and human, not just self-aware variations of cliché'd romantic comedy characters. It's situations are not tired and consistently replicated ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl"" plots, but an episodic stream of events packed with energy and originality just about every other romantic comedy this year seemed to lack.<br/><br/>But alas, not all was perfect. The film's narrator spoke with an irritatingly robotic tone, along with narration being entirely pointless from the start, and I also thought the film spent too long expressing Vicky's passionless relationship with her husband (which in a way, may have been intentional)... but it's an otherwise tiny flaw which hardly detracted from the overall joyful experience Woody has provided. And yes, give Cruz that Oscar.<br/><br/>8.75/10"
"nootch23","4","3","4","1 August 2013"," A rare Woody Allen film that wasn't for me
","Let me start with what I liked about this movie. I liked the sexual tension that the movie had and every actor played their respective character extremely well. I loved the dialogue even though at times it seemed a little much. The camera movement and angles were fantastic and I've always loved how Woody uses the city (no matter which city) and its landmarks to the point where they become a character in its own right.<br/><br/>What I disliked about the film was the narration. I like narration when it gives an extra insight to a singular character(s) but I don't like narration to be used to tell me the story as if it was a book. To me, that is taking the easy way out of making a film and it tends to cheapen the actors skill in telling the story through the characters. The narration I feel makes the characters interactions feel almost like filler. I didn't like the introduction of Vicky's classmate character who gets the wrong impression about their spending time together. That character offered nothing to the plot or to any development of Vicky's character. Even Vicky's husband, played by Chris Messina, I felt wasn't used properly. I didn't hate Vicky for her indiscretions and nor did I hope they would remain happily married once she made up her mind. I was left very complacent about the characters.<br/><br/>I felt very disappointed in this movie because I wanted to love it. I wanted it to be the next Woody Allen film that I would really love but was very disappointed."

","From the first frame of the film when Vicky and Cristina walk out of the airport in Barcelona, to the engaging scenes and film that follows, I am haunted by the memory of Henry James novel The American and this time the setting is in Barcelona, with the adventures of Vicky and Cristina amusingly set out by Woody Allen with a top notch cast and tremendous dialog. Oh, to be young and adventurous again in Spain as an American! BARCELONA has such interesting twists and turns in relationships and the actors play against the personal dramas with great flair and humor. Javier Bardem is marvelous as the ""Spanish Painter/Stud"" and he makes it so convincing when he romances the females who pander to his masculinity and attractiveness. Penelope Cruz, hot off of ELEGY, is really a spark plug here, and Scarlett Johansson performs a role which reminded me of her character in LOST IN TRANSLATION, a film I loved.<br/><br/>Patricia Clarkson, wonderful also in ELEGY, Kevin Dunn, Rebecca Hall and Chris Messina round out the cast with characters that all have their own issues to resolve. However, when the summer comes to an end, you wonder how the characters will start their lives again, and will they return to the magical times they all had in Barcelona? Bravo, Woody, for your ""postcard from Spain""."

","In Love & Death Diane Keaton's character at one point says to Woody's character that ""Sex without love is a meaningless experience."" Woody retorts ""Yes, but as meaningless experiences go, it's one of the best.' I think that almost describes what this movie is all about. The movie is not about work and career, children and family, or the meaning of Life. It about sex, art, vacations, beauty, danger and fun. So, it's a movie that should appeal to all those who've spent most of their lives pursuing the former. It reminded me somewhat of Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy (although without the cinematographic genius of Gordon Willis). It's also a movie that you should be able to safely take someone who's not a Woody die-hard. Some feel Woody's movies will lean toward the intellectual, but this is not that.<br/><br/>Also, I've never been a big Penelope Cruz fan, but, WOW, here she is the best part of the movie. Very sexy and she got some of the biggest laughs even though she wasn't really doing anything comedic, but rather by just being crazy with complete believability.<br/><br/>As a Woody fan who's seen the best he can do I'd give this an 8 or 9, but compared to all the other movies playing in theatres today it's definitely a 10."
"doctorsmoothlove","6","9","18","7 September 2008"," Don't tell me what I already know
","Remember those times when you would go see summer's biggest blockbuster only to be interrupted by someone's incessant commentary. It was probably when you viewed Lord of the Rings (any of them) or maybe Titanic. Rarely, though, does a movie itself provide this experience for you. Woody Allen is always known for his ""talkie"" movies but Vicky Cristina Barcelona is ridiculous. The film's horrible voice-over narration disrupts the narrative and inserts unnecessary dialog in key points.<br/><br/>The film follows two best friends as they spend a summer in Spain. Cristina is a professional, post-feminist woman who is engaged to be married to a cookie-cutter businessman. The other is her enigmatic friend, Cristina who doesn't have anything better to do. They arrive in Barcelona and Cristina begins studying for her Master's in Catalan Identity (I haven't found an institution which offers this degree..). The story begins formally when they meet an artist at a late-night restaurant. This guy is every man's idolized hero. He asks both of them to accompany him to a remote village for sightseeing and lovemaking. Vicky agrees enthusiastically but Cristina is hesitant, given her ""traditional"" perception of romance. It doesn't matter, though, since both women travel with him (but Cristina only agrees to go to guard her friend).<br/><br/>Once they arrive, our hero Juan Antonio proceeds to intoxicate the women and invites them to his room. Cristina disagrees under feminist objections to his pitiful attempt. So only Vicky agrees, but right before they begin, she becomes ill. This is rather annoying, as Allen proceeds to tell us exactly how she feels at different points in her illness. While Vicky recovers, Juan Antonio and Cristina tour the town. She begins to warm up to his artistic-inspired confidence and aloofness. This sequence, as well as Vicky's recover culminates with Cristina and Juan Antonio's consensual sex (It is ironic since Vicky exhibits greater desire for Juan than her friend does). Cristina is traumatized by this and develops feelings for Juan Antonio. Vicky does too, and becomes his girlfriend once they return to Barcelona.<br/><br/>The movie picks up the pace and Cristina's disposable husband-to-be arrives. He is the opposite of Juan Antonio in nearly every way, and no one likes him (including Cristina). He always wears professional clothing, is obsessed with owning a large home, and condemns Vicky's (recent) frivolous relationship. Vicky begins to suspect her relationship as well once Juan's estranged wife, María Elena, arrives. Vicky becomes jealous as she sees her relationship crumble but eventually comes to enjoy living with María Elena and her former husband. There's even a PG-13 lesbian scene (which is how I convinced some of my friends to see the movie).<br/><br/>As the film ends, Cristina decides that she doesn't want to live in a love triangle and heads to France for a vacation-within-a-vacation. This opening allows Cristina one last chance to see Antonio before returning home, and her hand is shot by jealous María Elena. None on the girls wins Juan Antonio, and Vicky and Cristina return home having changed little from their experience. Vicky is still unsure of what she wants to do and Cristina is engaged to Average Joe. At least they got to see Barcelona, right? As you've read in my purposely long and poorly written plot synopsis, I wasn't pleased with this film. Allen's story isn't bad, and is mostly well-acted but is terribly narrated. This is a film which relies on its actors to portray characters as the audience intends them, which limits character growth. Oh well, Penélope Cruz does much with her limited screen time in creating Juan's suicidal wife. She looks savage handling the gun yet intimate in her romances. Javier Barden both looks and acts like the gentle artist he portrays, but the leading actors weren't as impressive. Scarlet Johansson acts like a stereotypical coffee-shop grad student in her fickleness and inability to determine the course of her life. And then we come to Rebecca Hall as Vicky. Her character is wooden and underdeveloped. She is unhappy in her attraction to Juan Antonio yet bares this discontent and learns nothing from it. Oh, and I find it amusing that she is a Catalan Identity student who can speak neither Catalan nor Spanish.<br/><br/>My numerous, intense descriptions mimic the narration by Christopher Welch which removes any ability for personal interpretation. He lacks the voice to narrate a movie this extensively, and at many times, sounds as if he is presenting a report for a first-year English course. Narration (in dramas) is supposed to provide limited insight in characters' thoughts so that the audience can interpret directors' visions. Audiences may draw personal conclusions as well from narration depending on its ambiguity. Vicky Cristina Barcelona precludes the audience from this practice and is incapable of creating a memorable experience because of it.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Allen is able to overcome that critical handicap with a wonderful display of the complexity of human sexuality. I think the Spanish setting (and public funding) is what allowed him to do this. Spanish-language media frequently addresses sexual relationships which we in North America consider controversial. Incest is a theme I've seen in several Spanish-language novels (particularly in Isabel Allende's La Casa de los Espirtius) and films (Pedro Almódovar's Volver). Multiple partners and exiting difficult marriages are also prevalent themes (especially in Lorca's plays). Allen deserves much credit for acknowledging cultural identity in his film.<br/><br/>The movie is also a critique of American culture. Welch tells us that Vicky enjoys living with Juan Antonio because of his abstinence from consumerism. Allen's message is augmented by Cristina's husband's lack of desire to engage in anything other than consumerism. The effect works nicely. Again, this isn't my interpretation but Allen's obvious message which Welch delivers. Final Consensus: ** and 1/2 out of ****"
"EThompsonUMD","8","10","21","10 December 2008"," Woody's Euro Sex Caper
","Compared to such somber, even bleak, recent Woody Allen movies as ""Match Point"" and ""Cassandra's Dream,"" ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" has a good deal of humor. Yet to bill the film as a comedy - while no doubt shrewd marketing - is misleading both as to its quantity of chuckles and even more so in regard to its plot resolution. The film is not by any means a Hollywood style screwball romantic comedy, not even of the ironic failed romance variety that characterized such Allen classics as ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan."" <br/><br/>Rather, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is akin to many European and some American indie film adult sex comedies, focusing less on the boy-gets-girl removal of obstacles to idealized love and more on the foibles and vagaries of sexual attraction and human mating patterns. Such comedies are populated by flawed human beings whose choices in love reflect their own limitations and usually end in compromise or unhappiness  that is, realistically rather than romantically. Viewers prepared to accept this approach will really like ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona""; those expecting a full resurrection of ""funny Woody"" may be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film's semantically curious title refers to its twenty-something central characters Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) along with its romance-inspiring setting (Barcelona). While on a visit to Spain, the American friends are invited to share the rather opulent Barcelona residence of Vicky's family friend (Patricia Clarkson). Vicky is doing research on ""Catalan identity"" for her Master's thesis and killing time waiting to be securely married to a Wall Street business type back in the States. Cristina is essentially a hot girl on a hot summer's night, looking for sexual adventure and not knowing where she's headed in life but wanting it to be (in Benjamin Braddock's term) ""different."" <br/><br/>Little time is wasted getting the plot moving as the young women soon meet and are aggressively ""courted"" by Juan Antonio, a bohemian Spanish painter (Javier Bardem). Cristina is immediately smitten but Vicky is standoffish, partly because she is engaged but mainly because she fears disruptive emotions. As one might expect, things get emotionally complicated and tangled among the threesome in short order. What one doesn't expect, though, is the mid-Act 2 entrance into the picture of Juan Antonio's divorced wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). Maria Elena enters the scene like a force of nature, completely rewriting the chemistry of interaction among the principal characters and initiating a series of events - one more unpredictable and cataclysmic than the last that build to a resolution completely true to the characters although open and unsatisfying in the superficial Hollywood ending sense.<br/><br/>""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is clearly Allen's tightest, most inspired screenplay in some time, maybe since ""Husbands and Wives"" in the early '90s. It is also his best job of casting since perhaps even earlier than that. As Vicky, relative newcomer Rebecca Hall (""The Prestige"") plays a part that in the '80s and early '90s would have gone to Mia Farrow, but she plays it with a bare minimum of annoying imitation-Woody tics and has a much more appealing screen persona than Farrow usually managed to project. Scarlett Johansson's role is nicely limited to the small compass of her acting talent while tastefully exploiting her sensational sensuality. Javier Bardem, following his Academy Award turn as a ruthless hired killer and his stunning performance as a quadriplegic in ""The Sea Inside,"" continues to demonstrate formidable range here in playing a complexly human character, even if his bedroom eyes are apparently more powerful than his artist's brush. And what can one say of Penelope Cruz's tour de force as Marie Elena? Stealing every scene, Cruz fully inhabits a breathtakingly beautiful character who is alluringly feminine, powerful, inspirational, and more than a tad crazy. The closest precedent to her character type I can recall is Jeanne Moreau's Catherine in Francois Truffaut's masterpiece ""Jules and Jim."" <br/><br/>In several other respects, including the extensive use of a narrator, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" resembles a rendition of ""Jules and Jim"" told from a female perspective  i.e. it resembles ""Two English Girls,"" which is Truffaut's own version of ""Jules and Jim"" from a female perspective. One thing the three films certainly share is an image of love as a constant and shifting ménage a trois (or sometime a quartre!) Whether the connections to Truffaut were intended, I do not know. However, Allen has repeatedly expressed his life-long admiration for the European film masters of his youth: Bergman, Fellini, Godard, and Truffaut. The examples in his earlier work of the influence of the first three of these are plentiful. Perhaps it was time to take on Truffaut. If so, the initial results were happy indeed."

Vicky is a somewhat conservative & pragmatic,and is happy to be with the man of her dreams (a rather boring & mousy little businessman--but aren't most of them?).

You don't have to think hard to pick up all the fragmentary threads to get the great idea, and you won't be completely shocked and feel ashamed to be human. Watching Vicky Cristina Barcelona, all you need to do is get yourself in a comfortable sofa, try to experience with the characters the beauty of Spain and its art, feel the actors' charm, laugh when the fun comes, smile when you find you can identify with them, move your body with the end music and plan on seeing Barcelona with your own eyes.

","A lot of people complain about Woody Allen's new movies, saying that they lack the brilliance of his old days. Well, I have a different perspective (and I admit I can be a little biased, since the man is my favourite director): for someone who's 72 years old and still makes an average of a film a year (as VCB comes out, his next project is already in post-production!), you can't expect him to make a masterpiece every year, right? So, even though ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" and some of his recent works (""Match Point"" included- I find it slightly overrated, and prefer ""Melinda and Melinda"" or even ""Anything Else"" to it) are no ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"", ""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"", ""Husbands and Wives"" or ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", they're still enjoyable. I have a short list of life's 5 things that are good even when they're bad: sex, pizza, chocolate, ice cream, & Woody Allen's films (not necessarily in that order, depends on my mood). Which means that a ""bad"" Woody Allen (i.e., ""Cassandra's Dream""), is still better than the average director's best. Woody doesn't have anything left to prove anybody (maybe he never did). He just makes the movies he wants, and his admirers (count myself in!) will watch, enjoy them, and beg for more (I hope he makes at least 10 more films before dying, and that he doesn't retire while he's still breathing). Besides, it's hard to resist such a charming cast as this: Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Patricia Clarkson and a hilarious turn from Penélope Cruz; the beauty of Barcelona and other Spanish locations, and Allen's unmistakable dialogue. Even if ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" doesn't carry the depth of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", isn't as funny as ""Mighty Aphrodite"" or as witty as ""Bullets Over Broadway"", it's still another orgasm the Little Red provides us (oh, and if you wanna see it just for the already famous kiss between Penélope and Scarlett, you might be disappointed - it's sexy, but lasts only about 3 seconds). 8.5/10."

Unfortunately for these vapid young women, Juan is still emotionally involved with his ex-wife, Maria, who is portrayed as a stereotypical Latina spitfire with suicidal impulses. Nothing much that approaches drama, comedy or interest occurs during the film, which allows an audience to focus on the characters - or lack of them. Women should be justifiably incensed by the portrayal of Allen's females as silly, self-absorbed, easily-manipulated neurotics - but 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' is an equal-opportunity disaster - the self-entitlement and pomposity of the male characters makes them even more unlikable."

","I think this movie is like one of those shrimp flavored chips they sell in Asian food markets. Tasty but lacking in substance.<br/><br/>First some good points. I was watching this with a European traveler friend who identified a lot of the background as actually being of Spain as opposed to being budget filmed in Canada. The cinematography is excellent and did I mention 3 of the hottest women of our era? For fans of Woody Allen movies, this is nothing new. Scarlett Johansson who appeared in Matchpoint a couple years ago reprises her role as the third wheel in relationships. Perhaps I've been jaded by too many Woody flicks, but it seems the whole debacle of adultery and dissatisfaction with one's lot becomes a bit repetitive. I'm walking into the movie knowing full well that there is only one twist--what happens at the end.<br/><br/>Of course, this movie's also boasts that are 3 lovely women involved and one guy becomes the lucky stiff, but the triangle/quadrilateral never quite materializes because there is no real tension between Cristina and Vicky. Penelope Cruz was a standout in playing a neurotic psycho ex-gf but other than a titillating threesome, fails to inject any real conflict into the relationship.<br/><br/>This brings to mind another failing of the movie which I'm sure most males would agree with-- three lovely women. Come on Woody, is the best you can do a PG-13 movie? Seriously with all the infidelity and lust and sexual innuendos, is it asking too much for some boobies? I'm not a thirteen year old who's never seen naughty parts (and certainly if I needed to I'd watch Bikini Surfboard Vampires) but it detracts from the immersion--in this case escapism-- of the the movie when you're trying to imagine that a shaky closeup is tantamount to a passionate love-fest.<br/><br/>At the same time in the other direction, this movie doesn't leave much to the imagination. Unlike other Woody films, I don't know why this one necessitates a narrator. In Annie Hall, we get some interesting voice-over insights but this narrator seems shallow and patronizing--telling the audience such obvious trivialities as ""they(Vicky and male interest) had a good time"" after showing them having a sight-seeing session together. As far as I'm concerned, the only time to break the ""show and don't tell"" rule is if you're doing a documentary.<br/><br/>It's a shame that Allen has painted himself into a corner of such niche films because he certainly could do better."

","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is about two best friends and the summer they spent in Barcelona, one while working on her master's and the other looking for her meaning in life. While in Spain, both fall for the same man, a painter who's outlook on life is not typical. Going into the movie I didn't really know what to expect. Having seen only a few of Woody Allen's movies, like Scoop and Match Point which I greatly enjoyed, I was excited about the movie. What I found was well beyond expectation. The movie had a truth behind it that is rarely found in film, especially in ones that come out of Hollywood. It does not have a happy ending, rather one that would actually happen in real life. If you're looking for a happy ending, stay away. If you're looking to feel better about yourself because you don't know what you're doing or you are lead into a decision that you are expected to do and hate, you have to see this."

","Something happened to Woody Allen when he decided to abandon Manhattan, the setting of most of his films, for Europe. It seems Mr. Allen has found a new way to leave behind his angst in exchange for a new, somewhat less restrained sexual atmosphere in which to set his movies. This, of course, is a welcome relief. After all, Mr. Allen was getting in a rut with his last cinematic ventures.<br/><br/>Every year thousands of young American college students invade Europe, either in exchange programs, or just enrolled in foreign language studies, or just vacationing in the Continent. Most of these kids come from conservative, and in many ways, puritanical backgrounds, probably having no sexual experience to speak of. Vicky and Cristina, two of those students, are seen in Barcelona where they undergo a somewhat sentimental education in a different milieu.<br/><br/>While Vicky is less adventurous than her friend Cristina, both will be transformed by the meeting of the hunky Juan Antonio and his estranged wife, Maria Elena. Juan Antonio offers them sex, and even proposes to do it with both of them at the same time. Vicky, a more prudish girl, can't go along, but Cristina, the more adventuresome, doesn't even bat an eyelash when she gets together with him and the former wife, who is game for entering in a sexual triangle.<br/><br/>This time though, the principal male figure, Juan Antonio, is an aggressive man, in contrast with other characters that have served Mr. Allen well in his American movies. Javier Bardem proves he can excel when he is guided with a sure hand, as is the case here. Penelope Cruz fares better than in most of her Hollywood previous work in a role that gives her an edge over the more passive parts she has played before.<br/><br/>This is not to say there has not been sex involved in Mr. Allen's previous films. In showing a new freedom in how to present it on the screen, he has shied away from all the neurotic men and women that have been at the center of his work. This is a welcome development in a man who has decided to reinvent himself by getting away from his usual playing ground."

","Recently, Woody Allen has not been at his best. There have been some rather forced thrillers that started promising but rambled on, losing their impact. The spark and appreciation for the fine elements in human relationships had almost vanished. For years, we could count on him for combining drama and comedy, for giving us the feel that we were enjoying some light entertainment, with tons of self-deprecating humor, but we were really exploring the depths of human imperfections. He could make us think, rejoice, laugh at ourselves, at others, and a great time was almost guaranteed. Hilarity existed alongside reflection and guilt, and gems like ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", ""Bullets Over Broadway"", and ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" forced to look at the world around us and more importantly, at each other.<br/><br/>""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" does not reach the heights of some of those classics, but it missed by very little. Had Woody played with its length a little more, done some careful editing, and the film would have exploded in ways that very few works of art do nowadays. Maybe some of the ethereal beauty of its setting managed to lull him into relaxing a little too much. The film is gorgeously photographed and captures both the intensity and the peace of Barcelona and its surroundings. The emotions of the visitors are almost palpable, and some of the locals' own feelings come through.<br/><br/>""Barcelona"" could be seen as just a love affair that gets out of control, well, in a very special way, since there are four people at the heart of such relationship. We have two hot-blooded local artists unable to maintain a healthy commitment together because of the fire that lives in each of them. A very impressionable American who yearns for things she doesn't understand and that she might not want. In the hands of Scarlett Johansson, this character is interestingly portrayed. As is the case in Allen's work, women are very strongly written. It is a difficult role to play since we must learn to understand what motivates her, and how this is also perceived by others. It is a character that would have earned more than a critical look in other times. Allen gives her more dimension and tries to explain what lives in the soul of Cristina.<br/><br/>Along for the ride is Vicky, the one female role that could have been eclipsed by everyone else, but it is the quiet turmoil in the heart of this woman that makes it stand out. Everyone else jumps recklessly in the middle of this love feast. It takes a bit of analytical discomfort for Vicky to eventually surrender to the old world's charms. She is attracted but scared by the offerings of this exotic universe, and it is her objectivity that allows for some balance because at the other end of the spectrum are two Spanish powerhouses, flawlessly played by Bardem and Cruz, reinforcing their newly appreciated talents.<br/><br/>Bardem does an amazing job playing the seductive artist, a man who appears very self-assured and apparently has no time to waste on games. He puts the cards on the table and lets others join in at their own discretion. He is smooth, very likable, and quite a cad. We can't help but looking at the subtlety of his maneuvers and somehow see that it all should be problem free. However, he does have a past, and he can't sever his ties to the very unstable ex-wife.<br/><br/>Played by Cruz, this woman is a powerhouse, somehow who can't and won't rain her spirit, This lady has no problem expressing herself, can't be accused of never being direct, and she provokes quite a reaction on anyone who happens to cross her path. As already mentioned, there is still a bond between her and Bardem, and neither lets go, aware there is probably no way their paths will ever be completely separate. In the film, it is the chemistry produced by putting Cristina, Bardem, and Cruz that fascinates the viewer. Nothing will turn out as expected, and as we are amazed by the fireworks, we also get more than a peek at what resides in each person's heart.<br/><br/>It is quite a comeback for Allen, one that should have been bigger and more widely admired, one that might never seen the light of a director's or a revised cut, one where the parts are sometimes more powerful than the whole. Making the film in an exotic locale, with two very talented Spanish actors certainly helps Allen. It is also noticeable that he appears to be missing, yet one character can almost pass as is alter ego. It wouldn't be a Woody Allen film otherwise. ""Barcelona"" is another gem on his crown as one of our best filmmakers."

It isn't clear why, other than to include scenes of Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem fighting in Spanish. Allen's habitual, relentless claustrophia remains as present as ever, though, and we barely ever get out of a house, a room, a tight shot on a stilted conversation. Barcelona could have been Baltimore for all the difference it made. Neurotic artists, bad relationships, gossip, nouveau riche, petit bourgeoisie, passive men, crazy women, blah blah blah blah.

","Two young American women, a lusty Spanish artist. A love triangle.<br/><br/>With Vicky Christina Barcelona, Woody investigates some common conceptions (and preconceptions) about love, and why it's more about balance than numbers. While consistently interesting, some might find its quirks annoying. For one thing, a narrator intrudes on the story at regular intervals, as if needing to explain the plot and the characters. It's a common- enough device, but in VCB, it comes in the place of deft exposition. It's what many hack directors do when the film in the can isn't enough to make the film lucid. In a film with constant references to art, it reminds one of the various European features that present their stories only through dialog and acting.<br/><br/>The two female leads, Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen, put in good performances, but they would have been so much more effective if they could rely on conveying the plot through their acting.<br/><br/>By explaining everything as it goes along, the story itself becomes rather predictable The narrator hints at an exchange that will later become significant; instead of being surprised by the plot turn, there's almost a feeling that there are so few dramatic moments that the narrator has to nudge us awake for the subtleties. <br/><br/>It's one of Woody Allen's worst faults - trying to explain everything. At least in VCB, the characters have unique voices (unlike the director's 80s and 90s dramas where they'd all sound like the same person).<br/><br/>VCB is competent, with good acting, but basically unspecial."

","Woody's back!...and he seems to have finally grown up. I was a huge WA fan back in the 80s when he was banging out stellar works like Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes & Misdemeanors and Husbands & Wives...but remember these works were quite dark in attitude. I thought he had a few amusing efforts in the 90s...mainly Bullets over Broadway, Mighty Aphrodite and Celebrity...but, again, these works were written by an author who is sad and distraught about the impossibility of 'happily ever after.' To be quite frank, I was bored with all his movies this century including Match Point (which I thought was a rehashed version of Crimes & Misdemeanors...minus the laughs).<br/><br/>In Vicky Cristina Barcelona WA seems to have finally found his mature outlook on passion, love, and romance. He is now a REALIST. I was overwhelmed by the line, ""The only true love is unrequited love."" He nailed it. Only the lack of resolution can make passion last. Otherwise it either fades or turns into negative emotions such as anger and resentment. These are the same themes Shakespeare examined in A Midsummer Nights Dream. And like that great play, VCB acknowledges that love and passion are a glorious part of life, but doesn't try to pretend that love is perfect or that 'happily ever after' really exists...the movie remains grounded in realism without becoming morose at the end like some of WA's earlier films.<br/><br/>The writing is witty, intelligent and intense. The acting is superb (especially Javier Bardem who is a truly GREAT actor). The directing is brilliant and subtle...notice how many times Vicky changes clothes before meeting Juan Antonio which epitomizes her desire for this man AND her confusion about her feelings. Also, Woody seems to have finally dropped his beloved Jazz, which I always found distracting, out-of-place and annoying in most of his earlier movies (the Gershwin in Manhattan being a notable exception).<br/><br/>After seeing this movie I went on Amazon and purchased the 3 box Woody Allen DVD collection. Woody's finally back in my life."
"meeza","10","9","21","21 August 2008"," ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a winning trifecta of an excelente pelicula
","The latest Woody Allen cinematic offering ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" sure sent out a few ""Woodys"" to male filmgoers. Two words: Scarlett Johansson! Is there a more cinematic picturesque acting beauty than Scarlett? I think not. However, I am not going to get let my male hormones invade the film review of this very witty and delightful film. ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" stars Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio, a Spaniard painter who meets and fancies two gorgeous American female tourists visiting Barcelona for the summer named (yea you guessed it) Vicky and Cristina. Rebecca Hall plays the perspicacious Vicky while Johansson plays the free-spirited Cristina. The unruffled Juan Antonio offers Vicky and Cristina a flight to a nearby Spanish town, good wine, exquisite food, and a ""make love"" offer that he does not want them to refuse. The latter would fall into the entitlement of ""Vicky Cristina Off Pantalones"". Vicky is engaged to be married to a cookie-cutter yuppie named Doug so she rejects the making love portion of the Juan Antonio proposition, while Cristina is all down for the Juan Antonio seduction expedition. Cristina eventually does develop a relationship with Juan Antonio, but a Spanish ""new order"" is intertwined in a ""bizarre love triangle"" fashion when Juan Antonio's fiery ex-wife Maria Elena gets in the picture that eventually converts into a ménage a trios Barcelona style; Si Baby! However, the film's central focus is on Vicky's insecurities & neurosis on her relationship with Doug and her uncontainable desirable feelings for Juan Antonio. I think Batman is no longer my summer movie hero, gotta make the change for Juan Antonio; three beautiful women lusting for him, Do I say more? Legendary auteur Woody Allen scripted a brainy but relatable script on passion, love, and romance. He also helmed the picture with an effective unpredictable storyline manner that also had the fringe Spanish benefit of showing us viewers splendid cultural cinematography of beautiful Barcelona. No actor could have played the Juan Antonio role better than Bardem; I will call it ""friendo"" that Bardem will be one our finest male thespians in years to come. Newcomer Rebecca Hall is no kid in the lonely acting hall anymore with her breakthrough performance as Vicky, and Scarlett Johannson as Cristina is proving that she continues to be an effective muse to Woody; do not take that literally. Nonetheless, it is Penelope Cruz's performance as the fervent Maria Elena which should be cruising her to a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination. So reserve your one-way (or three-way) movie ticket to Spain and visit the luscious and passionate land of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". ***** Excellent"

","Woody Allen has made an excellent selection of actors and location of the movie. Scarlett Johansson ( my all time favorite), Rebecca Hall (my new favorite) who are 2 American girls in Spain, Penelope Cruz , a Spanish girl from spain who speaks English with a heavy Spanish accent and Javier Bardem ( a Spanish actor known for his Oscar winning role in No country for old men) are very convincing throughout the movie. They are good in love scenes and also in having long sensible conversations. If Scarlett Johansson continues to work with Woody Allen she never has to pick up any other accent. She is always an American tourist either in England ( Match point, Scoop )or in Spain. Scarlett Johansson is a good actress . Her body and her voice are her signature. Penelope Cruz did an excellent job of a very possessive lover and also did very well with her outbursts of anger as with silent sexual and erotic moves. Javier Bardem has shown that he is good with a gun and without a gun. 2 movies with very contrasting roles. Barcelona and other parts of Spain are definitely a romantic's paradise."

","Woody Allen has lost all conception of subtlety. He is a great writer, but a poor film maker in this case. This movie is a book on screen (in the sense of being a sort of book-on-tape). You are narrated almost every aspect of what should be visually shown. The point of a good movie is not to be told what is happening, it should be seen by the subtle nuances of an actor's performance. To add insult to injury, the narrator's voice is out-of-place and distracting; it recalls you constantly to your own position as a spectator, preventing you from becoming as entranced as you should be by the spectacular performance of an all-star cast. I have no doubt that some pseudo-intellectual will criticize this critique by claiming it ignores the depth or concepts explored by the film, concepts which I wholly admit are intriguing and worth the time spent to explore, but my criticism is not directed to the ideas surveyed. I do not hesitate to say that the script must read as an insightful reflection of life and love by a man with obvious experience in both, but do not placate criticisms of this film based on some nostalgic respect for the old Woody Allen, whose previous movies have earned that respect of their own merit. Consider this independently and those rose-coloured contacts melt-away to reveal what is left a poor visual adaptation of a brilliant script."

So flawed, with such little substance, no narrative interest at all (as Woody used to give) and the total misreading/generalization of a city.<br/><br/>. the love triangles, with Bardem as the common vortex. This is neither in the comedy inclined, narrative exploitive sense Woody Allen used to give it back in Annie Hall days nor in the sexual tension exploitation of, say, Henry and June. He places cardboards and makes them swing around (badly chosen) sets, making them seem dorks with useless dialogs, which underline how such a story of dangerous love/sex balance could never happen with such superficial mundane people;<br/><br/>. the voice over: what an insult. Woody Allen was a truly sensitive filmmaker when he was at his best, he built narratives which invite the spectator to find out, make us part of the process, make us follow them, he would give us a peach, and let us peal it. How could he think we needed an annoying fellow literally retelling absolutely every useless action or obvious thought of every character. What was the point? Didn't he trust his ability for visual narrative enough to let us find for ourselves?<br/><br/>. Barcelona, or whatever city he filmed in. I'm glad i watched this in Barcelona, because i could get out of the theatre and check that i had just saw a city woody wanted to place in the film, not the real thing. He was so good in embedding New York in the fluids of his kind of narrative, his kind of story, his kind of character, that it truly disappointed me, more than anything else, that e failed so miserably here. Barcelona is not tuned to flamenco. The very definition of ""Spanish city"" may be something controversial (in fact, any real city is an unity on its own, that's another discussion) but if any definition for that can be found, Barcelona will for sure be out of it. How could he place such an amount of ordinary touristic Spanish clichés into it? He even places a character who studies ""Catalan identity"". Where was that? She is learning Spanish, not Catalan, and the life she took in the city (not the phony life with her phony husband, but the life she chose to have) is something she could have elsewhere, no need to be in Barcelona necessarily. Th prostitutes Johanson photographs are probably the closest thing we have to a real city in this film. Gaudi shows as a mere highlight of assumed clichés, he is shot so superficially as he is in any touristic selling film. <br/><br/>It's a shame, it's not good to see an intelligent, yet intuitive filmmaker fall to the pits of vulgarity like this. The only mildly interesting aspect i found here is how he neglects and opposes to the high-class futile chit-chat of American culture that once once the juice that flavoured all his dialogs, in his New York based work.<br/><br/>My opinion: 1/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"captainadam","10","8","19","18 August 2008"," Beautiful visuals + superb performances = very good film.
","Over the past decade, every few years, film critics create a lot of buzz by saying that Woody Allen's newest film is a ""return to form."" Since he's been cranking them out at a breakneck pace, (one a year for about forty years) and his glory days of the 1970's have long passed, most often, the common conception has been that Allen's work in the 90's and early 00's has been subpar. Now, I can't speak for that, as I've only seen a handful of Allen films, most of which were made in this decade, but I can say without hesitation that ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a very good film. It's being billed as a romantic comedy, but I don't know that that's completely accurate. Without a doubt, it covers the territory that romantic comedies tend to cover, but I think ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a cut above the conventions of an atypical romantic comedy. To be sure, it's funny, but it's funny in a way that's muted, smart, and respectful of the viewer's intelligence, instead of appealing to the lowest common denominator for big laughs. The performances are uniformly excellent, particularly in the case of Rebecca Hall. I really liked her character, Vicky, and her storyline, and felt that Hall was terrific in the role. I'd love to see her get an Oscar nomination. Bardem, despite Juan Antonio's somewhat implausible behavior, manages to somehow make him a completely believable character. Johansson, who has underwhelmed me in everything I've seen her in since her great work in ""Lost In Translation,"" also turns in a good performance. Her character, Cristina, like Juan Antonio, is also somewhat erratic, but she plays it in such a way that it feels authentic for the complex character that she creates. As for Cruz, she's terrific, and very well might receive an Oscar nomination. Her character, Maria Elena, feels note-perfect. What's even better is that these strong performances were attached to a great screenplay, which I think might garner an Oscar nomination. What amazes me is that Woody Allen, a 72 year-old man from Brooklyn, somehow, someway, found his way into the hearts and minds of so many different people from all walks of life and wrote them in a way that feels spot-on. There are scenes in which some characters are speaking Spanish and others are speaking English and the scene totally works. Additionally, the film looks great. Allen captures Barcelona at its best. He really uses the locations to his advantage, but, at the same time, in the end, I really had invested in the characters and took a lot more out of the film than just a bunch of lovely images. See, at its heart, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a study of the human heart and the reasons and thought processes that people use to make choices, just like the best of Allen's work. We might look at the screen and want to tell the character to stop what they're doing or to just ""go for it,"" but we never for once lose sight of who that person is. This wonderful sense of humanity is a big part of what makes ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" a more than worthy addition to the Woody Allen canon, and even more than that, a very good film."
"pyrocitor","8","7","16","18 October 2008"," Painting with broad strokes
","Many have referred to the recent career of American auteur Woody Allen as his 'European vacation', having departed his beloved New York to begin experimenting with different narratives and cultural observations overseas. It would seem Vicky Cristina Barcelona proves the end of Allen's 'vacation' (his next film marks a return to New York) and as such, Allen seems determined to make the most of his last departure from tradition, toying with narrative, character and thematic development. The resulting film as such feels slightly piecemeal, but hardly in a negative sense, as Vicky Cristina Barcelona merely brims with the impulsive exploring one would expect at the end of a vacation, and the impulsive sense of artistic whimsy is one difficult to resist. <br/><br/>While once again abstaining from his traditional New York locations (this time transposing his pallet from England to Spain) and trademark neurotic humour, Allen demonstrates a welcome return to his acute knack for dissecting and observing human behaviour. Exploring a myriad of sexual habits and practices as well as his usual meditations on the nature and quality of love, the potentially redundant and overdone source material is given a fresh and fascinating spin in the hands of the veteran storyteller. But given his past credentials, it is interesting to see Allen experimenting with a different cinematic voice, albeit one which is still easily recognizable as his. Despite his complex and profound subject matter, Allen's sparse and rather matter of fact script feels almost overly simplistic, the bulk of the character development and contextual grounding of the plot performed in concise, clipped sound bites - rather than the viewer inferring Johansson's character to be neurotic and afraid of commitment, we are simply informed that she is as such, a tendency which comes across as rather jarring at first. <br/><br/>However, Allen's shrewdly cunning scripting makes such a narrative voice clear to be a deliberate choice rather than simply poor writing, as if tiding the viewer by with blunt surface description while leaving the inherent subtleties left to be discovered by the viewer. The comparison can be made to Bardem's painter character, as it seems Allen has simply chosen to paint with broad strokes, his deceptively simplistic overtones masking a far more complicated and fascinating underbelly left mainly to the viewer to discover through what is not said, rather than what is.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, not all of the film's potential problems can be explained away as deliberate artistic decisions quite as easily, particularly an ill-advised omnipresent narration, which starts off giving the impression of being sharp and satirical, but becomes quickly overused, after which it abruptly disappears for almost the rest of the film. This tendency to tell not show makes Allen's film feel remarkably un-cinematic at times, with the narration seeming a lazy and complacent way of quickening the story rather than letting it unfold, undermining an otherwise refreshingly unique and fascinating narrative. Similarly, the overuse of certain musical motifs becomes frustratingly repetitive, although the beautiful Spanish architecture and locations are captured with an excellent touristic flourish, sweeping the viewer up in the heady luxury of a Spanish holiday as the protagonists themselves. <br/><br/>Despite excellent past work as Allen's latest female muse, Scarlett Johansson appears somewhat wasted here, her usual spunky exuberance and sultry charisma appearing oddly stunted. Paradoxically, her character, who in theory should have been the most interesting (the struggling artist attempting to find her niche in life and love, while welcoming experimentation along the way) disappointingly proves one of the more poorly written, and although Johansson does her best, infusing her character with an appropriate degree of teasingly seductive charm, it is a shame her character was not explored more fully. The true breakout star of the picture is Rebecca Hall, last seen as Christian Bale's wife in magician thriller The Prestige. Hall shines as a more typical Allen leading lady, mastering the neurotic self-guessing, pragmatism and guilt-inducing impulsive spells of her character with a particular down to earth yet bubbly style all her own - an entirely credible and hugely enjoyable performance. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem is perfectly cast as the suavely overconfident artist just as determined to drink in the pleasures of life as he is cynically convinced of its worthlessness, his comic deadpan and extravagant screen presence making him a perfect foil for both leading ladies. However, it is the entrance of Penelope Cruz halfway through the film when the plot really picks up speed, her suicidal, fiercely proud yet chaotically unpredictable artist and ex-wife of Bardem's character proving a sublime catalyst for the other major characters to play off of. It is impossible to imagine a more fitting performance than Cruz's for the role, her ferocious, borderline psychotic energy proving alternately hilarious and terrifying. Patricia Clarkson also gives a typically strong performance as the family friend of Vicky's putting the two women up for the summer, and Kevin Dunn is a suitably distant presence as her absent husband. <br/><br/>Few movies provide such an odd mishmash of quietly whimsical storytelling touches, but there is no question that Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona adds up to an altogether pleasant experience. With appealingly complex undertones discernible beyond the deceptively simple exterior and peppered with an array of terrific performances, while the film may be somewhat of a departure of form for Allen, it is a welcome return to his intelligent introspection and quality of old, and one without question worth a watch. <br/><br/>-7.5/10"
"mistarkus","9","7","16","25 August 2008"," Brief wonderful trip to Barcelona
","Take a sojourn for a couple of hours to the romantic streets and country side of Barcelona. The beige pastel landscapes, the enchanted dreamlike streets, the surreal Gaudi monuments and amorous cafes all evoke a romantic escapade in Barcelona. Scenery and setting are an integral part of Woody's great films. As we typically see in Woody's films, like the movie Manhattan, where the sleepy streets and sites of grey, nostalgic New York take on a character of its own as the human characters discourse in front of it, we again feel his new European locale as though we are there ourselves. We are shown a lot of the defining sites of the culturally rich city.<br/><br/>Woody is a genius at capturing the mindset of people, of the times, especially with regards to courting etiquette and he continues to brilliantly totally possess an understanding of and be able to pierce into contemporary times. He understands and documents real human emotion and these real people draw us into his movies and this one. He does it with a literary flair and although people don't actually talk like how he portrays them, it is amusing to listen to the literary rich dialogue. <br/><br/>The movie resonates with Woody's philosophy and commentary with a tad of humor on his current theme of love and passion. By utilizing two contrasting personalities with contrasting view points on love and passion, woody makes an intriguing commentary on the subject. One with an indulgently bohemian outlook, boldly and constantly searches for the possibly unattainable or nearly impossible ideal which ultimately keeps her in hopeless situations and the other with a more conservative stance has more ""grounded and settled"" ideals and dubiously believes in the happily ever after bit. Both polar opposites are presented an amusingly similar circumstance and it is fun to see how the situation unfolds. Then Penelope Cruz's character emerges as a spicy twist to the story.<br/><br/>There is less humor in his later great movies than in the early ones and there is no longer any slapstick. But he still enjoys poking fun at his characters and since they are so believable he is poking fun at real people in a satirical way.<br/><br/>One of the most interestingly beautiful movies this year so far. And definitely one of Woody's best."

"rogerdarlington","Null","3","5","16 October 2010"," Something different from Woody
","I'm not a constant Woody Allen fan - so I loved ""Hannah And Her Sisters"" and then was disappointed by ""Scoop"" - but this film, which he both wrote and directed, is something different. Of course, it does no harm that it is full of attractive people - Rebecca Hall as the restrained Vicky and Scarlett Johansson as the impulsive Cristina, two young American friends spending the summer in Catalonia, plus Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio and Penélope Cruz as Maria Elena, Spanish artists who once had the near-prefect marriage - and of gorgeous locations - Gaudí's Barcelona, of course, but also Oviedo and Avilés.<br/><br/>What makes the movie though is the relationships and inter-relationships, mainly between these four colourful and contrasting characters but also between Vicky and her fiancé and an older American couple who seem to foretell where one of the young women is going. The acting is very naturalistic and the script has its fair share of humour in a narrative that presents a shifting kaleidoscope of emotions. When the shaking stops, how different will things be? You might be surprised ..."
"ozar_33-1","8","8","20","15 August 2008"," Entertaining and funny, Woody's still got it!
","People have been criticizing Allen recently for taking himself too seriously and not meshing his more dramatic subject matter with the comedic elements of his screenplays, thus creating half-assed contrivances like last year's Cassandra's Dream, but Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a sure improvement. No, it's not a completely original entrance into the Woody canon; a lot of his prior themes about sex, love, and the consequences each can respectively produce pop up here but somehow he still manages to make it all seem fresh.<br/><br/>Vicky Cristina Barcelona goes down easy. It's a deceptively simple meditation on the connection between love, art, and the ability to express oneself romantically and emotionally through the medium. Watching the film feels like spending a breezy afternoon in the beautiful titular city while the security and assurance one holds so closely crumbles around them. The two titular characters arrive in Barcelona with smiles on their faces, ready to relax and enjoy their youthful freedom, having no idea what's about to hit them.<br/><br/>Allen slyly and ironically plays on the whole notion of foreign escapism. Most people hold this notion that they can get away from their current lives and lose themselves in another culture and with this film, Allen explores the sometimes negative aspects of enveloping oneself into something one just doesn't understand. Indeed, it's what both Vicky and Cristina do, as their entire self-confident personas are stripped down to bare nothingness during their stay in Spain, by the simple and simultaneously complex chemistry of two past-lovers played energetically by Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz.<br/><br/>But none of what is mentioned above is ever treated with the slightest heavy-hand. While it may sound grim, Allen perfectly induces a little comedy around each and every corner to remind us just how ridiculously irrational we can get over the trivialities of love. It's always fun, never mindless, and consistently well-written throughout, as one would come to expect of Allen.<br/><br/>There is one glaring flaw however, and that is the often pointless narration. Every now and then a detached voice-over will tune in to describe what we can already tell from the images on screen. At other times, he'll describe the character's feelings or give background on certain situations. It's a lazy tactic that replaces what the actors should already be doing themselves and what the script should've indicated via character development. However, it gives the film this oddly lived-in feel, like an old scrapbook of forgotten memories to a trip to Spain.<br/><br/>The performances are all impressive. As expected, Bardem and Cruz are sizzling on screen, their chemistry is completely undeniable, even when it seems like they're about to get at each other's throats. Newcomer Rebecca Hall gives the most emotional performance, as her character is swayed passionately numerous times throughout the film, portraying a woman who is unsure of her grip on life. And Johansson turns in her best performance in a Woody Allen picture, playing a woman whose liberties are challenged by the even more unconventional and unplanned lifestyles of the couple she falls for.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is an assurance that Allen still has ""it"" and is feeling ever more confident behind the lens. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a highly entertaining, funny, and often heartfelt play on that little thing called love."
"cultfilmfan","10","7","17","21 August 2008"," Vicky Cristina Barcelona
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is about two American friends who are both in their twenties, who decide to go to Spain for a few months during the summer. The first of two girls is Vicky who is engaged to be married to her fiancé back home in America. Vicky is studying to complete her masters degree and overall is more of a conservative person. Cristina on the other hand has been in some amateurish type films and she really longs for romance whether it may be a one night stand, or a real lasting one. Cristina is a lot more adventurous which can not always be a good thing and even though at times Vicky and Cristina are the total opposites of each other they still work together well as good friends. While on their trip in Spain they meet an older Spanish artist who invites the both of them to come stay with him at his house and enjoy the many sights around them. Ultimately the film is about relationships. Some that work, others that do not and for people who get left out and are not particularly too sure of what they want. All this is told through narration and of course great dialogue and acting from the cast. Some of the television advertisements for Vicky Cristina Barcelona make the film look like some sexy, or erotic comedy, but I can most assuredly tell you that this film is neither one of those two things. Instead we are treated to a really interesting character study about relationships and the trials and sometimes the not so always pleasant things that happen in them. I found a lot of the film to be an accurate and honest look of this subject by providing us with everyday characters who would probably handle the relationships in this movie like most people of their age, or even older would as well. The writing and dialogue from writer/director Woody Allen is at it's best and he really deserves a Best Original Screenplay nomination for the film not only because of the well spoken, thought provoking and sometimes funny dialogue, bur for also writing and crafting such a story with some unique and overall really human and realistic characters that are examined in this tale of relationships which is a subject that Woody Allen does often and well too. The acting for the most part was really good with a standout performance by Rebecca Hall as Vicky. The other performances are quite good too, but I found Rebecca's performance as Vicky had the most emotion and depth to it and she delivered it perfectly. Spanish actors Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz yelling back and forth in Spanish at each other is also very interesting to watch and I enjoyed Bardem's playboy character. I'd probably have to say that the weakest performance in the film comes from Scarlett Johansson who plays Cristina, simply because her character doesn't have the same insight or is as dynamic, or as interesting as the other characters. Not to say that she weighs the film down, or anything like that, no not at all, but compared to the others it just really is not a standout performance, but because of the way her character is written, she is not given as much to work with and she is not as interesting a character as say Rebecca Hall's Vicky, or anything like that. Still that would be my only mild complaint about the film, but because of how the film plays out, one weak performance can not stop a movie with otherwise great acting and writing from being a great film. Listening to these characters talk was a very enjoyable experience if you are a fan of good writing and with the interesting dissection of these characters and these honest looks at their love lives I would say it is all done very well. This is also a beautiful looking film and is a lot to take in and think about. Even though I would not call this film a comedy I would say it works perfect as a drama and because of all the mastered writing and acting that went into it, I would say it's one of this year's finest accomplishments and one of the best films of the year so far."
"M2b","10","7","17","19 August 2008"," The Woodman hits a home run, finally (some mild spoilers)
","Perhaps the oldest working director in films (at least that would seem to be so for a successful stand-up comic WHO STARTED IN THE FIFTIES!) has turned out a beaut. Woody Allen has penned an adult romantic comedy with ten times the laughs (at least for me) of Pineapple Express. Called ""Vicky And Christina Spend the Summer in Barcelona"".<br/><br/>The star of the film is none other than the cold killer from No Country For Old Men, Oscar winner Javier Bardem proving his acting range goes way beyond scaring the s-word out of people. He plays a full of life, passionate Spanish painter-lover, and bless him for this. He nails a fine-wine getting hotter as she gets older Penelope Cruz, an equally desirable please-let-me-have-this Scarlett Johansen and a prissy uptight academic Rebecca Hall, who none of you ever heard of before (admit it). Sometimes more than one of them at the same time.<br/><br/>The acting is flawless. That's why Penelope and Scarlett stand out from other cinema hotties....they can act, they both have their craft down perfectly. Sadly, none of them go nude in the flick, but guys, there is a scene between Penny and Scarlett that will make you want to stand up and cheer anyway. YAHOOOOOO !!!<br/><br/>Woody's script shows two particular brilliancies, that seems to evade the rest of the hacks of Hollywood. He likes to insert his own film personnae into his films, and this time it's the Rebecca Hall character who does the Woodman's comedic pseudo-intellectual schtick. Really smart to switch himself to the woman, cause when he's used younger actors as himself, it becomes imitative parody and fails. And Woody himself it just too old for any make-up genius to make you think he is only 60, an age he passed a long long time ago. Rebecca is remarkable, holding her own against the two stellar screen beauties...and making her far less than super looks come out as still highly desirable.....in controlled passion coming out of it's containment at last.<br/><br/>Secondly, Woody brilliantly uses a narrator to make his cinematic novel come alive. The dialogue you would read in a novel comes to life in the faces of this great crew of actors. And instead of adding 30+ minutes of extraneous films to set the scene, or making stupid dialogue just so the audience can be informed of the plot, a simple line or two or concise narration keeps the film moving at a perfect pace. And Woody uses a young actor, not his old self for the narrator, which would have detracted from the youth and exuberance of the film.<br/><br/>Also, the musical score and the cinematography are great, simply great. Good job old guy. I loved the film. You made us old guys proud. And err, next time could you let us see Johannsen's goods. I KNOW she's shown you, you can't lie to M2b. So share."
"socrates99","9","4","8","9 February 2009"," Didn't think I'd see this Woody Allen take on Latin loveplay
","Didn't think he was capable of portraying it honestly or with any insight. Surely Barcelona is a long ways from angst-ridden Manhatten. And though I like Bardem's work, and think Scarlett Johansson is always a great choice for female lead, I was leery about spending much time watching Penelope Cruz acting wild and over-the-top at Allen's direction. To my surprise, Cruz was the most impressive of all. In just a few minutes, and she's on only a short time, she manages to nail a certain Latin type that anyone acquainted with the genuine article will recognize immediately. My only complaint is I wish Allen had gotten his camera in a little closer to Cruz as her performance is truly memorable and I would have enjoyed seeing more of her. Otherwise, this is a fun sex comedy which I still have trouble attributing to Woody Allen."
"jordan2240","4","6","14","7 March 2009"," Vicky Christina BOREcelona
","The movie's been over for about 10 minutes now, and I'm STILL waiting for something to happen. Honestly, I wanted to turn it off and go to bed before Penelope Cruz's character even showed up, but given she won an academy award for the part, I thought I'd stick it out. Well, she played her part fine, but it wasn't worth the wait. I suppose my expectation that a Woody Allen movie be at least remotely funny affects my opinion of anything he does, and this film provoked nary a snicker much less a laugh. I also think ol' Woody has quite a few fantasies about Ms. Johansson (sp?), based on her roles in his recent films. The narration of this film also was very annoying to me, both in dialog and the chosen voice. I think it would have been less so if Woody had done the narration himself.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're a fan of old Woody Allen, this one isn't going to win you back. Frankly, I don't know who this film would appeal to at all - perhaps women who hate their marriages and get a daily dose of romance novels."

","At my movie theater that I work at for some odd reason we got Vicky Cristina Barcelona 2 weeks after it's release, strange, but I don't know how these things work. But people were walking out very pleased with the movie. So I decided to go ahead and check it out, so I watched it this afternoon. Now we all have to admit, Woody has just been out of his game these past few decades, not since Annie Hall has he had a very memorable film. Nor have none of them have that creative edge that Woody has, but he still has something because Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a good movie. It has a strong story and was very different than any film we have had this year. We have a narrator throughout the film that just tells us the story as if he was reading a book. We have a strong cast that they can all hold their own on scree: Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem, and Penelope Cruz. They hold a strong chemistry and make the story very interesting.<br/><br/>Vicky and Cristina are best friends who are going to Barcelona for the summer, Vicky is a believer of realistic love and is engaged to a successful man who can make her ideal marriage dream work. Cristina is the idealist of a romantic love and meets a Spanish handsome charmer, Juan Antonio who invites the girls to another city for a weekend. He gets Cristina's notice automatically, but Vicky takes some seducing to get into bed. But Juan's crazy ex wife gets back into his life and just makes things very interesting for Cristina. Vicky starts to question her ideals on love when she is just swept off her feet with Juan.<br/><br/>Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a very well told story and nothing like I've seen before. Even though I found it to be unrealistic at times, this movie was just different, which we all need and Woody has a talent for showing that, as he has shown us with his private life, lol. But the acting is good and there are some funny moments and some touching one's as well. I loved how crazy Penelope was in this movie, she was like Fatal Attraction scary, yet you could see how Javier's character fell for her so hard, I don't blame him, I found her craziness attractive as well. So I do recommend this movie if you have the opportunity to see it, the characters are cool and the story is wonderful, Woody is back and throws in one last punch in the fight for his career.<br/><br/>8/10"
"gelman@attglobal.net","10","5","11","23 February 2009"," Superbly Cast, Brilliantly Executed
","Upfront: I don't recall a single joke in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" which in itself suggests a film by someone other than Woody Allen. Yet it is certainly one of the best movies Woody has ever made -- focused on the personalities and characters of the four main protagonists. They are the two American tourists, visiting Barcelona for the summer, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), the magnetic Spanish painter, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and his moody, explosive ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). Without giving away too much of the plot, Vicky, the sensible and apparently self-contained one, and Cristina, eager for novelty and sexual adventure, are both attracted to Juan Antonio -- Vicky guiltily and Cristina unreservedly. And into the picture strides the mercurial Maria Elena, complicating an already complicated and explosive emotional mix. The four principals in this film have been brilliantly chosen. And while Penelope Cruz clearly deserved the Oscar she won as Maria Elena, Hall, Johansson and Bardem also acquit themselves with distinction. I don't recall an ensemble in my entire film-going experience that equals these four. Woody Allen has somehow, somewhere acquired a sensitivity that has been evinced only sporadically over his long career. Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters are previous examples but not as sustained, not as free of his characteristic joking. This is a magnificent movie and should have been more widely rewarded than it was. I was particularly impressed with Rebecca Hall, whom I don't remember having seen before, though Penelope Cruz, as the script allowed undoubtedly stole the show without over-acting."

You can watch it as a lighthearted story about the romantic trials and tribulations of two American girls in Spain, OR you can do what I do, and read in all sorts of Woody nuances.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is refreshingly non-stereotypical as the ""sluttier"" one. Rebecca Hall is the ""neurotic"" one. Javier Bardem is HOT as the exotic Spaniard cliché. Penelope Cruz's character (a beautiful crazy artist) comes in halfway through, giving the story a much needed bang.<br/><br/>This film made me go all warm and giggly inside, a feeling that only Woody can invoke."

"Red_Identity","Null","5","11","18 December 2008"," A perfectly-acted, Artistically sexy and romantic film
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is perhaps a new renovation for romantic comedies. The film has such an ambitious and artistic tone and atmosphere to it. The screenplay, perfectly written, shows true lust and romance that appears at some point in peoples' lives, in this case, Vicky and Cristina. This film does not follow usual 'love' routines, and that is why it really is not a very romantic comedy, but more of the type of romance that you can only dream about, the type of romance that sweeps you away, and the type of romance that cannot always be fulfilled. It breaks all the rules for love, and shows how it does not have to be real, or even lasting. The film's stars, Rebbecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson capture the moods and feelings of their characters perfectly. Javier Bardem plays Juan Antonio, and does a great job, as well as Penelope Cruz, which gives a tour-de-force performance here. The main talk will be Cruz, and that is because, in her few scenes, she completely electrifies the screen with her rambling, lunatic and haunting portrayal as Juan Antonio's ex wife. Her awards sweep has been greatly deserved. But I also thought that Hall has been greatly ignored. She does the best with her scenes, and she is very natural, and realistic. She also gives one heck of a performance.<br/><br/>Overall, one very entertaining, artistic, and memorable film. Surely one of the films of 2007 that will be greatly appreciated with time, and very deserving too."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","11","17 August 2008"," Woody in Barcelona
","After breaking free from his too-comfortable habitat of New York and 3 encounters with Britain, Woody Allen went even further with his European adventure. When his ""Spanish project"" (working title) finally emerged as ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" in Cannes earlier this year, it was well received. The current general release in North America solidifies the consensus that Allen is alive and well, as nods from critics come from every direction.<br/><br/>In Allen's characteristic style, the story of two girls' summer sojourning in Barcelona moves along in crisp pace, becoming immediately engaging with its interesting characters and scintillating dialogue. The frequent use voice-over narration upset some critics, but frees the actors from the task of development of story and plot, allowing them to concentrate on development of the characters. And this is where the fun begins.<br/><br/>It starts with Vicky and Christina accepting charismatic painter Juan Antonio's invitation to a weekend in his idyllic resort to, among other things, ""make love"", ""all three of us, hopefully"". His easy candor in admitting that he is attracted by the beauty of both of them is disarming ti Christina but annoying to Vicky. But things are not what they seem.<br/><br/>Romantic-minded and sexually adventurous Christina, naturally the object of Juan Antonio's seduction, is out of action for the entire weekend, down with some local disease. Sensible, composed, soon-to-be-married Vicky becomes Juan Antonio's somewhat reluctant companion for the weekend. As Juan Antonio is cautious not to step over the line of a friendly tour guide, the time they spend together is not unpleasant. He even takes her to visit his Spanish-speaking father (reminds me of ""An affair to remember"", 1957). But then, under the romantic enchantment or the Spanish night and guitar, and with the help of the wine from dinner, the two finally connected, both figuratively and literally.<br/><br/>Rational Vicky turns out to be the most confused, unable to get Juan Antonia off her mind. Juan Antonia turns out to be the most rational. Entirely honest and calmly logical, he refrains from pursuing a meaningless relationship with Vicky and turns his attention to Christina. When Vicky's dull fiancée comes up with and puts into action the idea of coming to Barcelona to consummate the marriage originally planned for the fall, things seems to have stabilized. But we are not even having half the fun yet.<br/><br/>About half-way into the movie, in storms Juan Antonio's estranged wife Maria Elena, critics' descriptions of whom include ""combustible"" and ""tempestuous"". But she is also ultra-talented  not only that she was the one who initiated Juan Antonio on painting, she is also good enough to be a concert pianist. After a short initial claws-out stage, the women find friendship, and more. In order to help Christina tap her talents in photography, Maria Elena has a dark room constructed. Then, when she starts caressing Christina in said dark room, a new, three-way equilibrium is found. For a while, it looks like the three will carry on in this idyllic existence indefinitely.<br/><br/>But just like Vicky and Juan Antonio, Christine is not what initially meets the eye. The hopelessly romantic, erotic adventurer in her disappears, and she wants out. Without her as the ""marriage lubricant"" the relationship between the once estranged couple falls apart once more. Then, it's back to Juan Antonio and Vicky, who is now UNhappily married.<br/><br/>Such sumptuous, rich material in Allen's hands make wonders, due also not the least to the capable cast. Javier Bardem successfully erased his almost inerasable, blood chilling image from ""No country for old men"" with perfectly executed under-acting. Scarlett Johansson gives her best to portraying the dreamily sensuous American tourist in a perpetual search for romantic love. Appearing only in the second half of the movie, Penelope Cruz is at her fiery best. If she'd also sang (as she did in ""Volver""), she would have stolen the entire show. And it's a real shame, on the producers, that they Rebecca Hall (""The prestige"") did not get the same billing as the other three, for playing the most difficult character Vicky, and doing it so well."

","Woody Allen has created some great work throughout his career. This however doesn't fall into that decreasing category. It is an altogether boring, self indulgent piece filled with characters that speak in the same voice. No one has anything close to resembling an arc or development and every central character ends up exactly where they started having learnt nothing from their experiences. One might call that a spoiler however there is nothing to spoil as nothing happens of consequence. It is completely flat and uninspired. Even a decent (but not Oscar worthy in my opinion) performance from Penelope Cruz can't save this film from itself.

The encounter with Juan has an effect on both of them. Penelope Cruz later turns up as his volatile and suicidal wife. However she inspires Cristina's own artistic ambitions as a photographer whereas Vicky later has to deal with whether she wants her safe fiancé or someone passionate like Juan.<br/><br/>The film is well photographed, well it has to be when you dealing with the subject of art and artists, you need to make good use of light and colours. The film also makes good use of Barcelona with Gaudi's architecture being featured as well as the medieval narrow streets of Barcelona. You also get a bit of the Ramblas as well just to make sure that the tourist trail is followed.<br/><br/>However the film is slight, a bit of fluff and the fireworks only start when Cruz turns up as Maria who adds bite to the film. From the early moments when you see Vicky being stand offish to Juan's invitation you know that both women are going to end up sleeping with him, well these artistic types always get the women in films and more freethinking they are then more the merrier.<br/><br/>Good performances from the four leads with Cruz being exceptional but Allen's script is so-so."

And while it's much less pronounced than in his other works, the pretentious contrived dialogue creeps in a little too often. But despite this, the film is generally quite enjoyable. The cast, Penelope Cruz especially, are predictably mesmerising and I actually quite like the narration- even if it did feel a bit like a rip-off of Amelie.

Here Allen uses the same characters that are used mostly as caricatures and gave them real life and emotions that is not at all justifiable characters but still humane that it creates a certain amount of empathy for them."

","This movie is a masterpiece especially if you are into Art. After watching the film you will notice how much we are wasting our precious time and money on watching those Superheroes movies which give us an hour of pleasure and nothing else, The writer shows us the real angle of the life and love plus it forces us to think about how much we will be happy if we try not to label relationships and forget about what is right and wrong in Love and love each other with pure Heart then imagine how much our life will be peaceful and beautiful. Woody Allen tried to explain the things we barely imagine about it and these things are LOVE LOVE LOVE without rules. Now as a filmmaking student, To me everybody did his/her job with 100% passion. from writing to Music, Directing, and Acting everything is perfect. in my head, I was thinking about Javier Bardem as a villain but in this romantic movie he nails it and proved that he can fit in every act. while watching the movie I was thinking to give this movie 10 stars but the only thing which held me was the ending, maybe from my perspective but Anyway I give it 9 stars and everyone should appreciate this kind of work."

","On vacation in Spain two American girlfriends meet a tall, dark and handsome artist who satisfies their needs in unexpected ways.<br/><br/>A curious little romance that putters along until about the halfway mark, when the introduction of a new character adds some tension and darkness. The sensibility is middle class - safe and responsible - so nothing really dramatic is promised and the story resolves on a minor note: not too comfortable, restrained in emotion.<br/><br/>The performances are good, particularly from the ex-wife. Locations are idyllic. Music is gorgeous.

"tstudstrup","Null","1","1","30 May 2017"," Woody Allen tries to copy Almodovar and fails miserably!!!
","Do not believe the 7 stars this movie gets. I'm guessing this is enjoyed by Americans that are too lazy for subtitles and they accept this politically correct lame attempt at copying Pedro Almodovar. The reason I compare the two directors is because this movie takes place almost entirely in Spain, it has Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in it. And the plot could have been fun had the master Almodovar directed it. <br/><br/>Let's pretend that this was actually made by Almodovar. No annoying narrator. The two American girls would have went with Javier on his friends plane without Hall judging him and turning him down. They would have had sex in a passionate threesome and the girls would have shown their tits (or in Rebecca Halls case, lack of tits) and Javier would have sucked on them. Penelope would have shown up and one of the girls (Hall) would have ended up dead. And the others would have buried her and maybe gotten away with it. There would have been lots of Spanish dishes with references to sex. The characters would have acted immorally. Sex and lust and desire would have been what have driven the story forward. And it would have been fun to watch. <br/><br/>In Allens movie the so called sex-scenes are reduced to kissing, one time in slo-mo (what the hell Allen??) And after the sex which is always skipped the women cover up their tits from the man they just had sex with. <br/><br/>Oh and apparently in Spain artists are rich and successful. As one of Javiers artist friends own a small plane. And of course Javier can fly it and lives in a very nice villa and he has a sportscar. It's ridiculous. <br/><br/>And don't even get me started on the fact that Scarletts character just accepts it when Javier brings home ihis psychotic ex girlfriend who tried to kill him. A normal girl would have packed her bags and left. But not only does Scarlett stay. The three of them eventually becomes lovers until Scarlett gets restless for no reason at all, except that that is how her character is suppose to be and leaves them. So Hall can come back into the Picture with Javier.Come on, Allen, that's just poor writing. <br/><br/>It's also bigot and racist the way Spanish people are portrayed as irresponsible passionate people who only care about sex and never about the consequenses. Yes that is also how they behave in Almodóvars movies, but its in a bizare yuniviverse and it's pure comedy. This movie however tries to come off as a serious drama. Where the uptight Americans in the movie are the ones acting like people should be acting. The fact that Javier and Cruzes characters have that love/hate relationship, Means that they will never be happy. According to Allen. But at least they have passion and are alive, unlike the boring Americans. <br/><br/>What made it possible for me to suffer through this snooze fest, is the stunning Johannson and absolutely beautiful Cruz. The chemistry between Javier and Johansson and between Javier and Cruz is amazing and very real. Hall, however, is too tall, flat chested, boring and annoying and the kind of woman I would slap around as she's judgmental bitch from the get-go of the movie. Her character was not needed and had she not been in in the movie, it would have been more fun. Also the fact that Hall and Johansson are best friends as they're complete opposites, is not believable. Also they're clearly at different stages in their life and Hall seems to be 10 years older than Scarlett. <br/><br/>Avoid this and watch Jamon Jamon instead by Almodovar. And also with Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, only with passionate sex scenes, Spanish food, horny people behaving irresponsibly and lots of fun."
"sharky_55","4","1","1","3 September 2016"," Chinese? Why?
","The first pitfall of Vicky Cristina Barcelona is Christopher Evan Welch as the droning, omnipotent narrator. The voice-over is not an inherently bad thing to use in a film; used incorrectly it can be disastrous, but with some thought it can be a wonderful addition. If you've seen Allen at his best, then you've seen Annie Hall, and how perfectly utilised it was in that film. In Radio Days, Allen's voice-over took on a wistful, nostalgic perspective of the past, and you could feel the longing in his recount. But here it not a character or persona, barely even a tool, but simply a way of bridging the gaps of the plot and acting as a substitute for the emptiness of the characters. It pipes up whenever Allen has been too lazy to fully visualise a thought or characteristic. We are told that Juan Antonio opens up on his passion through his paintings to Cristina, but it means nothing coming from some bored voice offscreen while the pair walk aimlessly on screen around the room. <br/><br/>One of Allen's early forays into Europe sees the film utilise the picture-perfect postcard definition of Barcelona to its fullest extent. This is not the dreary New York skyline that Allen is so familiar with, where the characters are more striking than their surroundings. This is Europe and its broadest, vaguest and most exotic; the palette is awash with sun-kissed reds, oranges, browns and yellows, and Allen drenches each unspoken moment with a generous dose of Flamenco strings. It is a full-blown and unashamed fetishisation of the country's tendency for fleeting cultural and spiritual transformation, much like Coppola did with the neon-streaked Tokyo. A slightly sour note; Allen's Match Point was partially funded by BBC Films and turned out like a tourist's documentary, and the same thing has happened with this film. There must be no negative depictions or connotations in this version of Barcelona - which means the end result is every facet of the setting serving the character's emotional arcs (rather than existing in its natural state). The slum kids are merely an avenue for Cristina's artistic endeavours, but even they are brushed off for 'better' material. <br/><br/>But Allen doesn't stop there. The vacation might have been uneventful if not for the timely intervention from Bardem's Juan Antonio, local artist and lover. He is a fine actor reduced to a pretty face by both the film and Cristina, whose attractiveness and exotic accent shoulder the burden for his character. Bardem offers good looks and empty ideas, at one stage descending to the level of a teenage boy on prom night, suggesting that sex is the one true way of really discovering one's inner feelings. The film isn't actually interested in his art or passions, because they are simply a device used to contrast the boring conventionalities of the Americans and their culture (and the cardboard cutout that is Doug - even his name is ordinary). He is joined by ex-wife Maria Elena, who is Penelope Cruz at her stormiest and most tempestuous. Allen falls easily into lazy stereotyping; the pair are hot-blooded and equally hot-tempered lovers who cannot spend more than a moment together without either making love or tearing each other's hair out, and they have the strange ability to make American women flustered and instantly weak at the knees. The odds are so ridiculously stacked against them - see how Cristina's 'Chinese' is contrasted with the flurry of Spanish that they pair exchange. And who wants aspirin when you can massage the soul directly, whispering sensually and vaguely on how to exorcise its demons!<br/><br/>It seems impossible to imagine Vicky and Cristina as acquaintances, let alone friends. Allen pushes them to opposite ends of the spectrum, allowing for no middle ground. When Juan Antonio spontaneously propositions the pair of them, Vicky is offended while Cristina jumps at the opportunity. The blonde unsubtly admires his looks from a distance, and immediately dubs him as 'interesting'. It is Johansson's attractiveness working against her, as it did often in her early career. She was pegged as the blond beauty in Match Point, but had no other allure, which made the affair rather unexciting (unsurprisingly one of her best performances is a voiced one). And here she falls into cliché - these girls are always the aspiring (or struggling) actress types (she's made a 12-minute short about the impossibilities of love - no prizes for guessing how many tripods were involved in that production, or who the lead was) - airy and sexy all rolled into one. Ironically the film doesn't even deliver on that front. There is nothing sexy at all about Bardem and Johansson swallowing each other's mouths in an unbroken closeup for twenty uncomfortable seconds. The ending, if anything, salvages what little is left of this wreck. It concludes in perhaps the only way it could, by seeing Vicky and Cristina return to normalcy after their adventure. We've all experienced the depressing low after the orgasmic vacation high, so we know that it can't last forever."

","I have to admit Penelope Cruz, Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson looked all beautiful, and of course, Javier Bardem looked handsome as well, it just ain't a good movie that I have ever seen. It gave me this vibe that it was pushed to be too sexy, yes it's meant to be about a painter being all romantic and lonely after his messed up marriage. It just seemed too much like, it would've been better if he was a quiet person then a show off. Although Javier Bardem played a James Bond villain, I think in my opinion that he is normally better to play shy sexy men, then he is definitely on the right track. <br/><br/>I was surprised to think Woody Allen wrote this, he should've done a better job with the storyline.

","The only positive thing I could say about this movie is that I watched it for free on TV and didn't actually have to pay for it. Otherwise this is incredibly boring and pointless. It lasts less than an hour and a half but it feels like a 3 hour movie, that's how boring it is! You basically get the usual Hollywood love triangle plot with a few twists, which would've been thought-provoking if not outright shocking... 20 years ago. The problem is that we've gotten so used to these kind of twists in the past 20 years (Desperate Housewives, Sex in the City, Jerry Springer,... need I say more?) that they hardly come as a surprise to anyone anymore. So yeah I guess it can still be considered as thought-provoking for some conservative Mid-Western type who still don't have a TV in their houses and see a movie once every decade, otherwise this comes off as deja-vu a million times. Which is terribly disappointing when coming from Woody Allen who has made a reputation precisely out of creating unique situations and original story lines."

","The cinematography and imagery is beautiful to look at. Between the city of Barcelona and the 4 main characters, there's plenty of eye candy... so it does keep ones interest. Johansson and Hall don't put in the best of performances. Javier and Cruz do, and are responsible for giving the movie some depth. Cruz, in particular, is excellent in her very small, yet Oscar deserving role.<br/><br/>You can almost sum up the entire film with one word: Fling ""Two attractive American girls go to Barcelona and have a fling with a studly Spanish artist."" OK... and? ""And he's got a crazy-fiery Spanish former lover."" and then? ""Then they go back home. The End."" Now, some will argue the point of the movie is bigger... that it's really about trying to find happiness and contentment within the confines of standard social relationships. Hall is afraid to pursue her lusts while Johansson goes for it only to learn it's not what she wants. There are pitfalls of wanting vs. having and perhaps we can never truly be satiated.<br/><br/>Perhaps an interesting theme.

","Usually I am not too critical on films - every time I find in movie at least something useful and try not to be regretful even if the film doesn't meet all the expectations. Though that time film really didn't give as much as I hoped. It was bit monotonous and even boring. And too simple. Movie authors didn't surprise at all. Unfortunately only 5/10. Maybe the reason of disappointment was extremely positive reviews and ratings of film that I checked before watching it. :) But let's speak about some positive things, too. Firstly, Barcelona as a venue with its nice cultural places was exotic, attractant and very different of the most cases - it's wearily every time to see almost only big and modern US cities in films. Secondly, Rebecca Hall was just brilliant - in my opinion her performance was brighter then more known Johansson and Cruz. And finally film provides many options how to perceive relations in our lives - it doesn't enforce any ""only-true"" point of view, everybody can make his own conclusion. Personally I watched it with Vicky's eyes because she was the one who got most of new experiences and got undeceived.<br/><br/>p.s. Probably females would like this movie more as for me it seemed typical melodrama (just with some deeper psychological aspects, not so ""cheep""). p.p.s. It's my first comment on IMDb.

"MaxBorg89","9","5","12","10 October 2008"," Yo soy Woody Allen
","After three years in England, Woody Allen ends his European vacation (his next feature, starring Seinfeld co-creator Larry David, is set in New York) in Spain, and delivers his freshest, funniest comedy in eleven years (the wonderfully self-deprecating Deconstructing Harry came out in 1997). In reality, Vicky Cristina Barcelona (the title alone borders on genius) contains nothing completely new for an Allen film: love, unhappiness, neurosis, chronic dissatisfaction. But instead of remaking one of his older New York films with younger actors (Anything Else compared to Annie Hall, for example), he uses the new, more romantic setting to breathe fresh air into the age-old story, supported by a fiery cast.<br/><br/>As implied by the title, the main characters are Vicky (Rebecca Hall), Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) and the city of Barcelona, where the two spend the summer together. Vicky, the more rational one, is there to work on her university thesis (Catalan lifestyle) and take some time off before her imminent wedding. Cristina, who is more impulsive, came along to have some fun. Through one of Vicky's relatives (Patricia Clarkson, always as good) they meet an up-and-coming painter, Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem), a man who embraces the positive aspects of life despite believing it to be ultimately pointless. In a classic Allen scene, he invites Vicky and Cristina to come with him to Oviedo for a weekend, explaining they will enjoy the sights, the food, the wine and, uh, the lovemaking. At this point, a mildly shocked Vicky asks: ""Excuse me, but who's gonna make love?"" Juan Antonio, as serious as a horny Spaniard will ever be, replies: ""Hopefully, all three of us.""<br/><br/>Revealing anything else about the unusual threesome is a disservice to Allen's witty script. An exception would be mentioning that halfway through the movie Juan Antonio's psychotic ex- wife, Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz), comes back home, and that's when the real madness ensues and one remembers why they fell in love with Woody's movies in the first place. For years, his modus operandi has been: take a relationship, mess it up, see what happens. Perhaps the fact that he doesn't play the leading role anymore (in fact, like in his best post-2000 film, Match Point, he doesn't appear at all) has encouraged him to try ""crazier"" things. In this case, the Spanish setting and the casting of Cruz (whom he wanted to work with at all costs after seeing the beautiful Volver) enable to him to blend his classic ""neurotic love story"" with a sort of spoof of the telenovela genre, following the example of the TV show Ugly Betty (which, like most of Allen's work, takes place in the Big Apple). The Spanish actress, matching the feisty intensity she showed in Almodovar's black comedy, is on top form, giving a spontaneous, wild performance that should earn her a second Oscar nomination. Not that her American co-stars are less good: Johansson cements her status as the director's new muse with a vitality that shows how terrific she can be when cast in the right part, while Hall, who is actually British, channels early Diane Keaton (from Woody's golden period) with grace.<br/><br/>And what about the male cast? Well, there are only two presences who are prominent enough to rival with the Johansson-Hall-Cruz trio: Bardem and the omniscient narrator. The latter is actually a problem sometimes: it's fine, even entertaining, when he deadpans on events as we see them happen on the screen (especially when he describes an encounter between Cristina and Juan Antonio), less so when he insists on telling us exactly how the characters are feeling. Fortunately, Bardem compensates that occasional lack of charm by exuding loads of it: obviously relishing the opportunity to lighten up his image after his Oscar-winning turn in No Country for Old Men, he replaces that film's icy stare with a smile that could seduce anyone and speaks his lines with a warm earnestness few people wouldn't enjoy.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a good thing that Allen's holiday ends here. After all, his London trilogy started superbly and ended on a less encouraging note, therefore it's wise of him to not attempt the same thing with Barcelona and return to America, leaving the misadventures of Vicky and Cristina as an indication that perhaps, hopefully, he has found his way again."
"EUyeshima","8","5","12","25 August 2008"," Allen Finds His Romantic and Artistic Muse in Spain with a Sharp, Eclectic Cast
","From a thematic standpoint, Woody Allen's latest film offers nothing we haven't already seen in his earlier work like ""Manhattan"" and ""Hannah and Her Sisters"". Like those classics and several lesser efforts, this 2008 romantic dramedy is a distilled examination of why men and women long for romance and how we fluidly fall in and out of love as a result, often with dire consequences and not without personal humiliation. What makes this entry particularly welcome is the full-blooded infusion of Spanish art and architecture that brings an emotional ripeness to the story. It also helps that Allen has gathered a more eclectic cast than usual to inhabit the richly developed characters. This is easily the most enjoyable film he has made since going abroad and probably his funniest since at least 2000's ""Small Time Crooks"".<br/><br/>The plot focuses on two American college friends, polar opposites on the subject of love, as they vacation in Barcelona for the summer. As the conservative one who values stability and devotion, Vicky is there to study ""Catalan Identity"" as she waits to return to the states to marry Doug, an ambitious young man who maps out their future with a stifling lack of spontaneity. Failed filmmaker Cristina, on the other hand, is a romantic adventurer who craves unbridled passion with no limits. Their differing perspectives on love clash immediately when they both catch the eye of renowned abstract painter Juan Antonio. He makes a supremely self-confident proposition to Vicky and Cristina to join him on a romantic weekend trip to Oviedo, a picturesque town near the northern coast. Naturally, Vicky is appalled and makes no bones in telling him so, but Cristina is excited by the idea of being seduced by him. They agree to go with him and face unexpected consequences. Things get even more complicated when Juan Antonio's tempestuous ex-wife Maria Elena shows up and forces him to face his weaknesses.<br/><br/>Part of the resulting roundelay feels like a throwback to Allen's ""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy"", but there is also a palpable sense of melancholy more reminiscent of his mid-period films like ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and ""Husbands and Wives"". What remains consistent throughout is the filmmaker's incurable romanticism, a freshly optimistic viewpoint that makes the film thoroughly pleasurable despite the familiar set-up. The performances are terrific beginning with Rebecca Hall, a surprising find as Vicky, a young woman who thought she knew what she wanted only to find out too late that it's not what she wants at all. As a typical Allen heroine, Hall lets her initially strident manner as Vicky give way to a resonating sadness. As for Scarlett Johansson, the third time's definitely a charm. In ""Match Point"", Allen exploited her effortless sensuality, while he tried to make her a fumbling Diane Keaton copy in ""Scoop"". As Cristina, however, she gets to blend together her carnal allure and comic insecurity in a more seamless fashion. She has a wonderfully funny moment when she just can't control her titillation at Juan Antonio's proposal in the restaurant.<br/><br/>For those who have only recently been introduced to his mesmerizing work by way of his maniacal killer in the Coen Brothers' ""No Country for Old Men"", Javier Bardem is completely convincing as Juan Antonio, a man who effortlessly controls the fates of the three women enraptured by his sensual manner and open soul. Unlike a shallower actor like Antonio Banderas, Bardem manages to move between smoldering and vulnerable with fluency. As Maria Elena, Penélope Cruz finally comes into her own in a non-Almodóvar film. Taking the concept of a tortured artist to an extreme, the actress blazes with dangerous vitality, even though the role is relatively minor. She brings visceral life to the combative relationship between her and Juan Antonio, and at the same time, displays a sharp Allenesque wit, especially when she slyly ridicules Cristina in Spanish during their tension-filled conversations. The always-reliable Patricia Clarkson is quietly effective as a family friend of Vicki's with secrets of her own, while Chris Messina conveys the right level of unctuous smarminess as Doug.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful to look at thanks to the luscious, sun-dappled cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe. With Gaudi's most famous work on display, Barcelona could hardly look more appealing on film. Just as evocative is the atmospheric music by a bevy of contemporary Spanish composers. The one aspect that doesn't work quite as well as intended is Christopher Evan Welch's stentorian narration, which lacks the right level of irony to make the ploy worthwhile. Most of the time, it comes across as a conceit to explain parts of the narrative that seem clear enough from the scenes. Regardless, this is a genuine return to form for Allen and well worth seeing for fans."

""Beautiful"", ""fresh"" or ""Woody style"", used by others, are probably the last words that come to my mind after recalling that experience of terribly wasted 90 minutes of my life (at least, I haven't paid for it a penny, the price of wasted time is high, still) - ""Edsel"", that's probably the word fulfilling all the feelings about this Allen's movie.<br/><br/>I feel like seeing completely different movie than the others, with their plenty-of-stars ratings. ""My"" movie was based probably on a short, not more than 15 pages long story of an aspiring writer, who thinks that telling a story without any point is OK. The director, aspiring one as well, then took this topic and made a documentary of it, narrator being the utterly ubiquitous part of the realization. He somehow got those superstars of Southern California to act in it, so he probably got some connections, and, if he learns from mistakes he made in this movie, can be expected to become one of the numerous ordinary directors making seven sterile romantic comedies a year...<br/><br/>..And then you realize, that both the writer and director were Woody Allen. When I watched his earlier films, I usually laughed a lot, cos those were filled with irony and fresh joy of an extraordinary presentation of something ordinary. Now, Woody is just ordinary. It's not this movie only - seeing Melinda and Melinda was also an experience you wonder what the hell have you made to deserve it, for without some fun put into it by Will Ferrell, it is completely stupid. And now, Woody came with Melinda Melinda Barcelona minus Ferrell...<br/><br/>It's a shame that one of the best movie makers of past is embarrassing himself with crap like that.

"ghostflash","10","4","9","29 March 2009"," Woody Allen Still Has It
","Many films attempt to explore the oh-so-clichéd subject - love. Most of these films fail completely. But Woody Allen has proved time and time again that he really does understand this complex emotion in all it's manifestations, Vicky Cristina Barcelona being no exception.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to find films like this which don't shy away from the difficult questions and don't try and give easy answers. Vicky and Cristina are two characters who, unlike the rest of the characters, don't know what they want. Indeed, Cristina at one point says ""All I know is what I don't want""; Vicky and Cristina are truly on a quest for love and happiness.<br/><br/>They are opposites in one sense. Vicky's kind of love is about commitment and security whereas Cristina wants the excitement of something alternative and the heart-stopping feeling of romance. Both Cristina and Vicky go through considerable development and at the end of the film they are much less sure about their viewpoint. These different manifestations are given equal weight and it is left up to the viewer to decide which is 'right' or 'for them'. It makes one think deeply about what we want out of life and love.<br/><br/>Allen has constructed a beautiful tale which is pleasingly unpredictable. The narration which has received much criticism I didn't mind at all and I would argue that this God-affect adds much more scope and the feeling of destiny to the story.<br/><br/>The beauty of the subject matter is reflected in the beauty of the setting. Barcelona is given a chance to shine as the characters experience its sumptuous vitality and magnificent architecture. A story of love always seems to work better in these exotic climates. Perhaps because love itself is exotic and other, like the setting.<br/><br/>The fine performances from the whole cast add even more poignancy to the story. The beautiful melancholy of Scarlett Johansson, the creepiness yet seductiveness of Javier Bardem (showing his range), the non-believer then confusion of Rebecca Hall and the intimidating, funny yet beautiful Penelope Cruz.<br/><br/>Allen proves again his insight into our deep dilemmas and most yearning desires."

"flipshoes","Null","4","9","21 December 2008"," Unbelievable b***sh*t
","Let's begin with: I've seen every single movie of Woody Allen's several times, so I do know what to compare the latest one with. And I love his classics, ""Annie Hall"", ""Hannah and her sisters"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and what have you. So I really loved the world of Mr. Allen, the topics he dealt with and many of the characters he created in the past. <br/><br/>But since the last few of his pictures I get the slight impression that Woody Allen is trying to be someone he isn't and never will be. He was great at making films such as the aforementioned but he always failed when he tried to be Bergman or Hitchcock. Recently - I presume due to his constant successes in Europe - he has turned to doing ultimately more ""European""-style films. After two (supposedly) British films, he tries to bring us a Spanish-flavored movie, dealing with (as usual *yawn*) the topics of people in search of relationships, the meaning of life in general and art in particular, and - especially - the question of how to express one's feelings in art, depending on if one has talent (or even genius) or none. (And of course we know from ten thousand films in history that artists are troubled personalities. *yawn again*) <br/><br/>Now this one is full of clichés, in fact if one were to give an annual prize to the film containing the most clichés and one-dimensional characters (I would suggest calling it the ""Imitation of Life""-award), then ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" would beyond any doubt be the winner in 2008. It is barely unbelievable how many unrealistic, silly, and stupid clichés that one would expect only in a cheap novel appear in this picture. The story is silly beyond belief, it even requires an off-screen narrator (truly a badge of bad screen writing as one has to tell the audience things which one isn't able or willing to convey with more elegant - visual - means: basically missing everything what real film-making should be about...) to keep all parts together, the characters are so lifeless that even the good acting by Bardem or Cruz are wasted, and Catalonian life - of course - consists mainly of constant guitar music, the architecture of Gaudí and the pleasure of good food, sex and wine... <br/><br/>All that is so unbelievably superficial that one could imagine it having been conceived by a Harold Robbins-style writer. (As a mere example: sure, any painter would have a friend owning a private jet and would be able to fly it; and obviously, all characters are wealthy past compare and never have to deal with any day to day worries.) <br/><br/>Which brings me to the last point of criticism: Woody Allen's universe has always been one-dimensional to a certain degree. His characters have always only been inhabitants of the limited cosmos of Mr. Allen; you find artists, writers, filmmakers and actors and the likes. Unfortunately, the world in which I live also includes engineers, scientists, tax inspectors, waitresses, car mechanics, cab drivers etc. And their everyday life is quite different, yet most interesting and rewarding as well. <br/><br/>So, basically I think this anaemic world view of Mr. Allen's has ultimately lost its charms. What remains are merely clichés, clichés, and clichés. And they are getting worse and worse from film to film."

","Put together a bunch of great, internationally renowned actors, a beautiful, almost magical location, and one of the most talented director of our times. What do you get? A whole lot of nothing.<br/><br/>Vicky Cristina Barcelona remains to this day one of Allen's lesser efforts. The movie virtually stands for nothing, nothing meaningful, that is. There is no story, no motto, no grander meaning apart from screwing irresponsibly on your summer vacation. I'm amazed how shallow and uninteresting the characters were written, even the scene they star on, the beautiful, one-of-a- kind city of Barcelona is showed lackluster and boring. There's nothing intelligent, nothing to re- live again and again, nothing to think of. It's like the movie never existed. It's huge disappointment from such master as Allen."

","I just saw this film. I never saw it before because I read the bad reviews when it came out, and that cooled down my usual enthusiasm for Woody Allen's films.<br/><br/>I love his work, some of it passionately. <br/><br/>And I was quite surprised at the quality of this work. Maybe because of the bad reviews I read when it came out. One should never read reviews about a movie that one wants to see. One must go and see it and then, later on, if one so decides, one can read the reviews. <br/><br/>Most of them usually disagree so much among themselves that it seems they are talking about different movies!! First of all, having lived myself in Barcelona during 15 years I must say I was constantly moved by the different (gorgeous) locations I know so well and used to visit almost daily (Oh, Dear..., one of the most beautiful and fascinating cities I had ever known!!).<br/><br/>Talking about Barcelona's locations, I must say that they picked up for this film some of the most expensive, high class, exclusive neighborhoods in that town. <br/><br/>After a while I thought: ""These characters are millionaires!"", because practically very few people can afford to live in those places (next to Paradise). <br/><br/>The pacing is excellent, the photography gorgeous, and of course, Allen's philosophy (very bitter, ultra-realistic and the point of view of somebody that is already back from everything) if practiced by more people, would make this world a better place to live in. <br/><br/>I'm not sure that very young people would have the poise of these characters under similar circumstances. <br/><br/>But the whole effect works for the story, it's very entertaining and if you stop to think about many lines, a deep wisdom runs under apparently frivolous talk. <br/><br/>The actors, excellent all of them, the girls very pretty and Bardem, as usual, one of the sexiest men walking around on this earth --and what a voice!"

"bobsgrock","8","3","6","27 August 2010"," Psychoanalysis in sunny, beautiful Barcelona.
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a new kind of romantic film for Woody Allen, yet it still retains many of the classic Allen themes. It captures a certain kind of open-mindedness and tolerance that few people have but would surely want to have. Watching this film, I was never quite sure of what Woody was trying to say regarding the importance of artistic motivation in life or how it affects relationships and personalities. But then again, maybe there isn't much to say on the subject.<br/><br/>Like nearly all of Woody Allen's movies, there is a deft blend of comedy and psychoanalysis in this story, though less comedy than I expected. What is really intriguing is how Allen sets up the plot, with best friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) each symbolizing the two aspects Woody sees as essential to the female. Vicky is the intellectual who devotes herself entirely to her studies and has puritanical and idealistic ideas about love and life. Cristina is the artist, open-minded and more aware of the possibilities life offers her than Vicky. Into their lives comes the brash and sensual painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who shows a much different side than his horrifying performance in No Country for Old Men, at once both passionate and caring for each woman in his life.<br/><br/>But the real fiery passion at the center of the story is Maria Elena, the ex-wife of Juan Antonio played with sexy charisma by the immaculate Penelope Cruz. She enters the story about 50 minutes in, yet immediately becomes the only thing we can look at. It is at this point that the plot slightly steers off course as we are led to believe that a polyamorous relationship would form almost immediately between three of the characters and the utopian effects it creates. Still, Allen crafts a beautiful and charming story set in the gorgeous, sunny Barcelona with stunning buildings, attractive people and a meditative tale about what happens when art and life collide, and the lasting effects it can have."
"Meven_Stoffat","3","3","6","9 November 2009"," I wish I had seen it in the theater...
","...so then I wouldn't have had to have wasted money renting the Blu-Ray! There comes a time in one's film-making career when he becomes bland and overused to the point where he needs to stop. Well, that's basically Woody Allen in a nutshell- his movies have gotten more and more boring (I would say ""Boringer and Boringer"" but that's bad grammar) as he's gone on. Joke's on me, I guess? I dunno. I'm only a mortal, not a god like Woody.<br/><br/>Vicky Christina Barcelona is a movie that's every bit as annoying and ""gritting-teeth-to-sit-through"" as it's title. Well, title first- why not just ""Vicky and Christina Go to Barcelona""? Oh right, I forgot. Allen has gotten so old that he's decided to combine words now.<br/><br/>Basically, Vicky and Christina go to Barcelona on a vacation, they meet this guy who Christina finds attractive, they follow him to this one place outside of Barcelona, Vicky likes him, Christina likes him, he likes Christina more, Vicky gets married, etc. etc. etc. Oh! I forgot! Penelope Cruz is in this movie!!!! Except she plays an unlikeable bitchy character who Bardem was married to in the past. Oh, and a love triangle begins... are you able to follow this at all? Because I'm not.<br/><br/>Thank God I rented this. I gave it 2 out of 3 stars mainly for Penelope Cruz's awesome performance (although her character was an unlikeable headcase) and the other star being for the gorgeously hot Scarlett Johansson. I think Javier Bardem is a great actor and I loved his performance as Anton Chigurh in the spectacular ""No Country For Old Men"", which remains to this day as the best movie I've ever seen in a theater. However, not even he could save this movie. His performance is a very bored and tired one, he goes through the motions and never changes his expression on his face.<br/><br/>I am also going to have to tear the narrator to shreds too. The moment the narrator's voice came on, I began laughing. He sounds like a spokesperson for Mac!!!!! What kind of drugs was he taking when he decided to hire the narrator? I am also going to tear down the ""tension building"" argument too. What tension was there? Were sentences like ""They had lunch"" or ""2 Days later, she apologized"" supposed to be tension builders???? In short, I have not seen Whatever Works yet, but I currently have no plans to. This movie was a severely missed opportunity, and proof that Allen's clearly getting too old to be doing this kind of cinema, let alone any cinema."
"verminoz","5","3","6","20 August 2009"," Huge disappointment
","I must admit I had high expectations when I saw this film. Taking into account the great cast and of course Woody Allen the least I expected was very good laughs! Instead I got a huge disappointment and a ""huh?"" feeling after the film ended.<br/><br/>It starts in a simple way and the plot rolls pretty nice and smooth. I wasn't very excited with the narration but that is not that important. It wasn't up until the middle of the film that I finally realized that it was lacking basic elements. Firstly and most important of all Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona is missing the notorious humour of Woody Allen. Even Match Point had a weird and morbid sense of humour in some moments. But VCB has none of it. Secondly the characters miss eccentricity and that special something. Not a contemporary artist leading a bohemian life, not even an open love triangle can't keep the interest high enough. And lastly we come to the end. I have nothing specific to say about that, it's simply disappointing.<br/><br/>The cast is great and their performances are pretty neat and professional. Overall it's not all bad but it's lacking basic things as I already said. I'm a Woody Allen fan, not a fanatic, but I have loved films like Annie Hall, Love And Death and even Match Point. This is not a Woody Allen film."
"jfmvp","9","3","6","23 July 2009"," Woody Knows About Life...and Love.
","You don't have to be a film student or a die-hard Woody Allen fan to be aware of his philosophy: life is messy, ruthless, and unforgiving...but that doesn't mean we can't have a little fun -- or at least try to. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" life seems like a helluva lot of fun at times, and at other times (not surprisingly) it's a complete and utter disaster.<br/><br/>The funny thing is, the fun AND the disaster seem to stem from love. Woody's OBSESSED with love; he's always trying to dissect, interpret, define and re-define it. No matter what the year, perspective or location, he seems to come to the same conclusion: <br/><br/>There are no answers in love. You can be head over heels about someone one day, and be totally indifferent to them the next. You can think you're in love with someone, when in actuality you merely lust for them. You can think you're lusting after someone, when you're actually in love with them. You can love someone, but not be IN love with them. You can be IN love with someone, and it can still go wrong. Something can still be missing.<br/><br/>These are the ideas and questions that Woody raises, and continues to raise. We're confronted by many of them in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona."" As Juan Antonio, Javier Bardem serves as a stabilizing force for this film. Having seen ""No Country for Old Men"" long before ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" I had my doubts about Bardem in this type of role. But if he doesn't nail the smooth, suave, mysterious Spaniard, he comes pretty damn close. Bardem had to be good in order for this film to work, and he came through.<br/><br/>Bardem is necessary as a stabilizing force because he's the male character at the center of it all. Sure there's Doug (played easily by Chris Messina), Vicky's husband, but he's more of a caricature than a character. What I mean by that is, Doug serves as a film-long symbol of the average, working, corporate-world American. He's a dime a dozen, and Woody's not trying to hide that. In fact, he tries pretty hard to make sure that we understand Doug's lack of originality.<br/><br/>Juan Antonio is quite the contrary: a charming, tall, European painter who always seems to say the right thing at exactly the right time. There's a mystique to Juan Antonio, and seemingly all women are drawn to him. But are they drawn to him, or does he coerce them? Does his success come naturally, or philosophically? Just more questions that Woody raises.<br/><br/>The women all performed admirably in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona."" In my opinion, Academy Award winner Penelope Cruz WAS deserving as Maria Elena, though many have since criticized the Academy for its selection. I'll respectfully disagree with the haters out there, because I measure a great performance in a very simple way: <br/><br/>Was it memorable? Sure there's more to it than that, but that's the easiest way to make a fair assessment. And yes, Maria Elena IS memorable. She's a superwoman of sorts -- talented in painting, photography, poetry, and sex -- and yet she's frail at the same time. She's a strutting contradiction, full of vivacity, passion, and personal demons. Cruz is mesmerizing, just as Woody wanted her to be.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson oozes sexuality as Cristina, and serves as the midway point between Maria Elena, and Vicky. She has some of Vicky's naturally embedded American conservatism in her, but she also has some of Maria Elena's creativity, and open-mindedness. In the end, she doesn't know what she wants out of life, or love. There's much Woody in her end result.<br/><br/>And it's getting late and I'm tired of writing, so I'll wrap it up here. Just rent ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" when you get the chance. It's locales are magnetic and envy-inducing, and the questions it raises will keep your mind busy for hours...or maybe days."

","Hi again, so Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Woody Allen, I have always had a knack for Woody. And VCB is yet another branch of that tree. The movie is a joy from start to finish, and the reasons are as follows.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansen, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, Rebecca Hall and Woody! Well that kinda explains it, Scarlett for being so good and good looking. She is so believable in stepping the shoes of Cristina, A person who know not where she is going and mearly where she has been and definitely not where she is going to end up. But yet she is so sure of her self, she is adventures, curios and not afraid of what the world can do to people.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem, wow having just seen No Country For Old Men, has changed and has become this sexy male from Spain. A Lover Of Women! An Artist, and a man in control, except his women.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz, I love her.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall, well she is like Scarlett, but, Like two books even if they are the same you still would have two different books. The same words but a different package, if you can say that.<br/><br/>Then we have got the man himself, Woody Allen. The words I could find in my mind, can not be put on paper, not now. Some of them is, He has an eye for the good story. He is a master of not letting us know where the movie is going, he surprises us. Traveling in Woody Allens head. He is so adult, I would like to understand everything in this movie, and I think that I follow the point of the story. Make me smile! Recognize yourself in the different people you encounter in those 90 minutes of Woody in his ace! The supporting cast are all, let us swell a little, Great. The locations are just, Great. I would give it 9 but hey, I can not keep giving out such high grades, gotta figure out a way not to overpraise what I see. But what I have seen in this movie, I Recommend that you spend money on this film, I recommend that you see it, and then take it to you and then move on."
"ferguson-6","8","6","16","18 August 2008"," Woody's World
","Greetings again from the darkness. I have enjoyed Mr. Allen's resurgence and obviously Scarlett Johansson has played the role of his muse. VCB takes a step up even from his most recent offerings both because of Allen's writing and the amazing cast.<br/><br/>Scarlett teams with Rebecca Hall, a relative unknown in the U.S. (best known for ""The Prestige"" and ""Wide Saragasso Sea"") to play Cristina and Vicki, two American girls spending the summer in Spain. Scarlett is the free spirit, Rebecca is the engaged, practical one. The film takes off when they are both propositioned by a local painter played brilliantly by Javier Bardem, back in his most macho and amorous element after his trip down psycho road in ""No Country for Old Men"".<br/><br/>There are no coin flips for Bardem's character. He wants everything, including both Scarlett and Rebecca. That would be enough for most films, but not for Woody! We are then treated to Bardem's ex-wife, played explosively by Penelope Cruz. She is amazing as the jealous, suicidal artist who transitions into the warm and caring mentor in a very odd communal setting with Scarlett and Javier.<br/><br/>What adds the element of Allen brilliance here is the seemingly secondary character of Vicky played by Rebecca Hall. In reality, she is the heart of the story. Feeling trapped into a marriage to a Steve Guttenberg clone played by Chris Messina, Rebecca doesn't know how to handle the awakening since her Javier moment. Woody really pushes us on the topics of love, desire, freedom, loyalty, commitment and marriage. And if you need just an element of creepiness, Rebecca Hall's speech pattern and mannerisms remind me of Woody's-ex, Mia Farrow. Maybe that's why he cast a relative unknown?? Some of Woody's best writing in a long time and a pleasure to watch these fine actors execute. The best scenes are Javier and Penelope, and Javier and Rebecca. Throw in a beautiful soundtrack of Spainish guitar and you have a truly fine film."

","No, not everything works. Even if you are Woody Allen. This one doesn't't even work if you are a huge fan of his (old) movies. Or doesn't at all, if you are one.<br/><br/>After watching this, i felt like one of his characters from his old movies, wondering what is wrong with the world. or with the movies today.<br/><br/>I went out for a cigarette and i was trying to figure out why a director/writer like W.Allen would do something as dull, as non-sense, as uninspired as this movie. And i did come to a possible answer.<br/><br/>I've red that W.Allen was undergoing psychoanalysis for over 30 years and stopped doing it at the time he started going out with Soon-Yi Previn. I guess this also matches the time, when he stopped doing good cinema.<br/><br/>It felt for me as an audience as if i would be the missing shrink who has to hear all the chaos and emptiness in his head.<br/><br/>It makes me sad, but for me it feels like Mr. Allen had become the character he was making fun of in his older movies.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of the series Sex in the city."

I won't spoil the movie at all for you but follow my advice when I tell you to go and see it.<br/><br/>But here's some warning: You gotta go absolutely free-minded.<br/><br/>This movie shows a very -hmm let's say- DIFFERENT and INTERESTING way to relationships that have always been the same to us. I personally think I'm not able to do that but it might work for others.<br/><br/>You gotta see this movie as divided. The first half is about Vicky and Cristina interacting with Juan Antonio (Javier Berdam). I would say it's very funny and entertaining but the REAL story begins with Penelope's apparition twisting the story in a way you wouldn't imagine.<br/><br/>As for the acting, my opinion is Penelope's character was the best and her interpretation was perfect. She absolutely won over the movie even though she only appears in the second half of it. Scarlett, Javier, and Rebecca's characters were as well acted as Penelope's but it was the force of the lines they had that made Penelope rise up.<br/><br/>As my first review, I'm hoping for you not to be so harsh on me. I also apologize for the many mistakes I must had since English is not my mother tongue. Go watch it! :)"
"spfeiffr","2","4","10","25 May 2010"," Woody Allen needs to retake script writing class...
","The only thing saving this tripe from being a 1 star for me is the fact that it is technically well made, the music was alright, the cinematography and editing were competently done, too bad every other element was lacking. I don't blame the actors, ask Van Gogh to paint a pile of horse droppings and don't expect anything too pretty.<br/><br/>The plot lacks some of the basic elements that we learn about in fifth grade English. There is about an hour of exposition in the film as we learn various things about the characters and as watching their lives progress in a more or less mind numbing pace. Then all of a sudden Rebecca Hall decides to have an affair with Juan Antonio, she goes to his house, then his annoyingly emo girlfriend shows up with a gun and she changes her mind, I think that's supposed to be the climax, except nothing about the story has changed. As has been said before, all of the characters are exactly where they were at the start of the film. There appears to be no ""falling action period"" and it simply jumps to denouement instead, then the credits roll. There is no plot resolution, no revelations, no fulfillment of anything. At the end of this 96 minute mess the characters are no better or worse off than they were at the beginning, and neither is the audience.<br/><br/>The acting is competently executed I guess, how much can these actors do with the two dimensional cutouts they have been given to work with. The characters themselves have little to get the audience identify with them, in fact the only characters I came close caring about were the hapless husbands of Vicky and her Aunt Judy who are relegated to supporting roles with little development or involvement in the overall story. Vicky is a self absorbed east-coast intellectual stereotype who cheats on her fiancée and is almost completely self absorbed. Christina is a moral coward and a wishy washy spoiled brat who simply goes to France for a week to ""figure herself out"" near the end of the film whatever the heck that means. Juan Antonio seems like a walking stereotype of a artsy European, who sleeps around, has deep passionate emotions which seems more at home in a Danielle Steele novel than in the real world, and he treats Cristina pretty badly once his ex shows up. Maria Elena is an overly emotional and clingy bunny boiler, and would seem more at home in a padded room than out walking the streets. She attempts to murder two people, goes through Cristina's belongings, and threatens to kill her and no one seems to care. I spent most of the movie wishing she had succeeded at killing herself when she attempted to near the beginning of the story. Finally Judy has been carrying on a long term extra-marital affair on her hapless husband, then takes it upon herself to risk breaking up Vicky's marriage by getting her back together with Juan Antonio near the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie also strikes me as subtly sexist, all of female characters are increasingly impulsive without a thought given to the consequences of their actions, their decisions are ruled largely by their libido's and emotions rather than their brains. Meanwhile all of the male characters seem far more intelligent, mature, and seem to contemplate the consequences of their decisions.<br/><br/>Overall this film fails on so many levels of basic story telling and film making that it wasn't even worth making or watching, do something more constructive with your hour and a half, like counting the hairs on your head or collecting toenail clippings."

"UncleTantra","8","4","10","10 January 2009"," Important Travel Advisory from a resident of Barcelona :-)
","Earlier today, while making silly predictions for the Golden Globe winners, I suggested that ""In Bruges"" was actually funny, whereas the other nominees in the category of Best Comedy were not. In saying that I did an injustice to Woody Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona.""<br/><br/>VCB is funny. Just not in that LOL kind of way that ""In Bruges"" was for me. It's more of a wise, unattached funny, the kind that might be written and directed by, say, the Ultimate New York Neurotic.<br/><br/>And I really loved the film. If you want an inspiration to visit my area of Catalunya, this film is it in spades. Woody has always had an uncanny eye for capturing the beauty of the locales in which he films. Think ""Manhattan."" 'Nuff said, right? OK, Barcelona and the area of Spain around it are easily as beautiful as Gordon Willis' Manhattan. And it's all right up there on screen, no special effects necessary. It's really a lovely place.<br/><br/>But, in the interest of Touristic Integrity, I feel it necessary to correct some of the clichés and/or stereotypes that Woody writes into his script, and his characters. I would not wish that hapless Americans, seduced by the vision of the joys of Catalunya as seen by a New Yorker, might venture to my adopted land expecting one thing, and thus possibly set themselves up to miss the real charms of the place. My quibbles with Woody's vision are the following:<br/><br/>1. First, not all Spanish women are as attractive as Penelope Cruz. Penelope was considered the Ugly Duckling of the class throughout her school years, and still is. The Spanish don't hold it against her, because she can act. ( On the other hand, Spanish women *are* all as crazy as her character of Maria Elena. Potential tourists, be warned. )<br/><br/>2. Second, not all guitarists in Spain are as good as the ones featured in the film. There is one guy in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona who really sucks.<br/><br/>3. Third, not all Spanish men are as charming and handsome and have as smooth a line of bull as Javier Bardem does in VCB. That's a myth, as pervasive and as misunderstood as the myth of Penelope Cruz's beauty. The only men in Spain who are as charming, handsome, and well-spoken as Javier Bardem's character Juan Antonio in VCB are American ex-pat writers living in Sitges. They also have a characteristic that Juan Antonio lacks in the film -- humility.<br/><br/>4. Fourth, and this is more trivia than a correction, part of the film is set in the city of Oviedo. One of the sights of Oviedo is a life-size statue of Woody Allen, which was installed in 2003. Woody avoided what must have been a Hitchcockian temptation to include it in the film. I guess neurotic New York filmmakers have that humility thing going for them, too.<br/><br/>Thank you for your kind attention to this Travel Advisory."
"king_nick_the_1st","8","4","10","27 August 2008"," Could be two in two
","What helps make a good movie? Just follow a current winning formula, put Javier Bardem in it. Vicky Cristina Barcelona, is Woody Allen's latest creation, and is one of his best in recent memory. What makes this movie shine is not its sharp dialogue or decent story, it's the characters within the movie, that move this picture along in such a successful way. Vicky, Cristina, Juan Antonio (Bardem), Maria Elena (Cruz), and even the city of Barcelona is character in its own way. Every single one of these people are unique, have there own charm and character arcs in the movie that make is come together well.<br/><br/>Like the title of this review says, Javier Bardem could be going for two in two years for the best-supporting Oscar, though it's likely he will lose to Heath Ledger's Joker performance. Penelope Cruz provides a phenomenal supporting role as Bardem's crazy ex-wife, and should also garner an Oscar nod this year. While the two main leads in this movie provide fairly standard performances that don't particularly stand out, the character arcs written into are interesting enough to keep the audience entertained. Perhaps the more interesting of the two characters is Rebecca Hall's Vicky, who has extremely convincing moral conflicts that pushes her character through the movie. While not entirely convinced in Scarlett Johansson's acting chops, her Cristina characters bizarre love triangle with Bardem and Cruz, is one of the more interesting story aspects in the movie.<br/><br/>Another interesting point within the movie is the use of a narrator to help move the story along, while this could be a double edged sword, this also allows for the story to avoid lengthy scenes of explanation, which are quickly summed up by the narration. This though can help with the characters at time, because he explains psychology for dummies into the thought processes of the characters when necessary.<br/><br/>Pros: Bardem, Cruz deliver superb performances as attractive, charming, and eccentric characters. Very interesting character arcs, and moral conflicts within the characters. Barcelona is absolutely gorgeous as a back drop for a summer romance.<br/><br/>Cons: Not entirely sold on Scarlett Johansson just yet. Story sometimes becomes dry. The use of a narrator can be hit or miss, even though it hits more than misses. Makes you wish you were in Barcelona... but your not.<br/><br/>Overall: A movie most girl friends will try and drag their boyfriends to. If your into psychological movies, with a lighter tone, and great character arcs, see it. This movie will give you something to talk about once you leave the theater."

","Woody is witty and Woody can write. Woody Allen is a legend in his own right. Yet for a writer/director to re-invent himself and become even better after forty plus years of film-making is astonishing. Indeed, we all can appreciate the quintessential Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1979) Woody Allen, yet I must say that with a directorial achievement like Match Point (2005) and this written and directing magnum opus that is Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Allen is reaching his prime at the one-can-only-imagine-but-still-wouldn't-put-it-past-him end of his career! From the premise of two American girls spending a few months in beautiful Barcelona, Spain, to the moment where a Spaniard sweeps them away with one of the best pickup line in film history, this film captures the audience and does not let go. The picture feels like an incredible fantastic voyage with all the nuances and subtleties of a decidedly credible characters, context, complications and conclusion. Allen is able to contrast, appeal, intrigue, attract, convey, question and move. The only way you may want to snooze is if you're a dreamer like some of the characters.<br/><br/>Effortlessly, art, language and many iterations of love are explored in an enchanting, engaging and almost transporting way. If the movie had to have one fault it is but an irritating detail I've notice: Vicky is studying Catalan culture and we do not get to hear any Catalan language which is near impossible, the action taking place mostly in Catalan Barcelona. After the New Yorker spent years and films describing, delighting and even naming a movie after his city*, and giving justice to London in his last two Johansson features, Woody will unfortunately get this wrong about the eclectic Barcelona.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson stole the show in Woody's Match Point (2005) and Scoop (2006), but here she is equally polarized by the challenging and crafty performances of Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz & newcomer Rebecca Hall. Scarlett is her nonchalant gorgeous self, but what creates the sensuous, easy yet forbidden, high sexuality is a sumptuous synergy of the writing, acting and directing. A mental, affecting, visual and visceral arousal is cultivated throughout the movie and takes so many forms that you feel you've been privy to an emotionally charged sexual extravaganza.<br/><br/>Beyond the sexual tension, the plot makes for a very interesting, innovative and captivating human relationship roller-coaster as we can expect from an Allen screenplay. We are left with a sort of romantic comedy for grownups. There are no overly graphic sex scenes, yet the movie smells sex and feels sexy from title to credit. Much credit is due to Allen for his vision and his ability to harness acting and technical talent to bring to life this evocative, down-to-earth, film epiphany.<br/><br/>""Life is the ultimate work of art."" And how about this for a tagline!?! Simply brilliant, simple but brilliant.. Besides interesting conversational dialog and narrating monologue, Allen's text include such originality as Juan's father not wanting to publish his beautiful poetry in attempts to get back at the world. When Vicky finally asks why, Juan becomes philosophical. Lots to think about, to feel and to digest This motion picture is a daring and savory meal. A poetic paella perhaps <br/><br/>* Spike Lee may be the only real contender for hardcore pro-NYC film-making."

","I'll be brief, since I don't like reviewing films that much. However, I just hope to warn any possible viewers giving my point of view in what I believe is a good movie that could have been much better if it wasn't such an awful representation of Barcelona.<br/><br/>With this film, Allen claimed he wanted to make a film ""where the city was the protagonist"". Well, in this, the film is a miserable failure. The whole representation is like some sort of anti-septic city, beautiful and monumental, almost like some earthy paradise, with people owning large houses and living beside the mountain. Of course, I couldn't ask for Woody Allen to make actual social commentaries- that would be for someone else- but I think he exceeded a little the whole ""beautiful shots"" a lot, it's almost like a tourist guide, there is nothing of the true Barcelona here. Rumours say that Allen was pressured to make such a nice view of Barcelona by the government of the city, that paid for part of the film. I am unsure, however the most ""realistic"" part was when he showed the street prostitutes, the rest is purely postcard. I was expecting this when I heard he would shoot in my city, which is in fact very beautiful and monumental, yes, but also has another side, much larger and much more charming (even if darker) that has been completely ignored.<br/><br/>The rest of the film, I enjoyed a lot. I am glad Penelope and Bardem were cast in the film, as they make- to my taste- the most interesting characters in the film. The relationships of the characters are interesting, and even though they are mostly clichés, the way they are used is very intelligent. It could have been better, but I can't complain since the film kept me interested most of the time, even though it bugged me a little with it's excessive voice over narrations, I was expecting a whole Jeunet style ""like/don't like"" scene at any moment.<br/><br/>But this review is mainly a statement from someone who lives in Barcelona, just pointing out the representation of the city is fake and forced, purely promotional. Sure, it is still beautiful, but not the way Woody puts its. Hell, it would have been much more credible if Christina had been robbed at least once."
"st-shot","5","5","14","25 August 2008"," Luke warm Woody short on comedy and drama.
","Woody Allen has all but exhausted his neurotic comedy routine in this dull and vapid tale of romantic intrigue and sexual tension. He's taken the show on the road to Barcelona, Spain and installed female characters (with the assistance of a male narrator) to verbalize the same anxieties that Fielding Melish, Alvy Singer and Danny Rose turned into comic brilliance.<br/><br/>In Vicky Christina Barcelona we are presented with two American women, one grounded, one scattered who fall under the spell of a magnetic Spanish painter with Picasso bravado. Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) has little trouble bedding the free spirited Christina (Scarlet Johannsen)which to his dismay is short circuited when she comes down with food poisoning. Vicky, engaged to be married, resists Juan Antonio until the the right blend of Spanish guitar and wine do the trick. Humiliated by her backtracking she hides the truth from Christina who becomes heavily involved with Juan and moves in with him. Conflicted Vicky meanwhile agrees to marry her boyfriend in Barcelona. Back at Juan's place, passionate and unstable ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) moves in with him and Christina and spices things up.<br/><br/>VCB is neither complex or convoluted, it's just plain dull. Vicky and Christine mouth much of the same in-certitudes and anxieties found in most of Allen's films while displaying confident intellectual banter and newly discovered artistic talent. Vicky soaks up Gaudy and Catalonian culture and drones on about ""turgid intellectual imperative"" while Christina in under two months is on the road to becoming the next Cartier Bresson. In unabashed stereotyping Allen utilizes his ""hot blooded"" Spanish leads to bring and instill passion into the proceedings but his tepid dialogue and action prevent it from building and it is left to a narrator to move things along.<br/><br/>After nearly forty years of film making Allen has become a genre in himself. He was a major player during American film's last Golden Age in the 70's but since the late 80's has been hit or miss (mostly miss) with similar scenarios, dialogue and characters lifted from previous films. Farrow and Keaton have been replaced by Johansson and Barcelona pinch hits for New York City but Woody remains Woody and the lipstick he attempts to puts on this pig smudges quickly."

","Vicki (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are heading to Barcelona for the summer. Friends since college, Vicki will be working on her master's degree in Spanish culture and Cristina is going along to get over a bad relationship. On one of their first nights in the city, a great-looking artist, Juan (Javier Bardem) suggests that the two ladies accompany him to a remote town in Spain where they can, uh, have a hot threesome and do some sightseeing, too. This suggestion disgusts Vicki as she is engaged to a businessman and has her life pretty well mapped out in her head. Cristina, however, is intrigued and convinces her friend to make the trip but to refrain from any bedroom activity, if she wishes. As luck would have it, Cristina gets ill on that first evening and, unbelievably, Vicki and Juan spend the night together instead. Yet, in the morning, things change. Vicki goes back to Barcelona while Cristina begins a relationship with Juan. Into this already complicated picture comes Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). She is Juan's mentally unstable ex-wife and, after a suicide attempt, Juan brings her back to his house, where Cristina is also living. Aha! Meanwhile, Vicki's landlady, Judy (Patricia Clarkson) cautions the master's candidate that, sometimes, living for the moment is a good thing. This hits Vicki hard because, in truth, she can't stop thinking about Juan. How will this situation get resolved? Ole, Woody! Although this is not his funniest film (I adore Bullets over Broadway or Curse of the Jade Scorpion), it is definitely one of his most provocative. A menage a trois is a most difficult subject to tackle with sensitivity but, it is presented beautifully here. Also, the film asks some of those age old questions, such as what is more important, a safe, secure, and peaceful existence or a life filled with spur-of-the moment encounters that provide exciting memories? Should one make definite goals in life or give oneself an opportunity for a detour or two? As such, this is one of Allen's best movies. As for the cast, it is marvelous. Hall and Johansson, both lovely actresses, give intelligent, thought-provoking performances, although totally dissimilar. Barden is perfect for his role as the magnetic artist while Cruz, also, does a fine job as the fetching but enigmatic ex-wife. Clarkson, unfortunately, does not have enough screen time, nor does the other players, although they are certainly more than adequate. Naturally, the setting in Barcelona and other Spanish venues is most gorgeous while the costumes are also very well-selected. All of the embellishments that complete a successful film, that is, cinematography, writing and direction are nearly flawless. If you admire Allen's films, do make time to see this newest entry into his peerless catalogue of film-making. Although it is not a gut-buster like Take the Money and Run, its content is like a lightning bolt for the brain. Anyone who views it will have a mountain of matters to ponder for days and weeks after the showing."

Alas, I must confess that it took me 3 tries to watch the movie through as I was really a bit bored about the story, the acting and most of all , about this 'nerving' narrator.

","Woody Allen always one known for his offbeat and funny romantic comedy films, and I for one must say that I find most of them entertaining. Here this film is more of a crazy complex drama ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" as it's interesting and the love triangle is complex. You have two friends Vicky(Rebecca Hall)a uptight and straight arrow type who views the world as very cautious, and Cristina(Scarlett Johansson)a free spirited and adventurous type of a girl who wants to discover the world. So one summer they head to Barcelona, Spain for a stay with one of Vicky's family friends Judy(Patricia Clarkson). Soon they spot a charming and handsome looking man named Juan Gonzalo(Javier Bardem) who happens to be a Spanish artist who makes his living doing sculptures. And Juan is a seducer who beds and romances both even though it seemed odd he hit the sheets with Vicky. The lust and adventures are nice and good.<br/><br/>Only then the twist comes when enter the ex of Juan as it's been much known in Spain about the situation when his ex the beautiful Maria(Penelope Cruuz)tried to kill him. Once again this tough and sexy woman enters the lives of all three and her romance starts back up with Juan, plus she's back to her own aggressive ways of watching him every minute, and many times she will only speak Spanish, as she bucks to speak English. Slowly but surely the drama and emotional sparks start to fly, call Maria tough or just plain love crazy(a well done performance by Penelope)she is clearly the wild card of this film and she leads it to a very crazy love triangle for both Vicky and Cristina. Overall pretty good direction from Woody as he tries to prove love is complex and it can get tangled up and it still leaves many searching no matter how much fun and enjoyment they have. The love scenes were okay, and the chemistry of the cast made it a joy to watch as all were young and sexy performers. This is one love drama to check out."

","Barcelona is a beautiful city, and frankly I'd watch Cruz or Johansson take the trash out. So there was little chance of this new Woody Allen film going wrong.<br/><br/>Allen is beyond both American and European clichés, so can play with both fairly well. We see two American tourists enchanted by the surface culture of Spain, and their own inward uncertainty.<br/><br/>Allen has the massive advantage of knowing he is only ever telling one story, so finds it easy to refresh his work. That is partly why most good actors will appear in his films and do a good job - as the well appointed cast does here. Rebecca Hall does a great turn as the modern female version of the classic nebbish.<br/><br/>Where does this fit into the Allen pantheon? As his power wanes, his control weakens and so the impact of the piece fades a little. But at many points this has the strength of Manhatten or Sisters, and is a welcome addition."

","This film is brilliant. Acting, plot and also ideology are its main points and make it great.<br/><br/>Though I could spend half of an hour here talking about who good it is, I want to highlight one aspect that has called my attention very intensively.<br/><br/>It's related to the construction of the character Doug, Vicky's husband. It seems to me that he has been put on the film as the character which we would/should dislike and rebuff because his vision of the world, turned to those principles related and based on the American-capitalistic society, disapproving the conduct of Cristina, focused on the ""absolute freedom"".<br/><br/>This situation is mentioned during the film, when the narrator says that Cristina is more likely to the European society than to the American one, puritan and materialistic.<br/><br/>Althoug this ideology of the film, related to the art, freedom and pursuit of the ""real me"", Doug's position and points of view are really well built and substantiated. He can handle it with reasons and good arguments, as we can see when he talks about the ephemerality of the relationship in a ""absolute freedom"" situation, and how it leads to unhappiness.<br/><br/>Therefore, the maniqueism that we could find on the film vanishes by the confrontation of ideas, making it much better than what I could have expected. Even the the ""boring and old fashioned"" character is an outstanding one, essential to the whole story.<br/><br/>I won't talk about Penelope Cruz, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Javier Bardem. They need no words."

OK - that aside, the movie wasn't all that good. You really have to love Woody Allen's style to appreciate this movie.<br/><br/>The story's setup wasn't very believable. Basically, 2 lady friends are ""out of the blue"" propositioned by a local artist who wants them to travel with him to another city to sightsee and have sex (all three of them together). And of course ... they accept ... ya right. <br/><br/>No matter the cleverness and speed of the dialog, that basic setup is hard to swallow. There are a few other improbable actions further on in the movie, but it starts there.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the acting was really good and the dialog brainy and witty. However, the discourse sounded like Woody Allen talking instead of real/normal people.<br/><br/>The intense confrontations between the characters and social conflicts that arose were kind of interesting - but not enough to recommend this movie to the average moviegoer. <br/><br/>If you're a Woody Allen fan, you'll probably appreciate this film far more than others."
"Quinoa1984","9","5","15","25 August 2008"," Woody en Espanol
","Vicki (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlet Johansson) are the two main characters of Woody Allen's latest romantic comedy, but part of the ingenuity of the film is that the third name, Barcelona, is a character itself. Aside from the locales and hot-blooded, romantic atmosphere with Spanish guitars and wine in the night and gorgeous architecture during the day, which Allen and his DP capture wonderfully, the other characters Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) seem to spring out almost naturally out of this balmy city and country. It may be Allen's last international film for a while (according to reports his next film will be back to New York), but it's maybe the best at evoking this effect of a place on the characters (or, in spurts, its Jules and Jim inspiration).<br/><br/>Vicki and Cristina, as we learn from the Barry Lyndon-esquire authoritative narrator, are on leave from New York City in Barcelona for the summer, Vicki for studying purposes and Cristina as her friend whose looking for something new creatively after a bad acting experience and an ex-boyfriend. Almost immediately after shacking up with friends Judy and Mark (Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn), Vicki and Cristina are approached one night by local painter Juan, who tempts them (or rather Cristina) with a week end in Obejo. Cristina falls for him immediately, but Vicki, already engaged to Doug (Messina) back in New York, is resistant to his charms - which, by the end of the week end, gives way to a passionate encounter.<br/><br/>But after this, there's more complications, and not just with Vicki and Juan (or the surprise arrival of Doug to Barcelona for an also surprise wedding) and their suppressed affections. There's also Juan's ex-wife, Maria, who had a volcanic relationship and who comes back into Juan's life while Cristina is staying with him. To say much more would reveal and spoil a lot more of the fun and romance and questions Allen raises about monogamy and the complacency of marriage. Which, on the surface, might not sound like the 72 year old filmmaker is pursuing anything new to cover, as he's explored marriage, infidelity, and, as Maria Elena says at one point to Cristina, chronic dissatisfaction with lovers.<br/><br/>And yet when it's at its best, and here's the surprising part, Vicki Cristina Barcelona is Allen's funniest, most intelligent and well-acted romantic comedy in many years, maybe even in this decade (which maybe isn't saying a lot since this and Match Point are the closest he's reached to greatness since the 90s). It works because of the actors dedication to the material: Cruz is a total tornado of a presence here, with this and Volver her best performances to date; Bardem, again, shows his layers in Juan as a man of romance and love and lust but also tenderness and humor and rage and all these things that show how great an actor he is; Hall is very good in a part that some actresses might sleepwalk through if not coached and coaxed right; Clarkson, for just one or two scenes where she reveals her own fractured marriage to Vicki, is great; and Johansson, who as a given is stunning in her appearance, reveals again in the context of a Woody Allen movie how underrated she can be as an actress- when used right and not just as ho-hum window dressing.<br/><br/>It also works because Allen knows how to write dialog and relationships so brilliantly, maybe better than anyone working in film today in terms of simple but all-too-complex revelations on the trapped nature of the human condition, the struggle of what love is and what it is to be an artist, or simply how to function with someone that you love, but don't ""love"" in that same way one meets a sweeping-off-your-feet romance in Barcelona like so. The scenes he writes here are so good, and are so cool in being a kind of Woody-version of a Spanish soap opera (hysterical couple and three-way included, though not graphic), that he almost gets in the way of it with the narration. This last part is the only real significant flaw, as unlike in Husbands and Wives, where Allen used narration in a documentary style and to shorter bits of effect, here it takes some getting used to having a person talking as if reading excerpts from a trashy romance novel, and pops in giving those ""and then she never felt the same way again"" kind of notations to a character or scene that are just unnecessary.<br/><br/>If you love classic Woody Allen romance comedy, and you also are interested in how he's starting to get a little riskier, a little more interested in the existential angles of his characters that he's touched on off-and-on for years and has only finally (Match Point and Cassandra's Dream) opened up in full bitter glory, this is the pick of the rest of the summer, maybe even of the year. Overall, you just don't get rom-coms this smart, or just plain funny and perfectly PG-13 outrageous, as Vicki Cristina Barcelona gets."

Without going into great detail I'll just say I agreed with many of the negative reviews on this site concerning where the film failed: the narration ( jaw droppingly awful, the acting ( perhaps with the exception of Cruz) and the writing ( how badly did this script need a rewrite). If the film could have been saved it would have been by the last scene- but alas, by then the ship had sunk. I'm not giving up on Woody, he's too good a writer (maybe he could write about something he knows- like getting old- it might not be marketable but it could be great). Once Woody's film persona complained about TV audiences taste level ""having been systematically lowered""- unfortunately that's where his good reviews are now coming from.

While Cristina goes there to pursue an interest in photography.

Soon after they return to Barcelona, Cristina is ensconced in Juan Antonio's house and Vicky is awaiting the arrival of his beau, who thinks it might be romantic to get married in Spain, to try out the show in the provinces before opening for family and friends in New York. Then Maria Elena appears on the scene, penniless and in emotional upheaval. Though their marriage ended when she literally stabbed him in the back, Juan Antonio feels obliged to take her in. And Cristina goes along with the new arrangement.<br/><br/>This is one of the best Woody Allen movie in years.It has great dialogue.It is refreshing to have pretty people who say witty and sometimes interesting things.Besides Allen's amazing dialogue, he also had the most perfect musical score and some great ideas on how to shoot certain scenes.Also worth mentioning that this movie was shot on location in Spain that provided the film a beautiful cinematography. The acting is also commendable.Penelope Cruz is definitely superb as Maria Elena by elevating what could be stereotypical role into indelible characters.Obviously,her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress is a testament to that.Overall,it was definitely one of the most enjoyable and best films during its time of release."
"jkysharma","8","2","4","4 July 2010"," Penélope Cruz
","There are about a handful of film-makers whose influence on their films is unmistakable. Woody Allen defines this group and among Americans, only Martin Scorsese's influence is as pervading. This makes it hard to speak about Allen's films without his views on life, death and relationships getting more than a passing mention. Having seen only one prior to Vicky Cristina (Annie Hall), I'll stay away from reflections on that. A few things struck me. One of them was the way Barcelona was shot (Vicky is seduced by Barça, Juan Antonio is representative of the moods the city brings out in her). Excuse the digression, but Spanish Guitar ! How convenient ! The cinematographer (a chap with a wonderfully cinematic name Javier Aguirresarobe) and Allen capture, not merely the sights of Barcelona, but also the charming homes (villas had to be a Spanish term), cafés and cobbled, undulating roads. It feels as if Barca is both seductress and seduced. All the characters in the film are in love with it and the resultant effect on the viewer is a seduction that lasts about hundred minutes.<br/><br/>The other seduction was Penélope Cruz. She does a Maria Elena that nearly overshadows everything else about the film. It is in Allen's understanding of what her character signifies to the trio that this is avoided. Her portrayal is more poetry than prose. The beauty, grace and poise of it is bewitching which makes the irrationality of her condition vexing, and annotates our interest in her character. If Spain is anything like Maria Elena, then it is worth savouring. Javier Bardem's Juan Antonio is the bedrock of the film. The only way in which I can say anything about the performance is in the assurance of his juggling act.<br/><br/>Strangely, some of the film's pitfalls lie with Vicky and Cristina. Where there ought to be shades, Allen gives us diametric opposites. This, for me, is an easy way out on the part of film-makers. I guess it makes the character scripting process all the more easier. Despite that the contrasts are a little too gaudy here and muted colours could've given scope for multiple viewings. The real issue is in its germination to the voice over which, plainly put, should've been scrapped. It robs the film of a subtle touch, or a hidden hand rather. Ultimately, the performances from Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson hold our attention and keep it from straying too much. Rebecca Hall, in particular, is every bit the revelation that people have made her out to be."

It's not a movie you will get life lessons, not a movie you will be amazed by the complexity and the clever story, it's an atmospheric movie to create an erotic and artistic mood. I think Javier Bardem is just wonderful in this one, playing a seductive and messed up artist, he really gives depth to the character with his acting. The general feeling is pretty good, a nice, different, but still casual movie to experience something different but not too philosophical. The nice feel of a romantic experience without the cliche theme, or the usual realism, just a fun adventure of love in Barcelona."

","Once again Woody explores the themes of 'Magic vs. Logic' but this time it's within the feminine psyche. There's an internal debate about love and whether it's better to have of comfortable relationships versus lusty indulgences. Vicky and Cristina represent both sides of the coin. Cristina is immediately interested in Juan Antonio, but Vicky is a harder sell. Once she spends enough time with him however, she becomes enraptured. While both women have interest in the same man, Allen surprisingly never turns them against each other. Here they are always thoughtful and supportive as they explore their sexuality. While the debate and the characters are the same, this is a much subtler Woody Allen movie. There's more of an elegance to the portrayal of the artist, adultery, and immaturity. All of it feels less forced thanks to of all the beauty & charm Spain beholds. It has the same narrator that annoyed me in ""You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger"" but here it works. All of the actors are wonderful, but the underrated standout is Rebecca Hall who shows such great resilience, and unbridled passion. The part of Juan Antonio was written exclusively for Bardem, so he's a natural fit. Cruz is brilliant as erratic, violent muse. She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, but the cast as a whole is superb within this stylishly modern romance."

It is not okay to just pretend nothing happened, if the accuses are true. Nontheless, I'll try to set that aside and only rate the movie. I didn't really enjoy this film as much as Allen's other works, possibly because some typical features like the subtle humor are missing. It manages to depict love in very different and true ways but sometimes the plot is missing some tempo and personally, the narrator seemed like a disturbance sometimes. However the film delivers some great acting, big names and surely a lot of good eye for the details of relationships.<br/><br/>All in all this is a clever film about love and its forms but it is missing some of the esprit that other Woody Allen films convince with.

","My video store was doing an everything-must-go operation on their music and film articles so I bought a Blu-Ray copy of Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona for 5$ as I remembered that Penelope Cruz's performance was exceptional. When I put it on this evening I couldn't believe how insufferably bad everything else about it was.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple. It's a soft love/sex quadrangle between a guy and three women with a vague Woody Allen lemon flavor. The first woman (Rebecca Hall) is square, rich and fond of art, poetry and music. The second woman (Scarlett Johansson) is more unstable, not-so-rich but not-so-bad and fond of art, poetry and music. The third woman (Penelope Cruz) is self-destructive, not-so-rich but not-so-bad and an artist herself. The guy (Javier Bardem) is square, extremely rich and an artist himself. Together, they go sight-seeing, develop pictures in their darkroom, paint, write poetry, listen to Catalan guitar, have sex and drink expensive wine. And then everyone goes back where they came from and it's over.<br/><br/>Almost a decade after watching it for the first time, I can say that Cruz's performance holds up in depth and subtlety and that the film is still worth watching for that (the confrontation scene in the kitchen is brilliant). It actually makes up for Johansson and Hall's often-embarrassing screen time. 
Having said that, it's not their fault; it's the director's. Woody Allen's reputed technique of having his ensemble cast recite his dialogue is responsible for a lot of the film's mediocrity because the lines themselves lack the sarcasm and the grace of his finer work. As for Javier Bardem, he's stuck in neutral gear, trying to temper the monstrous imbalance between Cruz's atomic bomb of a performance and Hall and Johansson's unflavored acting.<br/><br/>One of the most frustrating elements of the entire film is the voice-over that constantly explains what the audience is supposed to figure out on its own if the film is well directed, but for some reason Allen doesn't want you to think. He'd rather have a narrator tell you what the characters are feeling or take you through an ellipsis of questionable subtlety. So for example the voice-over would tell you someone's sad when they're supposed to be sad. Maybe the director doesn't want you to think as mentioned before, or perhaps wants to think for you for ego-related reasons, or maybe tell you what to think for pretentiousness-related reasons. Whatever the case, the audience ends up feeling useless and stupid.
I find the use of voice-over in a fiction film very questionable in general, and quite problematic in Vicky. I always have trouble understanding why some directors try to blur the line between cinema and literature. There is no separation between novel language and screenplay language in here. The voice over in Vicky Cristina Barcelona is like an audiobook with optional shots. 
Not to mention that the characters speak nothing like real people. Woody Allen's really happy having one woman recite another woman's character bible instead of giving the audience the pleasure and luxury of unveiling it. This might have been fun a few times in the past but now it looks like narrative incompetence (which might actually be true).
The editing is flaky as well. I can mention several close-ups where I would've liked to see the reverse shot instead of being stuck with the original shot lasting several seconds longer than needed (which, in a feature film, can feel really awkward).<br/><br/>You've asked for a Woody Allen film and you're getting one. 
You get the color corrector who explodes the yellows to make the film look Spanish, artistic and old. Spain is yellow.
You get the aforementioned manipulated acting (if you mute some scenes you'd think Scarlett Johansson is saying ""I was told to stand like this!""). 
You get punk rock explained to you by Woody Allen: a grandfather who refuses to publish his poetry because SCREW THE SYSTEEEEEM. See, Woody knows everything about the Sex Pistols.
An excerpt from an unknown black-and-white film also makes its way out of nowhere to accompany a piece of lost voice-over midway into the film. Vicky Cristina Barcelona wouldn't be a Woody Allen film without him lecturing us on cinema. On classical cinema. On what's ""good cinema"" and what's ""bad cinema"". And we could go on and on about almost all other artistic disciplines. Classical guitar, for example, is ""good music"". It's the Catalan version of a standard Woody Allen jazz soundtrack. Taking pictures is also ""good art"" (with a silver camera, of course, not those decadent digital cameras!).
Also, the more sensual scenes of the film beg the question: has Woody Allen ever actually seen a romantic sexual encounter, let alone between two women? I'm speaking for myself but I don't think two people have ever caressed each other's arms for two seconds and started having sex right away without prior signals. Ever. Not even in Humphrey Bogart movies; at least they argued before every kiss. The events that lead to sex in Vicky Cristina are too neutral.<br/><br/>But the worst sin of the film is that its creator has no clue whatsoever who he's catering to. 
Who are the people who watch romantic comedies? 
Who are the people who watch sex comedies? 
Who are the people who watch the romantic sex adventures of Woody Allen characters in Spain? 
Who are the people who watch comedies, considering that Vicky qualifies as a comedy in Woodyland? 
""Two university graduates go wine-tasting."" 
""Two BFF's suddenly have passionate sex and fall in love with a wealthy painter (throw in a suicidal ex-lover because otherwise it's a non-story)."" 
""A woman happens to be studying Catalan painting and happens to fall in love with a Catalan painter who happens to still have feelings for his destructive ex who happens to be a Catalan painter."" 
What's the demographic for that? 
After some thinking, now I know. 
It's the people who, like Woody, think that only straight, vanilla, female polygamy is cute and acceptable and who worship the director for ""shining a light"" on that. 
It's the people who, as much as you criticize a Woody Allen film, will always answer ""Hey, it's Woody!""
It's the people who refuse to admit that there are very specific reasons why 9 Woody Allen films out of 10 lose money and that ""art-house"" is not an excuse.<br/><br/>Vicy Cristina Barcelona has its interesting aspects but it perfectly shows you that Woody Allen really lives in his own bubble. Almost all of his movies from the 21st century lack the substance to make up for that and Vicky's one of them. This used to bother the fans, now I don't think anyone bothers anymore. <br/><br/>All in all, the quality of the film is awfully mediocre. Long story short, towards the end, the square girl gets shot by the unstable woman. The square girl tells her husband Doug that her former Spanish teacher shot her by mistake. Doug buys it. That's the movie we're dealing with.<br/><br/>And that's one of the ""good"" 21st century Allen films. If you want, you can go watch Larry David scream at the camera for an hour."

They are not in competition with each other, they are merely trying to find themselves. Everyone gives a great performance, particularly Rebecca Hall and Penelope Cruz. Woody Allen is working in his element here are makes a few choices that are unorthodox, but effective. Most notable is his use of a narrator throughout in the manner that was common in the 40s and 50s.

","I finally found a Woody Allen film that didn't take place in New York that I enjoy. Vicky Cristina Barcelona isn't the first non-New York set Woody Allen film that I've liked, but it's one of only two. I've discussed this at length elsewhere so all I'll say here is Woody Allen just doesn't seem as comfortable behind the camera if he's working out of the country. Match Point is an obvious exception, as there is little to complain about regarding that outing. Anyway, the 2008 film written and directed by Woody Allen followed two best friends spending the summer in Barcelona. Starring Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall as the pair of best friends, Vicky Cristina Barcelona explores unconventional relationships and the extent one can be fulfilled by sharing love.<br/><br/>Two best friends that seem to be polar opposites plan a summer in Spain together before one of them is to wed. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) has always searched for a grounded love and a partner she can depend on as she is conventional in all aspects of life. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) has searched for a love that will set her soul on fire, one that is exciting and unpredictable. Their expectations have led them down different paths, Vicky will soon marry when she returns home, Cristina, who is single again after being hurt in her previous relationship. After a chance meeting with a Spanish painter, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) he invites the girls to travel with him on his private plane to a remote island. Ever the risk-taker, Cristina jumps at the chance for unprecedented excitement and intrigue. Vicky is much more hesitant, even attempting to talk Cristina out of going. They both eventually board the plane with Juan and make it to the island. Cristina becomes ill and it is Vicky that has a romantic evening with Juan. Feeling guilty and conflicted, Vicky leaves the island leaving Cristina and Juan to fall in love. Cristina believes she may have found the excitement in love she's been looking for, that is until Juan's ex- wife re-enters their lives.<br/><br/>Social constructs and conventional love are explored in Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Woody explores what it means to love someone that also loves someone else. Living together in an open relationship and the dynamic of three people that love each other so much that they can't survive without each other but struggle to survive the terms of their relationship provides an interesting character and another fine example of the exploration of the psyche that Woody Allen is so proficient at. The score and cinematography are gorgeous and I'm so happy that the excellent Woody Allen script made a triumphant return. I recently read an interview with Woody Allen in which he lists guilt as a motivating factor to accomplish the things he doesn't want to do, which I found interesting considering the guilt Vicky felt after cheating on her husband filled such a huge part of her character arc. It's always interesting to learn more about a filmmaker and then be able to see more of them in their work than before. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is certainly not the first film of Woody's where guilt has played a large part but it's interesting noticing it after learning that guilt plays a huge factor in his own life.<br/><br/>""Life is short, dull, and full of pain.""--Maybe Woody is right, but his films certainly help me cope with that."

","Not all of Woody Allen's later films must be major creations. VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA is another bright gem that makes up in atmosphere and insight what it may lack in scale. He rubs away the surface fibs of modern comfort to reveal the secret lives so many conceal. There are no attempts to solve the discontents that emerge, just an amused and pleasant tolerance of human foibles--accompanied by the sort of light ridicule and acceptance of offbeat lifestyles one expects from a veteran comedian. <br/><br/>Along the way we are treated to some refined cinematic work. The casting is perfect. The balance between action and voice-over is just right. The brilliant guitar accompaniment offers an effective blend of popular and classical pieces. <br/><br/>As for the direction, I especially appreciated the camera imagery. We have all seen hundreds of different ways to stage and frame kisses, but only Woody Allen would think to mask the first kiss between Juan Antonio and Vicky. It is a moment we have anticipated, and we wondered how it would look. Who else would have thought to hide it from us by having his head block their lips?--and then allow the camera to slowly move around his ear for the reveal? Brilliant."

But the two supporting characters Juan Antonio and María Elena both had beautiful, complex characteristics written on them.<br/><br/>Johansson and Hall's chemistry was magnificent, evene when hey were not in scenes together. There was not a second where I didn't believe they were best Friends. But when Cruz entered the picture, I was overwhelmed. Her ability to portray a character so convincing and so real, even if you don't understand a single word she says, as she only speaks Spanish in the movie is scary. Bardem and Cruz's chemistry is extraordinary, thanks to both of their truly great acting skills.

","This movie gets a 6/10, which is a passing grade. It's not terrible, not painful to watch, it can even be enjoyable at times, but make no mistake, this film is fluff. It's riddled with clichés of what people expect of Europe and Spain in particular. Everyone is just so sensual, artistic, living in the moment, passionate - life is just one never-ending candle-lit dinner, being serenaded by a guitar player, wine-tastings, art gallery openings, poetry readings and so on. That's life in Spain, where no one seems to work or have any other job other than being an artist.<br/><br/>The film shows two women with opposite personalities - one who knows what she wants and one who doesn't know what she wants. Things change when they visit Spain.<br/><br/>But despite all the fake artistic pretense, this is just a fluff movie. It's a summer love movie. Change the location to a beach and the characters would look absurd, contemplating leaving their lives behind to move to the beach. The dilemmas are unrealistic dilemmas. Life in Spain is not just strawberry pickings and wine-tastings, but none of that is shown. Spain is just an endless honeymoon and life in New York, although not shown, is so boring, busy, materialistic, consumerist, crowded and WASPy. There is no serious contemplation of the dilemma. One just contemplates leaving her husband but never wonders about how life would be like with her fling, just repeating ""this is crazy"" over and over. The other doesn't think, she just moves in with him, but then gets bored and moves on.<br/><br/>They both go back to how they were before - one doing whatever she wants but never satisfied and one overthinking things, over-analyzing everything and then doing exactly what she was going to do from the start. The man, whom they both had relationships with, goes back to how he was.<br/><br/>Nothing changes. It was just a ""crazy summer"" and everyone moves on. The only character development there is in this film is that one of the characters learned to become a better photographer that summer and learned how to process film in a dark room.<br/><br/>There's zero depth. Since it's also a ""comedy"" (not because of jokes, there are almost none), it just means not-serious. People have existential crises without actually thinking or suffering, couples fight without really fighting, suicide attempts, wife-beatings and attempted murders are brushed off so easily, treated so lightly as if they were ""why did you wash my whites with a red shirt?"" arguments.<br/><br/>This film is very similar to Match Point where someone had to choose between two women and two very different lives, each with their pros and cons. In this film, however, Spain has no cons and the New York is nothing but. So there is no actual dilemma. Life in a permanent honeymoon where there's more love and sex between ex-spouses (despite the wife-beatings and suicide attempts) than a newly-wed New York couple on their honeymoon.<br/><br/>Yet between the honeymoon and New York, between picnics and Wall Street, between exotic wines and large Starbucks coffee to go, both women choose to go back.<br/><br/>It's a fluffy summer film. The art, the museum visits, the guitar etc. could be easily replaced by beach experiences, snorkeling, fishing, skydiving, ukulele band, etc. It's just that drinking beer with a wife-beater on the beach as drinking foreign wines with a wife-beater in Spain.<br/><br/>There is more depth and emotion in Lost in Translation, a film in which nothing happens, than in this one where there are multiple relationships, an extra-marital affair, lesbian encounters, suicide attempts, murder attempt, wife-beating, severe food poisoning, and a whole bunch of characters.<br/><br/>For a film that talks about art, poetry and music so much, there is not one memorable song in the soundtrack, not one poem recited, no memorable paintings shown.<br/><br/>A better film would be one in which two Americans try to escape from the superficial, pretentious art scene in New York where people talk about what art is and isn't without actually discussing the art itself... and going to Spain where ""real artists"" are, only to discover that Spain has the same pretentious people and that real artists could be anywhere.<br/><br/>Instead, this is a movie where everyone and everything is a cliché, but some clichés reached the point of self-parody - the Spaniard is so unconventional that he lives with his ex-wife and they have threesomes with his girlfriends. The American husband is so conventional that he wants to get married twice - two weddings, because one is not conventional enough anymore.<br/><br/>The Spanish exes paint together, despite their differences. The American husband wants to golf on his honeymoon.<br/><br/>If you take this as a serious film, you'll be severely disappointed. If you treat it as fluff, you'll enjoy it. Lower your expectations and enjoy."

You can sense his excitement with it all...artists...old buildings...genuine culture rooted in real history, and most importantly, liberated attitudes. Europeans will find his sense of wonder painfully naive. This film is for those who have never heard of Gaudi - Woody seems determined to introduce him to us, as if it is all something new. Okaay, it will be to many, but the real problem here is the idealisation of everything.<br/><br/>In Europe you apparently get to live in a millionaire's mansion simply by splashing (literally) paint on a canvas. Even supermodels are artists...nay, geniuses. And the magic of Europe is infectious - Cristina (Scarlett Johanson) miraculously discovers her true talent as a photographer (together with a pretentious rediscovery of the darkroom). It's a shock to discover Woody is really so unsophisticated as to think we need to be handed these little artistic homilies. New York must be a narrower world than New Yorkers think.<br/><br/>There's a threesome in this film that comes about simply because everyone is, well, so wonderful in Europe, so avant-garde, so uninhibited - it's a love affair with a continent. Anyway, even if you're European and are choking on this, as well as the usual Allenesque stammering, plus the nagging suspicion that the awful title is infecting the whole film with its ungainliness, you can always simply sit back and enjoy the view. Johansson is gorgeous - and a fine actress in the right role, if only this were one - and Rebecca Hall, who gives a fine, assured performance that holds things together. Javier Bardem seems to be the new Gerard Depardieu, but like Depardieu, should stick to his own language. Woody should stick to New York."

","Vicky Cristina Barcelona possesses an energy, an intelligence and most of all, a passion that hasn't been seen from Allen in years. Gratefully, the filmmaker completely avoids making either of his actresses stand-ins or proxies for himself as he has done in the past, allowing Johansson and Hall to find the truth and humanity within their characters without forcing them to subscribe to some neurotic shtick, much less any of his other Allen-heroine clichés. Best of all, he crafts a completely believable portrait of each woman's uncertainty and in the process creates an interesting cross-section of romantic ideals between Vicky and Cristina's opposite perspectives."

","I just watched this movie yesterday the first time. It's most entertaining ever. I like Woody's movies without Woody in them. It's somehow an oxymoron. However, I feel he did better jobs as a director when he's not acting. I don't like intense romance stories. This one has right amount dramas. Recently, I watched Jane Austen's ""Pride & Prejudice"". I fell in love with her works and started reading her books. I think when writers left some room for readers to imagine is a more desirable approach. Movies used to sell fantasies to audience. Now they resonate with people. I will say I like them better now than then. Happy endings might be working but we need to be inspired sometimes."

","Allen's love letter to Barcelona finds now elderly director transported in a place completely different from his beloved New York and enjoying a romance with this magical town. Shots and characters are ""typical Woody Allen"" but it all have a new, spicy, Spanish flavor - no wonder, because it is one of the most intoxicating places I have ever visited, there is a strong atmosphere here unlike anything one might encounter elsewhere, be it architecture, history, people or simply combination of it all. <br/><br/>The interplay between two American tourists (Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall) and magnetic local couple who can't live with or without each other is pure Allen that reminds me on his previous movies (""Hannah and her sisters"" for example) where close group of people live, love and hate surrounded with class, privilege and comfort - no one seriously works here, its all talk, wine sipping, artistic friends and pursuit of pleasure. Ah yes, this is Spain so we get classical guitar, poetry, paintings and lots of Gaudi. Nothing wrong with that, except that in its heart this is still a tourist's impression of Barcelona - no wonder that work of local directors like Almodóvar, who are inspired with dirt, sweat and blood strikes me as being far closer to home. Allen's world is a different one and he is not interested in anything so prosaic as ordinary people who can't afford to simply flight a plane to Oviedo on a whim. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz are both excellent, true heart and soul of this movie. None of their American colleagues come close to their passion, charisma and presence. Perhaps it was not Allen's intention but where his American expatriates relocated in Barcelona appear spoiled and bored, it is locals who are grounded, firm and determined. However, it is very enjoyable to see director so inspired by new locations and I only wish him to live a hundred more years and making movies around the world."

","The two (make that three) female leads in this movie are absolutely must-see to-die-for gorgeous. Rebecca Hall shines engagingly as conservative Vicky. She absolutely rules! THe part written for Scarlett takes a while to pick up, and I was initially, during the first half, surprised that she would have bothered to play this much smaller role than her co-star. But then it does change. As for Penelope Cruz, she is of course great, although her character is grating most of the time.<br/><br/>Immediately off-putting though, was that cheap effect, the voice-over narrative. Bad idea. Could have been avoided. I suspect it is an editing trick to make the movie run faster, which of course works, but is really, really lame, and from an experienced director? No! <br/><br/>My other gripe is the weak ending. Come on, did the film crew overstay their welcome in Barcelona? Did their visas run out? No more film? Woody ate something bad? Budget cuts? So they just packed up and left, Game Over, The End? Had a Part 2 in mind, but nothing came of it?<br/><br/>As far as visual attractiveness go, movie is tops. But script fizzled out. I think most people would agree that it had a great start but did not live up to expectations as story progressed.<br/><br/>I would encourage everybody to see it, despite its flaws. It is ultimately charming and very realistic.<br/><br/>And, I am not one of those chronically dissatisfied people, with reference to the dialog by Maria Elena, I just had to point out that this one isn't quite as perfect as it promised to be coming out of the gate with that wonderful, wonderful scene where Juan introduces himself to Vicky and Cristina as a suitor for a threesome. I've watched that chapter on replay, it is marvelous!"
"ttetpos","8","0","0","7 August 2014"," Love and Honesty, Existential Baggage and Self-Realization
","THE ONLY BAD ELEMENTS OF THE MOVIE: <br/><br/>o- The cigarettes. They took up too much of the emotional interactions, and tainted the nearly perfect scenery of a beautiful, difficult exploration of very tender sentiments with filth.<br/><br/>o- The paintings composed by two of the main characters, Maria-Elena and Juan-Antonio. I suspect Woody Allen has the same opinion about that vacuous crap posing as ""modern art"", which is partly why Cristina's artwork is so much more profound, even though at the same time she's shown to be very insecure about it. I'm sad we only get to see very little of it, fleeting glimpses.<br/><br/>o- The ending.<br/><br/>THE REST OF THE MOVIE: It was great, though I have a really hard time forgiving the director for the ""bad elements"" described above! The way the movie was promoted when it first came out was terrible; it gave a really wrong impression through the promotional clips, ""coming attractions"", trailers, previews and posters: I vowed to boycott the movie for a few years and watch it only after the commercial and pseudo-intellectual fake excitement had passed.<br/><br/>And so it happened. I'm really glad I watched it - the movie is MUCH better than anything I expected! One element I'm really happy with is that there's a male main character who's actually good for a change, a person to look up to: Juan-Antonio is gentle, cultivated, has real depth, is honest, caring, tender, and even handles tremendously difficult, potentially lethal situations, with emotional flexibility that's guided by true love.<br/><br/>I'm sure that all the three main actresses will receive a lot of praise for portraying really well the primary characters who struggled with nearly impossible situations, handling them through very genuine personas.<br/><br/>It was clear that all four of them worked hard to portray with as much immediacy as possible feelings and behaviours which are either entirely outside the range of ""acceptable normalcy"" or totally perverted by male-chauvinism. But Scarlett Johansson and Javier Bardem took on extra burdens: what the movie demanded of them was to convey and bring to the surface aspects of being that only people who have struggled deeply with themselves can do. This is not to say that Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall did not act well - on the contrary, they were great! - but their roles demanded only parts of their conventional self, what comes easily and naturally to them.<br/><br/>I was really worried, before watching it, that the movie would have been an ode to the filthiest and sleaziest aspects of authoritarian and patriarchal perversions of male-chauvinist fantasy, ""prettified"" by Woody Allen into a pseudo-philosophical pretension. I'm so glad I was wrong! The movie really and honestly grapples with some of the most beautiful AND difficult aspects of polyamory - multifaceted relationships built on love, honesty and transparency - that it should probably be one of the first movies on the list of items for shared viewing and dialogue, especially for people who are new to the polyamory community. That dialogue is really needed badly by the community in order to feel itself closer to normalcy while it keeps expanding - pushing outwards - the limits of the ""established order"" under the present regime of Family, Private Property, the Church and the State."

","People are complaining about this movie and I think it has something to do with their expectations. I've read reviews saying something about Woody and romance. If you're searching for that don't search here. This movie isn't romantic and Rom-com is hardly fitting for it. It's an intense drama done in a really lighthearted way (it is also a comedy although it's subtle and the laughs are few but well placed) and it works without denying the depth of the drama and that's why this movie is charming: A great script with some great lines, an outstanding cast with 4 very strong performances in the center (yes 4!) and some good capturing of Spain through the photography. It makes you think but while it's very serious in the core it's quite uplifting. The movie could have been negative so easily but it delivers through the right atmosphere.<br/><br/>You should probably watch this movie if you like more subtle comedies and appreciate some depth in theme and a good approach to it.<br/><br/>This is not one of Allen's best but it's a good one and you should absolutely watch it if you're a fan of his."
"rajrouj","6","0","0","24 May 2014"," Some interesting thoughts...
","One thought which was interestingly brought forward was the idea of being in a 3 way relationship. How adding an extra person to an old deteriorated relationship, made the whole ""living together"" bearable and better. (Some couples in the beginning of the 21st century will look at the movie and wish the day Polygamous relationships would be acceptable and blessed by the Church.) But then the extra girl (Scarlett Johanson) leaves the couple for some reason and the story ends ...why she leaves I am not sure? Is Woody hinting that Americans are generally selfish, inconsiderate and never pursue an idea to the end? Is this threesome a metaphor to how American Foreign Policy should be with the other 2 world powers. If the USA stayed in bed with Russia and China (or Europe, or Africa, or whomever), there would be finally World Peace.<br/><br/>But talking of World Peace, there comes the second thought of the film which I thought was even better than the first. The father of Javier Bardem. The poet who will never publicly publicize or publish his works. And why do we ask? The father says that as long as Man doesn't learn to love and live in peace, Man will not deserve his book. A hint to a ""post-Judgment Day"" category of art. An art one becomes curious to know. An elogy to the Apocalypse.<br/><br/>I felt in this movie Woody Allen managed to send his message quite well but what became a disappointment later was that his movies that followed this didn't progress towards this post-modern art the poet father talked of. His ideas started to go backwards with Midnight in Paris asking the adolescent question: was the past better?"

","Vicky Cristina Barcelona made me want to watch more Woody Allen films. It's eye-opening expose of love in all it's guises and the complexities surrounding it. The characters are multi-faceted individuals who change and grow in striking ways as the plot unfurls, and it is highly unlikely you'll be able to guess who'll end up with who in the closing moments. It maintains a consistent level of quality throughout, but the midway point when Penelope Cruz's unstable ex-wife role is unleashed, definitely moves things to a higher level. A well deserved Oscar for her, methinks.<br/><br/>The only other Allen movies I'd watched before this one were Sleeper and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask ( that was a mouthful... lol) which were hardly indicative of his usual fare. Say what you like about the bloke's somewhat neurotic perspective, or his controversial lifestyle choices... he can both spin a good yarn and write compelling people in his films. Which is good enough for me. Now, what to put on next... 7/10"
"The_Movie_Cat","7","0","0","22 January 2012"," Woody Allen's best uncompleted movie?
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona (Allen's most nonsensical movie title since Broadway Danny Rose) is probably the best film Woody Allen never completed. With a fractured narrative and a narrator to cover the gaps, it's not even blessed with an especially strong ending. Like a lot of Allen works, things just fade to black rather than conclude. And despite all of this... it's still a very strong entry in his canon.<br/><br/>What's most interesting about Woody's work in his fifth decade as filmmaker is his decision to regularly shoot abroad and introduce us to new characters. Perhaps realising that there's only so many stories you can tell about neurotic Jewish New Yorkers, Allen pitches camp in several different locales, including three pictures set in the capital of England. <br/><br/>Of the London trilogy, then none of the films are particularly representative of a recognisable London. In fact, the characters in Cassandra's Dream (5) aren't even particularly representative of recognisable Londoners. But if the film is undermined by Ewan McGregor giving an uncharacteristically weak performance and seemingly struggling with both the leaden dialogue and the need to say ""Terry"" nearly every single line, then it was still a worthwhile experiment. An experiment that borrows from Crimes and Misdemeanors (as does Match Point, 7) but one that at least sees him pitch his director's chair in a new setting.<br/><br/>His delight in Scarlett Johannsen's company produces here her third work with the director after the memorable Match Point and the sadly forgettable Scoop (5). As he approaches his 50th movie, Allen seems to have lost his edge for pure comedy, such as with the toothless Hollywood Ending (5), wasting Larry David in mediocre Whatever Works (5) or possibly his career-worst Small Time Crooks (4). One of the best out-and-out comedies he achieved during the decade was the three minute short after the 9/11 attacks, Sounds from a Town I Love (6). Yet even that small runtime is filled with reactionary humour, like a lot of Woody's work these days. The concept of older people being outraged at younger culture is one that works to decreasing effect, even though this short generally works well. To this end his work in comedy drama or even complete drama is far more rewarding today. When it comes to the humour vehicles he was once known for, there's a sense that Woody's heart is either no longer in it or he's just going through the motions. The exception to this rule was Anything Else (7), a film that reused some jokes wholesale and met with very mixed reviews, but is surprisingly strong for this late period.<br/><br/>The rest of Allen's output for the decade – Melinda and Melinda, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (both 6) - are watchable albeit forgettable works. But when he travels abroad it's as if the trip rejuvenates a director who is beginning to approach his 80s. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of the few real successes from this run, but the point is no longer whether these are great movies, but as to whether they're NEW movies. There's already one Annie Hall, anyone can buy the DVD, and so multiple variations of it from Woody on automatic aren't what the world needs. Barcelona is an Allen film that unusually comes from a female perspective, despite a male narrator telling us what characters are thinking and feeling throughout.<br/><br/>Woody Allen has created some languid films, but ones which don't outstay their welcome: if we discount the likes of What's New, Pussycat? And Casino Royale then Allen didn't break the 100 minute mark until 1986's Hannah and Her Sisters. Since that breakthrough moment the longer format has become a fairly regular staple for Allen, with a dozen movies from 1989-2007 exceeding this length. All of which statistical musings make it doubly curious why Vicky Cristina Barcelona was hauled in at 96 minutes when at least another twenty would have done. For a low key, would-be reflective film we're frequently not given time to actually reflect, time and space constantly shunted forward and explained to us in favour of the next vignette. A strong, enjoyable movie that is deservedly one of Allen's most successful, and arguably his best since Husband and Wives... but one that could have been even more."
"Scarecrow-88","6","0","0","8 May 2010"," Vicky Cristina Barcelona
","Every bit the Woody Allen movie, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is the romantic adventures of two American tourists(Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson) over the course of a summer in Barcelona, how passionate encounters with a Bohemian artist(Javier Bardem)effect their lives for the future forever. Cristina(Johansson), must adjust to a very emotionally fragile ex-wife(Penélope Cruz)who returns to Juan Antonio's(Bardem)home after nearly committing suicide. We also are treated to the situation involving Vicky(Hall)and her struggling to get over that one heated night with Juan Antonio while now married to a wealthy hot shot businessman(Chris Messina)she doesn't truly love. Patricia Clarkson is Vicky's stepmother(..who is in love with her husband's best friend) and tries to steer her towards Juan Antonio, knowing that she doesn't love her husband and has deep feelings for the other man just out of reach.<br/><br/>As is a constant in Woody Allen's oeuvre, sex and emotional entanglements regarding love are of great consequence to the characters, except a great deal of this film is narrated, an overlapping voice informing us of the story as the principles' dialogue is drowned out by the one telling us of the difficulties, thoughts and feelings plaguing the stars of the film. Allen fans are accustomed to relationship comedies with characters who do not know what they really want and often swap partners throughout, and this 2008 movie is no different. It is refreshing to see an Allen film, however, in a different location, the beauties of Spain used splendidly as the stories for his characters are explored. I prefer the older movies where the characters have more dialogue and we aren't told almost everything by a narrator, but the cast equip the flavorful surrounding nicely and when they are allowed to speak/act, it is worthwhile, I think. Hall is a nice edition to Allen's family(Johansson has become Allen's new lead actress, this like her third film for the director), and seems to have a meatier role than Scarlett Johansson whose Cristina seems mellow and cool despite having to contend with a volatile Penélope Cruz. Cruz has the flashiest role, a loose cannon whose psyche is tempered as she becomes attached to Cristina, soon forming a loving connection which, for a while, enables the three of them, including Juan Antonio, to form a family of sorts. When you watch a Woody Allen film, you come to an understanding that oftentimes love and real feelings are brushed aside for comfort and complacency as is the case for Vicky who chooses the husband who can offer her a home and money instead of the unpredictable environment of Juan Antonio for whom she carries a serious torch for. Bardem is the handsome Lothario who sweeps everyone off their feet, charming and sensitive. I imagine many viewers will find the characters featured in this film as shallow, self-absorbed and superficial. I think the movie's greatest strength is of the unique relationship that develops between Bardem, Cruz, and Johansson."

","The conventional Vicky (Rebecca Hall), who is engaged of Doug (Chris Messina), travels to Barcelona for summer vacations in the house of their parent's friends Judy (Patricia Clarkson) and Mark Nash (Kevin Dunn) with her unconventional and open-minded friend Cristina (Scarlett Johansson). While in a restaurant, the divorced painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) flirts and invites them to travel to Oviedo with him, and also to go to bed with him. The reluctant Vicky does not accept the invitation but Cristina says yes and Vicky travels with her girlfriend. Once in Oviedo, Cristina has a crisis of ulcer and Vicky goes to sightseeing with Juan Antonio; then they go to his father's house and later they go to a guitar concert. Vicky falls in love with Juan Antonio and has sex with him. However, back in Barcelona, she does not tell anything to her friend and Cristina moves to Juan Antonio's house, while Vicky marries Doug. When the unstable former wife of Juan Antonio, Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz), has an OD, the painter brings her to his house and their troubled relationship harmonizes with the presence of Cristina, living a threesome. When Cristina asks for a time to travel to Paris and rethink their relationship, Vicky feels in doubt about her sentimental love.<br/><br/>I had a great expectation with ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", first because I am a great fan of Woody Allen, and also because of the Oscar of Penélope Cruz. Unfortunately I found this movie overrated, pretentious and annoying, with excessive narrative in off. The performance of Penélope Cruz is great, as usual, but not to be nominated and win an Oscar. Rebecca Hall has a better and better performance in this movie and Vicky is the most credible character. I like Scarlett Johansson very much, but I believe she needs to give a break in filming with Woody Allen, since her way of speaking and gestures are repetitive, like a female alter-ego of this director. Further, the yellow hair is awful. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"""

","Woody Allen's on a roll again.<br/><br/>Three years ago he gave us ""Match Point,"" a nearly perfect thriller that was unlike anything he'd done before, and last year he directed the under-appreciated ""Cassandra's Dream."" With ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" he's proved that this new artistic reawakening is more than a passing phase.<br/><br/>Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) travel to Barcelona for a summer adventure. Vicky is treading water until she marries her fiancé. Cristina, a wilder spirit, is looking for love, or at least lust. Both become involved with a dashing Spanish artist (Javier Bardem) and find that the things they took for granted about themselves may not be true after all, and each leaves Barcelona a little less grounded than she was when she arrived.<br/><br/>What makes so many Woody Allen films good is the same for this one. He understands both the dynamics of human emotions and the needs of effective drama, so if he's got even half-way decent actors in his movies the material is bound to succeed. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" he's got better than half-way decent actors. Rebecca Hall is probably the least known of the cast, but she makes one of the biggest impressions, and the movie is ""about"" Vicky more than it is anyone. Johansson and Bardem are well cast and they act their parts well. But it's Penelope Cruz, who storms into the film at about the mid-way point as Bardem's unhinged ex-wife, who you'll most remember.<br/><br/>""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" explores the differences between the way different people approach relationships. It's about the difference between those who are artists and those who are not, and it's also about the difference between Americans and Europeans. But it's never judgemental and it doesn't generalize. Every single character, even those with little screen time, is fully developed and respected by both Allen and the actors who play them. This one's a winner.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","This movie follows 2 women who fall for the same man. In the course of these dalliances, these three and nearly a half dozen more players find themselves in conventional, illicit, and unconventional liaisons. All of the characters are self-absorbed. Not a selfless soul in the bunch. So what a surprise it is for them to find that all of these relationships are unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>We get it, Mr. Allen. Life is meaningless. There is no God. Which means there are no rules. The only reasonable response is to seek gratification in the present. You've said it again and again. If I wanted a Philosophy 101 course on Sartre and Camus, I could do that with an extension course. I read The Stranger too. And moved on.<br/><br/>This movie is not unwatchable. It captures the attention - mostly. It is not an altogether unpleasant movie to watch. It is, however, forgettable and forced. One of the characters, for example, utters a line that she cannot take another ""turgid categorical imperative argument."" That's the way people talk? <br/><br/>I cannot escape the obvious - Woody Allen is throwing away the talent he has to make yet another homage to Bergman. Interiors. Crimes & Misdemeanors. Match Point. Now this. Please warn me if that train comes down the track again.<br/><br/>I'll take Scoop, Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Hollywood Endings any day over this sophomoric misery. It is unfortunate that Mr. Allen is troubled by the meaningless of existence, but I go to the movies to be entertained.

Woody ain't it. OK, I thought ""Lost in Translation"" was abysmal, but that's because I'm not entertained by superior imperial racist crap.

","I've always been a fan of Woody Allen's ability to write. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is probably Woody's best work in years. His film stars Vicky (Rebecca Hall) who early in the film fills the screen with prudish discussion and her love for her fiancée. Then there is Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) who is openly trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. <br/><br/>The anchors in this film are Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), fresh from his Oscar win for 'No Country For Old Men', his fiery ex-wife Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz) and the stunning city of Barcelona.<br/><br/>The screenplay starts with a slow narration where we find American tourists and best friends, Vicky & Cristina, having just arrived in Barcelona to spend 2-months in the beautiful, gorgeous, Catalonian city. The two quickly meet the high-flying, sexy artist Juan Antonio who invites them for a long weekend while pointing out he would enjoy their company in bed. Vicky is insulted while Cristina is interested and very much attracted to Juan Antonio. <br/><br/>The film hastens when Cristina & Juan Antonio convince Vicky to come along. The acting and dialogue are fresh, funny and unpredictable. Maria Elena steals the show when she surprisingly shows up and keeps you guessing throughout the film. The chemistry and timing are impeccable; all this reminding you of the Woody of old. <br/><br/>'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a romantic comedy set in a most beautiful part of the world with an excellent script, spicy soundtrack and amazing twists and turns. The film is wonderfully entertaining and truly a feast for the eyes. Don't miss it!"

","VCB offers, first and foremost, a very smart look at romance. It is complicated, emotional, and of course, awkwardly hilarious. The timeless Woody Allen works comedy into his latest - and one of his best - by giving us humor that isn't funny within the movie, but is hilarious to us, the viewer watching the situation unfold before us. Allen's clever and complex outlook on relationships and what romance should be (that there should be no barriers), helps make VCB the most original, likable, and best romantic comedy of the year.<br/><br/>Our actors work very well as an ensemble, especially our four main characters. The advertising makes it seem that there are only three main characters. While Bardem, Johansson, and Cruz make up the main cast, Rebecca Hall's character is just as important, and was sadly neglected in the advertising process. It's a real shame, because Hall's performance as the lovably neurotic and straight edge Vicky is a great one. It's a character we've seen countless times, but Hall brings something new to the character this time around. The inner conflict - the perfectly emoted lines - make her character the most realistic in the movie, and therefore she becomes the character the audience latches onto.<br/><br/>Bardem and Johansson are...different...in their roles. This isn't a bad thing by any means. It's just that it's hard, as a viewer, to see Bardem go from sociopathic killer Anton Chigurh to the light hearted and free spirit Juan Antonio. Bardem's transition from ""north to south"" is seamless, and he's completely believable in his part, which of course, reminds any detractors just how versatile he can be. Scarlett Johansson's role is nothing new for her, as she's played variants of her character before, and her Cristina is basically a conglomerate. Her performance could have been better, but in no way does it take away from the film. She could have accentuated the 'free spirit' aspect of her character.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz is nothing short of brilliant in her role as Bardem's ex-wife. The chemistry between Bardem and Cruz is electric, and is the emotional center of the movie. Much of who Bardem's character is centers around the performance of the actress playing his ex. Cruz is excellent, with her bilingual, unstable, and explosive performance. An Oscar nomination should be given here, though I don't know if it'll happen.<br/><br/>I also feel the need to note the excellent dialog, which is always present in an Allen film. The script is great, and again, an Oscar nomination is possible here as well. The film moves along quickly with beautiful shots of a beautiful city in Barcelona. Allen uses all the city's beauty to his advantage to make the film even better.<br/><br/>When dealing with performers that are as good looking as the actors we have here, the sexual tension presented by the film is already at an elevated level. Well, in the case of VCB, the sexual tension between ALL our character is so dynamic, palpable, and electric that you might get a little sweaty in the theater. It's a very sexy, hot, and hormone exciting film. If there's someone you know might be open to having a 'good time' with you, this is definitely the film to put them in the mood. In the end though, VCB is among Woody Allen's greatest movies, and is definitely one of the better films of the year. It's a smart romance movie that is a good break from the stupid and formulaic romcoms that are being churned out every other month."

"robert-temple-1","10","3","9","25 April 2009"," One of Woody Allen's best
","It has become fashionable to 'dump on' Woody Allen these days. People say he's past it, his films aren't what they were, why doesn't he dry up. That is all nonsense. This film has all the freshness and verve of the Woody of his youthful prime. People forget that 'Take the Money and Run', his first film, was terrible. It took him a long time to become as good a director as he is. He had to struggle against categories, trying to be serious sometimes (it could be said he has always been serious, and his humour was a blind). In this wonderful film, containing some of the funniest of scenes, and from which he is absent as an actor, we find a serious tale communicated to us as a hilarious comedy. The biggest and best surprise of the film is the radiant performance of Rebecca Hall. Many of us remember the way she dominated the British television mini-series 'The Camomile Lawn', as a child of about ten, stealing the scenes from many famous adult actors. Now she has become a big girl (indeed, surprisingly tall), and her childlike charm has been preserved as in amber, inside a sensitive adult persona, giving an irresistible mixture of inner innocence and outer 'seen it all' confidence which she has created for herself as an exterior protective layer. Woody Allen has always had a genius for bringing the best out of women in his movies. Some of the most memorable and glowing female performances in cinema history are to be found in his movies. I would rate that as his greatest gift to us, exceeding even his comedy and his pathos. In this film, two other splendid actresses also excel. Once again, we see an incredibly incisive and intuitive performance by Scarlett Johansson, this time as a girl who doesn't know what she wants, but only knows what she doesn't want, and isn't too sure about that either. By getting inside this character, Johansson shows us the inner vacuity of the girl, who is a kind of charming village idiot who wanders the world, beautiful, alluring, and passionate, and about as clued up as an old boot. This character relates to Rebecca Hall's ordered and sensible girl in a sublime symbiosis. Into this heady mix comes the other gal: Penelope Cruz at her fieriest and most intensely Spanish, ranting, raving, loving, hating, cursing, firing pistols, sobbing, collapsing, springing up and having another go, - it is all so magnificent. The man they all dance round is Javier Bardem, a narcissistic painter lacking in real talent, who cannot help himself, but remains a serial seducer even while telling all the girls he loves Penelope, when she isn't trying to kill him, that is. How did a man of Woody Allen's age write anything so wildly passionate as this? And direct it so successfully? Inside some older guys there is a teenager full of testosterone struggling to burst out: and he does! This film has so much energy and passion, you would think it had been made by someone in his twenties. And it helps that Hall and Johansson are at their very peak of attraction and allure just now, all of which is brought out by that magician, Woody Allen"
"imxo","6","3","9","4 September 2008"," Inoffensive; Mildly Diverting
","A 73-year old director apparently encouraging upper middle class poseurs to ""seize the day"" - a la Woody, perhaps? There are a couple of subdued chuckles to be had in this movie, but mostly it seems to be directed toward a special type of regretful woman approaching or just past menopause. There's not a sign of the sharp wit Woody was noted for; instead, it's just a rather bored sigh. This movie is about as inspiring as a New Yorker cartoon, and seemingly meant for the same audience: affluent, pretentious, unhappy.<br/><br/>What was Woody trying to do in this film, make Scarlett Johansson seem dense and dull? That's unforgivable. All the actors were absolutely fine, especially Penelope Cruz, but the writing was just not there. I think this was an especially poor effort from the former maestro."
"Robert_duder","8","3","9","24 August 2008"," Woody Allen takes my virginity...wow does that ever sound wrong?
","As huge a film buff as I am I am almost sure I have never laid eyes on a Woody Allen film. I think I might have seen bits and pieces of Match Point but that's the closest I've ever came. So I decided while in the city to see Vicky Christina Barcelona and change that once and for all. I know Allen's reputation...obscure and candid visions of love and reality and life and in that way I think Vicky Christina Barcelona fits Allen's genre profile perfectly. It might be different for him but it's the same idea and the message is blindingly clear in a droll, sarcastic, almost darkly comedic way. Life's perfection is in the eye of the person living it. Fortunately the film finds it's way into being not just some piece of Allen art but actually pretty entertaining. I hesitate to refer to it as a romance because of the twisted nature of the whole thing but isn't that just the entire idea of an Allen film? Certainly the third part of the film's title helps the entire idea and that's Barcelona. The stunning cinematography and beautiful Spanish setting is fun to watch and just very lovely. I did learn a great deal about Woody Allen fans as people around me of all ages laughed to tears like they were watching a slapstick Steve Carell movie. I mean Allen's sense of humor is not slapstick by any means and while the humor was very tongue in cheek and more something you'd smirk at these people thought it hilarious.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall is really terrific as straight laced, level headed Vicky who does everything in her power to convince herself and her best friend that life is black or white and never gray. Hall doesn't really shoot to the forefront of the film but she is still really good and does a great job supporting the stronger cast. I'm not sure though that she could carry a film on her own. Still within the cast she is good. I admit that I figured no matter what I thought of my first Woody Allen movie I knew it couldn't be that bad cause I would have Scarlett Johansson to look at. I mean remarkably the girl is talented despite some obscure choices in the roles over the years but the drop dead sexy, voluptuous blonde bombshell does a great job playing carefree, and morally obscured Christina. The role seems to fit her very well. She is lovely to watch and her character is fiery and keeps the story moving at a great pace. Javier Bardem takes a big turn from last years disappointing No Country for Old Men, as free spirited Spanish artist Juan Antonio who has some passionate views about true love and the likes. Bardem looks remarkably sexy and has a very passionate affair with Johansson and has good chemistry with both girls. He does a terrific job in his role and no one else could have given the performance like he does. Penélope Cruz gives a mind blowing incredible performance as Bardem's completely unbalanced passionate Spanish ex-wife Maria Elena. She is the highlight of the film completely and utterly. The film builds her character for a good portion of it, her wild personality and Bardem's turbulent and passionate relationship with her that you figure the actual appearance of her and the relationship would be anti climatic but that isn't the case at all. Bardem and Cruz are fiery and passionate and darkly hilarious. Christopher Evan Welch also adds to the Allen style as the monotoned but perfectly added Narrator to the entire story.<br/><br/>The characters are all very different, each with their own view on life, and each in their own place and this one trip to Barcelona effects each one of them in a different way. In the end do any of them learn anything about love? I kind of think...no. Allen's film could be intellectually debated for hours but it could also just be watched and enjoyed although some might find the story a little juvenile and the movie moves kind of slowly. The hour and a half feels like two hours easy. One of the most shocking parts of the entire film is all the rumor and barrage of media coverage about a ""steamy scene"" between stars Cruz and Johansson which I can promise you never happens except for a very brief kiss that is hardly erotic at all. It seems that a lot of film buffs and critics are doing what tends to happen with artsy movies and that is they are making a bigger deal about it than it deserves. While it entertains and has some interesting intellectual properties, it isn't mind blowing, nor does it revolutionize film making. It's just a good movie period. 8/10"
"Michael Fargo","8","3","9","16 August 2008"," Zelig-ing Almodóvar...and quite well
","Fans of Woody Allen have gotten used to him ""honoring"" other directors (Fellini, Bergman, Hitchcock), but I'm not sure any other director could get away with what he does. Woody Allen's talent has always been as a writer, and in this outing, he writes. Perhaps over-writes. The voice over narration digests a lot of the circumstances here that I think the audience would have be capable of doing and become more involved had it been omitted. This is a gorgeous film, well-edited, fully developed in its analysis of a well-worn path (that would be ""love""), and I wished Allen would have trusted what he'd put together.<br/><br/>It's a rip-off of several Almodóvar films, ""Talk to Her"" being the most ""honored."" While both films share the same cinematographer, I think this movie rises a level above Almodóvar's film visually. And what a beautiful setting this is.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the weakest element of the film is in the performances of the two leads of the title, Vicky (a lanky Rebecca West) and Christina (the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). You could accuse Allen of losing his ear in some of the exchanges between the two which sound reluctant and improvised. But others in the cast do very (very) well.<br/><br/>Patricia Clarkson needs to be in every movie made. She brings such conviction to any role. Putting ""sexy"" back in his work after ""No Country for Old Men,"" Javier Bardem is not only watchable, but quite believable as the hedonist who threads the women in this film around his, uh, finger.<br/><br/>And then God created Penélope Cruz (let's all give thanks). Funny and tragic at the same time is quite a feat, but she pulls it off effortlessly here proving her work in Almodóvar's ""Volver"" wasn't a fluke. Any time she's on the screen only Bardem matches her acting. We're left wondering (as Cruz' character wonders) what can Bardem possibly see in these two American tourists? <br/><br/>I almost skipped this film, but it was quite enjoyable at every level. It's Woody Allen's most successful work in years. While ""Match Point"" was fun, it was plot heavy. And let's face it, no one talks the way people talk in a Woody Allen film. But here his graduate school dialectic is appropriate for the two leads, who are immersed in their degrees. By the end of the film a lot of the stuffing has been knocked out of those who believe matters of the heart can either be measured and weighed or bear no consequence to the participants, and it's welcome to see Allen turn the tables on those who over-intellectualize the Universeand love."
"joachimokeefe","3","2","5","27 March 2014"," A bourgeois fantasy that fizzles out in 50 degrees of narcissism
","VCB is the tale of two American women, Vicky and Cristina (Hall and Johanssen), who visit Barcelona one summer. Both fall in love with the same man (Bardem) who is terminally entangled with his (utterly narcissistic) ex-wife (Cruz). Cristina temporarily enters this menage-a-trois, then she breaks up with them and goes to Antibes for a while. Vicky is then tempted to kick over the traces with her boring new husband (blah blah), but thanks to the ex-wife's use of a gun, decides to return to the USA with her husband and Cristina.<br/><br/>If you've never been to Spain, Woody Allen's VCB will make you want to go. The look of VCB is great, all honey, warmth and harmonious landscape and architecture (if you stay in the pretty bits). You will also find a lot to enjoy in looking at Scarlett Johanssen, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall, who are fine specimens of sexy human beings and do what I believe is called 'Acting'. The music is also great. Unfortunately, the story doesn't lead anywhere. And the anonymous WASP narrator gets rather annoying, particularly as the dialogue is so wordy anyway. Chris Messina as the husband wins the 'I am the Woody Allen character' badge, by the way.<br/><br/>I call VCB a bourgeois fantasy because it's like (and inferior to) one of those Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies from the thirties, in that all the characters are free to explore their romantic impulses in this beautiful setting without ever having to worry about bills, rent, doing their roots, selling their art/photographs/poetry, cooking, shopping, dentists, weight gain, laundry, contraception, mosquitoes, ageing parents, neurotic children - you get the picture: real life, apart from some jet-set lifestyle from a magazine, does not figure in this movie. And that would be fine, which it is in Fred'n'Ginger movies, if VCB wasn't so dependent on the audience caring what happens to the two friends. <br/><br/>The feeling goes, ""Wow, this is a tough dilemma; but since all the characters' luxurious lifestyles (including invisible domestic staff) are unaffected by it, the problem isn't really serious. Therefore there is nothing to worry about"". At this point you say to yourself, ""Get on with it then, Mr. Director!"". And the story fails to deliver anything resembling resolution, because there never really was any conflict. Fred'n'Ginger movies usually had some sort of 'real-life' problem to resolve, like a show to put on, or a divorce or social differences; Woody Allen focuses exclusively on problems of the heart, which as anybody who lives in the real world will tell you, is only part of the story. In spite of its pretensions to true drama, there is never in VCB a single moment of pathos.<br/><br/>3 stars for the acting, photography and music. None for the story or direction."
"john-hind","3","2","5","22 December 2013"," Sunk by the voice-over!
","I'll put up with almost anything from Woody Allen, but the atrocity of the voice-over sinks this film beyond redemption for me, that plus the lazy ""tourist fiction"" treatment of Barcelona.<br/><br/>This is a pity, because the dialog is great, the acting good and the cinematography wonderful. Penelope Cruz deserves her Oscar and Scarlett Johansen's young female version of Woody (complete with ulcers for goodness sake) is priceless!<br/><br/>But the script background detail seems to have come entirely from the Barcelona half-page in one of those ""Europe in a week"" guides – Vicky studies the architecture of Gaudi and ""Catalan identity"", Juan Antonio paints like a cut rate Miro (while Maria Elena paints rather good Miro pastiche, a nice touch), Juan Antonio's poet father seems to be Lorca if he had survived the firing squad.<br/><br/>Now, about that voice-over! My theory is it was written by Woody's lawyer and voice-acted by his orthodontist. Half of it is telling us what we can plainly see on the screen whilst the other half annoyingly and tritely tells us what the characters are thinking. Put a little more faith in your actors and your audience Woody!<br/><br/>I cannot resist some quotes:<br/><br/>""Lunch was served on the terrace"" - over a shot of a terrace with people eating a meal while the sun is high in the sky.<br/><br/>""Vicky met her fiancé at the airport"" - over a beautifully framed shot of Vicky hugging a guy with suitcases (with whom we've just seen her make wedding plans on the phone) in a big glass building with airliners maneuvering in the background.<br/><br/>""Cristina, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena went riding in the country"" – shot of three familiar people riding bikes down a country lane.<br/><br/>""Judy's plans to save Vicky from her fate were put on terminal hold."" - Come on, either they were terminated or they were put on hold, it cannot be both – was this doggerel even edited?<br/><br/>The first time I watched this film I genuinely thought I'd accidentally engaged the audio description for people with visual impairment! Unfortunately Woody never revisits his films, but re-cutting to lose the voice-over and add some new location shooting or stock footage to fill a few narrative holes could probably rescue this."

This guy can play anything , from a cold blood murderer like in ""No country for old men"" to a charming artist like in this movie .

","It would be cynical of you to suggest that Woody Allen conceived this project purely as a means of getting Scarlett Johansson and Penélope Cruz to kiss, so perish the thought; it is unworthy of you. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008)' is another of Allen's recent turns away from comedy, but nevertheless plays more lightheartedly than the tense neo-noir 'Match Point (2006).' The film is a breezy excursion into the subtleties of love and desire, as two American tourists (Johansson and Rebecca Hall) spend a few idyllic summer months in Spain, getting wooed by romantic, straight-talking artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), also an enthusiastic advocate of what is traditionally termed the ""menage à trois."" His attempts at seducing both the uptight Vicky (Hall) and the free-spirited Cristina (Johannson) are interrupted by the arrival of Maria Helena (Penélope Cruz), Juan Antonio's ex-wife, a nasty temper smouldering beneath a striking exterior. <br/><br/>Allen does an odd little thing here: in the opening moments, he introduces a chirpy narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) who periodically chimes in to unnecessarily and wordily voice the characters' thoughts and actions, not as a participant, but as a smug, omniscient storyteller. The narration must surely be intended as ironic; there's a patent absurdity in trying to explain human emotions via such glib, superficial remarks. This complaint aside, the film is beautifully shot, with strong performances only enhanced by the breathtaking shooting locations. Scarlett Johannson's character carries shades of her role in 'Lost in Translation (2002),' as Cristina struggles – and will, posits Allen, continue to struggle – to find satisfaction in her lifestyle. In fact, the film doesn't really end well for anybody, harking back to the disillusionment that concluded 'Annie Hall (1977),' and the realisation that we're in it only because we ""need the eggs."""
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","5","27 March 2010"," The difficulty of defining love
","This is only the third film by Woody that I catch(the others being Annie Hall, which I loved, and Manhattan, that I enjoyed), but I've heard that some of his more recent work is unimpressive when compared to the older; having not been exposed to the ones people speak ill of, I maintain that this is him doing well. Granted, it is perhaps not hilarious... I think it's really the kind of comedy that garners chuckles, and it certainly isn't trying too hard with any of the jokes(I didn't feel like I was constantly supposed to be laughing), and this is definitely clever. And no, this is not *the* most romantic movie he's given us. That doesn't mean it's bad. What this is, however, is a smart, open-minded and not judgmental piece about love that doesn't, as many would on account of the material, stoop to the lowest common denominator(with that said, the sensuality of the stars isn't exactly lost on the camera operators). The stars all shine. This is only the second time I watch something with Hall(The Prestige), and she really does perfectly in portraying a young woman who wants to be rational and pragmatic in all areas. Johansson is stunning as the adventurous Christina. Cruz is always a pleasure, especially in her mother tongue, and her role as the unstable artist is marvelous. Bardem I've seen in Mar adentra(and Collateral, though I do not recall him in that), a picture I cannot praise enough, and he is spot-on as the charming and direct painter Juan Antonio. The fact that not a single one of them is flat or one-note is a real credit to the script(that's a nice amount of development in 90 minutes), as is the realistic relationships between the credible characters. There is a lot of sexuality(if no nudity, and much is implied or mainly dealt with through dialog), a little violence/intensity and infrequent strong language(several of the words are in Spanish and subtitled) in this. It is not for children. The DVD comes with three trailers. I recommend this to fans of the genres, Allen and/or those attracted to the concept of it. 8/10"

","Though having been a movie buff for a long time, I hadn’t watched much of Woody Allen’s movies till recently when “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” was telecast on Zee Studio that opened my eyes to this gem of a movie and the great man behind it. It went without saying that I followed this up watching “Match Point”, “Scoop” and “Hollywood Ending”. The sheer beauty of storytelling without the frills runs through them all.<br/><br/>In this movie, he dissects relationships and lays bare the feelings, physical, emotional and circumstantial that affects romance. The trick is to watch it without making value judgments. Love could blossom in the most unpredictable situations and between unlikely partners. And, in the end, it could all be just so transient! <br/><br/>Set in a summer at Barcelona, the story traces the two months spent by two friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson). While Vicky is interested in Catalan culture in which she was doing her masters, Cristina looked for a change of scenery after giving up on a short film and breaking up with a boyfriend. Despite similar views on most issues, the duo had absolutely divergent views on love! <br/><br/>The girls bump into an artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) at an art gallery. Later at dinner he propositions them for a weekend of fun at Oviedo. Shot to precision, this is my favorite scene. As the offer is made, the two girls react differently. While Cristina finds Juan Antonio interesting, Vicky detests the idea of following him to Oviedo. But, strange as things turn out, Vicky and Juan Antonio make love eventually.<br/><br/>Vicky is drawn to the artist who still loves his ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz, Oscar winner for a Supporting role) who believes that only unfulfilled love can be romantic and had stabbed Juan Antonio. As the days pass, Cristina and Juan Antonio’s are in love and start living together. Vicky then gets married to Doug, her betrothed but her life has changed forever after what she’d experienced in Oviedo.<br/><br/>Maria Elena re-enters the scene. Though having gone green over Juan Antonio initially, Cristina and Maria Elena start their own romance with Antonio joining in later. They discover that Cristina was the missing ingredient in their romance. Though the going is good, Cristina is soon over with Juan Antonio and Maria Elena and falls out. Vicky then tries to take Cristina’s place and ends up getting shot.<br/><br/>In the end, the girls Vicky and Cristina leave Spain, Vicky back to Doug and Cristina back to nowhere ad the artist couple break up. All are back where they started. And you are left wiser to world cinema. Well, if you wondered why Barcelona? The city offered to support the budget if it were short there. Hence, Woody Allen’s original draft for San Francisco was changed to fit Barcelona. The result is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The story, screenplay and performances are amazing. The Oscar wins and nominations say enough already. It’s a testimony to the superiority of art over high budgets. If you are in a mood for some classy cinema, I recommend this for your DVD collection."

","I'm not going to add much more to what's already been written. Yes, it is a somewhat tedious film in terms of style, but, like another reviewer commented, it is fairly solid in terms of Allen's later work.<br/><br/>What we have here is some pretty pointed commentary on an age old dilemma, and its manifestation in modern times. We are witness to the temptation of the mad-handsome-artistic-genius to two young woman who are ostensibly social opposites. Both escape, but not before succumbing to this man's charms and false promises.<br/><br/>Ultimately does it really matter what a person's past is? It should, but is not always pertinent. As many an investment broker and banker has stated ""Past performance is no guarantee of future results."" Again, ultimately it is the human need, the human heart, that wins out in the end. And isn't that what really matters? The tawdriness was a weakness, and perhaps would've been best avoided. We see the weakness of the characters as they ignore all the warning signs, and go through the motions of ill fated decisions. Fortunately it all works out in the end.<br/><br/>Production values; standard Wood Allen fare, I think I miss him narrating the film, and would've appreciated him as a minor character... maybe an art instructor who witnesses the whole thing first hand.<br/><br/>Regardless, I found the film entertaining, though hard to digest in one sitting. Yes, I too subscribe to his ""earlier funnier ones"" theory, but appreciate the art he's created in his later years."
"harborrat28","5","4","15","24 August 2008"," Another Disappointment Fueled By Uncritical Critics
","After reading a couple of over-the-top reviews in New York publications, I was anxious to see Vicky Christina Barcelona. I felt that I had not seen a truly enjoyable Allen movie for about two decades, believing that Allen -- although he talked the self-disparaging talk -- had long ago begun to take himself much too seriously. And this was before his despicable personal behavior in ending his marriage for his stepdaughter (using, undoubtedly, many of the rationalizations he has raised to gospel in this movie). <br/><br/>I'd hated Matchpoint both because it was improbable (which I can tolerate in an otherwise well-conceived and executed work) and because it is difficult to ""hear"" Woody Allen opining on moral ambiguity. Although I realized that there were possible mines lying in wait in VCB, the reviews were so good; I had just (finally) seen Bardem in The Sea Inside and liked it very much; I am going to Barcelona in a few weeks; I had just seen Elegy with it's wonderful performance by Cruz, so I figured how bad could it be?? <br/><br/>Barcelona and the cinematography were beautiful and Cruz was stupendous. Bardem, Hall and Johansson were all pretty wooden (which could be attributed in part to the script) and neither Hall nor Johansson is fit to share the stage with Cruz (or even Bardem for that matter). In fact, if the truth be spoken, from most angles Johansson has a decidedly porcine look no matter how they dress her up. And imaging a neo-Picasso falling for Johansson or Hall was truly funny. Sure, wanting to get into their pants was credible -- as Dave Van Ronk said in Cocaine Blues, ""You take Mary, I'll take Sue/Can' tell the difference between the two/Turn 'em upside down.""<br/><br/>Worst of all, both the overlying narrative and the screeds of the various characters on the subject of sexual freedom and not succumbing to a banal life with a person one didn't truly, passionately love had a terrible effect on me visually. It was as if I were one of Annie Hall's WASP parents....the speaker's face, whoever it was, would turn into schlubby Woody Allen right before my eyes and the sentiments were rendered vapid and ridiculous without the redeeming humor of Allen's early movies.<br/><br/>Moving his films out of New York has not saved Allen from the pit of self-indulgent, pretentious twaddle that he fell into sometime at the end of the eighties or in the early nineties.<br/><br/>Since writing this I have visited Barcelona, where I learned that Allen was paid to use Barcelona & to promote it. Not surprising from this ethical paragon...."

","Or Beautiful People Doing Beautiful Things. This film features a gorgeous cast but luckily they can all act, making for an all round pleasurable experience. I enjoyed it immensely for its humour, originality and great writing, as well as a generous amount of casual sex and great views of Barcelona.<br/><br/>Two young women arrive for the summer in Barcelona (one of the world's great cities  I recommend it), planning on staying with old friend Judy Nash (Patricia Clarkson, excellent as always). Vicky (Rebecca Hall, who I enjoyed in The Prestige. She seems equally at home playing Brits or Americans) is engaged to be married. She's intelligent but cautious, traditional and more than a little skeptical. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) is restless, artsy without any direction, perhaps shallow, rootless. Cristina is looking for some kind of ultimate love affair, while Vicky is more practical, settling for what she sees as a 'good enough' relationship with reliable Doug back in the USA.<br/><br/>At a gallery opening they see Javier Bardem's Juan Antonio from a distance; he's an artist, well known, successful and very, very sexy. Later in a local restaurant, he approaches them and asks them to fly to Oviedo with him for a weekend of good food, good wine and, hopefully, good sex. In an amusing scene, we see cynical Vicky telling him exactly why they won't go with him, while Cristina tells him with everything including her body language, exactly why they will. Juan Antonio is charmingly upfront. There is no pretense, no coyness. Just ""Life is short, let's make the most of it and share some pleasure."" He is quite irresistible. I think whoever is managing Javier Bardem's career is doing a really good job, because coming after his psychopathic killer in No Country for Old Men, this is a glorious part for him. Yes, it's a male fantasy, but with a guy this good, it could be a female fantasy too.<br/><br/>They fly to Oviedo where Cristina gets sick and takes to her bed, while Vicky and Juan Antonio find a surprising amount in common. Later, back in Barcelona, Vicky throws herself into art study and language lessons, determined not to let her quickie with Juan interfere with her life plan, while Cristina moves in with Juan Antonio and takes up photography. Everything goes swimmingly until his erratic (and erotic) ex wife Maria Elena, played fabulously by Penelope Cruz, shows up. Cruz is just so much better in Spanish than English. She and Juan Antonio have a 'Can't live with her and can't live without her' type of relationship, and at one time she has tried to kill him. Talented but manic, there is a question over how much Juan Antonio owes of his own success to her. <br/><br/>The women get along in a ménage a trois for a while but Cristina gets restless again and decides to move on, and Maria Elena is never far from eruption. Vicky meanwhile is reviewing her own life plan, with Doug turning up in Spain.<br/><br/>One reason why this movie is so satisfying is that all the peripheral characters are so good. Juan Antonio's father, who writes beautiful poetry but decides to punish the world he despises by keeping it to himself; Patricia Clarkson's Judy, who is suffocating in her loveless marriage but is too scared to move on alone; Doug, Vicky's fiancé (Chris Messina, who is new to me.) It would have been easy to make Doug a figure of fun, but he's not, he's just a nice guy, decent but not very exciting. Every character is well written and their inter relationships keep us interested to the end. The use of voice over is never over done, and the sub titles are used to great effect, with Juan Antonio yelling ""Speak English"" at his ex wifein Spanish.<br/><br/>This is not a movie of great social importance, no one is poor or really struggling to survive. Everyone is pretty and rich. But neither is it superficial and trite and there isn't a special effect or over wrought explosion in sight. It's witty, grown up and very entertaining, certainly one of Woody Allen's best efforts in a while. I like most of the work he's done since he went to Europe to film, but I think this one is the best to date."

","The structure of the movie was a little different, but to a large extent so is life, which the movie was trying ""to be a slice of"".<br/><br/>I found the discussion about Juan Antonio's father not wanting to learn another language because something might get ""lost in translation"" funny and ironic. Funny in that Johansson used the term ""lost in translation"" and ironic in that Cruz always comes across better in Spanish and something gets lost in translation when she acts in English.<br/><br/>In summary without giving away the plot, Allen remade his point that despite society's and our efforts to have a life structure give us meaning and purpose, life is what it is, appreciate whatever beauty and joy you may come across. All I know is that after seeing it, I had a silly smile on my face for a few hours (before I had to go back out on the ledge)."

No one would ever think STO a masterpiece of social melodrama, but without a lot of cumbersome backstory Burns' story gave viewers characters that were well-thought out as characters standing on their own and in interaction with other characters.<br/><br/>I wish Woody Allen could do this well again."

","The first part of the film is a smash, but the whole thing rapidly falls apart. The story is simply not credible and the way the characters are drawn is even worse. I have always had mixed opinions about Woody Allen. I thought Hanna and Her Sisters was brilliant, but the weakness in Allen's films I think is the writing which is why I generally do not care for his work. He was a stand up comic after all - hardly an Ingmar Bergman. And therein lies the rub - Allen always scratches the surface of life the way a stand up comic does - he simply cannot get into the core of life the way Bergman does because Bergman is an artist and Allen will always be a stand up comic. There were so many things that annoyed me about this film that it would be pointless to list them here, but it is classic Allen - vapid and inane but great to look at and wonderful to hear (the music)."

","Woody Allen has done some great films. I haven't given one of them less than a 9. Cause they are all either hilarious, very interesting, or very suspenseful. That is why Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of my favorite Woody Allen films. It's hilarious, very interesting, dramatic, and towards the end very suspenseful. <br/><br/>The film was only nominated for one Oscar. Penelope Cuz was nominated for best supporting actress as Javier Bardem's crazy ex-wife. She deserved that Oscar. And she won it. She really deserved it. The performances are top notch, and so is the film itself. <br/><br/>The film is about two women, Vicky and Cristina(played by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johanson), who take a trip down to Spain for vacation. While there, they meet a painter named Juan Antonio(played by Javier Bardem), who has had a crazy past involving his ex-wife. He asks them to go off with him to another part of Spain. Vicky is engaged and hates the sound of it. But Cristina is a slut who really wants to go.<br/><br/>They go off with him anyways. But things don't go very well. Vicky and him sleep together, but he never wants to get back with her again. And eventually, Cristina and Juan Antonio hook up and Vicky gets married. None of them are really happy. Vicky still wants Juan Antonio secretly, and Cristina isn't happy cause his ex wife(played by Penelope Cruz) starts to live with them.<br/><br/>The film is very funny. And the ending is very crazy. Overall, I loved this film. This is probably my second favorite Woody Allen film behind Match point.

","I had very high hopes for this movie. Directed and written by Woody Allen, starring some of my favorite actors, Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson, and located in exotic Barcelona, how could it miss? It almost doesn't miss at all. But, ultimately, it fails in a number of ways.<br/><br/>First, labeled as a romantic comedy, it is in no way funny. And it is not particularly heart-warming to make up for its lack of humor. It is also not dramatic. While the characters are charming and attractive, they do not connect with the viewer at all. There is essentially no story, and there is absolutely no ending. Everyone just goes away, holiday over, to reluctantly live their real lives. Here, I agree with Allen, VCB is a sad movie.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is excellent in his role as the artist-love interest of almost everyone. His understated performance is quite compelling. Scarlett Johansson is very good as the confused and vivacious Christina. Rebecca Hall does not convince as the tortured lover married to another. She simply is not very interesting.<br/><br/>I continue to fail to see the cinema world's fascination with Penelope Cruz. Moderately attractive in an urchin sort of way, she evokes only annoyance when she is on screen. But, I am not sure if that is due to the VCB non-story with Allen's direction (which is otherwise very sure-footed here), or to her alone; I always seem to have that annoyed reaction to her. An Oscar for what!? <br/><br/>The film is beautiful, Allen's Spain is very photogenic, and the music is very well-chosen. But, at the end of the movie, I just sort of asked myself, 'Why did I watch this?' It will neither hurt nor please you to view this pic. Just don't expect much more than tourist eye-candy."

Not that I rush to the cinema theater, but I mark it as a memory note to watch it whenever it will be on TV. But a beautiful technological revolution in the way movies are shot, transformed the experience of watching Allen in something even better. Lack of action in the movie no longer reduces the quality of the colors and its brightness, so you don't need to attend such movies, in order to enjoy fantastic shots and breath taking views. That's exactly what has happened in this movie. No more exquisite dialogs surrounded by dull sceneries limited by inferior shooting technology, but exceptional images with the same high quality scenario. So everyone wins, and Spain is interwoven in Allen's film just as beautifully as it would have been in a touristic promotion. And by the way, the plot is wonderful."

","This is quintesensial Almodovar. I've always noticed how much in common the Woody Allen and Pedro Almodovar have in common and no picture conveys it as well as when Allen goes into his Spanish counterparts territory filming a movie in Barcelona of all places.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Allen the comparison between the two doesn't speak too well of the New Yorker as the plot, the dialogue and the script in general seems to be taken from a forgotten Almodovar drawer full of his artistic failures.<br/><br/>Two best friends - the proper Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and the adventurous Christina (Scarlett Johannson) go on the ultimate holiday to Barcelona, Spain. This is to be their last adventure before Vicky gets married to the ultimate catch - rich and well bred Doug (Chris Messina). Touring Barcelona the two come upon a seemingly narcissistic famous painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem), who offers them a proposal only a fiery Spaniard could make - fly with me to Oviedo, where the three of us will have luscious sex. Christina is quick to agree, but Vicky just comes for the company. One thing leads to another and...<br/><br/>At times funny the movie watches more like a light comedy. But there is no real flair to the movie or sense of purpose with a pathetic performance from constantly lip-playing Scarlett Johannson. A stand-out performance is made by the Almodovar actress Penelope Cruz, but this is far from one of her better roles, especially in Spanish cinema.<br/><br/>All in all a movie I would only recommend to die-hard Woody Allen fans, but apart from that it is essentially forgettable."
"bandw","9","2","6","25 May 2009"," Excellent comedy-drama
","I wish people could comment on a Woody Allen film based on its merits rather than its being a Woody Allen film. It seems that the main topic of discussion about a Woody Allen film is about the director. Has Woody lost it? Is this film among his best, or is it just average? Is this typical Woody Allen? Why isn't he as funny as he used to be? Don't you hate Woody Allen films? Doesn't he always just cover the same ground? It seems that people have become obsessed with reacting to the director rather than to his films.<br/><br/>I wager that if Allen had made this film under a pseudonym, it would have been tagged as a refreshing work of a talented director. And that is what it is. The photography is lush; every scene is beautifully lighted and shows great care in its presentation. Consider the scene in the fruit and vegetable market where the merchandise is carefully arranged and the colors are a feast for the eyes, or the verdant backdrop for the picnic with the flowers gently swaying in the wind. The sights of Barcelona serve as a mini travelogue and enrich the film. If nothing else, Allen has become very accomplished in his presentation and he has to be ranked as a skillful director.<br/><br/>The story is about two attractive young women spending the summer months in Barcelona where they become entangled in a love triangle with Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). When Jaun Antonio's ex-wife enters the picture, she squares the triangle. The actors are all on target with Rebecca Hall being a standout as Vicky. Barem plays Juan Antonio with such charm that he refutes any early inclinations you might have that he is a snake. He is a smooth operator, but he is never less than honest. <br/><br/>The musical score featuring guitar works by Albeniz, de Lucia, and Serrano (among others) complements the warmth of the photography.<br/><br/>I was puzzled by the all-knowing narrator who makes occasional observations throughout the film. I have nothing against such in general, but here most of the narrator's comments are superfluous and simply describe what can be otherwise deduced.<br/><br/>There is one scene that epitomizes the movie for me. It has Jaun Antonio talking to Vicky saying, ""Love requires a perfect balance. It's like the human body. It may turn out that you have all the vitamins and minerals, but if there is a minor, single, tiny ingredient missing, like ... salt, for example, one dies."" In response Vicky deadpans, ""Salt?"" A truth is punctuated with a humorous response."
"yris2002","5","2","6","4 April 2009"," Woody Allen tired of talking about men and women?
","With a good and even not so much hidden dose of witty shrewdness, Woody Allen chooses a cast of talented, besides charming, actors and actresses to patch up a quite low-range movie. Unfortunately, an attractive cast, together with a seductive city like Barcelona, are not able, by themselves, to provide a sense, in the end, which is not banal or annoying. Of course, talking about love in an original way, capable of conveying a new perspective, or simply stimulating thought or emotion, is hard work: when the history of man is too old, when everything and the opposite of everything seem to have been told, re-told, analyzed, even the genius of Allen seems a little resigned to this matter of fact and tired of talking of men and women which seem to be unable to communicate something authentic. What he offers to us is the old and trite commonplace of the dichotomy between passionate, adventurous love, on one hand, and stable and safe affection, on the other... I think too little for a highly gifted and experienced director like Allen. As I said before, the whole cast does its best to raise the film from the general impression of banality, some situations are amusing, intriguing, the solar and hot environment help to create a pleasant and enjoyable atmosphere. However, the final result doesn't hit the mark: boring and déjà vu, too harmless."
"Otoboke","Null","2","6","18 February 2009"," Alive, vibrant and emotionally resonant.
","Woody Allen is a filmmaker known for his somewhat counter-culturist views upon romance, love and the modern relationship in all their nuances and tiny, overlooked details that elude the consciousness of your average audience member. As a result, Woody has never quite achieved global acclaim from audiences world over, and has, to this day, stuck largely to the shadows of movie-as-art cultists and to the pages and pages of film reviews penned by adoring film critics.<br/><br/>Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which unmistakably sees the director returning to a form that has been rather murky in his latest works, is no real change of pace for the artist, sculpting an anti-romance of sorts that reaffirms tragic, romantic love in ways of truth and transient beauty rather than cliché and formula. This blatant disregard for cinema, and indeed society's views upon what love is, should be and should not ever thrive for, is sure to grate on the more reserved viewer's willingness to attach to a world stripped of its façade and safe, cosy pretensions. If anything, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, despite its minor faults here and there, attains a sense of coherency and fulfilling social catharsis that propelled the director to stardom decades ago, all the while without tiresomely repeating himself.<br/><br/>Of course, one of the ways in which Allen immediately distances himself from both his previous works, and the very idea of traditional, American-filtered romance is by shifting the location from skyscrapers and hot dog stands to villas and small markets. Taking place entirely on location within Barcelona itself, Vicky Cristina Barcelona manages to strike a tone that is both romantic and yet without whimsy pretence; for sure, there are elements to Woody's story here that border on breaking the illusion of passion that he is adamant to create, but such instances are too often overshadowed by the director's keen eye for beauty kept in check with a distinct key of realism.<br/><br/>This extra blend of unpolluted truth and introspection into love comes sharply into focus with the movie's central male character who comes in the form of bohemian artist and lover of life in all its bitter cruelties and tragic delights, Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem). Juan, at times, can be a little overwhelming, not just for those on screen, but for those watching it all unfold; his very outlook on life isn't the accepted standard for romantic films of this kind, and yet this is his very pulling power. It's not long then that the two female (American tourist) love interests of Juan soon come to see that not only is Juan something quite unlike anyone they have met before, but that his very presence unsettles their preconceived ideas and plans that they thought beforehand- were perfect.<br/><br/>It is this element of Vicky Cristina Barcelona that gives it its real zest and subtle form of vibrancy if you will, establishing a formless, boundless, counter-viewpoint on love, romance and sexual relations. As such as Juan's bohemian mind state often dictates, Allen reflects the ideas of said lifestyle in his portrayal that goes beyond his characters' development and at times even seeps into the narration and artistic deliverance of his feature. From the beautiful, elegant on-location photography that complements the script's themes poignantly to a score that establishes a romantic, foreign overtone to everything that is played underneath, Vicky Cristina Barcelona provides a romantic film experience that does not pander to the expectations of its immediate audience, instead giving a sharp, focused, and all the more convincing and compelling portrayal of romance that questions the very reasons we fall in love in the first place.<br/><br/>Most Hollywood features refuse to ask such questions however, and it would seem that a large majority of audiences would rather not be presented with the answers either. Yet as has been the case with Woody for many decades now, such under-the-rug apathy never did interest either him or his admirers, and in that vein at least, Vicky Cristina Barcelona satisfies by telling a story sure to adored by anyone ready for art that speaks in its own whimsical, neurotic yet safely grounded and human, honest and beautifully poetic way. Granted, there are some problems inherent to the overall experience that Mr. Allen paints us here (one of which simply being that I wanted more), yet cushioned with four flawless performances, chemistry that leaps off the screen and a screenplay that consistently breaks boundaries without resorting to stultifying disregard for narrative, Vicky Cristina Barcelona most importantly feels alive, vibrant and emotionally resonant.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>You can't call Woody Allen's latest film crap. The truth is, if his name wasn't attached to it, it would pass as a serviceable piece of estrogen pandering movie-making, yet even without his name, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is plagued by the all-too visible Woody Allen watermark. At this twilight stage in Allen's career he seems hellbent on proving Renoir's rumination individual filmmakers are doomed to make the same film over and over again. The problem with this pattern of redoing everything he's done before, Allen is dangerously close to tarnishing his reputation and is well past the point of evidencing he's merely a mortal. It hurts to realize that this American icon is not a genius...he's just a guy who found his little niche and was savvy enough to perfect it. But Woody perfected this art nearly twenty years ago and in the twenty years since, he's done nothing but turn his art into an archetype.<br/><br/>As longtime Allen watchers have come to expect, the actors may change, but the characters and the non-stop dialogue remains exactly the same. Perhaps there's comfort in this familiarity, which would explain why critics and his adoring followers are so reluctant to call Allen out for this sham. How many times can one stomach the same neuroses, the same speech patterns and rhythms, the same interchangeable references to classical music/literature/cinema and the same setup and delivery of jokes? Worst of all, the plots have been recycled so many times that they've become transparently predictable. <br/><br/>Unless you're not acquainted with Allen's formula, seconds after polar opposites Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) meet the charming Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), you know exactly how ironically the events will play out. He may not be the genius we all once thought he was, but Woody is still a very smart guy, begging the question: isn't he aware of the pointlessness of remaking the same film ad nauseam? Isn't it embarrassing for him to reveal how incredibly limited his palate is? Isn't it humiliating to show he's got nothing left to offer? Does he even care?<br/><br/>Yet despite the well worn formula, VCB still manages to be a watchable movie with a handful of great (albeith isolated) moments. Bardem and Penelope Cruz prove to be the scene stealers, perhaps taking liberty with their native tongue and adding a truly foreign (and fresh) dimension to the carefully regurgitated screenplay. Their chemistry proves to be as convincing as it is compelling and without these two, VCB would have been lost in expanding bog of forgettable films Woody has dutifully churned out on cue over the last few decades."

","When you think classic Woody Allen and then you think of the last 15 years Woody Allen, two sharp and distinctly opposite thoughts come to mind. Classic Woody is all about the people, crazy neurotic people looking for love and self-fulfillment/discovery. Last 15 years Woody is all generally...weird. ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is finally Woody finding himself in a modern context - taking what made him famous and making it work with multiple audiences.<br/><br/>""Barcelona"" takes place in the city of the same name as two women, Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johannson), best friends with distinctly different views on life and love, are both smitten by a Spanish painter named Juan Antonio (Bardem). Both women's definitions of love are called into question by the odd but alluring man and even his definition is called into question when his ex-wife (Cruz) enters the picture.<br/><br/>Allen tells this story in a highly narrative way, even using actual spoken narrative from an omniscient objective party. It's used to start to get us into the characters heads and sort of cleverly gives us expectations about what we are to see in addition to foreshadowing. It's a much more direct, yet still artsy way of telling a very Allen-like story involving love triangles and threesomes and such. While it may sound provocative, it makes actual sense as to why Allen chose for certain events to happen.<br/><br/>This is also a very artistic film. Allen has simply moved his love of New York City to another city overseas. The culture and the landscape play a very pivotal role in creating a mood for this film, some motivation for the characters to do things they wouldn't have before the film begins. It definitely leaves you longing for a carefree, overseas adventure.<br/><br/>Most importantly, this is some fine relationship drama. All the conversations are easy to follow and extremely easy to relate to. These aren't mind-altering ideas about love -- well, maybe with the exception of threesomes -- but they are provided a different, unique context that is the beautiful city of Barcelona. Welcome back, Woody, we missed you."
"jaredmobarak","8","2","6","3 September 2008"," Counter-intuitive loveVicky Cristina Barcelona
","I really love the poster for this film. I had to get that out there. The composition and motion is just stunning. Artistry orchestrated for just the right emotion and aesthetic, something you could say about the movie itself. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a gorgeous piece to view. Not to disregard Woody Allen at all, but I have to credit this look to cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe. The man acted as DP on some of my favorite Spanish filmsHable con ella and Mar adentroand now has me anticipating John Hillcoat's forthcoming The Road even more. Truthfully, besides the obligatory serif font, white on black, utilized in the opening credits, you would be somewhat hard-pressed to even realize that this is an Allen film. Europe definitely inspired the man and I'm happy for it. Whether the likes of Gaudio worked as a muse to him like they did to his characters, I don't know. What I do, though, is that he could never have made this film anywhere but in Barcelona. The beauty, the intrigue, the exoticness; they all overpower the people moving through the story as well as us watching it all unfold.<br/><br/>Let me say something right offI didn't really get this movie. I'm not even sure if there is something to get. On a purely aesthetic level, it is fantastic. The visuals, the art and culture on display, the use of language, and even a wonderfully successful third person narrator make this a creative and stimulating work. I don't want to belittle the writing or the story in any way; I just didn't quite get what we were being shown. Without ruining anything, not only do our characters finish at the same place from where they began, but also the narrator pretty much repeats his description from the start, at the close. Sure the events that occur shape their lives at that specific period of time, but neither really do anything about it. Maybe they learned something about themselves, maybe they experienced an intrinsic moment that will leave an indelible mark forever, but when all is said and done, both our leads, Vicky and Cristina, do not evolve. Whether it be a carefully planned out future or one filled with the knowledge of what she doesn't want, unknowing of what she does, our conclusion is so open-ended that it truly begs the question of if this story even needed to be told.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed my time, and there lies my quandary. How can I enjoy something I don't feel was a necessity to be seen? How can I recommend something that I myself deem as inconsequential without any progression in plot? The answer of course is the beauty of that which is art. Art is in the eye of the beholder. What you see doesn't have to make complete sense; it doesn't have to make you happy, it may, in fact, absolutely incense you. The sheer ability to touch you in some unquantifiable way, some level of consciousness that you can't even comprehend is enough. To know it touched you without the need for reason can be more powerful than anything else. The emotions on screen, the relationships on display, all hit you viscerally and physically. The raw power of the love triangles and quadrangles stimulate the mind more than any linear tale of young Americans finding their way in a foreign land. Life is messy and irrational; Allen sees this and paints his canvas like such.<br/><br/>The mixture of intellectual conversation, the brilliance of Javier Bardem's Juan Antonio seducing these women, not with his looks, but with his soul, is a refreshing thing to behold. His brazen confidence laced with a passion and vigor for life is a powerful weapon. While all he needs is sexual power and exotic backgrounds to woo Cristina, (Scarlet Johansson's free spirited roaming soul), he can still entrance Vicky, (Rebecca Hall's amazing turn as the rationally sheltered woman unable to follow her feelings), with his rhetoric and intellect, stories of poets and love for simple music done well, even at twelve in the morning. Never confused about what he wants, Bardem is bluntly honest at all times. He does not shy from the fact he still loves his ex-wife, nor that he is attracted to both girls. Always truthful, he is a genuine lover of life, if something doesn't work out at least he had his time of happiness. One can't dwell in pain or loss, as no one knows what path the future holds. What might not have worked now doesn't necessarily have to be broken later on.<br/><br/>Along with the visuals come these gem performances. Bardem is amazing as the puzzle piece linking everything together, stirring the pot while also being its most important ingredient. Johansson, I must say, was really good. She never annoyed me and effectively played the naïve American, thinking she is this open spirit without the knowledge of what practicing her thoughts could lead to. She may not be as open in love as she thought, but then without the experience how could she ever know? As for Hall, I have to say she was somewhat of a revelation. The one actor I was in the dark about outshone them all with her range of emotion, hiding behind her safe life and husband while torn inside about the passion she desires, but is too afraid to consume. And I must mention Penelope Cruz who comes in like a whirlwind and never stops. She is the wild card in this little game, acting as both the glue and volatile fire. None of these four could be removed from the machine and still achieve success. Allen has crafted a tight web of romance that, while it may not lead anywhere, still brings forth a journey worth taking. If nothing else it's a beast befitting a voyeuristic glance."

","I was building great expectations before seeing Vicky Cristina Barcelona, because of its incredible cast and my admiration towards Spanish and Catalan cultures, plus the fact that I visited Barcelona twice before and I was fascinated by it. But unfortunately the film did not fulfill my expectations. I am not saying it is a bad movie, unless I wouldn't have given it seven stars, however there are many choices that this picture took which were not much of a success, like choosing to put a narrative passage every five minutes to give us information about the characters that could've easily been transmitted through dialogue or action between the actors. Another thing I did not like was some performances especially by Scarlett Johanson who's acting didn't convince me with her portrayal of the characters feeling and getting them to the spectators. While on the bright side, the incredibly beautiful score of this movie with its charming flamenco melodies was intelligently employed and added a sort of symbolism to it. In addition, the performances by the other actors were pretty good, Penelope Cruz did an amazing job though I don't think her performance is Oscar worthy, with her appearing only in the second half of the movie in a few counted, but satisfying, shots. Javier Bardem and Rebecca Hall were both pretty fine. In a word, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a fun movie to watch that depicts love from a different point of view and is quite worth a shot."
"Seraphion","6","1","2","6 August 2015"," Almost comedic in some ways
","The story is a classic example of how a Hollywood script can be so pretentious. There's too many instances where the script completely disregard real human nature and proposes and promotes sheer carelessness and egotistical indulgence over clear thinking. Yet, as I play along and continue watching, I find the movie to be more and more comedic. It's especially so since the story becomes more and more predictable as the movie goes on. Yet the almost hypocritical presentation of the story developments did crack some laughs and made the movie funny for me. The bad thing is that the filmmakers really didn't pay any attention to the more natural story development and just went away with their own somewhat perverted imaginations. The acting overall feels like a standard romance movie job. Scarlett Johansson did just enough to portray her insecure character and Rebecca Hall did enough in portraying her character's deep anxiety. Javier Bardem did better in his action roles than this kind of character."

","Well, this film has everything you may expect from a Woody Allen one. There are antagonist characters that deliver interesting situations, like how Vicky treated Juan Antonio when they first met, and how, ironically, things lead to a way that they end up in bed. One interesting thing to notice is how all the characters are elegant and respectful-- with exception of Maria Elena. This is the third movie I see from Allen, and I admit that this one has the best characters. The plot is very ironic, such as the soundtrack, delivering intentionally funny scenes. Also, Scarlett Johansson really impressed me with such beauty; I didn't know she was THAT cute, even if everybody kept telling me that all time. So, that's it; ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a very provocative picture that entertains, makes you laugh and deliver a nice ending, as you may have expected from an Allen production. Good choice!"
"saytosandeep","7","1","2","23 March 2014"," MY REVIEW: The Puzzling Love!!
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Woody Allen never fails to surprise us while showcasing the little complexities of being in love and here he does it in pure Woody Allen style. Story is about two polar opposite friends who fall in love with same man over their trip to Barcelona but they don't know that his ex-wife is about to enter into the already complex equations. Supported with subtle and good performances by an A-list cast ranging from Rebecca Hall playing Vicky who likes to keep life simple, Scarlett Johansson playing ever confused Christina, Javier Bardem playing the womanizer Juan and terrific Penélope Cruz playing his crazy ex-wife. Two things that will remain with you after the movie has ended; First Penélope Cruz nagging in Spanish and Christopher Evan Welch's voice as narrator that keeps you awed while explaining the mood swings of Vicky and Cristina. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Vicky Cristina Barcelona. It's a nice sexy little cracker in Woody Allen style."
"jackasstrange","8","1","2","20 December 2013"," Very good and enjoyable Allen's film!
","'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is the second installment of the 'european sage' which started in London, England with Match Point, then goes to Barcelona, Spain with Vicky Cristina Barcelona, then followed by Paris, France with the hit Midnight in Paris and it's last installment being set in Rome, Italy, with To Rome with Love(the weakest in my opinion). The story follows the life of a fiancée woman and his friend, that goes to vacation in Barcelona. Then they met Luis Antonio, a seductive painter that wants to have a -guess what - three way relationship with them. The story starts crazy as you, then it just became even crazier until the end of the film, that has the classic existentialist Allen's ending. But beyond the very good story full of unpredictable moments, this film is also rich in the technical aspects. The art direction is very good, it portrays the ambient with 'hot' colors, such as yellow, orange and soft red lightning all over Spain. The soundtrack is also very good. Penelope Cruz did a very good job as the crazy ex- wife of Luis Antonio, and well deservedly won the Oscar for her supporting performance.<br/><br/>Good, entertaining and smart film. Worth a watch. 8.0/10"
"pacwarbuff","7","1","2","14 November 2013"," Woody Allen's Disdain for Seemingly Everything...and it's Brilliant
","At first I couldn't get into this movie, but now I officially love Vicky Cristina Barcelona. It took me three viewings to fully appreciate this film, but now I can say it's simply outstanding. Great performances all around, cinematography, music, location shooting. I think of VCB as a ""tormented tourist's postcard."" It's as though tourists cannot handle the ""real thing"" that is an artist's often chaotic life: full of fits and starts and sends them running away from what they believed they wanted. It's as cynical a look at the romanticism of being involved with an artist as I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The movie truly takes off when Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) enters the picture. From then on, I bought into her crazed, ""tortured artist"" melodrama though I found the kiss scene with Johannson to be a total failure; Penelope Cruz is definitely not interested in kissing girls (and neither is Johannson)! Javier ""Speak English"" Bardem plays the artistic stud well and his voice and appearance remind me of a young Raul Julia. The kind of men that Vicky (Rebecca Hall; also excellent) and Judy (Patricia Clarkson; wonderful and hotter than her younger co-stars)are involved with are tepid businessmen not unlike my brother-in-law; decent and ""safe"" guys, but certainly not compelling.<br/><br/>In regards to Cristina's disdain for American life, I realize Woody's gone on record via his films with his admiration for Europe, yet I still felt that everything being said by the narrator was sarcastic. I'm not sure why, but the entire film had a caustic tone and I felt that everything was being flayed, even the things that Allen usually revers and that there was disdain for every character. VCB is among Allen's most vicious, I think.<br/><br/>The final scene with Cristina and Vicky walking through the airport, both with ""damaged"" looks on their faces, is brilliant."

","Woody Allen made an original drama three years ago in ""Match Point"" and he has made yet another one here. Though it contains the typical Woody views on artistic angst and existential qualms, this movie has a fresh and entirely original feel to it. Partially because of the beautiful Barcelona settings and the attractive faces on screen, it is a visual treat to behold. Not only that, but Allen gives a fine portrait of two good friends who find more than expected on vacation. It certainly is little more than fluff, but it is fine, well-made, well-acted fluff at that. It is certainly the sexiest movie Woody has made yet, even succeeding over ""Match Point"" three years back."

","this movie surely teaches one thing about life that its pretty much simple and natural but yet in so many ways we make it complex with our superficial nature..look at the character of Antonio played impeccably by Javier bardem which is so much real i could relate him with real life. he makes all those unreal or superficial or never possible things so real. Scarlett Johanson played a very mysterious and perplex girl in the movie which was quite good to watch. Rebbecca hall played a confident character yet in so many ways she found herself in the ocean of perplexity which makes this movie sensible and real to watch. but for me the star and the surprising part of the movie was Penelope Cruz... the moment she made the entry in the movie..entire movie started making more sense...got more entertaining...she did the perfect job. one of the best thing about the movie was how aesthetically woody Allen portrayed the beautiful and sensual chemistry between Antony, Cristina and maria Elena, it could have got either way more in a sense of erotica but was handled pretty much well by woody..."
"bbewnylorac","8","1","2","14 April 2013"," Great entertainment
","I have seen a lot of Woody Allen films and this is among my favorites. Mainly because the script is so tight and witty and all the actors are brilliant and perfectly cast. My favourite scene is the very last one, in which Vicky and Cristina can look either profoundly changed or indifferent at what they've gone through, depending on your point of view. The film can be seen either as a fun bit of fluff or quite meaningful. I don't think the film has a message, but it is interested in what each character gets up to. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) must choose between her impulsive Spanish lover and her safe, boring husband. Javier Bardem's character realises he loves his troubled, fiery ex-wife Maria Elena, despite how chaotic and even violent she is. I don't know what Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) realises, but she is entertaining, as an open minded artistic woman who is up for everything. The scene at the restaurant in which Javier Bardem propositions Vicky and Cristina at the restaurant, and the women have vastly different responses, one prissy, one flattered and flirtatious, is a classic. Basically, Allen simply has fun with the beautiful setting, the art, the artists and the social milieu."

"blanche-2","7","1","2","19 July 2011"," taking a chance on love
","Two young women spend the summer in Barcelona in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona). At first, the women seem like caricatures: Vicky (Penelope Hall) is serious, somewhat conservative, and not much of a risk-taker; Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) is a free spirit, artistic, spontaneous, and up for adventure. However, one might look at them as two sides of the same woman.<br/><br/>When an artist, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) invites them to Oviedo on a private plane, Cristina jumps at the chance, while a nervous Vicky goes along just to keep Cristina company. Cristina jumps into an affair with Juan Antonio; for Vicky, it's a one-nighter that destroys her concept of who she is and what she wants. While Cristina and Juan Antonio are together, Juan's ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) shows up.<br/><br/>Allen makes it clear that in his world (and in ours), many people opt for unhappiness rather than move out of an uncomfortable situation - which in its way, has become comfortable. At least it's the devil you know. While Cristina is seeking ways to express herself through art, and relishes all of her experiences as a means of finding herself, Vicky sees it all as a threat to what she believes she wants.<br/><br/>The gorgeous Penelope Cruz is outstanding as the passionate, angry Maria Elena, and Javier Bardem portrays Juan Antonio as one who accepts a Bohemian lifestyle as a matter of course. Juan's and Maria's fights are delicious and very realistic. Scarlett Johansson is very right for the part of the young, natural beauty Cristina, for whom life is always a surprise as she tries to find her way.<br/><br/>Beautifully photographed, this is a deceptive film. It's breezy, it's laid back, it's sexy -- like Cristina -- but again like Cristina, the film has many layers. Really good work by Allen - except for that disconcerting narration which added nothing to the film. Otherwise, it's solid."
"GLanoue","9","1","2","22 March 2011"," Emotional angst with a light touch.
","This wonderful and light hearted look at what we want and don't want is proof that Woody Allen is becoming a better film maker with age, and that a movie can be serious and funny at the same time. Here, two friends from America, Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall, arrive in Barcelona for a summer abroad and discover that love, desire and passion can turn emotional rigidity (Hall) into existential angst and uncertainty, while emotional failure to commit (Johansson) can become stability and acceptance, or at least, as the movie says as its last word, the certainty of what one doesn't want (in fact she achieves stability only as the glue that binds together a dysfunctional couple, but I don't want to reveal too much). Scripted and directed with economy, this is the rare movie with a voice-over narration that doesn't jar and doesn't actually impose a narrative structure on the viewer, although of course its content strives to. The acting and script are so good that Allen lets the narrative line and especially the psychological tension linking the four main characters emerge on their own, through the characters' interactions (besides Hall and Johansson, there is an understated and ""truthful"" Bardem and Penelope Cruz as Bardem's unstable ex wife who can only attain equilibrium in a triangular relationship with Bardem and Hall). A wonderful blend of having what we need and what we want, and all the uncertainty and danger that accompanies choice. The really interesting aspect for me was that Johansson and Hall both speak in Allen's well known intonations and rhythms, restarting sentences right before getting to the verb, tonal hesitations, and even a little Bronx whine creep into their inflections. To make sure we get the contrast between want and need as sometimes being one and the same, Hall is dark and of course Johansson is blonde, but the two are often shot with camera angles that underscore their physical resemblance. The real trick achieved by Allen is the ending, where Hall goes back to her ordered New York existence after flirting with emotional danger, and Johansson goes on to the emotional anomie that defines her existence and ironically gives her strength and stability. In other words, back to the beginning. Fans are often unusually vocal in their enthusiasm for Allen in the first few weeks after one of his movies comes out, and then settle down. He does appeal to that literate and sometimes pseudo intellectual crowd. This, I think is no exception. However, it will stand the test of time, in part because Allen continues to grow as a filmmaker who can nuance the human heart without the egocentricity that dominated his earlier films, and partly because he now attracts even better actors to his projects."
"moviesleuth2","6","1","2","10 July 2009"," I don't know what I think about this film
","Did I like ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" or not? One might think that it would make sense to hold off writing the review of the film until I make up my mind, but I'm not, since this conflicted feeling is at the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johannsen) are two best friends who are vacationing in Barcelona for the summer. While there, they are asked abruptly by an artist named Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) to spend the weekend with him. They eventually go, and the weekend sets in motion a series of events that cause Vicky and Cristina to really examine what they want in a relationship (Vicky is engaged, and Cristina ""only knows what she doesn't want."" ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" starts out strong and ends even stronger, but it lags in the middle. I think it would have been a lot better if about 20 minutes had been cut during this period. The characters talk, but nothing really happens during this time.<br/><br/>The acting is strong. Rebecca Hall is very good as the practical Vicky. She knows what she wants and is satisfied with her future, at least until she meets Juan Antonio. Scarlett Johansson is slightly less impressive as Cristina, who is experimenting with the possibilities. Javier Bardem continues to impress as the artist/lover Juan Antonio. He's a seducer, and not ashamed of it. Yet he has a big heart. However, the best performance belongs to Penelope Cruz. She dominates the screen as Juan Antonio's volatile ex-wife, Maria Elena. She has some serious issues, and Cruz never lets us forget that Maria Elena can be set off by just about anything.<br/><br/>The best thing about ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is that it looks great. The cinematography is gorgeous, and very atmospheric. However, the film has some big flaws. First off, the narration is on going, and it gets old. It helps, but it gets in the way of the story. Second, of course, is the flat middle. Nothing much happens, and boredom sets in. Fortunately, when Cruz appears, the film gets back going again. Finally, the ending doesn't fit. An ending like the one Woody Allen gave this one seems to belong in a different film.<br/><br/>It's not ""Match Point,"" but I guess it's recommendable."

I reckon that was perhaps your last film to offer at least some entertainment and a few laughs.<br/><br/>Your offering here is beyond embarrassing. Just why, why, why did you feel a need to make this film? It is not funny, it does not entertain, there are no insights, it has no depth, it shows us nothing we have not seen many times before, it mostly doesn't even look good, despite being set in great Barcelona. It is not a comedy, it is not a drama, but it surely is the most lazy piece of film-making I had the misfortune to watch in a long time. And the voice-over is so incessant that one is almost surprised that you have managed to fit in the occasional actual dialogue and movie 'scene'. If you really need this much voice-over to tell your story (well, what banal story there is), perhaps you would be better served trying a radio-play next time - or perhaps only one angle directly on you just reading the script straight to camera. Having said that, there is the odd moment in the arguments between semi-exes Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem when the air just crackles - I suspect this has little to do with your direction or script, but is an indication of what fantastic actor and actress they can be. It puzzles me that you still manage to attract such gifted people to your puny projects. As it is, this film is utterly hollow and simply cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>Please do us all a favour and retire from film-making soon, surely you don't need the money anymore and I certainly can't see that you feel driven as an 'artist'. Listen to your therapist, go on a cruise, take a girl somewhere, drink a long, long cocktail, but spare us your puerile, pubescent and badly made fantasies.

Spanish Lothario artist. How can a director like Woody Allen who is so revered by many people make such a clichéd and smug bourgeois movie?? It kind of annoys me that some people feel obliged to like it just because it is Woody Allen when it is drivel!! The way Barcelona is portrayed, firstly, is like a tourist ad as others have said, all sanitised and stereotypical, where people randomly play Spanish guitar and there aren't any muggers or other unpleasantness. I laughed when I saw where the artist's father lived, in some fantasy villa, he was of course a poet. Some poor naive person is going to think that living in Europe is some sort of cultured fairytale, where everyone drinks fine wines and talks about art in beautiful sun dappled villas<br/><br/>That leads me to my next point-the utter pretentiousness of the characters. Cristina (or is it Vicky? Who cares?) is coming to study Catalan identity, as one does, Vicky is Of course WAIT FOR IT trying to be a photographer!! what a surprise!! She is not a very good or original one either...So, you know ""americans trying to find themselves in Europe, and going on a cultural, sexual exploration."" That would be fine if there was anything particularly shocking or original or cutting edge about it. . I have never heard to word ""art"" used so much and so vacuously in one film by these characters who really want to show they are higher CULTURED beings. The way they try to have an intellectual discussion about love is laughable, using all the typical art student phrases I heard so much at Uni. I wish I could remember some of those movie quotes but I've tried to block the film from my mind, there were some real script 'gems'. At one point I thought it was a big joke, like Woody was trying to make a parody of upper middle class pseudo-intellectual cultured types-was he?? The photographer thinks she is being really bohemian by living with the artist and his ex-wife, as if it is some sort of revolutionary superior way of life for artistic types, an extension of her rejection of the 'mudane' and conventional in her 'art'. Like some of my fellow haters have said, the film seemed to be trying to criticise the conventional lifestyle like Cristina's husband Doug but instead made it look more sympathetic to me. I could talk much more about how repulsive I found the attitude and characters of this movie, such as the ridiculous and unnecessary voice over, but my fellow haters have covered this in all there reviews. The reasons I have given it 3 instead of 1 is because of Penelope Cruz's performance, the only thing I liked about this movie. Unlike the 2 dimensional other characters, she was believable and much more human. Thank God for Penelope Cruz!! If you liked the highly overrated and similarly self indulgent film Closer with similar ideas in it, you will probably like this film. if you want a better version of this premise of Americans discovering themselves and exploring their sexuality amongst beautiful European settings, see the far superior and beautiful Stealing Beauty"

"diac228","5","2","7","4 April 2009"," Its like a Travel Channel documentary, with annoying narration and a yawn-worthy plot packaged within
","Woody Allen's work has been around for several decades, creating quite a livid and faithful fanbase that dedicate their lives to watching his yearly films. His films range from romantic to mysterious to even sometimes the realm of science fiction. After a brief slump that was cascading through the 90s into the early part of this decade, Woody Allen re-enters the mainstream with a string of successful and acclaimed movies he filmed overseas. Allen's success derives from his deep flicks about love, affection, sexuality, etc.; and they reached their peak in terms of tone and theme in films like Match Point and Scoop, his ""comeback"" movies. Riding the success wave with his latest muse Scarlett Johannson, Allen now heads to Barcelona to deliver another tale about the complexities of love.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing straight here: the man is a tad on the overrated side. Surely none of his movies can truly resemble that of your usual romantic comedy dribble, but its nothing spectacular. Perhaps it's the fact that I'm still bitter that Star Wars, one of the greatest films of all-time, was defeated in the Oscars by Annie Hall. But it could be that his sense of humor is extremely dry, his views on love are just absurd and become repetitive, and the films never quite take off. His movies start in shallow waters and remain in shallow waters, with every so often a curveball being flung by for good measure. Vicky Christina Barcelona is no different; it's a film that doesn't quite take off, even with grand performances, a nice soundtrack, and beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>This film is about two women (The Muse and the unknown Rebecca Hall), one engaged and the other free-spirited, spending the summer in Barcelona. Upon their wanderings, they run into a handsome and charming painter (Javier Bardem) who wants to make love to both of them. A few twists and turns later, Vicky gets married but has doubts about what she wants in life, and Christina moves in with the painter; only to have complications arise once the ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) comes into play. Like previously stated, Allen's movies are never predictable or dwell into stereotypical territory, but the film lacks any sort of dramatic or comedic tension.<br/><br/>To further simplify why this film can never be viewed as good or great in my eyes, Vicky Christina Barcelona presents a total of four main characters in a world full of love trying to figure out what it is. No conflict really arises, no climax is ever actually approached, and we never really care for anyone nor do we hope for someone to end up with someone. We are just witnessing, not really interacting or choosing sides. Plenty of dialogue, but very little of it actually enhances the plot. As a matter of fact, we learn most about our characters whenever the narrator (that comes out of left field most the time) describes the scenario at hand and how everyone is feeling.<br/><br/>Nothing is more hampering to an actor or actress' ability to perform than a narrator in the background telling you how they feel. This is what hampers everyone's performance, we know how they feel not because of their actions or reactions, but because some guy in the background is mentioning their sentiments. It's annoying, and perhaps why critics believe Cruz didn't deserve her Best Supporting Actress Oscar, even though personally I'm glad she finally earned something for her work.<br/><br/>Not bashing everything though. The cinematography is absolutely stunning here, as Barcelona looks its absolute best on the big screen. One would wonder how much better it would look in Blu-Ray; it can pass off as a Travel Channel documentary. The sets within the city are fantastic as well, further emphasizing the beauty of the setting. Adding to the allure of Spain is the fantastic choices of music. The classical guitar and laud-back music are like little finishing touches on the cinematic shots of the towns and restaurants within the city. Allen's direction has definitely improved over the years, as he broadens the horizons and films more than just characters muddled in dialogue. Too bad he couldn't write a better story.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I love him. I don't love him. I might love her. I don't love her anymore. We should all love each other. More or less, this is almost every single Woody Allen picture, and this one is no exception at all. But unlike Annie Hall, it doesn't even end very properly, by not proving enough closure. If you pressed mute throughout the film, you'll see why some credit should be given: the sets, scenery, and direction. Removing mute reveals relentless and repetitive dialogue and annoying narration; both elements ruining the acting and music of the entire film. This isn't the worst film of the year, but is indeed far from the best. Vicky Christina Barcelona is reserved for those who truly enjoy Allen's work—the good, the bad, and the pretty."

Vicky Christina Barcelona is provocative, natural, wild, controversial, visionary, funny as hell; simply genius.<br/><br/>In his ""perverted"" way, Woody Allen milked the roles from the three main actresses, Bardem is just a natural.<br/><br/>The camera shows all the beauty, the soundtrack is superb, the events keep you reaching out for the next minute, again it's a story that doesn't drop for a second.<br/><br/>It's a symphony, see it, enjoy it."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","2","7","8 February 2009"," What happens in Europe stays in Europe...
","One thing I've noticed about nearly all of Woody Allen's movies is that, regardless of how good the rest of the movie is, the dialogue is generally written and performed with a nearly flawless realism that pushes the surprisingly intricate stories along at a pretty fast pace, often leaving me with the feeling that the story is bigger than the movie and has to be squeezed to make it fit. In order to do this, Allen has recruited the talents of Christopher Evan Welch to provide a narrative voice-over and tell the portions of the story that can't be passed on simply through images and dialogue.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I developed an inability to see Woody Allen as anyone other than Woody Allen no matter what movie he's appearing in. This is a condition that has endured unchecked within me for the last ten years, since the release of Antz, which starred an animated, insect version of Woody, but who was nevertheless still Woody. He did write the movie, but the narrator speaks in such a distinct Woody Allen style that it becomes a little confusing why he didn't just narrate the thing himself. Or not have a narrator, that might have been a good idea, too. The narration thickens the story and gives it more detail, but it also makes it feel rushed. Here's a little example  <br/><br/>""Vicky was already thinking of herself as a kind of expatriate, not smothered by what she believed to be America's puritanical and materialistic culture, which she had little patience for. She saw herself more as a European soul, in tune with the thinkers and artists she felt expressed her tragic, romantic, free-thinking view of life.""<br/><br/>The movie is about characters that Allen can clearly relate to, but that most people in the audience will fail to relate to. We envy their lives, but for the most part we have nothing in common with any of them and thus it becomes difficult to care about them. Luckily, the primary characters, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), and Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) are played by three tremendous actors, and their performances are glowing. <br/><br/>Vicky and Cristina are best friends who decide to spend a couple of summer months in Barcelona with Vicky's family, who live in the area. Vicky is studying Catalan studies, so it seems like the perfect destination. She's into romantic stability and is happily engaged to a man named Doug, who is completely dedicated to her but is, unfortunately, also a massive tool. Cristina, on the other hand, is more impulsive and unpredictable, not afraid to take risks and invite a little turmoil into her life. She recently worked for months on a 12-minute film about love that she then hated, and is now getting shakily into photography. She wanders around Spanish towns taking clichéd photographs of empty alleyways and people, either just sightseeing or for some reason thinking she's doing something original. <br/><br/>While the two of them are eating in a charming café, a good-looking Spanish man approaches them and invites them on a trip, leaving in an hour, to a small town called Oviedo, where the three of them will eat good food, drink good wine, and make love. The different reaction of the two girls sets up the premise that supports the rest of the movie. Vicky is horrified and offended, Cristina is immediately intrigued and ultimately accepts, with ""no guarantees."" <br/><br/>What follows is a remarkably well-told but dense story about highly developed characters who lead fascinating but chaotic lives but who live in such a way that it's nearly impossible to relate to them in any way. It reminds me of the characters in William Faulkner's intolerable novel ""The Sun Also Rises,"" who also live in Spain and have nothing but money and leisure time. Such a lifestyle is difficult for me to understand or care about. <br/><br/>Juan Antonio is an abstract artist of some acclaim, and has famously been through a violent divorce which was well-covered by the news media. Evidently he and his wife tried to kill each other, but of course their stories differ wildly. A complex series of events leads to Cristina living together with Juan Antonio in his home in Spain and Vicky back in New York and suffering through a series of new emotional hurdles, until one day Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's ex-wife, tries to commit suicide and ends up living with Juan Antonio and Cristina because she has nowhere else to go. Where the movie goes from there is where it really gets interesting and strange, but I won't give anything else away. <br/><br/>By the way, I don't know if you realize this, but European vacations have an astonishing ability to wreck American relationships if only one half of the couple is making the trip. This happened to me with a girl that I dated in college who once traveled in Europe for a summer, and I didn't even find out about it until more than a year later, and by that time I had already gone to Europe myself and committed the same crime! What is it with that place??<br/><br/>Oh and just so you know, one of my best friend's here in China was born and raised in San Sebastian, in the Basque country in northern Spain, and he was deeply unimpressed with the movie. He says it felt like nothing more than a ""Lonely Planet Guide to Barcelona!"" Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed the story-telling and the performances, particularly the lack of predictability and the many narrative twists and turns. I recommend it."
"Balthazar-5","8","2","7","17 December 2008"," Still seems that Woody is running on empty....
","Nothing that Woody Allen does in the rest of his career is going to alter that fact that he will be regarded as one of the greatest American directors of all time - one of a mere handful who have presented a unique world-view in their films.... However, our wonderful, wonderful Woody has seemed to be on a decline for some time... certainly since 'Deconstructing Harry' and perhaps before...<br/><br/>And yet every new Woody movie contains real insight into the human condition, it's just that he doesn't seem to be bothered to wrap them up in the near perfect packages that we saw in 'Manhattan', 'Hannah' and 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'.<br/><br/>Here we have a case in point. Love and responsibility is the subject - it is in all of Woody's best films. Vicky is conventional and reserved, Cristina is flighty and adventurous... But hey! Cupid can soon start turning things around...<br/><br/>It was one of the great disappointments of the latter half of Fellini's career that, for the most part - even just after 'Giulietta degli Spiriti' - he seemed to forget about the rigour of script-writing and narrative expression. It was as if her was saying 'people will come to see a Fellini film even if I don't bother my head too much.' It was the same with Godard - only for very different reasons. I wonder if, perhaps, Woody has got tired of all of the effort needed to hone his ideas into the near-perfect packages of earlier times. It could be that the title of his new film 'Whatever Works' - is a signal that the search for perfection has been replaced for the search for 'whatever works'.<br/><br/>As has been noted in an interesting thread on the board for this film, one of the main problems with this film is the narration. This is strange, as Woody can turn voice-over narration into pure gold (think of his poignant narration for 'Annie Hall'), perhaps, the real problem is that it isn't Woody who is narrating... it is some faceless narrator with a smug voice.<br/><br/>For me Woody is the comic Shakespeare of our age. I do so hope that he has a 'Winter's Tale' or a 'The Tempest' left in him... Regrettably this isn't it... even though it knocks spots off the awful 'Cassandra's Dream'."
"MikeyB1793","6","2","7","7 December 2008"," Not That Funny
","This film has intelligence and is well filmed. BUT - it suffers from too many words and is overly long. Generally Woody Allen puts all this relationship angst about falling in and out of love into comedy. This movie was not particularly funny. It comes off as intellectually strained - we are told over and over that Cristina is unhappy with her boring husband. Also, I kept thinking, where are these two women getting the money to eat in lavish restaurants - one is a student and the other is an amateur film-maker. Surely the artist they meet, who is driving a fancy sports car and lives in a picturesque home can't be making any money from those atrocious paintings we see. Towards the end Cristina leaves for Paris which is far more expensive than Spain. Where's the money? Only Penelope Cruz infuses needed energy into this movie."

She convinces me as someone we'll see a lot more of in the future in totally different kinds of characters. The artist Doug interpreted by Julio Perillán seems to be adding to the comical Woody Allan touch of the movie, here and there I would have liked to see him a little bit more creating his art work as this would have enlarged details of his character and emotional state. The commenting voice of screen seemed to be too much present I would have preferred it highlights the past of the characters but not the moments when they are in Barcelona, there the picture speaks well enough It reminds you too often that you see the movie through the eyes of someone else rather then that you are experiencing the picture yourself. However the 'clarifying' voice is of the kind you are keen on while seated in comfortable cinema seat. Certain scenes are more of the suggesting kind which leave things open to the viewer but then do not reveal the characters more. The end of the movie I would have liked differently but who knows there might be an other Woody Allan sequel. May we see more of him in the future!"

","I won't go into a lengthy review that I could do no better than some already offered. I just want to make a few observations about a movie that I really enjoyed and found engaging.<br/><br/>First, Rebecca Hall's performance as Vicky should not be overlooked. She doesn't have the fireworks to play with except in one scene late in the movie, but she conveys brilliantly the dilemma of a newly married young woman with her conventional life planned out having serious buyer's remorse. There are some subtle takes she does that make me ache for her.<br/><br/>Second, I love the other three main actors but was disappointed in Bardem's performance. Knowing the kind of performance he is capable of--""The Dancer Upstairs""--it seemed to me that this one was to some degree ""phoned in."" Third (and last), I'm not a great Allen fan or aficionado, but I found many of his directorial choices for this film quite brilliant. Not the least, the work that must have gone in in post for the sound track. Delicious!"

","I usually don't get Woody Allen movie. I think he is just a neurotic crazy director/writer, and I can picture him in real life is not much different from his character in ""Annie Hall"". I watch ""Manhattan"", ""Hannah and her sister"" a really long time ago, and if I didn't remember wrong, I was bored with the movie. <br/><br/>The beautiful scene in Spain just make this movie worth watching. Just like some Italian think of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is so not realistic and portray nowadays Italy like 20 years ago.

"edwagreen","2","2","9","20 May 2009"," Vicky Cristina is Barcelona Bull *
","Woody Allen has reached the point in his long career that his films depicting people going for master's degrees and who have sexual neurotic hangups are becoming more ridiculous. Such is the case with this utterly pointless film.<br/><br/>Even the person who serves as the narrator appears to be bored with this entire episode.<br/><br/>Two young girls spend the summer in Barcelona and meet a painter, played by a more subdued and romantic Lothario, Javier Bardem. One lady is going for her master's in art and is engaged to be married to Mr.Nice Guy. The other is an actress who appeared in a 12 minute film about love. Yes, 12 minutes.<br/><br/>Both the girls soon romp with the Bardem character. He has an insanely jealous ex-wife played by Penelope Cruz. Her winning of the best supporting actress Oscar leaves me as perplexed as when Gloria Grahame won in 1952 for ""The Bad and the Beautiful."" This is totally undeserved as Cruz, as Maria Elena, comes across as a screaming lunatic.<br/><br/>At one point Cristina, played by Scarlett Johansson, takes up with a reunited Bardem and Maria. She then has to go off to Paris for a couple of weeks to think things through. If Allen were trying to create A MENAGE A TROIS, he let a potentially funny idea go awry.<br/><br/>When Vickie, who marries her fiancé in Barcelona, sneaks off with Bardem, she soon encounters a raging Maria, who accidentally shoots her in the hand. Imagining trying to justify to her new husband that she had met her college professor who happened to have a revolver. At least, if Allen had actually had a revolver, this idea might have worked. It doesn't because the picture is absurd."

Such as: Vicki or Christina? The obvious answer is BOTH; and Javier Bardem is in full agreement even if his ex-wife Penelope Cruz is not.<br/><br/>Rebecca Grey as Vicki is an absolute knockout as the reserved and quiet one. Her stunning face and long slim body -- she looks so squeezable in her wardrobe of loose-fitting casuals -- Christina is no match for her. Scarlett Johanssen has let herself go -- pound-wise. A few excess pounds add puffiness to her face and flab to her arms and legs. A good 12 pound trim might bring her back to her status as ""the actress most men want sex with"" but for now she's outclassed by both Vicki and by Penelope Cruz.<br/><br/>As to performances: You could not ask for better than those given by the 4 principal players. The standout is Javier Bardem having recovered from his just-plain-silly (and Oscar winning) role as the air-gun killer in the Coen Brothers' super silly ""No Country for Old Men."" Usually an actor playing a guy with 3 beautiful women at one time fails to be convincing; but not here. This guy is perfect. Penelope Cruz is reliably overpraised in reviews. She's good here, but praise ought be restrained to reflect reality.<br/><br/>The lesbian scene was the one negative. It was brief, stupid, and false as a $3 bill.<br/><br/>There are so few movies in 2008 for adults aged 12 or older. Cut this one an inch of slack for very minor faults and you've got a winner.<br/><br/>PS: We saw this at Washington DC's fine and historic AVALON Theater, a single screen house built in 1924.

It was fascinating listening to all the Allen-esque dialogue and getting what he was intending so on that front, it was pretty entertaining.

Above all, I value how the whole movie comes together as one piece of artwork instead of focusing on different aspects separately. HOW the movie feels to you emotionally, HOW the pacing suits you, HOW the flow is going, HOW engaged you are in the story, HOW you can relate to it, etc. If the whole thing doesn't FEEL good altogether, then it's a fail, no matter how many bits of sparkles there might be here and there. What's best about this movie is being multi layered without becoming a mess. There are a lot of great dialogues and life- related elements.<br/><br/>The movie raises some interesting questions about love, about different love situations, and about what we want and what we think we want. Vicky who loves her husband, who wants a perfect and politically correct life may actually be looking forward to some adventurous affairs. Cristina, who is willing to try something intriguing and unstable, grows restless after already finding it and realizes that isn't what she really want. Judy, who loves her husband but is not in love with him, is stuck in her situation because there is not a problem to be solved (her husband has done nothing wrong) and try to convince herself of a way out by forcing it to Vicky who is more or less having the same situation. And I'm not even talking about the threesome.

Although I've watched only two of his films, he is good at depicting a trivial matter in ordinary days cynically and dramatically, I think.

She knew that it shouldn't be occurred to her, however, she can't help to love with him. In the meantime, Antonio's ex- wife who is emotional disorder and passionate woman Elena (Penélope Cruz) emerge. Emotional movement of Cristina x Elena x Antonio, Antonio x Vicky will attract the audience into the film. <br/><br/>Interestingly, a thought of Spain=passionate country could be thought that affair is not taboos, rather better thought of following one's honest feeling. If you are a woman you might think which girl is similar of you in love. This square relationship amongst the three girls surrounding Antonio could be not a nasty, rather beautiful, which might be the reason that the film was shot in Spain as well. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson cannot be somewhat an adult woman, though, she played a fascinating role in this film because of her satisfactory position for Woody. While Penélope playing a passionate and hated woman may be fascinating, strong and sexy that might be personal fancy for actors. Penélope is in her element in her role even though she is struggling to play roles in Hollywood."

","Woody Allen is easily considered a great director, with films like Annie Hall and Manhattan being recognised as classics. But in his more recent efforts critics believed Allen has lost his mojo and his recent films have been set in London rather then his native New York. But critics consider Vicky Cristina Barcelona a return to form for the writer/director.<br/><br/>Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are two friends from university who plan to spend the summer in Barcelona. Both are very different people, Vicky was a very grounded academic type who wants stability and a committed relationship, whilst Cristina sees herself as a artistic type, who wants to take risks when it comes to romance. Both meet up with the charming artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who takes them to the city Oviedo. Vicky does not like Juan Antonio whilst Cristina was very attached to him, but the three form a friendship as the 3 deal with relationship problems. Vicky being stuck with a stuffy, conservative man, Doug (Chris Messina) who seems to have no real adventure, Cristina has to do handle her drive to be artistic and self-destructive nature and Juan Antonio has a psychotic ex-wife, María Elena (Penélope Cruz).<br/><br/>Allen does write a script with drama and witty dialogue. The tone is down to Earth, with a light-hearted touch to it and colourful direction. The characters are well rounded, all with their own personal problems, even the well rounded Vicky. The characters are what makes the film interesting and makes you care about what happens to them. There is a good cast in the film, with Cruz and Bardem being the best of the lot. Both are very entertaining as the more extreme characters of the film. Hall and Johannson too perform well, this was one of Johannson's better performances. Allen himself is able to combine the ideas of people looking for exciting and creativity, whilst others want security. There are drawbacks to both of those and it is shown in the film.<br/><br/>Allen uses a narrator throughout the film, at times it gives the film a Kubrickian like quality in films like The Killing. But at other times in the narration is just used to skip over details that we need to see for ourselves, particularly the relationship between Juan Antonio and Cristina.<br/><br/>At times the film also felt hollow with it's talk about art and culture, with Cristina being pretty much a young female version of Allen. Whilst the characters themselves are interesting and the act as the main drive for the film, the plot itself is not remarkable, with moments of lack of focus. Ihe ending too felt rushed and was basically lacking some power that it should have. This's is what is preventing the film from gaining a higher rating but it does have moments of interest."

The more stable, and engaged, Vicky has arranged that they stay with her aunt Judy and husband Mark. Cristina, who has always been more daring, is just getting over writing and directing a twelve minute film she hated. They go out to see the sights and, after a few days they meet Juan Antonio, an artist, who offers to take them to a small town for the weekend where they can see the sights. He makes it clear his intentions are to get one, or both of them into bed. Cristina, being the more adventurous is keen to go and persuades Vicky to accompany her. After a day of sightseeing Cristina decides she wants to share Juan Antonio's bed. Unfortunately she becomes ill right at the critical moment and ends up bedridden for the rest of the weekend. This leaves Vicky and Juan Antonio alone together. One thing leads to another and they end up in each others arms. When they return to Barcelona Juan Antonio calls Cristina up and they go out together. After a few weeks, Cristina moves in with Juan Antonio. And then Juan Antonio's estranged wife, Maria Elena turns up. Throw in Vicky's husband to be turning up and proposing they marry in Spain and you've got a pretty well mixed up Woody Allen plot. There is more, but, as ever I won't give the ending away.<br/><br/>This is a very well made film with dialogue that is unmistakably written by Woody Allen. I do question some of the morality, but then again, Juan Antonio did make his intentions clear from the beginning. Very good performances from all of the major players, Rebecca Hall as Vicky, Scarlett Johansson as Cristina, Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio and Penélope Cruz as Maria Elena.<br/><br/>Although it's not the kind of film I'd usually go out of my way to watch I did enjoy a lot of the dialogue and the way the film explores the neuroses of relationships. It's pretty entertaining, especially whenever Maria Elena appears on the screen! Over all, recommended, but turn your moral compass off first.<br/><br/>My Score: 6.9/10"

","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a hugely entertaining and pleasingly unpretentious film. Woody Allen has always directed female actors particularly well and he gets stunning performances from Rebecca Hall (Vicky), Scarlett Johansson (Cristina) and Penelope Cruz (Maria Elena). The fourth member of the ménage à quatre, Javier Bardem as the Catalan artist Juan Antonio, is also very good indeed, as is the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The film could have been pretentious and offensive twaddle in less assured hands than Allen's. Two beautiful young American women on holiday in Spain falling for the same mature Latin lover doesn't sound very original or engaging. But the contrast between the two young women is nicely drawn and rings true and the location shooting and the naturalistic dialogue adds to the authenticity of the story. The shock to the plot when Penelope's Cruz's Maria Elena storms in is at once both hilarious and frightening - but also convincing.<br/><br/>Allen has an amusing gentle dig at self-satisfied middle-class America with his depiction of the dull as ditchwater Doug - Vicky's fiancé (Chris Messina). I knew that I was going to hate him when I heard him call Vicky ""Babe"" - and I wasn't disappointed. As the movie unfolds the key question is whether Vicky will choose dull old Doug or exciting firebrand Juan Antonio as her partner. The former choice would almost certainly be for life - the latter probably not! When Woody Allen is at his best - and this film is very close to being in that category - it is satisfying and cerebral entertainment. The characters are not from a comic book but from real life and whilst a degree of poetic licence in the plot is necessary to move the story along it is never incredible. And as audience members we will empathise with the characters in a way that is much less possible in a more traditional Hollywood movie. We care about what happens to Vicky and Cristina because we like them and understand their dilemmas. They are serious and bright and attractive and real.<br/><br/>Is there a deeper meaning to Vicky Cristina Barcelona than, just, the romance and the charm? Is it in any way a ""message"" movie? I think that to some degree it is - and that the message is to consider living every day with the thought somewhere in your mind that it might be your last - Juan Antonio says as much at one point. And, of course, it is also about the luxury of choice. To choose between alternative lifestyles, alternative partners, alternative compromises. Each choice is a compromise to some degree because perfection is not just elusive it is impossible - the question is how far short of the ideal will you have to settle for?"

","Before watching this movie, I was expecting an odd sex comedy. But actually, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is lot more interesting than that. Woody Allen has directed and written not only a love story, but he has captured the soul of Spain in a way I seen few American directors been able to do. Of course, not all the performances are great. I was never a big fan of Scarlett Johannsen and her performance as Cristina did little to change that fact. Rebecca Hall gave a better performance as Vicky who seems (in the beginning) to be attached to this idea of a stable and normal life, but who then is attracted to the wild passionate life that Catalonia has to offer her. But really the performances that make this film work, which really represent the heart of this movie, come from Javiar Bardem as Juan Antonio Gonzalo and Penelope Cruz as his ex-wife Maria Elena. They give the most passionate, fiery performances of this film. Then add these great performances the wonderful Spanish architecture, the atmosphere which is electric, the classical guitar music, and the often hilarious dialogue, and what you end up with is a film that comes close to being a gem. The ending is also suitable, if not quite unexpected.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"jboothmillard","8","1","3","19 September 2009"," Vicky Cristina Barcelona
","Written and directed Woody Allen, I mainly heard of this film for the one and Oscar it won for best supporting actress, but also it reunited the director with the leading actress of his Match Point, so I thought I might enjoy this too. With narration by Christopher Evan Welch, basically bright but cautious Vicky (Golden Globe nominated British actress Rebecca Hall) and sexually adventurous Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are on holiday in Barcelona, Spain. There they meet seductive painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo (No Country for Old Men's Golden Globe nominated Javier Bardem), who makes them the offer to spend the weekend with him, and by the end of it be sleeping together. Cristina reluctantly agrees, while Vicky objects, being engaged to fiancée Doug (Chris Messina), and hearing that Juan was violent to his wife, but she does go along. Once in Pviedo, Cristina develops an ulcer, so Juan takes Vicky sightseeing, and they eventually end up kissing each other and having sex, and of course she doesn't say anything to Cristina. While Vicky marries Doug, Vicky moves in with Juan after they too have had sex, but then Juan's unstable ex-wife Maria Elena (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Penélope Cruz) overdoses on something, and he brings her to his house to recover. As time goes by, what was once a distraction actually turns into a passion as Juan, Cristina and Maria all enjoy each other's company (yes, sexually). Vicky realises the mistake of marriage, and Cristina eventually leaves Juan and Maria, and when Vicky goes to see Juan again, Maria goes mad with a gun. In the end, Vicky and Cristina find each other, but they are all the way back where they started, unsure of where to go and what to do. Also starring Dogville's Patricia Clarkson as Judy Nash, Small Soldiers' Kevin Dunn as Mark Nash, Julio Perillán as Charles, Zak Orth as Adam, Carrie Preston as Sally and Pablo Schreiber as Ben. All four performers, Johansson, Bardem, Hall and obviously award-worthy Cruz are perfect for this film that is both charmingly funny, at times very dramatic, and a fully rounded romantic story, a very effective film about culture clashes. It won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Very good!"
"Saturn131313","7","1","3","21 July 2009"," Interesting, with flawless performances from all actors.
","Initially I was disappointed in this film and still am somewhat because Woody Allen doesn't explore anything new--nope,not at all. It is well done and does explore unmet expectations in relationships even if the expectation is not a conscious one for the person.<br/><br/>I thought the Maria E. character was overdone--the mood swings were unexplained and one wonders why she was not(or was?) on any medication. The dialog was at times repetitive and just plain silly because it is in the manner of a Mills & Boone novel (and I have read many of them!) The narrator was annoying and enhanced the romance novel effect. And I was hoping that Vicky would somehow resolve her issue and find passion with her husband.<br/><br/>However this movie is great if only because of the skill of the actors involved in the project. I think Scarlett J. is a fantastic actor and well cast as is Rebecca Hall. <br/><br/>Interesting use is made of the various characters and what quality and what conflict they represent in the film. Maria E. out of control and passionate as well as very compassionate & perceptive in helping Christina discover her talent. Cristina, confused and vulnerable and yet the stabilizing influence in the Juan A./Maria E. drama. Vicky, sad, seeking, aware and unaware of her unmet needs. Juan A. the charming, devious (and honest--he admits he uses people) sociopath who is also, at times, kind and generous and (of all people) assists Vicky in finding part of her true self. Judy, the disappointed and yet wise. Juan's father, playing safe and yet isolated. The barely visible husbands who could be the unappreciated and reliable yet seemingly boring and unaware of their wives' conflict (I wouldn't be too certain of that, however!) Plus others whom I can't recall at the moment. <br/><br/>The film is ultimately about the complexity of humans, their relationships, and the burdens a culture places on all of us.<br/><br/>If you can overlook the annoying parts it is a fantastic film. See it!"
"bptr-1","8","1","3","20 July 2009"," Why does Woody Allen have his actors do Woody Allen imitations?
","Very entertaining film. And, yes, it IS breezy summer entertainment"". As for the person who said that it is ""boring and lackluster writing"", all I can conclude is that you are insensitive and not very bright. It is a ROMANTIC piece, with original and insightful writing. I DO agree that the ""speak in English"" over and over was a bit annoying. Woody Allen certainly has a few flaws.<br/><br/>The main thing that bothers me that I notice in most Woody Allen films is the actors doing a Woody Allen imitation. It really stands out for me. Why is it that no one else notices this? Both Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson) do it very noticeably - especially Vicky. They stutter and stammer and over-analyze exactly like him. Does he direct them specifically to do this? I have seen this in several of his films. Weird. <br/><br/>Aside from this, I really liked this film. It was a nice exotic Summer escape for the viewer just as it was for the two girls living out a Summer fantasy in Spain."
"fwomp","6","1","3","20 May 2009"," Another Hypersexual Film By Woody Allen
","It's official: Javier Bardem (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN) is the luckiest man/actor on the planet! I mean, this guy gets to make out with three of the most gorgeous women acting today. Forget that one of them is his current girlfriend (Penelope Cruz). He also got down with hottie Rebecca Hall (THE PRESTIGE) and ultimate hottie Scarlett Johansson (MATCH POINT). Regardless of how I felt about the rest of the film, there was plenty of eye-candy for guys. And those ladies who think Javier isn't too shabby himself, well, there's that, too.<br/><br/>But let me explain why I'm talking about how good-looking these folks are on-screen and why I started my review in such an unabashed way. Director Woody Allen is well-known for his love of beautiful people. Everything from SLEEPER to MATCH POINT has been sexually charged, to say the least. But his take on relationships is exceptionally skewed toward the hyper-sexual, and that's even more true here. Some might compare this to his private life, but I'll leave that alone ...for now.<br/><br/>This time we have two women, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) on vacation in Barcelona, Spain. The two are good friends and Vicky (Hall) is taking a break in preparation for marriage to Doug (Chris Messina), whom she leaves back in the States. Cristina isn't even close to being ready for marriage, and rips through relationships like a laundry woman through sheets. Then the two ladies meet Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who approaches them with a unique proposal: fly away with him to his house in the north and have sex with him; both of them. At the same time, perhaps. This doesn't surprise Vicky, who immediately labels him a troll with artistic aspirations. But Cristina is intrigued by his forwardness, and the two ladies go with him to his beautiful Spanish home. But Cristina gets sick after eating some bad food, which leaves Vicky and Juan Antonio together, and opposite sparks fly. Then, after Cristina gets better, Juan Antonio takes her into his bed, too. But then a phone call in the middle of the night leads to Juan Antonio's ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), coming to stay with them after a suicide attempt. Cristina and Juan become closer. His ex-wife and Cristina become closer. Juan Antonio and his ex-wife reignite their passions ...with Cristina getting involved with both of them, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Vicky is struggling to deal with her feelings on the night when she weakened and had sex with Juan Antonio. She begins questioning whether she's ready for marriage. But then Dough, her fiancé, comes to Spain with the option to get married there before returning to the States and ""doing it up right."" There are quite a few twists and turns in the multiple relationships that wind and unwind themselves. And that is what made most of the story interesting (that and the beautiful people surrounded by the beauty of Barcelona). So you can see why I started my review the way I did. It's mainly about how sexually charged relationships can change (or maybe not change) who we are. Which brings me to my next point: Penelope Cruz's Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress. I'm not gonna take anything away from her. She did a fine job. But she wasn't on-screen very much. Personally, I think Rebecca Hall got gypped during the Oscar's. Her battles for her emotional stability were what kept me watching, not Penelope Cruz. Hall's character was so conflicted that I could empathize with her. While Cruz's character only made me laugh because she seemed almost like a caricature.<br/><br/>Still, it's an interesting film to watch. But it's really just another Woody Allen sex-take on relationships."
"Buddy-51","8","1","3","9 May 2009"," the trials and tribulations of the rich and beautiful
","In his latest romantic escapade, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" Woody Allen, that wry purveyor of modern relationships, turns sexiness into a purely aesthetic experience. Of course, that's not all that hard to do when you have a cast of drop-dead gorgeous actors exploring the fine art of love and lovemaking in a drop-dead gorgeous setting.<br/><br/>The two main women in the story represent diametrically opposed views of love and men. Vicky is the clear-thinking pragmatist who, when it comes to the opposite sex, opts for the stodgy and reliable type over the dashing romantic ideal - a preference reflected in her choice of fiancé, the stuffed-shirt Doug, whose dutiful dullness makes him a perfect fit for Vicky's middlebrow conception of domestic bliss. Cristina, on the other hand, fancies herself more as the free-living Bohemian type, a gifted amateur photographer who prefers the more ""dangerous"" breed of man - one whose propensity for living life in the moment simmers just beneath the surface of a handsome appearance and smoldering sexuality.<br/><br/>When they travel to Spain for the summer, the two best friends almost immediately find themselves entangled in a complex romantic relationship with Juan Antonio, an abstract painter who inflames the women with his cultured temperament, his devil-may-care attitude, his smooth-talking ways, his raw animal magnetism and his Old World passion for life. And as if all that weren't enough, we get a fourth ingredient added to the already spicy brew: Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's beautiful, volatile and possibly mentally unbalanced ex-wife whom the artist has clearly never gotten over - and apparently never will.<br/><br/>As always, Allen achieves a remarkable complexity both in his characters and in his view of how romantic and sexual attraction actually work. This is reflected most intensely in the character of Vicky who, after a brief but sizzling encounter with Juan Antonio, comes to question her old willingness to settle for staid conformity and emotional security over all-consuming passion and romance. This, of course, puts her whole future marriage in jeopardy as well as her friendship with Cristina, once the latter becomes the live-in lover of Juan Antonio. But Cristina has problems of her own to contend with when an emotionally distraught Maria Elena pops up unexpectedly, taking up residence with the newly formed couple in Juan Antonio's home. With each additional twist of the plot, Allen brings new color and depth to his canvas, as now the complexities of Juan Antonio and Maria Elena's self-destructive love/hate relationship suddenly come racing to the fore.<br/><br/>At times the emotions are so raw and close to the bone - and the truths about human relationships so pinpoint in their accuracy - that the movie becomes almost unbearable to sit through. Or at least it would if the tone itself weren't so consistently scintillating and lighthearted and the setting so eye-popping and sensuous. In fact, I predict that Barcelona - so richly photographed here by Javier Aguirresarobe -will be experiencing a tourism boom for years to come thanks to this film.<br/><br/>Although it was Penelope Cruz who earned a number of awards (including the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress) for her work as Maria Elena, all the actors in this film - Rebecca Hall, Scarlet Johansson, Javier Bardem, Patricia Clarkson and Chris Messina - deliver rich, outstanding performances. And it may just be me, but the singsong, deliberately simplistic narration that Allen has attached to the story appears to be an homage of sorts to Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim,"" probably the most famous romantic roundelay ever committed to film.<br/><br/>The conclusion ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" seems to come to is that NEITHER approach to love really works in the long run - that while too little passion in a relationship may lead to a life of endless regrets over unrealized possibilities, too much passion can result in burnout, serial infidelity and mutual self-destruction for the individuals involved.<br/><br/>Perhaps, Friar Lawrence's advice to the impetuous Romeo and Juliet - ""Therefore, love moderately: long love doth so; too swift arrives as tardy as too slow"" - was right after all."
"MOscarbradley","9","1","3","4 April 2009"," Perhaps it was the weather but Woody has found his muse.
","Perhaps it was the climate; I know that any time I go to Spain my mood lifts considerably and I am invigorated. Whatever the reason, ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" is Woody Allen's best film in years; a warm, funny, cheerful and erotic picture filled with the spirit of Almodovar yet unmistakably a Woody Allen film. For good or ill no-one but Allen could have made this picture and while some may find his pre-occupation with pseudo-intellectual Americans with no interests outside of painting, photography, poetry or movies a crashing bore there are many of us who can still respond to that warm and generous affection he still holds for his emotionally battered and somewhat anally retentive romantics. This is a movie that hearkens back to ""Annie Hall"" and almost everything in-between and if he himself is now too old to play the bruised and battered romantic fool there are many others, younger and not necessarily of the same gender, willing to do it for him.<br/><br/>The problem recently, of course, is that Woody has been too quick to put his aphorisms and gags into the mouths of others as if it is he who is saying them and the result hasn't always worked to his advantage, here there is an easy -going naturalism to all his players that is distractingly un-Woody-like even if the situations and great swathes of dialogue are typically his. This is a film of considerable charm, luminously photographed in warm, Spanish sunlight by Javier Aguirresarobe and performed to perfection by the entire cast. Allen is a great actor's director who has already directed six players to Oscar success, (and Cruz as the passionate if unstable Maria Elena, here, being the latest). If there is no immediate Woody doppelganger we can still trace elements of him in both the characters of Vicky and Christina, (if Christina is more prone to the kind of tics we associate with Woody, it is Vicky who emerges as the more sympathetically drawn stand-in), and both these characters are beautifully played by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson.<br/><br/>Spain is represented by the erotic charms of Javier Bardem's bed-hopping artist and Cruz's tempestuous ex-wife and they are both terrific. Bardem, as we all know, is one of the best actors in the world and Cruz seems to get better with every picture. If there isn't anything fundamentally new here, don't despair; many film-makers will never reach the level of gentle, ironic maturity that Allen displays in this film. He may be an old man now and, yes, it's possible that his best work is behind him but this doesn't feel like an old man's movie. Having just about hit the bar with his last several films and having nose-dived totally with the recent ""Cassandra's Dream"" this feels like an artist getting a new lease of life. It may be Spain, it may be the sunshine, it may even be the ghost of Gaudi; whatever, he is finally back on top."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","3","26 March 2009"," Scattered Romance In Catalonia
","'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' follows the same track of the usual Woody Allen movie about unusual relationships with a touch of comedy. Previously he has tried something different with 'Matchpoint' and 'Scoop' but this movie can be labelled a 'typical Woody Allen comedy', if you like. Here too he explores relationships. The narrative structure is pretty similar but I wonder why Woody chose not to do the voice-over himself. The dialogues have the irony, humour and philosophy of Allen's usual style. The cinematography is vibrant and the score is both whimsical and romantic.<br/><br/>Allen takes full advantage of Barcelona's beauty and gives us glimpses of the typical tourist locations such as the Sagrada Familia (since the title characters are visitors, why not?) but also the stunning natural landscape shots. I like that he portrays it as an artist's city for that is what makes it a unique place in the world. Gaudi's works also play a small but significant role. It is his works that draw Vicky to Barcelona in the first place until this is replaced by someone, Juan Antonio.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall is quite a pleasant surprise. I had first seen her in 'Frost/Nixon' where she has a strong presence, but here she is brilliant. Scarlett Johansson is quite alright. She's overshadowed by her co-stars. Javier Bardem is unexpectedly cast as a charming, smooth-talking seducer/artist and the actor is simply great. Patricia Clarkson is effective in a small role.<br/><br/>But the real star is Penelope Cruz. Cast against type, she is terrific as the neurotic, manipulative.. (well I shouldn't list more spoilers).. Maria Elena. It's one of her best works to date and completely different from what she has done for Almodovar (contrary to what many have said).<br/><br/>The characters are very familiar when you think of Allen's previous film and I doubt it would be wrong to guess that they are a part of him. Thus, 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is an unconventional romantic comedy (though typical Woody Allen) but that is not to say that it's a summer flick. The movie does have layers and depth that reveal the dark side of relationships, attachments, desire and commitment."

One night, while out at a restaurant, they meet Juan Antonio, a Spanish painter beautifully portrayed by Javier bardem. He offers them a weekend at his home town promising sightseeing, good food and making love. Cristina accepts and persuades Vicky to come along.

Everything is going smoothly until the artist receives a phone call revealing that his ex-wife Maria Elena (a stunning Penelope cruz) has attempted to commit suicide. Juan Antonio allows her to come and live with them for a couple of months and eventually the three all indulge in a relationship together. However, neither of the very different affairs last and the movie has a lot to say about the strange, briefness and unpredictability of love. Rebecca Hall manages to hold her own as the insecure Vicky, who's simple and dull life is turned upside down when she meets Juan Antonio and ends up falling for him. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson is beautiful but outclassed by the two Spaniards. the movie is far from perfect however, with annoying narration throughout telling us a lot more than we need to know and feeling lazy and pointless. It almost signifies that the actors could not portray the emotion required, which is entirely untrue, considering the calibre of acting which is very high.

"blackburnj-1","8","1","3","22 February 2009"," A delight
","Woody Allen's latest film is a return to comedy, after recent wanders into darker territory. It cannot be said to be a crushing, comic examination of humanity's madness in matters of love, but it is a subtle, clever and highly entertaining piece of humorous cinema which hits the spot quite expertly.<br/><br/>The theme of the film, as it is with so many of Allen's films, is love and what the heart really wants. It is, however, incredibly light-hearted about it and swings through the brief running time with ease. Vicky, an engaged girl with safe and definite views on love, and her friend Cristina, who is much more given to passions, no matter how fleeting, have their worldviews challenged by their respective relationships with local artist, Juan Antonio, who embodies the passion that Cristina likes and the Catalan philosophy and lifestyle which Vicky adores.<br/><br/>The story is quietly involving, as the characters are entertaining, well defined and beautifully played. Rebecca Hall continues to impress with a really beautifully executed performance here, which is as wonderfully understated as the rest of the film. Scarlett Johansson delivers a performance which draws on the talent which she has shown before now, but still doesn't quite live up to the promise that she gave us in ""Lost in Translation"". Javier Bardem is, once again, magnificent to watch as he oozes charm through the course of the film. And who could forget Penelope Cruz, whose controlled madness is fuelled into the ideal form of Juan Antonio's insane former wife Maria Elena? The actors have got a good script to work with here, as Woody Allen delivers a piece of writing which is delightfully restrained, constantly amusing and, at points, devilishly funny. There are numerous lines and moments which could be quoted, but that would spoil them.<br/><br/>As a result of all this expert craftsmanship, Allen leaves his audience with a little gem of a film, which is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. It may not be a masterpiece, but it is a wonderful way to pass an hour and a half."
"3xHCCH","6","1","3","13 February 2009"," Provokes Thoughts About Love Relationships
","I have not seen a Woody Allen movie for a very long time. In fact I do not even remember the last one. Watching ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" brought it all back -- the incisive and thought-provoking ideas elucidated in the very smart dialogue. Vintage Woody, back to form. Nobody can write with so much neuroses in its varied forms like Woody Allen.<br/><br/>That said, I think the screenplay, while very witty, also had its flaws in its very unexpected plot turns. First, who was the Narrator? He surely helped the story along, but who was he in the first place? However, my main qualm was the way the problem of Vicky got resolved which I found contrived. I did not like it. It seems to be the easy way out.<br/><br/>As for the main actor, I'm sure all the men in the audience would agree what a lucky guy Javier Bardem is, sharing the screen bed with three gorgeous women -- Scarlett Johannson, Rebecca Hall and Penelope Cruz. He is just laid back here and clearly enjoying his fantasy role of a woman-magnet artist.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannson is very natural and carefree as the free-spirited Cristina. Her character makes a key yet sudden decision midway in the film that upsets the status quo. This is another one of my problems with the script. She has certainly come a long way from the girl in ""Horse Whisperer."" My favorite Scarlett role remains to be Griet in ""Girl with a Pearl Earring."" <br/><br/>Rebecca Hall looks and acts very different from her confident character in ""Frost/Nixon,"" playing the mousy and conflicted bride Vicky. As the more conservative and rigid character, she had to convey her emotions in less words and less body language. Yet she gets her character's conflicts across.<br/><br/>However, it is Penelope Cruz who is the only member of the cast nominated for an Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress). Her character Maria Elena is far and away the most showy role and she goes to town with it. I did not like the way the character was written, but Ms. Cruz did very well in it, if not a little overdone.<br/><br/>I should mention one more actress, Patricia Clarkson. She has a short role, yet instrumental in the development of Vicky's character. Ms. Patricia does very well in her few minutes on screen.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure why this was nominated (and won) for Best Musical/Comedy in the Golden Globes. While the cinematography, set design, music and Barcelona are all fantastic, the topics tackled are quite serious and controversial. Especially for Asian sensitivities. Overall though, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is not entirely a Valentine sort of romantic movie. The script provides difficult questions that challenges the audience to think and discuss afterward."
"mario_c","8","1","3","29 January 2009"," Barcelona, art and romance
","This new film by Woody Allen is a comedy/drama romance set in Barcelona with all the typical ""Woody Allen ingredients"": irony, humor, failed relationships, but all with the charm and the elegance we are used to watch in Woody's films! I enjoyed the movie especially because it's quite realistic and unrealistic at the same time. I mean, by one hand it has some kind of situations that just happens in movies, like that scene where the two girls accept the invitation to go to Oviedo, but on the other hand it describes very well the undefined feelings people sometimes feel for each other. In this particular case I really appreciated the role played by Penelope Cruz. I think she does a fantastic job, playing this stressed, lunatic, jealous but passionate girl! And one interesting idea I took from this love triangle composed by the characters played by Cruz, Barden and Johansson, MARIA ELENA, JUAN ANTONIO, and CRISTINA, respectively: Love can happen between three people. In the film CRISTINA is the bridge between MARIA ELENA and JUAN and she's also the ""equilibrium point"" of all them, as was said by MARIA ELENA. So CRISTINA was the piece that was missing to complete the puzzle between MARIA ELENA and JUAN, and their relationship would be incomplete without her. Love doesn't happen always just between two people... But in the film this connection was also broken and the puzzle stilled incomplete!...(SPOILERS)... As the movie begins as the movie ends: CRISTINA who started seeking for adventure stilled seeking for adventure; VICKY who started engaged stilled engaged; and MARIA ELENA and JUAN who started angry with each other stilled angry with each other!"

","Vicky is a prim, proper, practical woman. She is engaged to the type of man prim, proper, practical women marry. Vicky's friend Cristina is everything Vicky is not. Adventurous, spontaneous and quite willing to hop into bed with some random man she just met. Vicky knows what she wants in life. Cristina is searching. The two friends are spending the summer in Barcelona. Artist Juan Antonio, of whom Vicky and Cristina know nothing other than he tried to kill his ex-wife (or maybe the other way around), introduces himself and suggests the three of them fly off to Oviedo for a weekend of sightseeing and sex. Mostly sex. Vicky is of course appalled. Cristina is of course intrigued. Off to Oviedo the threesome goes, Vicky only agreeing to go along to keep an eye on Cristina. And then things get complicated.<br/><br/>Woody Allen has set up an interesting situation here but the film doesn't live up to its initial promise. Ultimately it is quite a letdown. This seems like a story which should be full of emotion but the movie is oddly flat. The performances of the leads don't help. Scarlett Johansson, playing Cristina, is a blank slate in desperate need of some color. She's quite dull. Rebecca Hall, playing Vicky, comes across somewhat better. It is really left to Penélope Cruz, playing a prototypical Spanish firecracker, to inject some life into the proceedings. The movie noticeably perks up when Cruz is on the screen. Her scenes with Javier Bardem, playing Juan Antonio, have some sizzle to them, a notable contrast to Bardem's interactions with the film's other leading ladies. Cruz brings good energy but not nearly enough to rescue what is all in all a rather boring movie.<br/><br/>While not a total misfire Vicky Cristina Barcelona has too many flaws to be deemed a success. The dialogue is rather pretentious. There is an incredibly annoying narrator who just never shuts up. The story, which seemed to have great promise, ends up falling rather flat. Some of the key performances fail to engage. And in the end it all seems rather pointless, there is no satisfying resolution whatsoever. Cruz and Bardem work well together. Unfortunately that which surrounds them disappoints. You can see potential in this movie. But Allen was unable to put the pieces together properly. One of those frustrating movies which you can't help but feel should be much better than it actually is."

","Textbook Woody Allen, via Barcelona. Two young American friends visit Spain for the summer: Cristina is adventurous but aimless, while high-minded Vicky holds tight to her principles but is ready to melt. After a chance meeting with a handsome local artist, who is still enraptured with his fiery ex-wife, both ladies become individually involved with the hot-blooded lover--relationships that become even more complicated when the sexy ex returns. Not the rich, sumptuous spread one might expect, this light, minor Allen effort has very little of his customary wit. The location shooting is pleasant but unremarkable, while the performances are rather colorless. Penélope Cruz won a surprising Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work, though her character (a temperamental train-wreck who thinks nothing of being intrusive) is rather a born loser. Allen's screenplay is talk-heavy with the type of relationship issues he has been mining for years (he fails to come up with anything fresh), while the scenario (deemed ""seductive"" and ""sexy"" by professional critics) is curiously muted. There's next-to-nil seducing going on, while the sex either takes place off-screen or is interrupted. ** from ****"

","I thought that having the Vicky character adopt the kind of dialog and mannerisms of the character Allen himself usually takes -- sort of using her character as an Allen stand-in -- had potential. Much more broadly presented, it could have given everyone a few laughs and believe me when I say that we needed a few. Instead, the Vicky/Allen character just gradually falls into line with the rest of this dull movie -- her first allenisms were the best and her last the worst. Except for the Cruz parts, everything is gradual in this film. It just didn't work. Throw it onto the 'Didn't Work' pile and go on to the next project."

During the weekend, both end up sleeping with Juan.

"lewiskendell","8","1","4","26 March 2010"," A great cast gets the best out of Allen.
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a movie of beautiful parts that never quite solidify into an equally pleasing whole. It doesn't have a ""plot"", but instead it focuses on the relationships of a few people over a summer in Spain. The narrative focus switches between three main characters as they all seemingly go through changes, only to end essentially where they began. <br/><br/>Every actor and actress was cast perfectly. Javier Bardem is beyond charming, and really it's more accurate to say that he embodies the role of Juan Antonio instead of acts it out. Penelope Cruz, Rebecca Hall, and Scarlett Johansson are all so hypnotically beautiful that it's easy to overlook the fact that each of them gives some of the most outstanding performances of their careers. And I can't talk about beauty without mentioning the picturesque scenery of Spain. I wanted to visit there before, but now I think I'd rather travel there than any other place in the world. The theme song, ""Barcelona"", was the cherry on top of it all. Each time I heard it during the film, I just had to crack a bit of a smile.<br/><br/>The main theme of Vicky Cristina Barcelona is how different kinds of people look for and respond to different kinds of love and relationships. Each person who watches it will probably relate differently to the actions and thoughts of the main characters, because they all represent the various human perspectives of love. They all seem so refreshingly authentic, in an urbane way. There was very little romantic idealization going on (to my relief).<br/><br/>Vicky Cristina reminds me a bit of Closer, even though its motif lies in the completely opposite direction. Ultimately there's no resolution, no progress in the lives of the characters. It feels like the viewer simply lived among the characters and viewed their lives for a few months, and then left again. Of course, every movie doesn't have to have a tidy ending to be good, but in this case it's a double-edge sword. The ending was so abrupt that I was left wanting to know more. How (if at all) were the characters changed by their summer? Is it unfair for me to wish for a Vicky Cristina Barcelona...Part 2?"
"sagar272","5","1","4","8 November 2009"," Woody could have done better..!!
","What basically I think about the movie is that it's all about confusions in relation, skeptical people with confused minds who never really learn to attach to someone so easily and tend to wander off. According to me what woody is trying to show in the movie is that there a lot of people around who don't bother much about love or just don't consider it a big deal. Relations don't get enough ground and tend to get over in a disastrous way.<br/><br/>Well the movie is supposed to be basically only about two girls Vicky and Christina who migrate to Barcelona and get into a weird kind of relation with the same man called Juan Antonio. Well where Christina's frequency matches with the guy much but on the other hand Vicky seems to disapprove on all grounds with the guy. But at some point of time even Vicky attaches to him to a certain level and just when Christina and Antonio seem to go around well suddenly his ex-wife gets in, which is a very dramatic mode. At this point of time I thought may be the movie might go somewhere else and not where I thought and exactly that's what happened later on Christina, Juan Antonio and maria Elena made a trio. All the characters in the movie seem to be quiet open with each other throughout.<br/><br/>Summing it up to the end the whole story didn't seem that appealing to me. Characters have been shown in a messy life and the only thing that puts up the movie is quiet a act by scarlet and Javier Bardem. Its said that this movie is one of his best in the decade but not in my case. The script could have been better. So one has to take a chance to decide whether to c it or not."
"TxMike","Null","1","4","2 February 2009"," If you like Woody Allen, you will like this movie.
","Many Woody Allen films are less likely to have a story that has a ""resolution"", instead will be more ""slice of life"" stories. But ""slice of life"" of rather ordinary, honest, faithful people isn't that interesting so he makes them rather unusual and quirky. This is that type of movie.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall as Vicky and Scarlett Johansson as Cristina are university students who have the opportunity to spend two months in Spain. Vicky is traditional and is engaged to a traditional man back in New York, and they plan to have a traditional wedding and a traditional life, all in all predictable and some think boring.<br/><br/>Christina, on the other hand, is just about the opposite of all that. She has a more wild zest for life and the experiences it can provide. She is more likely to experiment when the opportunity presents itself.<br/><br/>But both Vicky and Christina are having a nice, pleasant visit until one evening at a function they encounter Javier Bardem (evil guy in ""No Country for Old Men"") as Spanish artist Juan Antonio Gonzalo. He is the type that doesn't exist in reality, but here he is charming, intelligent, witty, sexy and ... forward. He very calmly tells the two friends that he would like to have sex with both of them, at the same time. Instead of anyone becoming offended, they have an Allen-esq discussion about it.<br/><br/>All that results in their flying off in a small plane to another location. Some interactions result. Then what starts out as a rather nice developing love affair between Christina and Juan Antonio is thrown into turmoil by Penélope Cruz as Maria Elena , the recent former wife of Juan Antonio. (Cruz has received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for this role.) A feature of this movie is Christopher Evan Welch (whom we never see) as Narrator. While this feature of the movie has been widely criticized by some, I found it a rather nice way to augment the story without having to interpret everything a character might be doing.<br/><br/>When the 90-minute movie is over, we observe that all the characters have been changed by the experiences, but they mainly continue in the directions they were headed as the story began. Just an interesting, somewhat perverted, slice of life story. For my tastes it is somewhat overrated."

","Woody Allen has written and directed another European based film that feels like a view across the pond toward America: Allen is still Allen, but with the comparison of European attitudes with American narcissism makes this little film a bit more bitter than most of his others. As with most of Allen's movies, as fine as they are there are usually some annoying elements. In VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA that element is in the presence of an unseen narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) who provides the bridges among the various aspects of the film, bridges that in the presence of such a fine cast are unnecessary in fleshing out the characters and their odd situations. <br/><br/>Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who have elected to spend a summer in Barcelona: Vicky intends to pursue her studies of Catalan art and architecture while Cristina needs to recover from her completion of a disappointing 12 minute film. Vicky is a pragmatist engaged to a 'good prospect' named Doug (Chris Messina) while Cristina longs for the unusual - something that will fill the gap in her perception that she is without talent. The two girls meet a famous artist Juan Antonio Gonzano (Javier Bardem) who, recovering from a strangely abusive marriage to the flamboyant Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz), puts the make on the two girls for a ménage a trois. Vicky is disgusted, Cristina is fascinated and somehow the trio is off for a wild weekend that turns into a strange interplay of even stranger personality types. Juan loves both, beds both, and problems arise - especially when his still beloved tempestuous Maria Elena arrives on the scene. Just about every variation of relationships is explored during this film with the audience more than willing to go along with the twists and turns that never cease to surprise and entertain. <br/><br/>Once again Javier Bardem proves he is one of our strongest actors on the screen and Penélope Cruz lights up the story like a rocket. Watching them both is reason enough to see this film. As for the script, Allen allows each of the characters to reference an aspect of Allen's own quirks, and in the end we have indeed heard yet another diatribe of how Woody Allen sees himself and the people who enter his sphere. The film is colorful, rich in fine music, and blessed with an impeccable cast. If it just didn't superimpose that narrator as a tour guide....Grady Harp"

","Woody Allen already knocked me out with his talent with Matchpoint, which was probably one of his best movies ever. Over 70 he had found a second career with remarkable movies. Along his great quality for dialogs, Allen has the quality to get the best out of actors. Bardem as always is fantastic as the artist with a lack of talent and an image which makes every women love him. Johansson with he lovely eyes and a little chunky body has one of he best roles, but the biggest actor on the screen is Penelope Cruz who lives together with Bardem in real life. Cruz acting in Spanish or Englisch is a complete difference. Cruz acting in an European film instead of an American film is the same story. AltoughWoody Allen is Amnerican, this film feels European. Cruz performs fantastically with power. Her role as unbalanced, aggressive, highly talented, very intellectual artist is phenomenal. Compared with her roles in other American films Cruz gives a top end performance, also due to the passion she feels with Bardem. A good movie, not a great movie, but good due to the acting and an excellent cinematography. I really loved it. 8,5 /10"
"mirwais-orbit","8","1","4","12 January 2009"," The comic half of love stories
","For sure Europe has made consistent changes in Woody's mind and all that's happening around him as an observer and as a misunderstood artist as well. Also seems that he wants to express it in a so intense way that all his best creative processes in the last 10 years are happening in Europe than when living in his loved Manhattan.<br/><br/>It's obvious why his mind seems so much more clear and his movies seems so more coherent now than before. Manhattan is a concrete jungle surrounded by chaos and cars and people crossing streets and a place where you can find anything anytime anywhere, but you will never be able to find answers for inner questions. So it's always the search for an inexistent thing. In Europe, as things happens a little slower and everything in that continent has a cultural explanation for everything, or an intense artistic feeling for every moment, that's why most of the artists find themselves crossing the ocean. And we can feel that happens to Woody.<br/><br/>I never appreciated his movies so much as now. Like I said, he seemed to me a totally chaos before Europe and now he seems a lot more coherent and expressive, and we are able to feel that. It's not like Woody is trying to be something else, he's there all the time with all his perfectionism and questionings, extracting from life the finner feelings that we are always trying to hide, but he is not that messy expressionist picture anymore.<br/><br/>Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of his best works because he unified all his discussions thru the years in a loose movie that carries you naturally over his own ideas and personal questions and fears that we all heard before. For me, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is the opposite of Match Point (2005), and both of them are what he was trying to express with Melinda And Melinda (2004) and its both sides of the same story, the comic one and the tragic one. While Match Point is the tragic one in London, VCB is the comic one in Barcelona. So, it was necessary two different movies in two totally different places to show what Melinda And Melinda fails a lot in Manhattan. But that is a totally Woody Allen thing, I mean... he never gives up an idea till the time he feels fully completed in satisfaction with it.<br/><br/>Also is very interesting why he chose Spain as background of the comic love stories, because that country represents all about love clichés and the appreciation of a good wine in bucolic warm places surrounded by colors and history. That is another huge twist in a career that always suited in inexpressive cold places filled with whisk.<br/><br/>But the most interesting fact of the movie - and each one of his European movies - is that there are always American characters searching for something outside their native country, and there are always other American characters always trying to push them back to that American way of life that those ones were trying to escape or forget someway. And that seems to me his consistent idea that no matter how better and creative he fells in Europe, there's always a foot in New York.<br/><br/>It's unfair talk about how much better are the actors or the characters separately because all of them has a whole importance in Woody's mind and how they were able to express it in his own artistic ways. But the actors here perform their characters with sincere brilliance and they are so consistent and well directed that is refreshing.<br/><br/>No doubt Woody keeps getting better and better thru the years and I'm rediscovering the pleasure to watch his movies all over again."

I consider that at the end of the story, when the characters are back in United States, they aren't back to the ""starting point"" as some people wrote. That is, back to the state in which they were before traveling to Barcelona. <br/><br/>They aren't back to the state in which they were before traveling to Barcelona, because something new happened in their lives. This doesn't mean that their lives changed, but that their way of looking at life must have changed. This new way of looking to life should have been pointed out by the author.<br/><br/>I can't believe that the author consider nothing: (i) having an intense affair with a foreigner, while being engaged to marry someone (Vicky) (ii) having an intense affair in a threesome scheme with a very intense couple (Cristina)<br/><br/>2. I consider that the relationship between the three characters in the threesome scheme, should have been explored a bit more to help me understand better what was going on between Cristina, Maria Helena and Juan Antonio. The way this relationship was actually described makes me think that this threesome scheme was just a fantasy in the author's head. And, I'm interested in something more than a mere fantasy.

Vicky Cristina Barcelona has been rightly told to be the cinematic equivalent of a book on tape: a flick watching itself for you and telling/explaining all you see. The three heroines are three very attractive girls/women (Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz) that show chemistry together and prove very fit for their roles.

The girls, Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson, in her third Allen film), both fall for Juan Antonio, a local painter and lothario who still mourns the disastrous failure of his marriage. Antonio (Bardem) is something of a conundrum to both girls: Cristina, because she has always enjoyed strange and mysterious relationships, and Vicky, because she never has.<br/><br/>After a secret affair with Juan Antonio, Vicky tries to force herself to abide by her old life plan. She is engaged to a successful New York businessman but suddenly finds herself doubting what she thought she always wanted out of love and life. Cristina picks up where Vicky leaves off, falling in love and eventually moving in with Juan Antonio. She is all the while unsure of her new life with the charming painter, especially when his ex-wife (Cruz) comes back into the picture.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz is wonderful as Maria Elena, a mentally unstable muddle of emotions. She and Bardem have great chemistry, during tender moments of intimacy and heated bouts of screaming. She stirs things up just as the film starts to get a bit too predictable. Her scene with Johansson's Cristina, developing photos in a darkroom, is very sensual and not soon forgotten once the movie ends.<br/><br/>The film is typical of Woody Allen with its sharp dialogue and fully fleshed-out characters. However, ""Barcelona"" is slightly hindered by unnecessary narration from Christopher Evan Welch. The commentary adds nothing to the picture and sometimes glosses over scenes that require more attention.<br/><br/>Allen tends to be a better writer than director, but he really utilizes Spain's beautiful city as a fantastic backdrop to his picture. He manages to do for Barcelona what he used to do for New York so many years ago. By filming the city's culture instead of generic monuments, Allen manages to unearth its heart. If Spain's tourism industry sees a spike in visits to Barcelona, they ought to send him a check.<br/><br/>""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a solid, thought-provoking film that is a great addition to the long list of Woody Allen's works.

"DICK STEEL","8","1","4","28 September 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Vicky Cristina Barcelona
","Woody Allen seems to have a riot of a time making movies outside of New York, and truth be told, I find them pretty enjoyable, though some would argue I should revisit his earlier films to understand what's great. Then again, his ""muse"" Scarlett Johansson and a more contemporary cast are an interesting mix to gain a fresh following from a new generation of audiences like myself, lapping it up on Allen's wit, narrative creativity and candy eye cast.<br/><br/>The reason why Barcelona was chosen, and hence in the title, was because the City had sponsored Allen to make his movie there. I guess if Uniquely Singapore would do so, this could have been Vicky Cristina Singapore. Then again, I suspect some boardroom terms and conditions might have made it very pro-tourism video like. Of some of the earlier co- productions I have seen with the Lion City's money pumped in, you can't help but feel that shots of our landmarks almost always come across as something made for corporate videos, and relied plenty on those tracking shots, or worse, dug out from archives.<br/><br/>But in the hands of maestros, this feeling somehow doesn't even come into the picture. Landmarks become just another non-intrusive backdrop, or worked carefully that they become essential to the story without drawing attention to themselves. I guess we could all learn from this film how to do reward a city that graciously allows itself to be filmed and filmed using some of its investment.<br/><br/>Vicky Cristina Barcelona is so titled because it is a tale of the two titular best friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) who spend their summer vacation in the Catalan city. It's an exploration of contemporary relationships using two characters whose view on love comes from total opposites. For Vicky, it's all built on the foundation of commitment, of being very structured and organized about it. For Cristina, a failed short filmmaker by her own standards, it's to take the bull by the horns, and to grab relationship opportunities in a rather cavalier manner.<br/><br/>In a test of their resolve, they meet newly minted star Javier Bardem who plays Juan Antonio, a suave, witty and sweet talking painter who audaciously suggests that they travel with him, and thereafter sleep with him. For Vicky it is near impossible given that she's on the verge of getting married and a definite contradiction of her principles, but to Cristina, it is a plus point in have a complete stranger come up and telling them honestly what he wants to do with them. So begins the exploration of love and relationships in 3 acts.<br/><br/>The start is a bit slow as Vicky gets to have a spanner thrown in her plans, that once you've tasted the forbidden fruit, you'll likely be clamouring for more. It's a wake up call and examination of a life that she thinks she wants to have, versus one that she probably would like to have and enjoy it a lot more. It's the classic tussle between freedom, and being shackled, of conforming to the idea that being successful means a good career with an equally career-successful husband, in an artificially created lifestyle involving small talk with colleagues/friends and the likes.<br/><br/>Cristina's dalliance with Juan Antonio shows how their carefree attitudes and bohemian lifestyles might attract and inspire each other to greater heights and the pursuit of new dreams and skills, though I welcomed the arrival of Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) somewhere at the halfway point, feisty and temperamental ex-wife of Juan Antonio, as she stirs the pot a lot more, and truly the three of them engage in quite a parasitical lifestyle, feeding off one another's energy, sexual and otherwise.<br/><br/>All the cast members perform up to expectations, though I reckon that Scarlett haters will continue to loathe her presence here. Javier Bardem does an about turn from his extremely dead serious role in No Country for Old Men, and here he's quite the Casanova in his pursuit of women. It doesn't have plenty of big moments and never lapses into melodrama. Events get presented as is, without the need to exaggerate, and it's always a plus point to have a dash of humour added as well in Allen's signature style. It might seem fresh and breezy on the outside, but underneath its veneer is some serious study into human romantic relationships that you'll be left pondering for some time after the end credits roll."
"moutonbear25","8","1","4","4 September 2008"," Woody in khakis and sandals
","What could be more romantic than a summer vacationing is Barcelona? You're surrounded by art, history and breathtaking scenery. You meet people you've probably never met before and will most likely never see again. You can immerse yourself in an entirely different culture, learning something new about life and yourself with every passing day. Or, you can leave your every woe from your difficult life behind you and let it all fall away into the ocean. In Woody Allen's latest, VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, Vicky and Cristina (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannson) do just that. Vicky is going to learn while Cristina follows in hope of escape and before the summer is out both will learn that that which is inherently romantic is also inescapably complicated.<br/><br/>Vicky and Cristina are the kinds of friends that would likely not become friends if they met at this present moment but are good friends regardless because of a long and cherished history. Vicky is practical to a fault. Everything she does has purpose and function, including her fiancé, Doug (Chris Messina, who played the same ""I am everything that is wrong with America today"" character at the end of ""Six Feet Under""). Cristina cannot stomach settling into herself, as she can't stand that self, so she recklessly pursues paths of abandon in hopes of finding solace. They are opposite in everything they do, right down to their hair colors, but they find one common interest while abroad, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), a painter with a dramatic reputation. Juan Antonio is a player but he isn't playing. He's unassumingly smooth and sexy in shirts and pants that are dressed down by playful sneakers. He is a passionate man and his provocative proposal to have both ladies join him for a weekend of food, music and lovemaking brings out the American prude in both Vicky and Cristina.<br/><br/>Still, the vacation does everybody good, including Allen himself. Stepping out of New York and into London for his (brief) return to form, MATCH POINT, rejuvenated a vision that was once great but had recently become monotonously unwieldy. Going to the Barcelona countrysides for his 40th feature has a similar effect, in that his vision is refreshingly alive. Still, it is different than the London Allen of late. In Barcelona, it feels as if Allen were on his own vacation. This is Woody in sandals, a loose fitting tee and khakis. Sure, he's still neurotically smothered in sun block but his grip on the film is relaxed, more organic. In fact, the film's underlying criticism of American materialism and structure suggest that Allen is happy to be away for a while. Besides, if he weren't overseas, he might not have had the chance to work with Penelope Cruz. Cruz plays Marie Elena, Juan Antonio's ex-wife who tried to kill him before ultimately leaving him. Her insanity and is eluded to so often before she actually graces the screen that by the time she does, one shakes with anticipation for her arrival. Cruz's presence is overwhelming, a tumultuous force that commands attention and can either destroy or nurture from one moment to the next. She elevates the overall quality of the film to exciting heights and it was already pretty great before she got there.<br/><br/>After years of troubled relationships both on and off screen, Allen is still going back for more despite it all. Having been around a few blocks though has given the man a fair amount of insight. He may not know what makes the perfect recipe but he's still in the kitchen cooking because he knows that when you do get all the ingredients just right, you're in for one hell of a good meal. He throws all of his characters into the fire knowing full well they will all get burned but that they will also all be better people for it. For all its complications, love or sex or however you choose to define your interaction with another human being (or with two or three for that matter) will ultimately transform you. The same can be said for VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, a flame well worth getting close to."
"massimo-pigliucci","8","1","4","31 August 2008"," Woody should have done the voice-over
","A perfectly enjoyable movie by Woody Allen, arguably one of the most under-appreciated directors in contemporary America. The story of two close friends during a summer vacation in Barcelona continues Allen's recent streak of movies set in Europe. This isn't Manhattan, but the backdrop shots are beautiful nonetheless. The two main characters couldn't be different, though during the movie their reactions to events begin to crossover to some extent, at least for a while. Excellent performance by Penélope Cruz, who I think is a much more convincing actress when she acts in Spanish, I guess not surprisingly. But the movie's major attraction is an understated but superb performance by Rebecca Hall, playing Vicky. Also of note Javier Bardem, playing the Spanish Latin lover. One complaint: the narrator voice should have been Allen's. You can just hear him coming through loud and clear, even though that's not his voice."
"s_imdb-18-540293","5","1","5","8 April 2011"," unrealistic cliché
","I mean, I know Woody loves cliché characters, but here it's too much... And these cliché are also not-believable. The troubled painter dresses like Dolce & Gabbana fashion style and he's always perfect like he takes 3 shower per day and goes to the hair dresser every week. The artistic girl Scarlet looks like a bimbo when she talks, and she dresses without any kind of style or personality, I mean, did you ever meet a early twenty something years old who writes, direct movies and make pictures, that goes around with that bourgeois style? And Barcelona looks like the stereotype Americans have about Europe. They drink Italian coffé again and again like it's Nescafé. The only true character in the movie is Rebecca Hall. I suppose it's her story, because all others characters are unrealistic. Bardem looks like a zen enlightened master, just to end up fighting like a bitch for who knows what. Most fascinating performance was Penelope Cruz'. But I guess this movie was a success mainly because it talks about threesomes and sapphic sex other than unhappy marriages, and it does it in an open way, which is all good, and I agree with it. But it was kind of disappointing. The old and fascinating passion vs rationality struggle..., but kind of banal. And I mean, NOT A SINGLE (FUNNY) JOKE in the entire movie!! Was this Woody Allen?"

","One wonders if Woody Allen's films will be regarded simply as mere mannerisms 50 years from today. Once again, the elite world of New Yorkers possessed of unlimited earning power and ever so much leisure time is the center of attention, a world on both sides of the Atlantic where no poverty, filth, despair, oppression and ultimate unfairness are even visible. This middle class maven has succeeded in fooling many of us into regarding articulate kitsch as art. To many of us. Spielberg can't make a love story and Woody Allen cannot or will not portray life, real life. One assumes that the glimpse of real life we saw in Radio Days is too painful to be an adult experience.<br/><br/>Yeah, we get it - real connections don't happen enough and we are left to settle or forever search.<br/><br/>The guitar music would have been great by half."

","The Spanish National Tourist Office, The Agency for Tourism in Catalonia, The Antoni Gaudi Association and Woody Allen proudly presents Vicky Christina Barcelona, the latest promotional movie targeted for the US market. The list of Golden Sponsors for this movie is the following: The Vacation Department of Hollywood Trade Union, The Macho Lover Guild, The Love-seeking American Girls Club, The Society of Idiotic But Wealthy American Husbands and finally the Merriam-Webster Dictionary of Stereotypes.<br/><br/>So the story goes that Woody and his crew got bored in foggy Albion and aspired to warmer climate for a while. They also got allies, as the Spanish contingent in Hollywood wanted a free trip home. They quickly assembled a script, managed to convince some film managers (also just considering a Spanish vacation) and soon they started the shooting in the warm, sunny and lovable city of Barcelona. They also included a few excursions into the script, just to prevent getting bored in the same city for such a long time. Everyone enjoyed staying there, the siesta, the excellent wine, the tourist attractions, the friendly locals, the possibility of flirting and everything. In the end, somehow they even managed to put the film together.<br/><br/>And it's not that bad, after all. The story passes as an easy-going comedy: the main line is that two American girls spend some time in Spain and have affairs with a charming Spanish womanizer. This is an ideal story for single female audience, but obviously alienates young and wealthy Gringos: unfortunately they are presented as boring idiots. Not exactly an ideal program to take your girlfriend out on Valentine-Day. Luckily, with non-US male audience the problem is absent, for they can easily identify themselves as the Latin womanizer and can also practice their anti-yankee sentiments.<br/><br/>The movie is saved by the fairly good cast and the usual Woody Allen irony. A little bit everyone plays his or her parody, which gives just enough spice to the otherwise rather calculable story.<br/><br/>Woody Allen has made much better movies than this one. Still, this is far more enjoyable than the the latest Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller effort or anything else Hollywood nowadays releases under the comedy tag."

Scarlet Johansson carries the innocent look she had in ""the island"" and we have Javier Bardem in a completely contradictory style with what he had in his Oscar winning performance in ""no country for old men"".Penolpe Cruz as always sizzles and does what she does best. The movie has Vicky and Cristina having a vacation in Barcelona who incidentally meet and fall for the same guy Juan and both don't know of each others situation.Moreover Vicky is on the verge of her engagement but Christine is still in search of her soul mate.But Juan himself has just faced a divorce with maria(peneolpe Cruz).The rest is all Woody Allen's magic!!!

Chrstina is dreamy, free, and spontaneous while Vicky is realistic, hard-headed yet longing at the same time. Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio is definitely sexy and pitiful while Penelope Cruz really deserved the Oscar she won for her performance in this film. This film will leave a smile on your face. A truly entertaining, light-hearted Woody Allen's creation."

","I have to point one thing out right from the start, without spoiling anything, but you might have heard something about a scene involving Penelope, Scarlett and Javier. Let me tell you, if that's your main reason for watching the movie, you will be disappointed. I didn't really expect anything from that scene, even though some magazines made a big deal out of it.<br/><br/>I was surprised though to see another woman playing a major role in this movie. She's also playing a part in the ""Frost/Nixon"" movie that came out in 2008. She's not only beautiful, but really talented. While she might not have a brand name as do the other two females playing here, she does hold the movie together.<br/><br/>Another comment/user said, that the old Woody is back. Well let's just say, the weirdness factor really went up here. You have many loose ends, you have people acting strange (as they would in normal life too?), but most importantly: They talk a lot (mostly not saying as much as they talk)! If that's not your kind of movie, than you better stay away from this. I actually did like it :o)"
"blahblahblah12345","7","1","5","12 March 2009"," Interesting film but could have been better.
","This was an enjoyable film. Penelope Cruz was fantastic (although given a bit too much credit in my opinion), as was Javier Bardem. I also found Rebecca Hall's performance to be very interesting. Having never seen any of her other work, I'm not aware of her acting style, but her constant stuttering and her precise way of speaking were perfect for the character of Vicky and really helped illustrate her intellectual side and how critical that makes her. But I'm not sure if this is simply because she was speaking through an accent. Scarlett Johansson didn't really have much to her role, nor did she add anything, but at least she serves her purpose of looking pretty. Unfortunately, she is outshined by even Patricia Clarkson in a minor supporting part. But casting aside, the film is beautiful and Barcelona is the perfect setting for the story to take place. It's a complicated love story which I found interesting, particularly the three way relationship. I actually wish this was explored more in the film."

","Vicky Christina Barcelona has Woody Allen meeting Pedro Almodovar, & if you, like myself, love both these directors, you will definitely like this movie. So here you have Woody Allen's typical style, his breezy storytelling, his dry, quick wit & he throws in dashes of Almodovar's raging passions here & there & you get a concoction that is just right. Woody Allen likes his women beautiful, yet not sexy in their truest sense, not in the wild, free sense of the term at least. Here Allen's latest muse Scarlett Johansson (who has been in all of Allen's last few films) & the equally beautiful Rebecca Hall play the two American tourists going to Barcelona for a summer where their very lives are turned around in a whirlwind of romance, emotions, romance & art. You have the very talented, very handsome Javier Bardem playing the painter Juan Antonio who is the ultimate bohemian & treats life like a piece of art, full of sensual pleasures. Then there is Almodovar's muse Penelope Cruz, playing the free spirited Maria Elena, who is consumed by the passion that drives her, often burning bright, often burning her out. There is also a scene with the very Almodovarian Spanish soirée with the protagonists being overwhelmed by the music & then falling into passion. Overall, like all Allen's movies, this one too is witty & funny, never gets preachy or boring & is completely entertaining."

","I always liked Allen and being myself Spanish and the movie being shot in Barcelona well... It was a ""must see"" to me. After 90 min I can recall is not the best movie of Allen by far. Is not the worst neither. Is like he had to made it so he threw up an average script, hired good actors and set up some ""typical Spanish"" locations and scenarios.<br/><br/>There's the mostly unnecessary voice-over narration that fills in expository gaps. C'mon Allen, you have 4 fine actors who could have done it with no needs of this voice and it would allowed to go into the characters more deeply. Dialogues are just fine speaking of Woody Allen. Not as sharp or intelligent as used to be. A master in ""Catalan Identity""? Uummm... well. And how about a master in ""butifarras""? (catalan sausage). The pretext could have been better but it doesn't actually matter. It has no relevance in the movie. <br/><br/>I have to say this movie is not about Spain or Barcelona. Barcelona is the scenario that's all. Some actors are Spanish playing Spanish. I can't understand why people is complaining about not being the real Spain what's is portrayed. This movie is about the story of one summer in Barcelona. Could be anywhere. And that's the way you have to watch it.<br/><br/>Javier(what an actor!!), Scarlett and Cruz are all good, but it is Vicky character (Rebecca Hall) who stands out giving such depth.<br/><br/>I've criticized enough this film but probably cause I expected a bit more. It has its points too. However I rarely find a film of Allen that isn't worth seeing The film is enjoyably light."

Both women end up going and falling for Juan but their paths towards him are a lot different. Things take yet another turn when Vicky gets married and Juan's ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) enters his life again. I guess it's not really fair to say I'm a tad bit disappointed considering I liked the film yet I was really hoping for more even though what's here is pretty entertaining. I get the negative stuff out of the way first and for me it was the final thirty-minutes of the movie. The way Allen kept going back and forth between the two story lines wasn't all that interesting to me and I even think Vicky's character wasn't all that well written in the second half of the film. That's really a shame because Hall is very good in her role as are the rest of the cast but it's Bardem who really steals the movie. I really loved his performance here with that Romeo like charm that he pushes on all three of the women in his life. I think he perfectly captures that sexuality he is constantly giving off but it works because of his charm as well. Johansson is making a name for herself in Allen's movies and he's once again written a very good role for her and the actress delivers. Cruz is only in the film for a handful of scenes but she's really, really good here and works excellently with Bardem. As with the recent trend in Allen's films, this one here benefits from the beautiful Spanish landscape, which certainly sets the mood for the film. Allen's choice for a music is a good one and the cinematography is nice as well. While this is an entertaining film I wouldn't call it one of the director's best."
"monimm18","8","1","5","1 September 2008"," Good, but could have been better (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","I was very excited about seeing this film. I like Woody Allen's films (well, some more than others), and the trailer looked very promising. I am sad to say that by the time I reached the end of the movie I was a bit disappointed. The story was interesting - a nice touch of character study in the mix, the acting was great, the music, images, etc., were wonderful, but the narrator killed me. Why do we need a voice over to describe the characters' mentality, when we can figure them out by simply by listening to the dialogue and watching their actions, body language, etc.? I'm sure everyone could have figured out that Vicky prefers the rigidity of an organized and regulated existence while Christina wants to be a ""free spirit"", without any additional ""book on tape"" style explanations. Why did we need a voice over to tell us things like ""Christina, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena decided to go on a bicycle trip in the country"" when we can clearly see them on bikes on a country road? I suspect Allen was aiming for a whimsically ironic/sarcastic commentary to complement and lighten up the film into a comedy, but, if that's the case, I think the sarcasm was way too light, the comments were merely stating the obvious in boringly constructed phrases. In my opinion, the narrator was a very weak point in the film, it seemed to be there to make up for any shortcomings in the direction, just in case the film was unable to depict things in a truly cinematic and comedic manner.<br/><br/>I gave the film 8 stars because of the interesting story line and, most of all, for the acting. Had it not been for the terrific performances of Penelope Cruz (give that woman an Oscar, please) and Javier Bardem, and the refreshing presence of Scarlett Johansson and Rebcca Hall (loved her), I don't think this film would have done well at all.<br/><br/>Some people compared this film with Pedro Almodovar's.

","Another anti-white movie by the little Jew Woody Allen and his young sister Letty Aronson. Like how fun is it for this Hollywood people to ridicule white people and portray them in a very awkward way that not in any way lives up to the ways of European people. Lets start with Cristina, a ""blond"" stupid half hippie girl that would never say no to sex and and acts like there is no problems in the world, just because the viewer is to perceive a picture that blond people are very shallow and would live for the moment not wanting to hurt anyone and specially themselves, like they are an empty object related to a little child. Lets head on to Vicky, the cavalier of European heritage. It seemed so until Woody and Letty found a way to make this statue of glory to something degenerated. It only took a meeting with a Spanish philander for her to transfer from a woman to a cattle or as Jews say goyim.<br/><br/>On one side we have the American women that are never happy with life and all the time seek adventures, and here with other men. And we have the American men that somehow never find out anything of what their women are up to, like they live in denial. Letting the American thing at side, as we to this point are used to Americans being portrayed like this, move on to the Spanish. It's very unpleasant to see how the Woody family portrays the Spanish as a diluted people with schizophrenic tendencies. Only reason I like the movie to a small point is that I have an open mind and can see through their ways of ridiculing our culture. And the other thing is I liked the Spanish theme as I have an interest in Spanish culture, other than that, this flick should get an anti-hate ban towards white people."

"neil-476","7","1","6","19 February 2009"," But what happened after that?
","Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie: I wouldn't want to give the impression that the reservations which follow mean that I didn't.<br/><br/>Vicky Cristina Barcelona is essentially a drama, even though the plot sounds more like a French farce - Vicky (Rebecca Hall, tightly controlled, life on a strictly predetermined plan) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson, chaotic free spirit) are students, lifelong friends who go to Barcelona for the summer prior to Vicky marrying fiancé Doug that autumn. They are propositioned by charismatic artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem): Vicky is appalled but Cristina happily goes along with it. Before their liaison is consummated, however Cristina falls sick, at which point Vicky suddenly and unexpectedly drops all her defences along with her knickers and enjoys a night of passion with Juan Antonio. This is strictly a one-off, and Juan Antonio resumes with Cristina at a later date. At this point, his ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) arrives on the scene following a suicide attempt. Juan Antonio and Maria Elena are inextricably bound together: soulmates who cannot live without each other, but cannot live together either. It turns out that Cristina is the essential catalyst in their relationship, and they fall into a three-way relationship which works. By this time Doug has arrived in Barcelona and he and Vicky have had a quickie wedding despite the fact that her one night stand with Juan Antonio has lit something of a fire in her. Cristina tells Juan Antonio and Maria Elena that while the relationship may work for them, it's not what she wants, so she goes off for a couple of weeks to find herself. They fall back into old ways and Maria Elena steams off after another row. Vicky visits Juan Antonion to try to scratch the itch he has created: before they can do so, Maria Elena appears and shoots Vicky in the hand. The two girls and Doug go back to the US.<br/><br/>The film has a very strong sense of its Spanish location, and all the cast are attractive and perform well, particularly Penelope Cruz, whose Maria Elena who is either excessively emotional or else mildly disturbed.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with this movie was the lack of resolution. The characters are interesting and the dynamics between them are entertaining, but not that plausible. To then be served up with a realistic ending - in that everyone simply gets on with their lives with no resolution to any of the arcs which are set up and pursued - is, I felt, cheating the expectations of the audience.<br/><br/>The other problem I had was that all the main American characters - both girls, Doug, the narrator, and Patricia Clarkson as host Judy - all delivered speeches at different points by way of Woody Allen impressions. The aping of Allen's distinctive stammering self-deprecating delivery was so marked that it can only have been intentional, and it was so out of place each time that it pulled me out of the movie."

","Conventional wisdom suggests that when an American recipe is adapted into a Latin-style dish, the resulting feast should be a bit more exotic, thanks to spices, salsa, peppers and a greater tolerance by Latins for that which is decidedly hotter. Certainly, that was the promise that came with Woody Allen's first attempt at making a movie in Spain. The buzz heralding the American premiere of VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA had it that the film would include a daring ""menage a trois"" featuring Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, with an added incentive being a particularly titillating liplock between Scarlett and Penelope. But anyone taken in by such advance P.R. would have done well to recall the similar word-of-mouth that preceded Stanley Kubrick's achingly over-hyped EYES WIDE SHUT, another artsy epic that promised taboo-busting sexuality from a director with no prior skill for, or interest in, any sort of erotica.<br/><br/>As it happens, Cruz and Johansson do smooch a quickie, but really do nothing that Madonna wouldn't try on an awards show. And other than this kiss, the sexuality in the film is low-key at best and simply off screen most of the time. We have to take Johansson's word that there is a ""trois"" in this ""menage,"" because Woody certainly doesn't show much of anything that might be considered shocking.<br/><br/>Indeed, the decor may be contemporary Latin, but the cuisine itself is warmed over specials from the Woodman's standard deli menu. It is Manhattan-lite -- and low-cal at that. That's not to say that VCB isn't edible, just a bit familiar. A serving of pseudo-intellectual chatter, a heaping helping of romantic dissatisfaction with a side order of indecision, all sweetened with witty one-liners and a gentle sprinkle of cynicism. VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA is one of Allen's better recent efforts, but it tastes strangely pre-packaged and microwave ready.<br/><br/>Twenty-somethings Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Johansson) take a vacation in Barcelona to see the sights and to ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" over the art work at the museums. But they hardly get their bags unpacked before they are approached by a famous painter named Juan Antonio (Bardem), who invites them to fly off to another Spanish city for a weekend threeway. Cristina eagerly says yes, while Vicky reluctantly tags along. The threeway tryst doesn't quite come off -- carnally speaking, but eventually it is the already-engaged Vicky who ends up doing a one-nighter with Juan Antonio. But Cristina hangs in there and soon moves in with the artist. Juan Antonio's homicidal/suicidal ex-wife, Maria Elena (Cruz) suddenly shows up as well. Complicated love triangles are promised, but Allen's script only sets up romantic complications that he has no interest in resolving. This is a film made up mostly of propositions and exposition and precious little copulation.<br/><br/>As for making the film in Barcelona, that springs less from artistic inspiration and more from financial convenience. There's little here that couldn't have happened in Woody's old stomping grounds of Manhattan. Other than a few music selections and some fiery conversation between Bardem and Cruz (who steal the movie), there is little on hand to remind the viewer that the movie was filmed in Spain. Even the totally unnecessary (and annoying) narration is provided by a stern male Anglo voice. And for that matter, this is a film with two female protagonists, so why doesn't it have a female narrator? Possibly Woody didn't even think about it -- indeed, the narration seems like a dramatic shortcut to avoid putting too much effort into actually filming extra scenes.<br/><br/>As always, VCB is a polished production: the acting is solid, much of the dialogue crisp and the look of the film is slick and professional. But the whole thing is so uninspired. Even within his relatively narrow range of interests, Allen's movies have long been remarkably inventive and he has stubbornly tried to avoid the cliché. Now, he is falling back on his own clichés, doing nothing more than the bare minimum to get the job done. Efficiency is not necessarily a virtue. And though Woody seems to be covering new territory with his recent extended European vacation, the ground he covers isn't dramatic, only geographic."

","""An easy attainment makes love contemptible; a difficult one makes it more dear."" ""Nothing prevents a woman from being loved by two men, or a man from being loved by two women."" From The Art of Courtly Love by Andreas Capellanus (Late 12th Century) <br/><br/>The Woodman has found a home, and it's not Manhattan. After a brief time in London, Woody Allen has landed in Spain, Barcelona to be precise, and he is more lyrical than he has ever been before with his new romance, Vicky Cristina Barcelona. <br/><br/>The film and the city allow the director to be young and creative, attributes in short supply for most artists on the short side of 70. This light-hearted but philosophical romantic comedy deconstructs love in all its maddening irony only to end just as romantically as it began. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) visit Barcelona with very different attitudes toward romance, Vicky a pragmatist engaged to be married and Cristina a wandering sybarite in search of love. <br/><br/>As if in some medieval allegory, they meet love in the form of painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who woos them both and other desirable young things as if they were the very life of his art, as if he could not live without their sensuality. They all find a restlessness where nothing can satisfy like the love they can't have. Medieval courtly love as codified by Andreas Cappelanus comes to mind (see above), in which unfulfilled love is the only romantic love. <br/><br/>Vicky Cristina Barcelona is framed by a narrator who lends an almost travelogue feel to the proceedings as he explicates and narrates what we don't see on screen. Although I usually favor a narrator's insight, a colleague reminds me her creative writing class warned to show, not tell. She may be right in this case even though the lilting pace mitigates the depressing role of infidelity with the major players. <br/><br/>The cinematography is as lush as Juan's lovers, who are capped by the older but far richer character, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). Allen also peppers his backgrounds with Gaudi, the Catalan architect who even more than Miro represents the romantic spirit of Spanish art and individualism. <br/><br/>Although Allen doesn't have the answer to what women want as Chaucer did, he comes closer with his Three Graces--Vicky, Cristina,and Maria."

","I was pretty reluctant to watch this movie given that I don't care for most of the actors and I hadn't heard good things about it from the people in Barcelona, where I live. After watching it I can say that I found the movie entertaining and well made, but in many aspects I do agree with the Catalans and their complaints. Most of all, I would really like people to know, and I am an American who has been living in Cataluña for the last 20 years, that the beautiful and welcoming city you see in the movie is complete fiction. Barcelona's habitants, who speak a language called Catalan, are mostly poor and can't afford the many luxuries most tourists think. I know artists of all kinds, but not one who could afford to live on the money earned from it. Neither Javier Bardem nor Penelope are Catalans, which bothered some people, but most of the Catalans I know were more concerned with the fact that Bardem's character is from Oviedo, yet Vicky, who studies the Catalan identity (her one reason for visiting Barcelona), says she's interested in him because he's Catalan. Anyone who knows about Catalan identity should know that you are not Catalan just because you live in Cataluña. My husband was born in Barcelona, yet the Catalans consider him an outsider, because his parents are from the south. I understand that as American tourists, Vicky and Cristina are more interested in seeing the popular sights, but it would have been OK to show the real side of Barcelona, the heroin junkies (1% of the population, also the most common cause of death), the crime (mostly thieves), the very poor immigrants, etc... <br/><br/>That aside, there are many things I did like about the film. As with all Of Mr. Allen's movies, you find incredibly witty dialog and interesting characters who will surely entertain you for the duration of the film. But the best thing about the movie, and this surprises even me, is Penelope Cruz as Maria Elena. I'm usually not a fan of her films or her acting, but she really outdid herself and was more alive than most of her costars. I'm tempted to have her ""Niñata de mierda!"" scream as my ringtone."

","Lots of positive reports about this one coupled with 'his best for ages' squibs perhaps oversold this one. There are several pluses; the location shooting that stops just short of being a valentine to Barcelona, the really fine performance from Rebecca Hall, the not bad performances from Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz but against this we must balance the wooden performance that teeters on the edge of being embarrassing from Scarlett Johanson and the woeful lack of the one-liners that tend to define a Woody Allen movie. The arabesque performed by the several lovers both old and new is mildly interesting but ultimately says nothing new nor does it add anything to the sum of knowledge on the subject.

Meanwhile, Johansson has to deal with Bardem's crazy ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), who is invited back home after a suicide attempt. The story, though perhaps overcomplicated, is a good one. Unfortunately, Allen kind of spoils it by including a bland voice-over narration that over-explains the plot. The narration distances the audience from the action, and the film started to drag for me. And in the end, it felt like nothing much had happened. I didn't care and I doubt the movie will remain long in my memory. However, that's not to say that it's a bad movie. It's a moderate failure for the long-suffering Allen, but it's a success for most of the actors. In particular, I think Penelope Cruz's performance should be considered award-worthy. It'll probably be worth catching on DVD, but I wouldn't especially recommend you be in any rush."
"isantistao","10","0","1","31 December 2019"," One Of The Most Honest & Intelligent Movies About Love, Romance & Relationships
","As a man, I am obviously not a fan of romance movies like women are. The reasons why most men do not enjoy them are obvious, most of them are made for women, thus they pander to women and make the movies all too girly, and in addition they make them unintelligent and cliche and generic.<br/><br/>This movie is the opposite of all of that. While it is romantic in its use of artwork, it is not girly. It is a highly intelligent, sophisticated and brutally honest look at romance, love and relationships, the way we experience it in the real world of dating, not the way most hollywood movies portray.<br/><br/>Of course you need a film mastermind like Woody Allen to portray this. And this, to me as a film buff, is his masterpiece. I consider this to be his best film. It is so eloquently written and directed. Some films are works of art. But this is fine art.<br/><br/>And he couldn't do it without the all star cast he lines up for it however. Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz and Scarlette Johansen star in this film in some of the most lovable roles of their careers.<br/><br/>And this film goes where no other films dare to go, at least not seriously (some late night comedies do, but in a comical way, this of course is different). This film explores the very complicated concept of polyamory and its complex dynamics. That is dating multiple people at the same time. For in this film 3 women fall in love with the same man, each with a different type of relationship with him, and each other. As a social scientist this movie was a delightful exploration of the social dynamics in dating and relationships.<br/><br/>And the romantic artistic portrayal of the depth of these emotional situations and relationships and the complexity of it all is just so charming. Especially with the narration. But this movie is not just a feel good movie. It exposes all of the parts of love and these relationship dynamics that most of us people who believe in love, (especially us polyamorists who believe in it in abundance), do not like to talk about and face.<br/><br/>Through the characters having to process their own romantic feelings, it helps you to process them as well. Something most dumbed down romance movies just do not offer you. Nor do they offer you the level of art that this one does as well. So this is a movie that any Romance genre loving female will like, but which any intelligent man will enjoy as well.<br/><br/>In fact I believe this is the best romance film ever made. An easy 10. And a must see for any film lover."

They get into things that drive them to act in ways they don't usually. Yes, the men are boring, but that's just a factor. Most people are boring and we marry them and do the best we can.

","Woody Allen is one of those directors that either we love or hate. I confess, I am the exception: I don't like nor hate, I've never had much contact with his films. This film was, probably, the first of his work I saw from beginning to end, and I liked it. It has a somewhat unrealistic but acceptable script in which two American girls get involved with the same man during a summer trip to Barcelona. Both are dissatisfied with their love life for different reasons: Vicky attaches great value to commitment but needs passion to support it; Cristina is very passionate but she cannot be in a relationship because she always feels something missing. In this duality lies the great criticism the film makes to the emptiness of American society, described as very conservative and worried with appearances. On the other side the Spanish Juan Antonio and Maria Elena, a former couple whose love is deep and destructive to the point of not being able to live without melodramatic fights. Through them, Allen seems to criticize the way of being of European society, described as being very liberal. The whole movie is a clash of mindsets of different people, representing very different civilizations and different ways of facing love.<br/><br/>Of course, this is all based on Woody Allen's own views. I, for example, have a very different idea of ​​what Europeans and Americans are like, and I don't think they are so different. We must not forget that American society has been shaped in the image of Europe. Never has Europe seemed to me as liberal and open-minded as the film suggests, and even Latin countries (like my own) are quite conservative, partly because of religious issues, although its also true that they're becoming more liberal (maybe too much). But this only proves that these ideas are points of view, debatable and subjective. Either way, the way the characters behave is very interesting, creating situations that are very hilarious. The narrator works well and has an excellent voice. Concerning the actors, they're all big names. Bardem and Cruz, however, deserve special applause for the way they ended up standing out, starring in some of the funniest scenes. Rebecca Hall did a good job in the role of conventional Vicky, giving her special psychological depth from which she falls in love. Scarlett Johansson fulfilled her role, not surprisingly but also without disappointment. She was OK most of the time. A note of praise still for the very careful cinematography and for the choice of filming locations, who knew how to take advantage of the landscapes and tourist icons that we associate with the Catalan capital.<br/><br/>Intelligent, beautiful, passionate, romantic, elegant... there would be several adjectives for this film. It's not enough to shut up those who hate Woody Allen but, for those like me, who are not familiar with his work, it's enough to give him more attention from now on."

These are also important factors I wasn't aware of, while rating the movie in its entirety. <br/><br/>The reason that matters, at least for me is that, the lack of that knowledge purged all bias and left only, pure and honest opinion.<br/><br/>I'm not a Woody Allen fan at all, and I rated this film 6/10 not knowing it was directed by him, which showed me that yeah, I'm actually, not all that fond of Woody Allen's films.<br/><br/>However, as for Penelope Cruz, I found her incredibly stunning in this movie. She embodied the character almost as if it were her own experiences. Without knowing she won an Oscar for this role, I find it now, as no surprise that she did.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson played their parts wonderfully also.<br/><br/>I did find the film a bit predictable perhaps, though some parts, Woody took a path I didn't expect, perhaps because I didn't quite agree with it; like Vicky seemingly feeling no remorse for what she did, but felt ambivalence rather. Also, if it weren't for Penelope's performance, this film would've lost me some 40 minutes in, even with Scarlett.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an interesting take on love and relationships...

","Another movie about the boring Americans coming to Europe and having freak summer adventures. The choice of Spain rather than France is good because that kind of boring life would not be workable in France. <br/><br/>So what Woody Allen is trying to experiment? I would say it is about a man centered love relations with several women. He tries to explore the feelings of women in these relations. A kind of perfect monogamy of man. Perverted relations for artistic creativity? well it is a kind of cliché nowadays, one never knows. <br/><br/>Forcing each other to speak English for the sake of Americans is one of the elements that Woody Alan is exploring. It is not a killing demand for the sake of your rival, the director tries to explore the divergence and difficulty in the relations.<br/><br/>One of the visible message of the film is the fact that they tell the right feelings and the truths right away. Actually this is a growing sentiment of Hollywood nowadays. Without lying or cheating the partner people rather prefer telling their right feeling, which is good ad educating some humans at least."

Whether we are comfortable with the idea or not, the things expressed here exist: relationships beyond strict monogamy, and beyond cheating. The human emotion can know many kinds of love and many kinds of desire, and a handful are explored here (though not nearly as many as in Allen's classic film on bestiality).<br/><br/>If you are going to have a seductive Spanish man, clearly it must be Javier Bardem.

She is either incredibly stupid or blind or something as this is a great way to disappear into the slave trade or turn up dead. Secondly, the Vicky character - wow, engaged,, still sleeps with the guy, and basically screws over her new husband. Nothing redeeming there, but at the end she says she is 'over it', thus eliminating all her guilt. Finally the narration in this film was way over the top. I know Woody likes to use narration in most of his films, but in some scenes it was like watching those television shows that have audio for the visually impaired. I don't need to have a narrator describing what I'm looking at. For example, you see Christina on her own, walking down a street and taking photos, and the narrator says, ""Christin spent the day taking photos."" Well,, no kidding! I found the narration very frustrating. You could eliminate totally and not miss it at all. But all in all I did like the film."

"TheLittleSongbird","8","0","2","19 April 2014"," Very impressive Woody Allen film...
","Though definitely not for all tastes, depending on whether you relate to the characters and the story. Woody Allen has done better than Vicky Cristina Barcelona, especially Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanours, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Husbands and Wives, but it is one of his better films in the past 15 years(very hit-and-miss at this point) along with Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine. Vicky Cristina Barcelona isn't perfect, it has a very abrupt ending but most problematic was the narration, which was completely pointless and it does feel patronising when you're been told what's happening like little schoolchildren- that's how it was delivered anyway- when it is being shown very clearly. There is no personal bias against narration, providing they move the story forward, but not when it adds nothing and just succeeds in over-explaining things like it does here. However, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is beautifully filmed and the locations are just gorgeous, making you wish you were there in Barcelona. The music score is both relaxing and infectious, and Allen's direction is accomplished. The film is brilliantly written narration aside, the dialogue is witty and thoughtful, by all means it doesn't break new ground but it still has a lot to say and does so in an entertaining and honest way. The story is a slow-burner but the way the characters interact and the way the relationships develop make it a largely compelling one at the same time, complex they are too and while the situations are fairly sensitive in the first place they are relatable as well. The characters are stereotypical(but mostly not that crudely, though judging from what I've read people will disagree with that) and typically neurotic but as is also typical of Allen they are very real as well. The acting is never less than very good, Patricia Clarkson standing out in support but the four leads dominate and all four impress. Penelope Cruz steals the show, she's rarely been lovelier and she always has been a beautiful woman, she is very funny and is fully immersed into the drama. Her scenes with Javier Bardem are among the film's best scenes. Bardem is effortlessly sexy that you completely understand the attraction, and he does very well at being sympathetic and seductive. Rebecca Hall plays a conflicted character and somehow succeeds in making her likable, her accent is fine. Scarlett Johansson is not as good as the other three, having to play the character that we in a way relate to the least but she is very sultry and compassionate and doesn't look uncomfortable at all. In conclusion, not among Allen's best films but very impressive stuff. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","Another crap for the so-called master: I really wonder why he has such good praises with having so little values and craft. Maybe his secret is his casting of such big names, attractive actress so they get him untouchable (as it will need a lot of courage to acknowledge that those big names doesn't equal talent!).<br/><br/>But first, Allen is really a limited, poor technician: in spite he's filming on locations, in Spain, in summer, he feels obliged to use a awful orange cinematography that really destroy all the colors, all the charm of reality! Next, his use of voice-over is the proof that he can't tell his story or put it visually. If we have to hear this voice to know what happens, to understand the feeling of his characters, it means that his screenplay isn't ready or his directing is lacking.<br/><br/>In addition, Allen lives in such a closed, elitist world i that I really wonder what he can tell me about life and love. In other world, his stories lack cruelly of humanity: his characters are always the same stereotypes: rich, privileged families that really don't know what's working (they are artists!) or what's love: they hunger for lust, they confound sex and passion, they are valueless, instead of resolving their problems and respecting commitments, they talk to shrinks and start affairs. They call themselves successful, libertine, free spirit and i call them exploiters, perverts, lecherous. Maybe they crave for art, but it's rather an excuse for drink and sex. In a way, this is the same stupid handle in relationships that Americans know when they want to talk about queer: one day, the straight character wakes up and goes with its gender. Here, it's the soon to be married character who wants another love! <br/><br/>So, salvaged locations, empty story and characters: i was just left with what i started writing: big names: i have nothing to say about the pale, lascivious Johansson.

The structure of the movie, the narrator, the time line and the settings are quite good, and the places are astonishingly beautiful. The plot is the only thing that doesn't quite fit. The idea of a love triangle being faced in such a natural way, when there are such extraordinary circumstances, is just not natural.

","I love this movie because shows undermined the foundations of the family in today's society, just like the Match Point. Life based on feelings,Lust and Inner desires... Woody Allen works admirably in this area. But the brilliance of Woody's work is limited to only a few films... Allen's works often involved his political and racial ideas and this is a drawback . This movie can be a challenge to the so-called betrayal. For example, We see a middle-aged woman who initially appeared to be committed to his wife and.... also end of movie. But the film can not be a perfect movie and there are some problems compared with a powerful film like Match point. Sense that while watching the film, the viewer is transported is a carnality sense, Instead of a sense of excitement that is necessary to movie.

'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' does the same for the Catalan city, with the added proviso that it's not even made by a local, but by Woody Allen. So it's a view that uses Barcelona (and its stereotypes) as a backdrop while concentrating on two very American characters, and completely uninterested in, say, the difference between Catalonia and Spain (which is a fairly essential thing in Barcelona) or indeed any other hint of authenticity. Allen is of course famous for making films about people obsessing over their sex lives, but in this film, where everyone is (without exception) rich, beautiful, talented and essentially unemployed, it's a good job that they do - they certainly don't have any real concerns to engage them. This film was celebrated as a return to form by its veteran director, and it has a certain style, but it has absolutely nothing to say about life as lived by real people in Barcelona, or elsewhere."

","To call it a masterpiece or a Woody Allen classic would be a major stretch. What it is is a satisfying and fitting conclusion to Woody's European vacation from himself, which started with Match Point and continued with Scoop and Cassandra's Dream. Its major weakness is that it's simply not a Woody Allen original, but a homage to cinema that he loves. For that reason it still feels less authentic to me than even the more mediocre of his classic pieces. But considering the staleness of some of his recent New York movies, I feel he did the right thing by taking this much needed break. And having recently seen the wonderful Whatever Works, I'd say that it worked and he's now ready to return to 'real' Woody Allen films.<br/><br/>That's not to say that Vicky Cristina Barcelona is not an effective and entertaining film by its own right. It's sensual and emotional like few of his movies ever were, and it's incredibly beautiful. A lot of the credit should go to the actors. Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson, both among my favorite actors, do a commendable job, but Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall are the real surprises here, and they're the ones who really dominate the movie. With phenomenal acting like that, coupled with sharp dialog and beautiful cinematography, it's a very enjoyable, though somewhat forgettable watch - despite some flaws like the narration and annoying music.<br/><br/>On a side note - while stylistically little of what goes on here is original Woody Allen, his themes are all over, and it's no accident that the phrase 'whatever works' slips out of Rebecca Hall's mouth - the connection to the film that has that title is obvious. Knowing now that Whatever Works was a script in work for over a decade, it's conceivable that Woody decided to lead up to it in this more escapist film. Viewing both films as a double-feature, it's easy to conceive it to be another attempt from Woody - as he did try (successfully) in Crimes and Misdemeanors and (not successfully) Melinda and Melinda - to tell the same tale twice, as a comedy and as a tragedy. And viewed like that, it almost actually works."
"cherold","7","0","1","3 January 2012"," Good movie partially undone by terrible narration
","I almost stopped watching this movie at the 10 minutes mark. That first ten minutes was pretty much nothing but a narration of events by someone who sounded like he was doing a Power Point presentation on economics. I don't know why Allen felt the film needed a bland American narrator, but he did. The truth is, Allen himself would have been a far better choice; when he speaks, he sounds like he means something by it.<br/><br/>The narration, of which there is a great deal, is also almost entirely unnecessary; you could cut it out all of the movie and you would still know pretty much was going on. The narrator says nothing about the characters that you can't glean from their actions, and I would think Allen has been around long enough to have heard of ""show don't tell.""<br/><br/>However, since my girlfriend said she loved the movie I decided to keep going, and once the narrator took a pause and the characters started talking, they were pretty interesting (in fact, more interesting than the glib assessments given by the narrator). The story has the typically messy romantic tangles Allen is so fond of and it's interesting to see it play out. The actors are all very good, each making their characters likable. Sure, everyone in the movie is little more than a stereotype (tempestuous Spanish woman, free spirit, over- planned American), but the actors make these characters more interesting than they really are.<br/><br/>While neither deep nor especially effecting, the movie is, when the narrator isn't speaking, quite charming, offering a romantic vision of Spain and a story that keeps moving even if not a lot ever happens. Cut out the narrator and it would probably deserve to be rated one star higher."

","I have never been a Woody Allen fan, but this film was different for me. Shooting in the style it was done, with deep warm pastel effects, contributed to an overall dreamy surrealism, compounded by the art and artistry than runs through the film as a theme, that immersed me from the beginning.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough - a take on the eternal love triangle - but far more complex than the usual 3 person affair, and instead creates triangles, and triangles and triangles. Making the triangles even more interesting is some very good, and some brilliant, acting.<br/><br/>Bardem is an extremely talented actor, and he delivers the performance that Allen expects from him. He is operating at all times ""in the zone"" of his character, but one would expect no less from him.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannsen get's better as the movie progresses, but the main force of her performance comes from the directors development of the character that she plays, as she progresses from a girl to a woman, sure of herself and the most happy of all the characters, by the end of the film.<br/><br/>The real star of the film is Rebecca Hall though. Her performance is absolute art of acting. The nuances and subtleties of her characters every whim and emotion are brilliantly conveyed by this character actor who deserves many more roles. Rebecca is not a stunningly beautiful woman, and perhaps that helps her work harder to catch the eye. Her character did not appear to be acting - the viewer is drawn directly into her conflicts and desires, and ultimate choices.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz is a good actor, but the role is almost too easy for her. She is Spanish, and she plays the emotional Spanish relationship ""spoiler"". I think Allen would have been better served by a less well-known actress for this character. Penelope Cruz is just far too predictable for the role of Maria Elena.<br/><br/>The other cast members do an adequate job in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>Allen develops the story beautifully; it grows and grows, and slowly the viewer gets sucked into the story. However, for the story to be a great one, it needs a beginning, a middle and an ending. We got the beginning and the middle, but the end was extremely abrupt, compounded by the abruptness of the narrators final words to us. Whether this was due to the editor, or the director, I do not know, but I would have felt far more comfortable if the ending had been more fleshed out; the same result would have been fine, it was just delivered too suddenly, as though the movie had run out of time and needed to be stopped immediately.<br/><br/>Overall, I would watch the film again, though."

","This is quintesensial Almodovar. I've always noticed how much in common the Woody Allen and Pedro Almodovar have in common and no picture conveys it as well as when Allen goes into his Spanish counterparts territory filming a movie in Barcelona of all places.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Allen the comparison between the two doesn't speak too well of the New Yorker as the plot, the dialogue and the script in general seems to be taken from a forgotten Almodovar drawer full of his artistic failures.<br/><br/>Two best friends - the proper Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and the adventurous Christina (Scarlett Johannson) go on the ultimate holiday to Barcelona, Spain. This is to be their last adventure before Vicky gets married to the ultimate catch - rich and well bred Doug (Chris Messina). Touring Barcelona the two come upon a seemingly narcissistic famous painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem), who offers them a proposal only a fiery Spaniard could make - fly with me to Oviedo, where the three of us will have luscious sex. Christina is quick to agree, but Vicky just comes for the company. One thing leads to another and...<br/><br/>At times funny the movie watches more like a light comedy. But there is no real flair to the movie or sense of purpose with a pathetic performance from constantly lip-playing Scarlett Johannson. A stand-out performance is made by the Almodovar actress Penelope Cruz, but this is far from one of her better roles, especially in Spanish cinema.<br/><br/>All in all a movie I would only recommend to die-hard Woody Allen fans, but apart from that it is essentially forgettable."

"ferdinand1932","6","0","4","16 January 2011"," Henry James in Barcelona
","Woody Allen has contrived a contemporary version of a Henry James or Edith Wharton story of Americans in Europe. Like those two great American writers it hinges on polarities. The Americans are opposite of the Europeans, in this case Spanish, it leads to humor, misunderstanding and occasionally something illuminating in the way each society behaves. It also tends to rely on cliché, a word Allen employs often as criticism, but it is present here, although it is a sophisticated cliché.<br/><br/>Just like James and Wharton the exposition of American morals, in all spheres, and with it, a wry critique of American philistinism is engaging. Vicky is all puritan accomplishments and rational objectives; Cristina is adventurous, and as the pompous husband of Vicky says, she is contemptuous of the American bourgeois life-plan. <br/><br/>The criticism of philistinism is apparent in the lifeless and materialistic way the American characters talk: the house they have Vicky and Doug have planned for instance, but mostly it is in the foreignness and otherness of art in Barcelona, they must acquire, possess, learn about it, it in a way that is absurd to the Spanish who live with it. The father poet of Juan Antonio who will not publish anything as an example of an artistic life lived without the materialist aim of money and book sales. It's an American stereotype of a European, which is just another but fancier cliché. And the tempestuous relationship between Juan Antonio and Maria Elena is an extended Latin stereotype that might have been taken from an olive oil commercial.<br/><br/>The most curious feature to the film is the voice over, written with care in real prose. Again, it might have been take from James. While it adds layers to characters and insights into the drama beyond the camera, it distances the actions on-screen and betrays their motives. At the end it almost cheats the audience of what they have sat through."
"Red-125","7","0","3","22 December 2010"," Sense and Sensibility in Barcelona
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) was written and directed by Woody Allen. Allen's movies almost always feature a beautiful woman. This movie features three beautiful women, all of whom swirl around macho Javier Bardem. The plot reprises ""Sense and Sensibility."" Two friends visit Spain for the summer. Rebecca Hall, as Vicky, is reserved and cerebral. Scarlett Johansson as Cristina is outgoing and looking for adventure. They both get involved with Juan Antonio (Bardem), a brilliant painter and, no doubt, a brilliant lover. Into the mix Allen brings Penelope Cruz, Juan Antonio's ex-wife. She screams, she cries, she throws things. And yet, Juan Antonio can never really fall out of love with her.<br/><br/>There's lots of hopping in and out of bed, and lots of talk about hopping in and out of bed. However, the picture is PG-13, so there's not much sex on screen. Instead there are great shots of Barcelona and the small city of Orviedo in Asturias. <br/><br/>This film isn't much if you sit down and analyze it, but when you're watching it, it keeps your attention. I've never been wild about Scarlett Johansson as an actor, and Penelope Cruz relies too much on her beauty, and too little on her talent. However, I really admire Rebecca Hall whose tall elegance makes the other two women look tawdry.<br/><br/>I saw this film on DVD, and it worked well. Note: there's a howler in the movie. Vicky is supposed to be doing graduate work on Catalan culture, but she doesn't speak Spanish. Allen could have pulled this off by saying, ""She only speaks Catalan."" He didn't bother. What is Vicky doing in the library when we see her with a book in her hand? Looking at the pictures?"

","Give me Barcelona and especially Gaudi's architecture as a set for a film and I will be happy (and given how Woody Allen filmed it I guess he loves it as much as I do). Give me some Spanish dialogues to hear and try to understand and I will be happy. Give me Scarlett Johansson as one of the main actresses and I will be happy. Is it still necessary to say I am happy with Vicky Christina Barcelona, where indeed Barcelona is the third character rather than Maria Elena? More deeply, give me some young women questioning their own definition of love and I will be happy, as (sadly?) I am still looking for it and questioning the reality of a good balance between stability and passion (yes emotionally I am mature as a teenager, I know). But make them go back to their life without having progressed from an inch and I am not happy anymore. I wasn't asking for Vicky to jump from a stable husband to a crazy artist, but scared people can't stay scared. I wasn't asking for Christina to find her definition of what she wants from love, but running away people can't go on running-away. In fact people can't stay how they are, whoever they are; personal development IS lifespan for god sake! OK, maybe I am harsh and I could think their Spanish interlude will influence them at some point. But this is really not the feeling I have; especially when Judy appears, walking with the husband she doesn't love anymore, I don't really take this as a clue of evolution. Hence there is a more global feeling at the end, where as a European I feel like Americans consider the old continent (and especially the Southern one) as just a playground to test their philosophy of life before going back to it, a place where you can live some craziness before living a serious life in America. Annoying because simplistic and categorical, annoying because this relies on the assumption that you can't have both, some craziness and some seriousness."

","Some critics have praised the use of a voice-over narrator in the film, while others, like James Berardinelli, have condemned it. The truth is that it's neither here nor there. Yes, there are moments when it is needlessly recapitulative, but others where it makes for handy elisions of superfluous moments. The voice of Welch, though, is perhaps too much like a young Woody Allen's, and given that Hall's Vicky is clearly the designated neurotic Woody character, this vocal affinity of Welch's subliminally biases the viewer toward feeling a certain way toward Vicky that otherwise might not exist- i.e.- it makes the screenplay seem more about Vicky because she is seen as the Woody character- pro or con, depending on the viewer's preconceptions of the real life Allen and his neurotic on screen characterizations. The film's strongest point, however, is its anti-climactic ending, wherein all the characters return to where they were. If only the rest of the film were as spare and poetic, then Vicky Cristina Barcelona would have been a film that could be argued for greatness.<br/><br/>As for the actors, the best performance was likely given by Bardem, although he also had the least complicated part- the slimeball user (best described by Vicky as a 'charmingly candid wifebeater'). Hall and Messina actually had good chemistry together, which made a viewer wonder why Vicky would give a damn about the slimy Juan, except for the obvious; that Allen was pandering to the Lowest Common Denominator Hollywood ideal of romantic love (being in love) somehow being better than true love (being loved). Scarlett Johansson was again misused by Allen. Her best role was in Allen's light comedy, Scoop, where she proved to be quite an adept comedienne- surpassed in the Allen pantheon of female comic talents only by Diane Keaton. But where this idea arose of her as a sex symbol is mystifying. She's simply a rather average looking young woman, far more suited to the girl next door roles that would have once gone to Donna Reed or Doris Day than the roles she gets, which would have once gone to Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield. It's truly mystifying, as Johansson simply lacks the sexual 'It' factor. But, worst of all is Penelope Cruz. Putting aside the character's stereotypes, I have seen her in a handful of films and a) she cannot act (despite claims that she is far better in Spanish language films than English ones, for over 50% of her role here is in Spanish), and b) like Johansson, she is almost always cast as a sex bomb, despite the fact that she's just an average looking woman and, in this film, looks scrawny, if not outright anorexic. Despite, at times looking like a younger, prettier Mackenzie Phillips, the best looking female in the film, by far, is Rebecca Hall, the least known of the trio. She also is, easily, the best actress.<br/><br/>The film also benefits from some great cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, and by that I do not mean merely that Barcelona was beautiful to look at. There are numerous well framed shots, and shots from interesting angles, such as when Cristina and Maria go around the city photographing sights and people. Aguirresarobe is not a cinematographer I've seen the work of before, but after this film, and given his great surname, his is work I will look for in the future, despite whatever director he works with in the future. It is because of the strengths of the film (the cinematography, Bardem's and Hall's performances, the sometimes great deployment of ellipses and narration) that I can recommend Vicky Cristina Barcelona as, at least, a good way to spend a couple of hours in filmic revery. Don't expect a masterpiece from Allen's Golden Age, and you will do OK. Go in thinking it's another Hollywood Ending, though, and you will end the film smiling. Given the lows of some of Allen's work post-Golden Age, that's as close to a rave as you will find, at least from me."

","Vicky Christina Barcelona fits well into the ""Woody abroad"" genre that comprises pretty much any Woody Allen film not made in New York (correction: not made in Manhattan). Spain is a series of attractive tourist views, Spanish people are either having sex, looking steamy or gustating in a sexy way, so watch out any bland, parboiled American ingenues that happen to fall into this fragrant and meaty broth. <br/><br/>The film starts with the arrival of the eponymous heroines in the same city, all of which is told to us by a flat, sardonic narration that continues through the film, giving an air of Lars von Trier's Dogville to the piece: whatever happens on-screen is provided with a stark, dismissive description, the effect of which is to distance the action (which is schematic at best) even further from the viewer. <br/><br/>What does happen is an absurd intertwining of lusts, doubts and desires, which tease tall moody Vicky and blonde sexpot Christina into a frenzy around the irredeemably macho presence of Javier Bardem. As such it's not a bad effort: the girls loosen up under the Spanish sun, and Bardem hams it up as the unshaven, bacchanalian stereotype of masculinity. But the whole operation is so diagrammatic and so undercut by the cruel narration that you have to start wondering what Woody really thinks that he is doing. <br/><br/>That only really becomes apparent when Penelope Cruz hits the screen and saves the film. My god, I am really turning into a big Cruz fan. She seems to be capable of doing anything, saving anything, and here, as Bardem's ex-wife she breaks through the film's study of types with a performance that is as ridiculous as it is riveting. Somehow, despite her unbelievably exaggerated manner, she seems to be the only real person on the screen, while the others are just playing their parts. <br/><br/>So the film keeps going, people do stuff and the narrator's deadpan, snarky manner reminds us that it's all ridiculous, all pretty pointless really. When the film does finish, the statement it makes appears to be pretty bleak too. Vicky returns to America, to live with the husband that she does not love, Christina goes back too, still searching, having been unable to find satisfaction, even in a pre-lapsarian menage a trois. <br/><br/>I might be completely wrong, but it seems that the wider point that Woody is making is pretty unfavourable about his fellow Americans: Barcelona offers both girls a glimpse of how life can be, and both of them are too scared to seize it. The Spanish people in the film (who are of course cartoon Spaniards) by contrast carry on with their crazed, passion-filled existences. They might not be very happy, but they are very much alive. <br/><br/>I have to declare that I'm a very big Woody Allen fan and would be prepared to watch anything that he makes. Sometimes that leads to great pleasure (as in the classics of the late seventies and early eighties), and sometimes to confusion and boredom (as in the execrable Match Point, which I really hated). Vicky Christina Barcelona is neither a high water mark nor a low tide on that scale, but it is a work apart. It seems to be that it's a much darker work than most of Woody's output, a deeply alienated analysis of what is wrong with America, albeit through the means of desultory comedy. Without Penelope Cruz it would have been a lot darker still."

These are people Woody would have been made fun of in the 70's, but instead he seems to take these people too seriously. I did, however, find Javier Bardem's character very likable and amusing, because he seems to be the only with a sense of humor about this kind of self-absorbed life these people are living in. The one thing great about this movie is the cinematography, beautiful, vibrant, warm, the scenery and the characters are beautiful to look at.

","Let me start by saying that I don't care much for Woody Allen's films. I find them to be pretentious with an annoying, snotty undertone. ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" definitely has some of that, but I supposed I enjoyed it a bit more than other Woody Allen films I've seen.<br/><br/>This movie starts out as a complete bore for the first half until Penélope Cruz makes her entrance. Vicky, Christina, and Juan Antonio are all characters that I hardly cared about. And to make matters worse, they all have that ""we're so much smarter and artsier than everyone else"" tone that many characters in Allen's movies have. Beyond the character flaws the plot is one that really just bored me.<br/><br/>As I touched on earlier, Penélope Cruz really makes this movie. She plays her part magnificently and unlike the other main characters, Maria Elena is a very interesting character. She single handedly makes the second half of this film one hundred times better than the first.<br/><br/>I was going to give this film a five for a rating, but I really liked the ending quite a bit. I like how the main characters did not necessarily get what they wanted, but things were still okay. All too often you'll get this type of film end with everyone getting exactly what they want, or if they don't, it is really traumatic. It was refreshing to see a movie of this genre end the way that this did. The part with the gun was cool too. It was definitely not how you expected the film to end."
"Turfseer","8","0","2","3 November 2009"," Woody Allen's Grand Comeback
","In his early days, after he gave up writing comedies such as ""Bananas"" and ""Sleeper"", Woody Allen desperately wanted to join the ranks of the world's great directors such as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. He churned out pretentious drivel such as ""Interiors"" in an attempt to emulate his beloved Bergman but deep down he always knew that he could never approach the great director's depth. So he turned to a mixture of romantic comedy and his own brand of 'art house fare' in the films that made him famous: 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' and 'Hannah and her Sisters'. Unfortunately, until the impressive ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", he was never able to muster enough sympathy for his characters to make them credible enough or engaging. There was always that flash of arrogance underneath the surface that Allen was unable to hide; he was always one step above his characters, looking down on them rather then striking the necessary balance between sympathy and contempt.<br/><br/>At a certain point, Allen threw up his hands and decided for awhile that maybe he should go back to his strong suit as an 'entertainer'. He churned out fluff pieces such as 'Bullets over Broadway' and 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' but made one last attempt at joining the great directors' pantheon with ""Deconstructing Harry"", another failed attempt to emulate Bergman. Allen floundered until 2005 when he came out with 'Match Point' which marked a welcome move to the mainstream. No longer starring in his own films and filming in England, Allen decided that he no longer had to prove to the world that he was the next Fellini or Bergman. Up until the unconvincing climax, 'Match Point' was a taut drama chronicling the machinations of a lower-class retired tennis pro as he manipulates family members in an upper class milieu.<br/><br/>Vicky Christina Barcelona is content to examine all strictly middle class characters from both sides of the Atlantic. Before Allen shows us the 'dark' side to his characters, he wisely builds sympathy for them. Both Vicky and Christina are adventurers. Vicky, the more conservative of the two, is extremely skeptical of Juan Antonio's proposal to fly in his private plane for a weekend of wild abandon in a picaresque Spanish town. Her skepticism and conservative nature are her strong points. Christina, in contrast, believes in taking chances without thinking about the consequences so she convinces Vicky to accept Juan Antonio's proposal. While Christina often acts recklessly, her desire for freedom often leads her to new, interesting experiences which the average person would never dream of entertaining.<br/><br/>Juan Antonio, the suave Lothario, who sees nothing wrong in seducing as many women as he can, also has many likable attributes. Not only is he a 'smooth operator' but he has that 'senstive side' that women are drawn to. Vicky finds Juan Antonio's proposition to visit his father his ""first genuinely interesting proposition"". Juan Antonio's startling account of why his father won't share his poetry with the world draws Vicky to him. Juan Antonio's ex-girlfriend, the volatile Maria Elena, can hold her own with her ex in regards to creative pursuits. Not only does Juan Antonio claim that his strength as an artist can be attributed to Maria Elena but she is genuinely helpful to Christina when she teaches her how to become an accomplished photographer.<br/><br/>The plot of VCB never bores. The break into Act II occurs when Juan Antonio takes Vicky and Christina on a wild weekend. Up until the midpoint there are many twists: Christina becomes sick right before making love; Juan Antonio's seduction of Vicky; Doug's proposal to get married first in Spain and his arrival and Christina's decision to move in with Juan Antonio.<br/><br/>The midpoint marks escalating tension. This is when Maria Elena attempts suicide and moves in with Christina and Juan Antonio. More twists and turns occur in the second half of Act II: Maria Elena's terrible jealousy toward Christina; The revelation of Juan Antonio's infidelity which led to Maria Elena attacking him; Vicky's confession to Ben that she doesn't know why she's attracted to Juan Antonio; Judy's affair with Doug's business partner and her misguided encouragement of Vicky in continuing the affair with Juan Antonio; Christina's decision to leave the ménage a trios and Maria Elena and Juan Antonio's dispiriting breakup.<br/><br/>Woody Allen does a much better job with his climax than in Match Point since Maria Elena's 'crime of passion' is more believable than Chris, the ex-tennis pro's foray into full-blown murder.<br/><br/>Just as he views his characters with sympathy, Woody Allen doesn't hesitate to criticize them. Vicky admits that her husband Doug is a wonderful guy, someone who she's always wanted but cannot throw off her irrational attraction to Juan Antonio. Even at the end, she's about to be seduced by Juan Antonio AGAIN but is brought back to reality when Maria Elena's gun goes off and she sustains a flesh wound to her hand. Christina seems naturally drawn to vacuous affairs. Even at the beginning, she's telling Juan Antonio she'll go up to his room but ""you'll have to seduce ME"". She's also a bit arrogant when she tells him, ""You're home free, unless you blow it"". Christina never knows ""what she wants"" but does know ""what she DOESN'T want"".<br/><br/>Juan Antonio seems to go from one woman to another but is unable to make a commitment. His narcissism seems to always lead to bad feelings of jealousy amongst the various women he seduces. And of course Maria Elena is the ultimate narcissist in that she can't accept others unless they give her 100% loyalty.<br/><br/>The overuse of the narrator in VCB is perhaps the film's major flaw. One wonders why Woody Allen doesn't trust his audience to draw its own conclusions. Nonetheless, VCB marks a comeback of sorts for Woody Allen. It's a perceptive and critical look at European and American sensibilities regarding relationships and how they can go awry."

","This is one of those movies Vicky Cristina Barcelona, that i go and watch without any review reading or asking around how is the movie? To my surprise i see Woody Allen as the director, i was like this would be an interesting and complicated storyline.<br/><br/>Th only thing that i love in the movie are the characters. First character Juan Antonio (played by Javier Bardem). Ina nutshell, very commendable about his character is that he manages to bed three women, spent time with them, get attacked by one of them, without any guilt or malice. He uses the language as an amazing form of lost in translation excuse to be with all of them. for all the Guys out there, Juan's character is ultimate balance between women-sex-life-creativity.<br/><br/>The other characters are also good in this movie, specially the one played by Pen%C3%A9lope_Cruz Maria Elena, she is hyperventilating and just about either kill someone or herself for an obscure reason that will build in her mind. There is this scene where she actually goes through Cristina's baggage just to know, if she had any intentions of killing her. This is of course my favorite sequence from the movie. Cristina (played by Scarlett Johansson) is an eccentric and ready to for an adventure even in an relationship. Then there is Vicky played by Rebecca Hall, who thinks she knows what she wants. But then at Barcelona where she come to spend her summer vacation with Vicky, things go in a way, that not what they seem like.<br/><br/>This movie, still has its own scenic beauty of Barcelona, it has its own ups and downs in the movie, and gets you thinking as to why would someone want to get oneself so involved that is unable to focus on other things. I love the end to the movie, of course you need to watch the movie to understand the complexities that one goes through being in multiple relationships and still manages to survive."

"dromasca","5","0","2","23 May 2009"," Woody Allen in Europe
","The typical Manhattan director transplanted himself to Europe. His previous films were set in London, now he reached the continent and Barcelona is the setting of his summer romantic comedy 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'. The setting of many European films becomes background for another classic Allen show, gathering a couple of gorgeous American female tourists and a suicidal ex-wife around the super-sexy Javier Bardem. Everybody is neurotic despite living a life without any apparent care and any expense report to fill. Their personal problems seem to be their whole universe. The scheme seems to work pretty well and pretty the same way in many of the films of Allen in the last two or three decades - it works due to the fluency and witness of the dialogs and of the splendid actors that love to star in his movies. This is not however his best cinema in my opinion. Allen is at his best when craziness exceeds and displaces the thin intellectual wit - an Yidischer Mamma speaking from the skies or a spectacled sperm cell waiting to be launched to fulfill his destiny. It is not the case here. VCB is another Manhattan story of Allen, disguised as an European summer comedy."

"JoeMiddletonAlba","6","0","2","16 May 2009"," Technical flaws defeat promising concept
","I am a Woody Allen fan (who isn't?) and therefore I always look forward to his films. I admire the fact that he is a relentless pusher of boundaries and that he tries to do different films.<br/><br/>Unfortunately however when he is not present as an actor (he has a great screen presence) his films can lack a certain something and this is unfortunately the case here.<br/><br/>The missing Woody isn't the main problem however. There are in fact two major technical problems however which fatally flaw the film.<br/><br/>Firstly, there is an entirely unnecessary voice-over which grates on the ears and adds little to the plot. Voiceovers can of course work well, in context. Michael Caine did a great verbalisation of his thoughts in Hannah and Her Sisters for example which was crucial to the plot.<br/><br/>In this case the voice-over had no connection to the film, wasn't done by a character in it and instead appeared from nowhere as a sort of invisible omniscient presence which was simply unrealistic and distracting. All it did was suggest that the director felt his tale wasn't being properly told by the cast or the footage shot. The plot wasn't difficult to follow so a narration really wasn't required.<br/><br/>Secondly, much of the dialogue in this film is in Spanish or Catalan. None of this is subtitled, leaving large gaps in scenes. It almost seems like the Spanish lines are completely unnecessary and are just in there for 'colour'. Yet why should we sympathise with characters if the director can't be bothered providing their words and thoughts to the audience? With these issues resolved perhaps the film might have worked. Cruz and Bardem were quite charismatic and charming and the plot wasn't bad.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Johansson was as pretty as ever but seemed rather vacant and Hall (who can be very engaging as Starter for 10 proved) seemed to struggle with a rather pointless part.<br/><br/>In short then a disappointment. Allen needs to find a more charismatic muse than Johansson (Match Point was rotten as well) and the complete lack of genuine humour and indeed humanity in the script means this is way below his high standards of the past.<br/><br/>On the brighter side however the use of Barcelona as a backdrop worked well and its beauty shone through the film.<br/><br/>As I say I am a fan of Allen in general and much of his recent output I have liked a lot, Melinda and Melinda was excellent for example as was Curse of the Jade Scorpion but this film needed a stronger script and there needed to be a point to the story.<br/><br/>My partner and I watched the Odd Couple just before this film. While comparisons between old and new films are inevitably unfair it does make one wonder if the new crop of bland good looking so called 'stars' deserve the label compared to the greater brighter talents of the past.<br/><br/>No one can be a genius every day however and Allen's cinematic legacy is already assured. 6/10"

","Vicky and Cristina are young American friends about to spend the summer in Spain. While both have different ideals, they are about to share a similar experience, resulting in a life upheaval.<br/><br/>Woody Allen cannot stop. He has made a film a year for the past thirty years. The two best things about Woody Allen films these days is that he has finally discovered Europe and that he is not in them. I for one, was over his incessant whining. I'd much rather his observations on people arrive from the mouth of Scarlett Johansson as it does here.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is luminous as is Penelope Cruz and the delightful Rebecca Hall. The setting is rich, the characterization is spot on and everything falls into place. Not so his last outing, the dreadful 'Cassandra's Dream', which seemed so false, despite the cast of Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell. It's intriguing how a filmmaker like Allen can get it so wrong and then turn around and deliver a little gem like this. Ah Barcelona"

","Woody Allen has never been at the top of my directors. However, after watching Vicky Christina Barcelona - I was blown away. The glorious cinematography in beautiful Barcelona captivated me, and so did the unique, strange and mind-bending plot which left me unknown of where I was going and what was going to happen. Absolutely un-predictable.<br/><br/>Three leading ladies, and a sexy hero as a lead makes the film even more enjoyable. The believable performances by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson made the film sexy and relatable. The seductive Javier Bardem gives a gorgeous performance, which left me captivated and hypnotized. But all the attention goes rightfully to the beautiful Penelope Cruz who gave the performance of a life-time, as a troubled ex-wife. Her portrayal was haunting and fabulous, and her presence made the film beautifully odd and dark. Her Oscar-win was deserved.<br/><br/>Many criticize the film for having no 'plot', but I do not agree. The film is triumphant in telling the story of what love is and the different challenges with it. It is by no means a romance, and I myself find it difficult to classify the film - but isn't that part of its beauty? Woody Allen created such a dysfunctional work of art that has left many wondering what the film is. The power to do this proves the films brilliance.<br/><br/>Vicky Christina Barcelona is a glorious film which truly delivers. The haunting performances, stunning scenery and captivating story-line makes this one of the juiciest films 2008 had to offer. 9/10."

","Despite not being one of Allen's best efforts, VCB is above other recent outings. It's an interesting and adult story, a bit of a throwback to his late 80s/early 90s sex/love/relationships dramas, after a stint of crime stories and silly comedies. The exceptionally good looking cast and setting (my city :-) also help maintain the interest, of course, and the photography is brilliant. The story is irregular, however, in that it strains credibility at some points, while at others you feel it doesn't go as far as it could have, some characters seeming to be let off too easy from their predicaments; and the performances are irregular as well, Cruz and Hall being the obvious standouts, and Johansson the weakest link. The voice-over narration, while necessary, is a bit excessive. And the songs are, quite frankly, unbearable!"
"EijnarAmadeus","7","0","3","20 March 2009"," A playful and sensual trip to Woody Allen's Spain
","Woody Allen made himself a prolific, global film director with his humor from the New York scene, his satire on the Jewish life and all its highly enjoyable neurotic characters who concerned over and over about the themes of love and romance. In his latter career he has turned his nose away from New York and to Europe, making three films back-to-back in Britain, he makes another environmental change with his latest feature and travels to Spain, and its Barcelona. Once there, we're given a peachy story full of gorgeous Southern European life. Javier Bardem plays Juan Antonio, a ravishing, passionate painter that seduces the double-entry of Vicky (Rebecca Hall), who's there to give further studies to the Catalanian language, and Christina (Scarlett Johansson), who's exploring her artistic abilities. They soon learn about his ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), a woman who stabbed him with a knife before leaving him, and who sooner or later will return like fireworks.<br/><br/>'Vicky Christina Barcelona' is a lush experience, with a soft-focus lens Woody creates a sensual and humid touch to the characters who mostly flirt, discuss, makes love and fight - the main ingredients of romance. Woody lends us a voice-over narration that explains the many narrative plot-holes, and so he paces through the hot summer days of Spanish landscape with the characters going along, making for important but also less important, but not necessarily less enjoyable, dialogs and interactions. And when Cruz's Maria Elena shows up, the film sparks a new flare. She's a firework of everything we thought we knew and didn't know about the great actress - just listen Bardem and Cruz exchange love and hate in the language of Woody Allen, in both English and Spanish, it's fabulous! 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' is what Woody Allen loves the most; observing romance, and what we humans make of it, and don't make of it."

","It's awesome how Allen achieves to display such sad, intense, and disturbing plot as a light and even curious turn of events. I personally disagree in labeling this movie as a sad one. Even though we can find polygamist relationships and a lot of insanity it's easy to identify with all four of the characters at at some point. <br/><br/>The result: we can find ourselves comfortable with a natural search for stability. Confortable with jealousness and desire of monogamy. Confortable with the need of passion in life brought by new feelings and experiences. Enchanting and infinite number of possible combinations can be made from this characters.<br/><br/>We won't find as much great long dialogues as we can in other Allen's films. However we'll end up loving the description of Barcelona and the attempt of falling for the ""Catalan Identity"" through the film."

","Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), two American friends in their twenties, are holidaying in beautiful Barcelona prior to Vicky's marriage to the dull but worthy Doug (Chris Messina). They meet Juan Antonio, accomplished artist and dedicated Latin lover (Javier Bardem), who proposes going to bed with both of them, preferably at the same time. Cristina is keen, but passes out and it is the guilty Vicky who has a night of passion before marrying the unsuspecting Doug. Afterwards, Juan Antonio and Cristina get together, and, surprise, form a relationship. Alas, the idyll is interrupted by a blast from Juan Antonio's past, his homeless and unstable ex-wife Maria (Penelope Cruz). Juan Antonio can't bring himself to turn her away, and the three of them start living together. At first things go well, but then Well, the movie succeeds as travelogue. The locations are authentic and beautiful. The acting is fine, especially the two Spanish leads. But this is a slight story about two emotionally shallow and not very interesting Americans abroad. The real people are the locals. We are also kept at a distance from the characters by a bland voice-over. Perhaps Woody Allen, a long-time student of American sexual manners, is aiming to contrast the Spanish and (wasp) American approaches to affairs of the heart. The Spanish go for romance as if life depended on it, the American regard it as just another life goal, like a college education, or a well-paid middle-class job. The Americans are strangely discontented in the warm Catalonian environment, while the Spanish seem to belong there, which of course they do.<br/><br/>I'm not complaining (it was after all a free in-flight movie being shown before the release date here) and it was lovely to see Barcelona again after 10 years, if only on the back of the seat in front of me, but I'd have to say Woody's best work is behind him. I saw Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" afterwards – now there's an ancient director who still can produce, as well as act."
"Georgegrigolava","4","0","1","23 February 2009"," Penelope Cruz is Exceptional - Movie is mediocre
","Woody Allen makes two types of films; the witty crime caper and the life affirming romantic comedies. This undoubtedly falls into the latter category.<br/><br/>I love and rate Woody Allen (my favourites include; Cassandra's Dream, Scoop, Match Point, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Small Time Crooks), but I am categorically bored with all his attempts at romantic comedies (Annie Hall  Overrated and boring) and where the only plot is for the characters to better understand them selves or their lovers, partners or who ever. I just don't care.<br/><br/>I guess in films like this, you have to really be able to see yourself in one of the main characters to really appreciate what is going on. Vicky  a woman, Cristina  a woman and Juan  a womanising eccentric artist. Unfortunately, as the two title characters belong to the opposite sex, I could not relate to what they were going though, as for Juan his character only exists in books, movies and possibly Barcelona.<br/><br/>I didn't find the film funny, or even remotely entertaining. Saying all that the film still has an outstanding element to it, and that is Penelope Cruz, beautiful, crazy and most of all interesting. Watch the movie just so you can fall in and out of love with Penelope as the movie progresses."
"Red_Flag","8","0","2","20 February 2009"," Welcome back Woody, weve missed you.
","If I were to tell you that Woody Allen, director of the exceptional Annie Hall, were back on top form you would most likely not believe me. Understandable of course considering he hasn't made a good movie for several years, funnily enough the truth is that he is indeed back on sparkling form with ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" his attempt at a romantic comedy showing off a beautifully ensemble cast including Javier Bardem, Scarlet Johansen and Penelope Cruz and while the premise may feels worn out and ultimately dull there this unusual chemistry between the three just mentioned that works as a huge advantage in favour of this movie. Even at the dullest point the movie remains a charm if simply for its colourful characterisation.<br/><br/>One thing that stands out like a sore thumb is how wonderful Penelope Cruz is. Ultimately she's a brutally tormented characters unable to deal with her own ghosts and looks nothing but unstable for 90% of the movie. Honestly said, it's an Oscar calibre performance hitting all the right notes allowing her audience to see the pain she's experiencing.Woody Allen's romantic drama Vicky Cristina Barcelona stars Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson as best friends Vicky and Cristina. As the movie opens, the pair of twentysomethings travel to Barcelona so that Vicky can work on her post-graduate degree. The two meet the charming artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who offers to take them on a vacation and make love to them. Vicky, being a happily engaged young woman, refuses, but Cristina is eager for this life experience. A love triangle begins to coalesce, and things grow more complicated when Juan Antonio's passionate, unstable ex, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), arrives to stay after a suicide attempt.<br/><br/>Ultimately, in exploring this distended romantic triangle, Allen never comes down on the side of either the dull stability of marriage or the unpredictability of the boho threesome, but his position remains clear. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is another in his persuasive arguments that love, for all the complexities and pain it throws up, is still worth chasing. And along with art, perhaps the only thing worth chasing. The performances of Bardem, Cruz, Johansson and Hall are delightfully inventive, with Cruz in particular relishing the tempestuous nature of Maria Elena and her tantrums.<br/><br/>Vicky Christina may not be much in the long run but as it stand its a fun enjoyable fell-good romance movie with spectacular cinematography, sumptuous acting and a director that, for now, remains a one to watch. Allen has crafted a wry and thoughtful film about the peculiar stirrings of the heart, which is certainly his most accomplished piece of work since Match Point, and his funniest in the eight years since Small Time Crooks.<br/><br/>Verdict: Believe the hype, Woody's back and better than ever with Vicky Christina Barcelona. While the territory is familiar, the terrain is new: Allen shoots his title city with an eye for its art and architecture and while undoubtedly forgettable, you'll have a blast watching it. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is so engaging so much of the time that it feels like a modest rejuvenation: evidence that a summer in Spain can do wonders for a writer-director who may not have outlived his prime. For my overall rating i give Vicky Christina Barcelona 4/5."

","The latest offering from the now veteran Woody Allen is set in the Spanish capitol of Barcelona and sees the director giving the city the treatment he has previously lavished on Manhattan and London. The story centres around Juan (Bardem) who is a carefree painter with an unhealthy fixation on his ex-wife; the feeling is mutual to the point where they just can't shake each other, but enter two friends on holiday to really throw a spanner in the works. Vicky (Hall) is happily about to be married and has her whole life planned, Cristina (Johansson) on the other hand is floundering she doesn't know what she wants but she does know what she defiantly doesn't want, the two decide to spend a few summer months together in Barcelona which is where they meet Juan and eventually his ex-wife Maria Elena (Cruz). What follows is a typical Allen story packed with twists and turns and great one liners, never big on set pieces the beauty of Allen's work lies in his excellent script work, his characters talk like they are real not like actors delivering lines and the situations he places them in requires just that. The cast is strong and with Gaudi as a major backdrop the lives of the characters unfold over the few months and create an enjoyable film packed with humour, heartbreak and plenty of Spanish sunshine.

It's better than 'Match Point' and is probably Woody Allen's best film since 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'. Javier Badem cleans up nicely as the estranged artist (after his 'No Country For Old Men' role). Penelope Cruz turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as the neurotic ex-wife of the artist.

Together with the decor of beautiful and smoldering Barcelona I treated myself to this film. The only bad thing about Woody Allen's latest movies I find the casting. In lack of Kate Winslet he chose Scarlett Johansson who I am totally allergic to since I saw her in The Horse Whisperer, because she keeps looking and acting like a six year old. I'm sure she's every man's wet dream with her over-the-top flirtatious platinum presence, but if I were a man I'd find Penelope Cruz brave ""don't bullshit me!""-attitude a lot more appealing. She's a real challenge and I like her style! Javier Bardem is the totally annoying self righteous, assumptuous male chauvinist with an attitude like he is ""Gods gift to women"". I could totally relate to Vicky's reaction like ""Oh pulease... take your phony act and ass elsewhere."" (Too bad she gave into him all of a sudden, because you don't grant that creep such victory.) But... I loved the art he made! (Wonder what artist made those paintings for this movie?...) Pretty entertaining movie with good insight of people's sometimes so-unlike-their-character actions.

","At one point in this the latest Woody Allen film Vicky Cristina Barcelona one of the characters sees the world that she always wanted right there in her table but at that moment that world was no longer her perfect world, she was certainly concern, her head was thinking in many things but always the fear was present, to stay means to be in the place that she don't want any more and to go means to try to get what she really wants, is with the man that she always loved or with the man that she is in love with. In this film each character had a time that they will never forget and that certainly they will try to forget, first we meet the Americans, two young and beautiful women, friends that are together in a different continent, Spain is the country and Barcelona is the exact place, we meet Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), the narrator tell us how they are different from each other and we soon see that, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) is the one who will help in order to show us how both friends are different from each other. None of these three will forget the others, certainly Juan Antonio will be out of the lives of both women in a not very long period of time but for sure if somehow Vicky stops seeing Cristina they will not forget the other. Cristina and Juan Antonio were the ones with the same intentions at the beginning of their relation and at one point the two American friends has their man with them in Barcelona and we see the four together. Penelope Cruz is Maria Elena, we don't see Penelope during the first part of the film but we know about her character since the moment we know more or less who is Juan Antonio, certainly for the two American friends to hear about Juan Antonio is to hear about Maria Elena and to be with Juan Antonio is to hear more about Maria Elena. Penelope is all you want and also very funny but certainly she is not funny for Juan Antonio and Cristina and she will be everything but funny for Vicky however for us she says some really funny things, she says a lot in Spanish and with her craziness everything turns really enjoyable, I think Penelope did my favourite performance of this film. A situation, Maria Elena was and still is in love with Juan Antonio and he is in the same position, the factor that makes this relation finally a stable one is actually a person, is actually Cristina. I remember reading time ago about the scene that was going to appear in Woody's upcoming feature, for sure Scarlett Johansson is incredible sexy in this one. Anyway, Scarlett's character is not sure about anything, she loves this, she enjoys that but she in this part of her life will not find a thing like stability, after all this was just an adventure, a strange summer. Woody let us know enough about each character to can be surprised by some of their actions, after all they are in love, in love with the place also and all share that feeling, Barcelona provokes many things for them, there is music, painting, photograph, love, fear, dreams. Each player of Woody shines, not in a really amazing way and some more than others but each one of them is at least very good. Scarlett is the only one of the main cast whose performance is not the first in a Woody Allen film and I think still Match Point has her most memorable performance of the now three under the direction of Allen. <br/><br/>It's not been really a long time since I had my first experience with a Woody Allen film but now every time a Woody film comes to the theaters of my city I certainly save my time. To be honest this was only the third Allen film that I see on the big screen, the first one was Scoop back in January of 2007 and the second one was Cassandra's Dream actually in this same year so Vicky Cristina Barcelona was the second Allen film that was released here in Mexico in 2008, with it I have seen 25 Allen feature films and it is maybe my favourite or at least it is in my top 3 of Allen films from this decade and I have seen all of his films of the 00s. Small Time Crooks was funny but I was expecting a whole lot more from it. For me The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Hollywood Ending and Scoop are extremely enjoyable little gems that I would like to watch again. Anything Else and Melinda and Melinda (a real gem for me) are also films that I really liked and from them I was expecting simply awful films. As for the others film in England I think Match Point is overrated when someone says it is one of Allen's very best but I found there an excellent and strange film and Cassandra's Dream is not as good as Match Point but is worth watching. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is another little gem that you should check. 9.5 out of 10"

","Far from Woody Allen's best, with that said I am far from sold on Scarlett Johansson. In my opinion she has been very lucky to work with good directors and be surrounded by great actors. In this film she is completely out shined by both Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, more so then any of her previous films. All I could think during this film is how a movie about Bardem and Cruz's characters would be way more interesting and at the same time spare me from Scarlet Johansson and her winy voice and sub par acting skill. Woody Allen is known for his quick, witty and intelligent dialog and most the time throughout this film it's present and promising, except of course when Johansson makes her attempt at it. The dialog does not sound at all convincing coming out of her mouth, it is as if she has no clue what she is saying and how her character should be delivering her lines. Not to mention the fact that her character doesn't even seem smart enough to talk the way she does. In another Allen film, Matchpoint, her part was to play the sexy, alluring and tempting girl, so natural that comes easy to her, but here she stands out like a sore thumb. Anyway back to the film itself, about three times this film feels completely Woody Allen, the characters are smart, witty and very interesting. Then later they turn winy, self obsessed and just plain boring in there search to find the meaning of love. Blah."

","Woody Allen is a guy that keeps making variations on the same film over and over again, sometimes with lackluster results, but sometimes with sparkling results. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of his better attempts at the same story.<br/><br/>In fact, the Spanish setting helps give the film a sort of air of freedom that I haven't yet witnessed in an Allen film. Granted, I'm only acquainted with his older works, so perhaps he'd achieved that before. Again, he draws characters that are interesting, but in this case, they bordered on slight, being more than ciphers for himself, but not by much. And that's the thing, even without Allen physically on screen, the characters he writes still represent aspects of who he is and I think by dividing himself between Vicky and Cristina (believably played by the lead actresses), he weakens their characters. They are, after all a little flat.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film is that it's content to tell the story instead of show it. The magic of movies happens in the show, but Allen cops out and throws an omniscient narrator (very clearly a stand-in for his own voice) who describes what's happening on screen and relates information about who everyone is. The first half of the film really spends a lot of time setting up and without any notable dynamism, I found it a little boring.<br/><br/>Once the interpersonal conflicts start happening, the movie picks up. In fact, the Cristina sections of the film sort of flag because they lack any real conflict, but just move along smoothly. Vicky's sections are a little more interesting, but it's still only slightly engaging. I think that with storytelling and characters on the weak side, the film's real strong point is in building atmosphere. VCB is sort of an exploration of Barcelona and in that sense, it captures some of the magic in its air or, at least, Woody Allen's own fascination with the land pretty well.<br/><br/>In the end, VCB is a story about people with problems with finding what they want, whether out of the drive to achieve what they think they want or the inability to settle on what it is they want. A common Allen theme. But the Spanish background and gliding vibe help keep it somewhat interesting. Allen's easily done better, but VCB is just interesting enough that I wasn't disappointed. Still, it's not a dynamic film and lacking most of the elements that's found in Allen's best. As such, I can only recommend this film to those who usually enjoy Allen's films and want a different take on his usual neurosis. 7/10."
"emwolf","7","0","4","13 September 2008"," moderately good, not a triumph
","This is a pleasant piece of Allen whimsy, not the dazzling triumph that some reviewers are talking about. It has little of the true emotional heft that Matchpoint or Crimes & Misdemeanors had due partly to the fact that it has a narrator distancing us from the characters whenever it threatens to get too close.<br/><br/>Performances are good all around, but the characters, with the exception of Allen's ""Spanish"" actors, are uninteresting, completely self-absorbed and seem to end up unchanged at their core.<br/><br/>To add insult I viewed it at our local multiplex. They are no longer able to adequately handle movies sent to them on 35mm (they only know digital) so consequently there were issues in starting the movie, and the masking was appalling. Shame on Carmike Cinemas. Needless to say I got a free movie out of it."
