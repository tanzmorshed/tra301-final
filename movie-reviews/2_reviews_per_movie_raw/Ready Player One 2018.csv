","I've noticed quite a few reviews here from book fans complaining that the movie wasn't true to the novel. As a fan of the book, let me just say that's true but it's fine. The overarching story is the same. The fact of the matter is with a nearly 400 page novel packed full of pop culture references, some things would have to be cut to make it onto the big screen. Partially it's an issue of length. Partially it's just the reality that the planets were never going to fully align to allow use of many of the properties from the novel. Yes, I loved the 2112, WarGames, D&D, Joust, et al references from the novel as much as the next person, but still I felt that Spielberg captured the wonder and fun and the story of the novel accurately, even if he did so using different references. The are actually some things I even think were an improvement from the book, especially the way they re-imagined I-R0k. The bottom line is, if you're a book reader, just take this movie for what it is, an alternate version of the story, written by the same person who wrote the novel."

","Ready Player One is inoffensive enough to be entertaining but gets a bit stupid when thought is put into it.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is a very fun movie with the very experienced Steven Spielberg behind it. Visually it's stunning, full of glaring moments and Spielberg-Esque choreography and sound. The musical score too is done similarly, adding to the aesthetic pleasure of the film.<br/><br/>That is when Ready Player One starts to go downhill. The first major issue is the spoon-fed pop culture references (especially the 80's) to today's adolescent audience. The film thrives on them and it starts getting overwhelming and annoying after a few.<br/><br/>The second issue is how much watered down the film is from the book. All of the sticking points of the book are completely ignored making the books relatively dark narrative feel soft in the film which is almost insulting to the book.<br/><br/>The final major issue is the illogicality of the plot. How is one kid able to find all the answers to the OASIS but a whole company of man and women working together isn't?<br/><br/>Besides from the film being stupid and illogical it still manages to be mostly fun from start to finish is and worth of some praise for its vigorous visuals.<br/><br/>Final Grade: 6/10"

","There seem to be two camps as far as Ready Player One is concerned, those who have read the books (Who tend to dislike the movie) and those who haven't (Who tend to like the movie). I'm in the latter group and am very thankful for this.<br/><br/>When the trailer came out I was unimpressed and didn't get onboard with the hype at all, yes I was impressed with all the pop culture references and characters but I figured it would be all flash and no substance.<br/><br/>Thankfully I couldn't have been anymore wrong, Read Player One has plenty of substance, emotion and charm and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.<br/><br/>Set in a near dystopian world where people use a virtual reality world called the Oasis to escape their lives it tells the story of one player and his efforts participating in a competition that with decide the fate of the entire universe (Oasis).<br/><br/>The plot if fantastic and very well handled, the movie looks like a billion dollars, the cast did a decent enough job and the pop culture references though thick and fast didn't overwhelm the movie like I feared they would.<br/><br/>From Overwatchs Tracer, Streetfighters Chun-Li & Ryu, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Iron Giant, Chucky, Freddy Kreuger, Mortal Kombats Goro, Gundam, Mech-Godzilla, King Kong, and countless more I being a big ol'nerd really appreciated this. Combined with the incredible mostly 80's soundtrack it's a sight to behold.<br/><br/>The movie wrapped up nicely and went in directions I didn't expect, I'm suitably impressed and would love to see more.<br/><br/>If it's very different than the book I understand peoples anger, for me however this was fantastic.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>Solid plot and delivery<br/><br/>Pop culture references are charming<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Honestly nothing springs to mind<br/><br/>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br/><br/>I'm still not impressed with Gundam<br/><br/>People CAN swear in Spielberg movies<br/><br/>Old Simon Pegg looks like a tall hobbit<br/><br/>Artemis is the offspring of an elf and a porcupine"

","I honestly didn't think that Spielberg had another crowd-pleasing actioner left in him. For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?<br/><br/>This film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the ""real"" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out ""form of a gundam"" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky (""Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky"" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).<br/><br/>But to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.<br/><br/>The characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. <br/><br/>
And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to
write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference."
"mattgosling1987","8","402","683","20 March 2018"," Great movie but different from the book
","Pretty good movie visually and even though the changes from the book are obvious but they don't spoil it. They are changes that have to be made so it translates well on to screen. <br/><br/>The comedy in the film is charming and not over the top. It fits in well with the film. <br/><br/>The visuals are awesome. There are so many Easter eggs and references from pop culture it's unbelievable that they managed to add so many. It'll take a long time to spot them all. <br/><br/>Overall I'd say this film is definitely worth a watch."
"DanielRobertRoss","7","344","610","21 March 2018"," Welcome back Spielberg
","Spielberg remains to this day one of the most misunderstood film-makers of his generation. He has been labeled both a peddler of popcorn and a saccharine manipulator (Those who say the latter have clearly forgotten Alex Kitner erupting in a geyser of blood in Jaws, exploding Nazi heads, the horrors of the Holocaust in Schindler and the river of corpses in War of the Worlds). <br/><br/>There are two Spielbergs. 
There's the man who makes somber, academy award winning dramas (Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, Munich, War Horse, Lincoln etc). Then's there's the 10 year old playing in the sand box (The Indy films, Hook, Jurassic Park, Tintin etc). What I enjoy most about the 'Berg, is how he can zigzag between disparate genres. 
But after a stretch of SF films (A.I, Minority Report and War of the Worlds), I was looking forward to a return to the free wheeling fun with Crystal Skull. It turned out to be an uncharacteristic dud that despite the boffo box office, proved to be deeply unpopular with fans of the series.<br/><br/>This made me cautious about Ready Player One. Had Spielberg lost his touch? 
I was wrong. This may be one of the most visually amazing and effortlessly fun films I've seen in a long time. I have not read Ernest Cline's novel, so fans of the popular novel may have issues, but I rarely read the books before seeing the film. <br/><br/>The cast are great. Tye Sheridan are Olivia Cooke are the standouts. Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg are fun in supporting roles. Alan Silvestri's robust score is one of his most memorable. I miss John Williams, but it's still a great score. Longtime 'Berg collaborator Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is beautiful. And it's the only film where you'll see a DeLorean chasing a T-Rex on the big screen. That image alone is worth the ticket price. 
 
He never went away, but it's nice to see him back playing in the sand box."

Yes the CGI looks amazing. <br/><br/>But oh my lord what happened? <br/><br/>What happened to all the smart dialogue and puzzle solving? What happened to the cool and funny references? And oh my god what happened to the plot? <br/><br/>I'm aware that it can be difficult to transfer a book to a movie but come on. Nothing besides the characters names were similar to the book. The plot is very Hollywood and stiff. <br/><br/>It's nothing you haven't seen before. Hollywood unfortunately got the best of this one."

This is a great and entertaining movie, I absolutely recommend ignoring the raging nerds and go watch it."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","4","746","1412","2 April 2018"," Relies heavily on empty nostalgia and pop-culture references but lacks engagement and a solid story of its own.
","'Ready Player One (2018)' should have been called 'The Pop-Culture Movie', since it is so chock-full of blatant references and call-backs to media, from the eighties and nineties in particular. It seems as though this over-reliance on pre-existing material, along with its recognition and nostalgic value, is the driving force behind most of the narrative, being that the flick itself doesn't capture the spirit of the films it intends to ape, and so often calls out by name to cringe-worthy results, but instead shoves in reference after soulless reference in a vapid attempt to prey on its audience's ability to recognise things they've seen before. This 'nostalgia vampirism' is meant to evoke memories of better films and have those emotions transposed onto this one, though it only succeeds in the former and reminds you how much you'd rather watch any of those than this. It's evocative of the larger issues that plague the flick, those being that it doesn't have any real stakes or ability to engage on its own and also treats its audience as rather dumb and forces expository dialogue down their throats at every opportunity. The on-the-nose exposition was honesty some of the most intense and grating I'd experienced in some time. The feature did have some nice visual effects and I cared about the digital 'avatars' as much as any of their real-world counter-parts, though only to a certain degree, but so much was happening that it was hard to register at times due to the odd colour palette and heavily contrasting character designs. It didn't have a cohesive aesthetic, to say the least. It did have a good score by Alan Silvestri and some of its allegorical undertones certainly ring true. I honestly wasn't entertained, though, despite all the visual splendour and things that should appeal directly to me, and that really tells you all you need to know. For all the throw-away movie references, where was the fun of 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)'? Where was the wonder of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)', the suspense of 'Jaws (1975)' or the excitement of 'Jurassic Park (1993)'? In other words, where was Spielberg? 4/10"
"gertjan_kampen","4","433","820","30 March 2018"," Not the story it could and should have been
","I wanted to give this movie 4.5 stars but sadly that isn't possible so I am rounding down. <br/><br/>When I first heard news of the synopsis of the movie being leaked and that it was vastly different from the book I hoped they fixed some of the issues the book had. Because even though the book is fun, for it being a book focused on people that actually lived through the 80's it lacks serious depth. I graces the hard issues but never really tackles them (what does being alive mean? Online vs Offline live? What is romance?).<br/><br/>Going into this movie I had hoped they would touch on some of these issues but right from the start things go wrong. It is easy to harp on this movie for not following the book, but at best 2% of the book can be found in this movie. Wades origin story is off. All the challenges have been altered. All he hard hitting moments of sacrifice and taking risks removed. What you are left with is a watered down ""spectacle movie"" that doesn't make much sense.<br/><br/>Aside from that most of the actual 80's references have been cut. Instead we get pop-culture references (Halo, Gears of War, Track mania, Golden EYE). I can sort of understand why, because they wanted to make it PG13 and the PG13 wouldn't get text based games and 80's references, but it takes away from the entire identity of the book.<br/><br/>The acting is alright although I can't help but feel they completely wasted Simon Pegg's talent. It actually took me a while to even notice he is in the movie all together. All he is is a bland English voice over. A real shame as he normally adds a lot of character to his characters.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is fine. The world outside the Oasis mostly follows the books. The world inside the Oasis is crisp and well rendered. Animations are fluid and facial animations are spot on. This is one of those movies where the 3D is completely tagged on and didn't add anything to the experience however.<br/><br/>Overall I can't praise this movie. It's few clever changes are not enough to save it from mediocrity and the few nostalgia moments will hardly excite the real ""nerd"". Had they follow the book this movie would have been, like the book, a solid 7/10. As it is now I can't give it above a 4.5/10 in good conscience."
"kbveggies","3","436","841","1 April 2018"," An exercise in excess held together by soullessness
","I think Spielberg's lost his way recently. This move is absolutely empty without the pop culture references it reaps upon, without an ounce of subtlety no less (If I want to watch The Shining, I'll watch The Shining. If Spielberg really wanted a highlights reel of The Shining pasted onto his movie, he should be learning to have some restraint). Hollow story, no characters, no emotion, terrible CGI that is reminiscent of current pre-rendered cutscenes (which is pretty accurate but extremely lazy. It would've been nice to see some effort and creativity), hazy and exhausting action sequences, and a hackneyed message about being a gamer and how electronics are bad and should be used in moderation. It's basically a spiritual successor to The Emoji Movie."
"Jared_Andrews","6","98","176","11 April 2018"," An Entertaining VR Movie that Ignores Real-World Problems
","If you are just looking for a fun movie with expertly directed action sequences, wow moments, and beautiful effects, this is the movie for you. If you are the type of person who cannot help but analyze every movie you see, Ready Player One will cause you some problems. <br/><br/> Spielberg is a master of wow moments. He knows how to capture characters in moments of awe, and he knows how to make the audiences respond with dropped jaws and bewildered expressions. That's why the guy is one of the most financially successful filmmakers of all time. Watching this particular film of his makes it easy to see, even if you weren't already aware of his reputation, that Spielberg works the camera like few others can.<br/><br/> That said, this movie is not perfect. <br/><br/> The premise, at least on its surface, seems wonderful. A teenage boy (Tye Sheridan), named Wade Watts (because it sounds like a superhero's alter ego) in the near future plays an ultra-version of a virtual reality game to escape his grim real-world existence. Everyone in his world does. And we can see why. The VR world (The Oasis) is awesome. <br/><br/> Wade spends his time obsessing over a contest in The Oasis left behind by its now deceased creator. The winner of the contest claims a kajillion dollars (or something like that) and control over The Oasis. With a prize like that, Wade is obviously not the only person trying to win.<br/><br/> So, one day he meets a girl who uses the player name Art3mis (a charming Olivia Cooke) and joins her group. Together they try to win the contest before the evil company does and puts ads in The Oasis (which doesn't seem that bad). Then blah, blah, blah. You can imagine how this all turns out. If not, great, you'll be surprised.<br/><br/> This all seems fine and fun until you dissect the movie even a little bit. The message the movie sends is that this is all about friendship, which is total BS. Friendship is important, sure, but in this world, there is more at stake. Wade and much of the country live in terrible poverty, and a couple mega-businesses control the state of everything. It's a miserable reality with problems that we see today, except amplified by 100. <br/><br/> It's irresponsible and insulting that the movie pretends that this future world will be okay as long as The Oasis doesn't have ads. People still live in poverty. The world is still in shambles.<br/><br/> What I'm saying is, the movie has a problem with stakes. The stakes of this future world are enormous and dire, but the movie chooses to ignore them. That doesn't sit right with me. <br/><br/> One other issue, and this one is minor, is that this movie seems like it's made for kids, but it makes a bunch of 80s nostalgia references. Does that make sense? I don't think today's 14-year-olds care about Duran-Duran. <br/><br/> Even looking past the social blinders this movie chooses to wear and the confusing nostalgia choices, the third act drags horribly. I spaced out for a good ten minutes and didn't miss a thing. <br/><br/> In spite of all that, this movie has moments of ecstasy. If you are going to see, and I'm not sure if you should, see it in a theater. If you can avoid analyzing the movie and simply enjoy it from a pure entertainment standpoint, you may love it."
"toe71","2","490","961","25 March 2018"," Could have been a cult classic, but instead it's an insult to an amazing book,
","If you haven't read the book, then this will be a nice fun film to watch with retro references, adventure, and a look at a world where everyone lives on VR.<br/><br/>If you have read the book then prepare to be left bemused, gutted, devastated and downright disappointed at what a mess that Spielberg has made from an amazing geek fest book into a mundane movie for the masses. <br/><br/>This movie could have been an absolute cult classic of a dystopian future with some amazing insights as to what a future society of Virtual Reality users would look like. But this movie has not only decided to skim over the details of the technology and how far integrated it is in every day life, not only forget building the characters story line and gradually introducing them, but instead has taken the basic story line, along with the characters and then a few key points, throw them in the air and where ever they land write a completely different story in between and Hollywood the hell out of it with absolutely no loyalty to the book. I can not even begin to list how much is missing that would make this film make more sense. <br/><br/>In fact this movie should NOT even have the honour of the title Ready Player One, instead it should be called GAME OVER, it is an insult to the book in every way possible.<br/><br/>If you are thinking of watching this movie and not read the book, then do as it is probably not a bad film but make sure you read the book after the movie and not before. If you have already read the book, and loved the book then I would not recommend going to see this as it will just infuriate and give you high blood pressure. Instead wait for the dvd so you can rant, shout and tut loudly at the screen without disturbing others.<br/><br/>Sorry to repeat myself but this film is not ""Based on the book"" instead it is ""Very Vaguely Inspired by the book"""
"CobertNeede","7","288","560","14 March 2018"," The book might be better, but the references work better on screen
","Ernest Cline's fast-moving novel was a treasure trove for pop-culture junkies, but the endless references work better on the screen.<br/><br/>The year is 2045; the place is Columbus, Ohio. Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, ""the stacks,"" where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.<br/><br/>The book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.<br/><br/>The thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish. <br/><br/>The story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch."

","Do you like the 80's? Do you like video games? Do you like being pandered to until you want to vomit? Well this would be the movie for you. This movie is less of a movie and more of review of all pop culture of the last three decades. One of the most blaring issues is the onslaught of huge plot holes that are never addressed to any extent. For example, despite the fact that this virtual environment has people playing from all over the world, it just so happens that all prominent characters are located in the same area. It also just so happens that, despite the characters not knowing the other players past their online avatars, immediately recognize each other in the real world. Trust me when I say there are much larger more absurd examples but they contain spoilers so I will refrain from mentioning them. Speaking of characters, the development of each one is a two dimensional paper cutout that does not go beyond ""The protagonist is good"", ""The bad man is bad"", and ""The girl is a girl"". There is no example of any earnest emotion a character displays or lasting impact that a character must persevere through, even when life altering events occur. This movie focuses more on throwing as many pop culture references on screen as it can than it does on presenting the plot effectively or developing any of its characters. I am disappoint."

Also the deaths that happen in the book were removed to have the young audience not to be confronted with the harsh methods from IOI.<br/><br/>All characters are and behave totally differently.
Aech is in the book a badass who knows his stuff, not that whiney character in the movie.
Wade is a kid who has no money, IRL and in the OASIS, so no DeLorean from the start.

Art3mis is a chubby girl (would have been great to see that in the movie). So why is Spielberg putting his money on a skinny girl? Great move to give the one chance away to put some self-esteem in non-perfect people.
I-R0k is a stupid looser in the book, not that super strong headhunter.
Really? IOI employees applaud when Wade opens the final gate?!<br/><br/>The 80s references used in the movie have nothing in common with the ones from the book. 
But not always the obvious 80s references are the best ones, there are many hidden treasures in the book.
Mr. Spielberg, learn something from Marvel, they used ""Lake Shore Drive"" in the soundtrack... think about it.
A great movie might have really started an 80s nostalgia boost. But you killed it. <br/><br/>What was stolen from other movies:
The OASIS simulation inside the OASIS simulation, from Inception. 
The place around the castle with the lava and high voltage bursts, from Star Wars III.
Rig suits, strongly inspired by Tron Legacy.
I-R0k made like a very cheap Boba-Fett-headhunter-copy, again Star Wars.
Iron Giant raising the thumb while melting in the lava, from Terminator II - Judgement day (when was that? right 1991).<br/><br/>In conclusion: 
Mr. Spielberg, you are old enough, you have enough money. Please retire. You lost it long ago.
Maybe you can write a children's book, and watch it getting ripped to pieces by some amateur director, who makes a movie from your book. <br/><br/>For the viewers:
If you loved the book. Stay far away from that movie. Never ever watch it. 
You will only scream in frustration, like I did. 
If you have not read the book and you have 2.5 hrs and the money to spare, you can watch it. Maybe you will enjoy it.
But as many others wrote, it is a straight forward plot, cheesy scenes, mediocre story, lame jokes. <br/><br/>I don't know how they kept Ernest Cline quiet. It must have either involved a lot of money or threatening him to sue. How else would you silently watch how your hard work gets so destroyed."

","Of all the Spielberg films of recent years - and possibly with the exception of ""The BFG"" - this was the film whose trailer disconcerted me the most. It really looked dire: CGI over heart; gimmicks over substance. I was right about 'The BFG"", one of my least favourite Spielberg flicks. I was definitely wrong about ""Ready Player One"": it's a blast.<br/><br/>The film is fun in continually throwing surprises at you, including those actors not included in the trailer and only on small print on the poster. So I won't spoil that here for you (you can of course look them up on imdb if you want to: but I suggest you try to see this one 'cold'). <br/><br/>It's 2044, and the majority of the population have taken the next logical step of video gaming and virtual reality and retreated into their own headsets, living out their lives primarily as avatars within the fanciful landscapes of ""The Oasis"". You can ""be"" anyone and (subject to gaining the necessary credits) ""do"" anything there.<br/><br/>The Oasis was the brainchild of a (Steve Wozniak-like) genius called James Halliday (played in enormous style by ""Actor R"") and supported by his (Steve Jobs-like) business partner Ogden Morrow (""Actor P""). The two had a big falling out leaving Halliday in total control of the Oasis. But he died, and his dying ""game"" was to devise a devious competition that left a trail of three virtual keys in the Oasis leading to an 'easter egg': which if found would provide the finder with total ownership of the Oasis and the trillions of dollars that it is worth. <br/><br/>But the game is not only played by amateur ""gunters"" (egg-hunters) like our hero Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"") and his in-Oasis flirting partner Samantha (Olivia Cooke, ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl""); there are big corporate game-hunters involved like IoI (that's eye-oh-eye, not one-oh-one as I assumed from the trailer) who fill warehouses with combinations of nerd-consultants and professional game players to try to find the keys before anyone else. Which hardly seems fair does it? Ruthless boss Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Rogue One"") and his tough-as-nails hench-woman F'Nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen, ""Tomb Raider"") really couldn't give a toss!<br/><br/>What follows is two-hours of high-octane game-play and eye-popping 3D (it is good in 3D by the way) that melds a baseline of ""Avatar"" with soupÃ§ons of ""Tron"", ""Minority Report"" and Dan Brown novels. But its a blend that works.<br/><br/>I was afraid as I said that CGI would squash flat any hope of character development and story, and - yes - to be sure this is 'suppressed' a bit. You never get to really know many of the 'pack' members to any great level other than Wade and Samantha. And exactly what drives the corporate protagonists, other than ""corporate greed"", is not particularly clear. What gives the film heart though are the performances of ""Actor P"" and (particularly) ""Actor R"", who again steals every scene he is in. For their limited screen time together, the pair bounce off each other in a delightful way.<br/><br/>I have to make a confession at this point that I spent the whole film thinking ""Miles Teller is way too old for the part of Wade""! Tye Sheridan (who I think *does* bear a likeness!) is actually much more age appropriate, and is fine in the role. But the star performance for me, out of the youngsters at least, was Oldham's-own Olivia Cooke, who has a genuinely magnetic screen presence. She is most definitely a name to watch for the future. <br/><br/>Almost unrecognizable in the role is the woman of the hour Letitia Wright (""Black Panther"", ""Thor: Ragnarok"") as Wade's inventor friend Reb.<br/><br/>The story, although simple and quite one-dimensional, in the main intrigues: there is nothing like a Mario-style chase for keys to entertain when it is done well (I am so old and crusty that in my day it was ""Manic Miner"" on a ZX-Spectrum!).<br/><br/>And there's not just one ""Easter Egg"" in this film: the film is rammed to the rafters with throwbacks to classic pop-culture icons of past decades, and particularly the 80's.... the film could have been subtitled ""I Heart 80's"". Some of these are subliminal (Mayor Goldie Wilson anyone?), and others are more prominent but very clever: ""The Zemekis cube"" and ""The Holy Hand Grenade"" being prime examples. This is a film that deserves buying on Blu-ray and then slo-mo-ing through! The nostalgia extends to the music by Alan Silvestri, with occasional motifs from his most famous soundtrack! <br/><br/>For me though, the highspot of the film though is a journey into a recreation of a classic '80's film which - while a scary sequence, earning for sure its 12A UK rating - is done with verve and chutzpah. <br/><br/>Although a little overlong (2 hours 20 mins) and getting rather over-blown and LOTR-esque in the finale, the ending is very satisfying - roll on Tuesdays and Thursdays! <br/><br/>Spielberg's recent films have been largely solid and well-constructed watches (""The Post"" and ""Bridge of Spies"" for example) but they have been more niche than mainstream box office draws. I firmly predict that ""Ready Player One"" will change that: here Spielberg has a sure-fire hit on his hands and word of mouth (rather than the ho-hum trailer) should assure that.<br/><br/>(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

"kuuk3","7","134","260","20 March 2018"," Captures the adventure of the book, but lacks the heart and character growth.
","The book is better. It always will be. I think everyone knows that you cannot take a 15 hour book and condense it to a 130 minute movie without losing a lot of what made it special. <br/><br/>Firstly there is no after-credit scene. So dont bother waiting. <br/><br/>The opening title was just white text on a black screen, which is rather disapointing given the clever 'maze' logo all the marketing had.<br/><br/>The film gets rid of the gates, most of the real world stuff, all the school stuff, and all character development. Our heroes just have all the weapons, cars, robots that they had to earn in the book. Even before finding the first key. Wade already owns the Delorian and Aech just happens to have Iron Giant in his garage. <br/><br/>They make a number of dramatic changes to the main plot, some for visual storytelling (such as adding a car chase) and others to expand the role other characters worth in the plot, such as Art3mis going to IOI instead of Parzival. <br/><br/>My main issue was the lack of character arcs. They all strated off strong, and ended the exact same way. The heart of the book was how this normal person rose from being one of us, to the savior of the universe. The film is missing that. Wade no-longer talks to the sweet old lady at the bottom of the stacks. He no-longer fixes people's old oasis machines, instead he steals there gloves? 
Those real world connections are lost and he just seems like a rich spoilt kid from the start. His reasons for not joining IOI are never explained. We as audinence members have no idea why he would not have taken the money. But on that, IOI are also made out to be idiots. They dont solve any puzzles or collect any of the keys. In the book they were far more competent. <br/><br/>Then there is the whole rebellion side story which was not in book, hardly touched upon, was not explained, had unexplained henchmen, and ended abruptly. But the sheer fact that they had an army to fall back on in the real world weakened our connection to them for us as an audience. They were no longer the small guy going after the big corporation, now they were a small army going after what seemed to be just one man (Nolan) who was afraid of guns, and a mercenary woman who was beaten up by an eleven year old kid. The bad guys became a joke. Not to mention so stupid in that they keep there passwords written down for the world to see. <br/><br/>The film captures the adventure and spectacle of the book thats for sure, but is missing its heart. And they shoehorned several side characters (Rick) into the movie which really could have been left out and there screen time devoted to more puzzle solving or building the relationship. <br/><br/>They could have left i-Rok, Daito and Shoto out the story and it would not have changed anything. In fact, giving Nolan all of i-R0ks jobs would have helped his character. <br/><br/>There is almost zero world building for the real world. They show pizza delivery drones that can fly around the city and place bombs on buildings, but somehow are unable to follow a giant delivery truck featuring the worlds most wanted down the road. Ignoring speed cameras and satellite tracking as well. Again, another example of incompetency the villains demonstrate. <br/><br/>Perhaps I love the book so much, that its hard for me to separate the source material for this movie adaptation. But the book was not just about 80s nostalgia, it was about growth of characters as they went on this adventure together. It was about making sacrifices when needed and learning to work as a team to open the last gate. None of which was required for this movie. <br/><br/>I also want to mention the lack of nostalgia music. The trailers had some great songs, with Pure imagination being outstanding. None of them however are played in the movie. With the exception of jump at the start, that felt out of place as it was too fast paced for someone just walking. <br/><br/>Still watch it in the cinema as its an experience you have to see. But read the book, or listen to the great Will Wheaton audiobook as well, as its a very different story with more depth and love than the film portrays. <br/><br/>I rate it 6.5 out of 10."

","Steven Spielberg's latest cinematic exercise is the equivalent of watching somebody else playing a computer game: in other words, not very interesting at all. I thought he would've learnt a few lessons with his bland Tintin adaptation, but it seems not because READY PLAYER ONE feels like one of his worst-ever movies. It's a bland and soulless virtual reality adventure in which a mundane hero plays game to defeat the usual cliched big business corporate interest bad guys. Not at all predictable, then.<br/><br/>Spielberg fills his movie with pop culture references, which is mildly interesting I guess, but fails to make any of it entertaining for a second. The CGI animation I found to be quite shallow and insubstantial, with the same big-span battle sequences playing out over and over again that we've seen countless times in other Hollywood movies. I was longing for something more real-world and realistic and I look forward to the day that Hollywood gives up on this kind of mindless hokum. To paraphrase Jeff Goldblum in JURASSIC PARK: just because they can do these FX movies, doesn't mean they should."

","I just finished reading the book today and was so excited to see the movie adaptation. There were so many great scenes from the book that I couldn't wait to see and wondered how they would translate to the screen, and I get there must be challenges in doing that well, but it honestly felt like they didn't even try, or probably couldn't within the 2h20m duration allotted. And when I saw Spielberg's name at the end I couldn't believe it!<br/><br/>I really wish this had been created as a ten part series. With more time to play with than in a single movie I think the book could really have been done justice, but as it is they have cut huge chunks out and rearranged everything else into an unrecognisable and incoherent plot that it really disappointed me.<br/><br/>Yes, there are lots of reviews criticising the book vs movie comments - but I've not seen one positive review of the film from someone who has read the book. I can't say what my thoughts of the film are without basing it against the book as the book set my expectations so high, and the film didn't come close at all.

It looks good, it is mostly well acted, it has a nice concept of virtual space, and it has some genuinely good emotional moments. But the ending kills this all. The ending is so brutally backwards, so patronising, so technophobic and fairy-tale-logic-filled, I can only sigh, and slap a mark of disappointment on the flick.<br/><br/>Alas, poor Yorick, but your princess is in another castle."
"dmrotstein","5","5","6","4 November 2018"," The best half-movie of the year
","I knew this movie has potential to be my favorite from the very first moments. The score is excellent and matches the scenes and characters perfectly. The setup and initial character development are all but flawless. Granted, it's easy if the main character simply narrates the basic premise, but it feels natural and there is still plenty of details left for us to discover as the action unfolds. The visual effects are perfect too. I-R0k is one of the best villains I've ever seen - brilliant, stupid, scary, and comical at the same time in perfect harmony. It all seemed too good to be true, and so it was.
After the first hour of the movie, right after IOI blew up Wade's home, things suddenly fell apart so clearly as if a script writer suddenly ran away and was replaced by a teenage underachiever. And it couldn't come at a worst time. I mean this was supposed to be a pivotal moment in the movie, when Wade is at his lowest, his home and family are gone, he's completely alone, helpless and running for his life. This is when he must realize that he needs friends to survive, both in Oasis and the real world. This is when he can discover his true strength, stop being a slacker who just wants to hide from his crappy life in a fantasy world. Instead, he just goes with the flow from that point, losing any shreds of initiative he had before. First, he's kidnapped by some moronic ""rebellion"" (which plays no further role in the movie) and unwillingly meets all his ""friends"" in the real world, and so on. The following scenes and dialogs feel primitive and juvenile, character development stops completely, leaving Daito and Sho in particular horribly underdeveloped, plot lines get lost, and so on. Wade goes from ""I don't clan"" to ""In the name of the High Five"" with no preparation or justification. One of the most anticipated moments - him meeting Art3mis in the real world - goes without a hitch, because her avatar is pretty much her real self (including identical voice and personality) and Wade simply brushes off any slight differences in appearance. Same is true with Helen - she suddenly jumps in and within a few seconds it's like nothing happened and they always knew each other in the real world. Her being a woman was obvious from the start, by the way, if only because Aech's voice is clearly a digitally lowered female voice. Sorrento's arc is also a total loss - he suddenly goes from being afraid of real action to grabbing a gun and going after Wade, but when he gets there he does nothing. Oh, and he gets punched in the balls and in the face. Hilarious... if you're twelve. Okay, the moment where Wade realizes that Anorak is not an avatar, but something mysterious has some great potential, but even that is left hanging.
I'm not saying the second half of the movie is completely unwatchable - there's plenty of fun action, especially during the final battle, but that's all just mindless action, nothing left of the movie's true potential. To paraphrase I-R0k: ""Well, Spielberg blows it. Shocking."""

2. The acting is terrible and wooden all around. Forced jokes (literally no one in my theater laughed once) with bad delivery.

This has had the full Hollywood makeover replacing key parts of the story, losing the development of the main characters, and the struggles that Wade had to face to climb from the bottom in the stacks (no pun intended), and reducing the fantastic 80's references to background noise - even to replacing some of the main plot elements that made the book such a joy to read to non-sensical excuses to throw in more action and a few 'scares'. Just had you home blown up with the only family you have? Hey that's okay, I just met a pretty girl!

The only redeemable quality of this movie is the concept of the oasis, but somehow the movie manages to mess that up to, leaving the first 15 or so minutes of the movie to explain the viewer its history and purpose, yet the world doesn't feel real at all, the characters visit 5 or so locations in the oasis, making it feel small instad of the huge universe that it should be. The performances are either terrible or mediocre, even Simon Pegg manages to be mediocre.

","""Ready Player One"" was first a sci-fi novel written by Ernest Cline, published in 2011. Warner Bros. saw so much potential in this novel, they bought the rights for its film version a full year before it was even published. Cline adapted his own book into a script, with the assistance of veteran screenwriter Zak Penn. With Steven Spielberg signing on to direct in 2015, this film had all the ingredients for a blockbuster film.<br/><br/>It is 2045. Wade Watt was an orphaned young man who lived in the ""Stacks,"" a dystopian slum neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio. Like everyone else at that time, Wade spent his days going inside the OASIS, a virtual world where people can do anything they desire. As his avatar Parzival, Wade wanted to win the game challenge left by the late OASIS inventor James Halliday -- where anyone who can win three keys leading to an Easter Egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS will inherit full ownership of the Halliday's invention. <br/><br/>I first saw lead actor Tye Sheridan in 2015 in two thematically diverse films like ""Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" (MY REVIEW) and ""Dark Places"" (MY REVIEW). He then made a strong impression as the young Cyclops in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016). His role here as Wade Watts is bound to launch this young 21-year old actor into super-stardom. Although half of the time, we see him as his avatar Parzival, Sheridan ably carried the whole film on his shoulders in both the action and drama components of his role. <br/><br/>His group of friends in the OASIS were a diverse bunch of very skilled video game geeks. Lena Waithe played Helen Harris, whose OASIS identity Aech was a musclebound male techie and Wade's best friend. Win Morisaki and Philip Zhao play Japanese gamers Toshiro and Akihide whose avatars were samurai Daito and ninja Shoto respectively. Olivia Cooke played Samantha Cook, a rebel activist in real life and Wade's cyber crush Art3mis virtually. Although the book does not have a follow-up, it does not seem impossible if we see this group again in a future sequel for further adventures of The High Five.<br/><br/>Mark Rylance was not easily recognized in his unkempt long-haired geek make-up as the eccentric James Halliday, the timid genius who developed a virtual world to escape the loneliness of the real world. Simon Pegg played Halliday's only friend and business partner Ogden Morrow, who later became estranged due to their divergent philosophies. <br/><br/>Veteran character actor Ben Mendehlson played the main antagonist character Nolan Sorrento, CEO of the Innovative Online Industries or IOI, manufacturers of virtual reality hardware. He hired an entire army of virtual warriors in order to win Halliday's Easter Egg in order for IOI to gain control of the whole OASIS. There was so much subtle tongue-in-cheek humor in his portrayal of a ruthless character. T.J. Miller stole scenes as virtual mercenary i-R0k whom Sorrento hired to do his virtual mayhem. <br/><br/>This film was so much fun to watch with all the pop culture references that abound in it. You'd need repeated watching of this film to catch all those little juicy details hidden in the scenes and the dialogue. You will see King Kong, Mecha-Godzilla, Gundam, the Iron Giant in all their glory, and catch glimpses of the Batmobile, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tony Manero's disco moves and many more. <br/><br/>The musical soundtrack was steeped in 1980s pop songs, beginning with Van Halen's ""Jump"" from the opening scene, and citations of a-ha and Duran Duran. There were rich references to 1980s movies with mentions of names like John Hughes, Ferris Bueller and Buckaroo Banzai. Parzival's car is a DeLorean from ""Back to the Future."" There was entire elaborate segment dedicated to a tribute to the horror classic ""The Shining"" (Stanley Kubrick, 1980), in what is probably the most fun part of the whole film. <br/><br/>Watching a film like this in 3D IMAX is very much worth the additional ticket expense. The computer-generated world of OASIS really came alive three-dimensionally for the audience as they are drawn in and immersed into what is practically what the characters were virtually seeing and experiencing in their heads. <br/><br/>From the 1970s all the way to the 1990s, Steven Spielberg had given us some of the most engaging adventure films of all time both by young film fans and old -- ""Jaws"" (1974), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977), ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981), ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982), ""Jurassic Park"" (1993). It is only now that Spielberg had again handled material that showed that he still had that magic touch when it comes to directing these types of films, making them connect with audiences of all generations. 10/10."

I was so excited about this and it let me down in every way except visually. Take everything about the novel and change it to something less interesting and cheesy and this is what you get. A wonderful modern throwback novel full of creative nostalgia and incredibly compelling characters that gets so mucked around in Hollywood movie filth that what you get on the big screen doesn't even remotely resemble the novel at all. If you're looking for anything fun from the book, it's probably gone. Your favorite scene or part of the story line regarding the hunt for the keys and search for clues is GONE! Everything is GONE! Forget RUSH, Joust, ZORK, Lich King, Blade Runner, ALL GONE! A very sad screenplay for such a wonderful book. On the other hand, if you didn't read the book and have no expectations going in.......it still stinks! :("

","While this movie is full of cinematic wonder, that is really where the magic stops. Spielberg sadly took a great book, ripped off the cover, and stuck it on a completely different story. <br/><br/>There is no drama, no tension and largely not a lot a story. He did the same thing to Jurassic Park. <br/><br/>I was truly disappointed. It started out so well, and then it spun out of control. The only reason I didn't walk out after the first half-an-hour was because I'd taken a friend and it would have been rude to storm out and leave them sat alone. They only came because I'd raved about how great the book was, and how great the movie was going to be. <br/><br/>My friend was largely confused, and all I could do was apologise for wasting two hours and twenty minutes of their time.<br/><br/>This travesty was made worse because Empire magazine had said that it was a close fit to the book. Shame on Mr Cline, who wrote the book, and also wrote this script. I can't believe an author would do such a spectacular hatchet job on his own material (maybe the blood rushing down the hotel corridor came from all the fans who committed suicide when the saw the prescreening). <br/><br/>I wanted this movie to be so much more than it was. And I have no doubt that anyone who is ignorant of the book will find it amusing. But they really shouldn't think too hard otherwise they will spot all the inconsistencies. Like how artimus has the landline numbers for all the five players when they are all keeping their identities secret. <br/><br/>Sadly I don't own a working delorian with functioning time-travel to enable me to go back to yesterday and tell me to not buy the tickets. <br/><br/>This joins the only other movie that I will never watch again. The remake of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy (which is amongst my all time favourite stories)."

","NO SPOILERS - I promise.<br/><br/>BEST VIDEO GAME THEMED FILM OF ALL TIME &
AN INSTANT CLASSIC FOREVER<br/><br/>Let me first off state that I have not read the book prior to seeing this film. <br/><br/>However, I enjoined the film sooo much that I am now interested in buying the book so that I can see the difference between it and the film adaption. <br/><br/>This movie is full of nostalgia! You feel like Marty Mcfly in Back to the Future - going back in time, only in this case - a journey filled with absolute nostalgia of pop culture from the 80s and possible some early 90s. <br/><br/>The entire time you can spot references or so called easter eggs throughout the entire film. You get that feeling of being a kid again and reliving your childhood (if you grew up in those times) on a roller coaster ride! The nostalgia is not just other things you see throughout the film but also from some of the lines the characters in the story use, their gestures, and even clothing apparel! Not to mention, the music!!! What a great choice and what better than using Van Halen's ""Jump"" in the trailer to let you know you're about to step back into 80s!<br/><br/>The film displays beautiful vivid colors of non stop special effects and the action is very consistent without long dwelling scenes of nonsense found in other films. You feel like you're enjoying an absolute retro filled vibe through the movie yet it doesn't feel outdated at all - it feels modern and current with the times! It's like Tron meets Wreck it Ralph w/ a small touch of maybe say The Wizard!<br/><br/>The film was an awesome refresher to all the recent most disappointing films in Hollywood, and that old school still has a great touch of simplicity but also powerful creativity that many film makers could learn from today, a message to film makers today - when you over complicate films or stories you tend to lose a lot of quality in the fun factor. The film is NOT overly cheesy and doesn't make you cringe or soo bad its good in examples of other films like ""The Wizard"", ""Super Mario Bros"", ""Street Fighter"", ""Dead or Alive"", ""Pixels"" or ""Double Dragon"" etc. No, this film got it right! <br/><br/>The only thing I will say is that it did feel like they could have elaborated on some essential things that are missing from the book that people have mentioned but hey, the film is only roughly 2 hours, its not enough time to cram all of that. I could name hundreds of other films that have come out recently over the last couple years - including this year, that are absolutely terrible with plot holes, long dragging needless scenes and didn't make the best usage of a film's time. <br/><br/>But this movie: READY PLAYER ONE did a great job in managing its time among scenes because they spent more time on the things that people wanted to see!!<br/><br/>Not to mention, the film has a great message that its trying to get across and that is explained at the end.<br/><br/>I enjoined the movie soo much that after seeing it the first time at a standard showing, I decided to watch it a second time in I-max! Yes it was worth paying more to see it again on the big screen!! I took my gf and she loved every bit of the film!<br/><br/>Hope you guys found this review to be helpful!<br/><br/>GO SEE IT!!!"

Now I've seen it, I won't be reading the book because I couldn't care less what it was about. <br/><br/>I'm not even sure who this movie is for. The script reads like a tweens audiobook with some swearing thrown in. There are seemingly no valid cultural references past 1989, and I find it hard to believe (considering the film is set in 2045) that this group of teens would still be acknowledging John Hughes movies. Yeah right - no-one under 30 does that NOW! <br/><br/>And the effects are all bluster. It's pretty, and I guess in a very immature way it's fun, but not once did I laugh, or gasp, or feel any sense of dread or menace - it was all so impotent."

","Did Steven Spielberg even read this book! So much of the story was altered from the book that it made watching this movie very painful and frustrating. It seems that the movie was made for a different generation rather than the audience that fell in love with the book. Take a note from Peter Jackson when making a movie from a book. I understand that parts will be altered and some parts left out. Making a movie from a book is challenging I am sure. Just don't rewrite it! Even Ridley Scott did better with the Martian. He missed the mark on the humor in the Martian but at least he told the story as the author had written."
"maruugaa","1","8","12","6 June 2018"," too long
","This was a two and a half hour movie for a half hour of content.
I didn't read the book, aside from chapter 1, but given from how every once and a a while the movie would hint at a plot or theme or morale, I assume the book did actually have a story line.
This was 50% 80s references(which I'm aware is from the book), 45% horrible CGI fight/action/violence scenes, and 5% story line. The character development in the movie is zero. I'm pretty sure the whole movie was filmed in front of a green screen. It felt like I was watching a video game demo, which I guess was somewhat the point as it happened in a video game, but it was just visually unappealing to the eyes.
The avatars were hideous. OASIS was hideous.
And a complaint toward both the movie and the book, I am so tired of 1980s music and references. I was born in the 1980s and never even got to experience the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s fully because society is stuck in the 1980s for some reason.
Maybe the music was good in the 1980s, but having to hear the same songs continuously for my entire life means hearing 80s music just gives me a raging headache."

And since I haven't read the book I can't really join that discussion.
All I know is that when you look at it from a film stand point. This movie is damn near perfect! 
The characters are likable and fun.
The story is intriguing and facinating.

I can't say enough good things about this movie.

Watching READY PLAYER ONE was difficult because the storytelling felt rushed, most of the 80's references are missing, there are gaps in the plot, and MAJOR characters roles are changed, the screenplay barely resembled the book and it leaves me wondering how you thought your readers would enjoy this vastly different storyline. I respect the process of adapting a book for the screen. It's hard work and not everyone will agree with what you keep and what you cut. It's hard to understand what you did or let Spielberg and Penn do to the movie. The disparity between what I saw on screen and what I read in your book was shocking. I was slack jawed and left scratching my head the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes because I couldn't keep up with all the changes! <br/><br/>I am assuming that getting the rights to use all the 1980's music and movie references from the book would have been exorbitantly expensive, even downright impossible, but why make a movie that drops out so much of what made the book great?

","My girlfriend and I went to a preview screening with moderate expectations. Having both read and enjoyed the book although neither of us being what you might call stereotypical geeks/nerds. When reading the books there were many references which we didn't understand, but that didn't diminish from the enjoyment we got from the book.<br/><br/>The film on the other hand is a disgrace to its source material. I am amazed that as a co-writer Cline was happy with it. For a start there is such little exposition in the story. We both spent the first half hour gawping at how bad it is. Completely changing the storyline, changing the methods of gaining keys, changing how IOI find out identities, putting all the main cast to just happen to be in the same place, putting other characters in because they just happen to be in the book but giving them meaningless roles with no development.
There is very little other socio-political context about the current world as there is in the book. It is glimpsed about people investing real word currency to the point of deprivation into the game (aunt's boyfriend paying the house money) and the centres for indebted people, but there is little guiding to this, these seem as isolated events.
The change from Wade going into the centre to 'saving the girl' and the whole of the half baked terrible 'love story arc' was terrible. Made all the worse from her being a major character from the start.
Also for a 12a to feature crotch stoking and reenactments of Chucky stabbing people and the shining is awful.<br/><br/>I would equate this with the similar adaptation of the Da Vinci Code. There was so little story line, no chance for anyone in the audience to even ponder what the clues could mean just racing about doing stuff which unless the audience had an idea of the story would have no meaning I expect.
I know it is a film and everything in the book can't be translated to screen but it seemed like the essence of what the book was was ripped out, stomped on, put through a grinder and then just discarded completely.<br/><br/>I do not blame the multiple groups of people who walked out of the screening within the first hour. We were tempted ourselves but hoped it would get better.<br/><br/>TL;DR if you liked the book, get ready to hate the film. If you haven't read the book, it is a very average sci-fi CGI flick with predictable tropes and themes with a bit of added nostalgia."

","This was heartbreaking. This movie could have been...SHOULD have been so much better. I should have known not to get my hopes up since Peter Jackson wasn't directing it. <br/><br/>I think that Spielberg was a little too personally close to all of the content that the book references for him to realize that so much of that content is what makes people love the book so much. He just sees those things and that period through different eyes than those of us who grew up during the period. He sees past accomplishments and a great catalog of his art. He has no idea of what his movies mean to someone who's childhood was essentially defined by them. This isn't a knock against a brilliant director, just a statement of truth - the artist will always feel differently about his own work than those who grew up loving that work. I'm sure that's why he left out so much self-referencing material, but the movie is so much poorer for it.<br/><br/>So, from the aspect of a movie adaptation of the book, it fails miserably and is such a disappointment. A Peter Jackson trilogy would have been better. It just feels so rushed at 2 hours, 20 min.<br/><br/>If you have no idea what's in the book, then this movie is at least a fun, mindless thrill ride, with outstanding effects and CGI, so it has that going for it. It's more for those that watched The Lord Of The Rings trilogy because ""OMG, Viggo is so hot"", rather than see Tolkien's vision come to life. It's the only explanation for the number of 10-star rating this film has garnered. That and hordes of shills. <br/><br/>I weep for the lost opportunity that this movie represents. Spielberg destroyed the story, but I'm more pissed off with Mr. Cline for allowing it to happen. You, sir, are are a complete SELLOUT. You should hang your head in shame for having your name associated with this dumpster fire of a film."

Appaerently they never work. <br/><br/>Wades story in the real world (the cliche-ridden dystopian future, where everyone is poor, but can some how still afford VR glasses and suits and tread mills and yet they live in slum) could have been interesting. But after less than 8 minutes Wade is is his avatar in Oasis. And for the rest of the very long movie Wade is only himself for a total of 30 minutes. Halway through the movie his aunt is killed. His last living relative. And yet Wade doesnt seem too bothered by it. He doesnt mourn her death for even a second. I guess that's rule number one in 21st century scifi movies: when somebody dies, nobody gives a shit. Like when Han Solo died in the afwul The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>Wade falls in love with another avatar, who also looks like a manga toon, even though the human girl Samantha who owns the avatar is way more hot. This very attractive girl has a huge birthmark on her face, that she for some reason tries to hide, like it's something hideous. <br/><br/>Some dead rich nerd who invented the Oasis offers a reward of his entire fortune to whoever can find three keys and an easteregg. Everytime he appaears in the Oasis, he looks like Gandalf from LOTR. And even though he died long ago, he appears very much alive in one of the final scenes of the movie. This makes no sense. You cannot talk and interact with a dead person. <br/><br/>The other characters are some black kids and some asian kids. I'm sick of annoying asian kids appearing in Hollywood movies, just to please an asian audience. And sell tickets in asian countries. Mostly because they cant act, they hav no personalities. And theyre forgotten very fast. <br/><br/>This movie is so dumb. Dont waste your money and time. No Spielberg is not back.

After all, you cannot fully translate the epic scope of a nostalgic adventure like RP1 in just two hours. But from the opening scenes, I found myself seething in the theater seat. Where was the Wade Watts who was going to school and had to come up from nothing? Why was I supposed to care about this character all of the sudden? The movie did very little to develop the characters at all, and instead smashes you over the head with visuals and pop culture imagery, as if to say, ""These are the things you love and are nostalgic for right? Yes? Then you have to love this movie!"" <br/><br/>But no. What you love and appreciate about a great story like RP1 isn't all of the pop culture, though that is fun; it's caring about Wade and the other characters growth throughout the story. The movie left that out. Instead it moved at a break neck pace with no build up. Does Wade grow at all over the course of the movie? Is he different at the end than he is in the beginning of the movie? No. I didn't get the impression that he did. So why am I supposed to like this movie? Because it has a bunch of references to things I love in it? I'm sorry, but that isn't enough for me. I go to the movies for a good story, not for a slide show on pop culture. At it's essence, this movie adaptation didn't feel like a good story that kept me wanting to see the characters succeed. <br/><br/>I could have accepted some changes to make it more cinematic, but the movie felt like it took the basic plot from the book, and that was it. The way he wins the keys are almost entirely different, and my favorite part in the book when he purposefully infiltrates IOI turns into the heroine getting captured and him needing to save her. Okay, I can understand that. Let Wade be the knight in shining armor and save the damsel. But Art3mis was never meant to be a damsel. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie to me was the performance by Mark Rylance who played James Halliday. They managed to capture his spirit and tragedy throughout the movie, and I will credit it with that. A stellar performance by Rylance.<br/><br/>The visuals were great and all, and maybe I'm being too harsh and need to see it again, but I didn't feel invested in the characters or the story the way I was when I read the book. None of the characters changed throughout the movie and at the end of it, I left the theater disappointed. <br/><br/>If you are among those singing this movies praises, and loved it, I'm a bit jealous, because I wanted to love this movie. I just didn't."
"mark-hall4","1","53","118","2 April 2018"," A massive pander.
","This movie contains all the elements of the last 20 years I personally haven't been a fan of. People's obsession with technological gimmicks, corporate CEO worship, overindulgent CGI, superhero fascination.. and retro nostalgia thrown in for good measure. 
The look of the film's only consistency is that it has no consistency- each scene is as gaudy and ugly as the last. 
I managed to last about three quarters of the film, mainly because I was hoping that the dead CEO would tell the guy to destroy the entire game (I since read he did, but was declined), but I just didn't want to watch it after a certain point. I did however break my desire to leave during the first 20 minutes, and then very ten minutes after that, so I did pretty good I think.
I feel for the producers who have to make back 440 million dollars, but I'm sure this movie's extreme pandering to a society that is loosing to it's mind to corporations and technology will probably pay off even with my little viewpoint."

","I'm NOT a book reader but I've read Ready Player One twice. I also read the Twilight series (nor am I a GOOD book reader, I like what I like) and I can honestly say the movie adaptations of Twilight were FAR better than Ready Player One and those were some terrible terrible terrible movies. It hurts I tell you, it hurts. Sadly this movie for me will go down with Timeline. A fantastic book (by Michael Crichton) movie butchered it to DEATH. <br/><br/>We as book readers knew there were going to be some liberties taken, and with Earnest Cline co writing the screenplay, ok...I trust it will be true to the source...but no. I supposed since he was involved he would have had a say. But when Spielberg wants to change something it's, ""Yes Mr. Spielberg, sir."" Which isn't a bad thing really, but eek. <br/><br/>Like others have said, if you haven't read the book you will most likely really enjoy this movie. The pain I feel being one of those ""the book was better"" people now, will be the burden I bear this time, it will just be the burden I bear."

"robertleelch","10","22","44","2 April 2018"," Great Family Movie
","This movie is a must see for family. I first off never read the book, but I am part of the generation this movie is referencing toward. I had an Atari 2600, Intellivison and Colecovision. I was one of the geeks that would spend weekends playing D and D. I was into anime, cartoons and science fiction. But as with all of us, we all grow older with family and responsibilities. That said, I convinced my wife (who was never into Sci-fi or Fantasy movies) and my 12 yr daughter and 9 yr son to see this movie with no prior pre-conceptions. The result was that we absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>In the movie the CGI graphics were amazing, my kids were glued to the screen watching all the action and effects. There were never any slow or boring parts in the CGI world. Caution: The part looking for the second key might be intense for younger kids (mine just closed their eyes). All the numerous characters and 80's references my wife and I found definitely gave us nostalgic smile and laughs during the movie.<br/><br/>The seamless action and story of the characters in the real world was actually riveting and it felt the long movie run time went by fairly quick. I thought all the characters fitted well and not once did my family groan about a character.<br/><br/>I know there has been some negative reviews by people who are comparing it to the book (just like the movie ""Enders Game""). However, if you look at this movie as it is presented to the viewer, it is a fantastic movie! My family could not stop talking about it the last few days. I really enjoyed the ending with the final general message that Spielberg is relaying, where true life and happiness comes from. That powerful underlying message was something my kids took out of this movie, besides the absolute great storytelling.<br/><br/>If you have kids, I strongly recommend you take them to see it!"

"bastille-852-731547","4","56","127","22 March 2018"," Not Quite Game Over, But Very Disappointing
","I saw this movie at an advance screening. I enjoy Spielberg's films and sci-fi when done well, but wasn't too impressed with the trailers for this one and was not planning on seeing it in theaters. (Note: I have not read the book (also titled ""Ready Player One,"" which the film is adapted from.) I was hoping for a riveting and entertaining look at pop culture and futuristic technology, but unfortunately left disappointed. ""Ready Player One"" isn't a terrible film by any means, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel like a wasted opportunity given Spielberg's talent.<br/><br/>The film is centered around Wade Watts, an adolescent male who lives in Columbus, Ohio in 2045. In 2045, almost everyone plays in ""the Oasis"" in their spare time--a sprawling and all-encompassing virtual reality universe. The main narrative arc of the film centers around various players (particularly Wade and his love interest Artemis) attempting to obtain control of the Oasis after the death of the game's founder. To do this, they have to obtain three keys that will allow them to view an ""Easter egg"" placed in the Oasis by the founder before he died. Surprisingly, the plot is easier to follow than it sounds even if you don't really play video games (like me.) The structure and pace of the narrative is probably the best thing about the movie. Despite running for 2 hours and 20 minutes, it never feels too long--an amazing feat for a generally weak film. The soundtrack is good, but the acting is quite hit-or-miss; although the lead actor does bring a healthy amount of charisma to the table through his performance.<br/><br/>Many viewers are anticipating this movie due to the film's numerous pop culture references. Tragically, these references are one of the reasons why ""Ready Player One"" doesn't work as a movie. References to many great films are often (with one good exception) stripped down to simply brief thoughts through otherwise-pretentious lines of dialogue that seem destined to satisfy hardcore geeks and fanboys but leave others in the dust. An example of this is the film's so-called homage to ""Jurassic Park"" (also directed by Spielberg) by simply showing a cheesy-looking, CGI T-rex attack race car drivers in a futuristic, virtual-reality race car game set in a virtual version of Manhattan. While the idea of using authentic pop-culture references in a film like this seems like a great one, these references are degraded to the soulless level of the evil corporate overlords that are the antagonists of this film. The script is overstuffed to the brim with clichÃ©s, using every stereotypical ""dorky"" or ""nerdy"" characteristic as a depictive state or plot device. The film's action scenes are more helter-skelter and knee-jerk than actually thrilling. (Think something slightly better than, but similar to, action scenes in Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" franchise.) All three of these complaints I have against the film are confirmed by lazy writing that often stoops low to very basic-level dialogue or making cheap shots using internet slang like ""noob.""<br/><br/>While Spielberg has contributed much to cinema as both an entertainment medium and art form over the past several decades, ""Ready Player One"" does not present itself as a confirmation of this in the slightest. I hate to say this, but it lands with a bit of a thud. 4/10"

","I haven't been so excited about a scifi movie in a long time<br/><br/>Spielberg just hit the Jackpot, its a visual journey through Pop Culture from the last 30 years.

","Sure, I could start by telling you who I am and why you should care, what I have to say and so on! But the fact is you probably dont care, because I am wrong and you are right. Everyone is THE biggest movie fan of all times and you need to listen to me because yada yada... You will probably think I am a book snob and that I know nothing about movies. This is not true. Movies have a very special place in my heart. And again I could tell you all about myself, but who cares!
However, consider this. I have been a member of this page for over a decade. And this is the first time I really feel obligated to actually write a review. That should tell you something. <br/><br/>Nothing is right about this film. The movie starts of wrong and it ends wrong. I cant even briefly summarize everything that is wrong with this picture. The only thing that is actually from the novel are the names. They couldn't even get the easter egg hunt right, which is the main story of the novel (the plot). 
In the future people will look back on Ready Player One and say, ""This is the prime example on how you butcher a book, and make it into a incoherent mess, without any attachment to the novel""."

"freydis-e","1","6","9","29 November 2019"," 150 minutes watching people play computer games. Seriously.
","What's the point in leaving a review when there are already a couple of thousand out there? Well, this has a very high rating, I guess most of those reviews are positive, and I'd like to register a little warning for anyone looking for one.<br/><br/>In a grim future dominated by a single online game, the game's creator has hidden a huge real-world prize, with clues to find it. That idea is good, but nothing else is, and even this brings a problem, placing all the action inside the game - there are hardly any real-world scenes. Therefore the viewer spends 2.5 precious hours watching other people play computer games in which the worst that can happen is 'game over'. Serious gamers would surely sooner be playing than watching this.<br/><br/>There are references to gaming history, but far more to film and other aspects of pop culture, most of them very dated, and possibly tedious for younger viewers. OK, we all know Millennium Falcon, but how many people know what 'Valley Forge from Silent Running' is?<br/><br/>So what's so bad? Everything. There's no plot beyond the idea itself. It's way way too long for something with no plot. The characters are boring, partly because the acting is poor across the board, especially bad-guy Ben Mendelsohn who sleepwalks through. The original score is horrible, loud and intrusive. The dialogue is flat, dull and rarely funny. The direction is patchy with long sequences of sheer tedium. The FX, which dominate the movie, are same old same old, with nothing to surprise. And finally: in this future world where, supposedly, everyone plays this game, how come the adventure features a bunch of guys (with one token, fashionably feisty woman serving as love-interest) versus, you guessed it, a bunch of guys (with one token black-leather clad woman in a tiny part, presumably for the benefit of male viewers who like women in black leather)? A third female does emerge late on as a kind of (hugely predictable) joke/surprise in an even tinier part, but basically this is sexist crap for no reason.<br/><br/>Spielberg has made good films but it's been a long while. I haven't seen all his work, and wouldn't want to, but this surely must be the worst. Maybe he should go back to WW2 so he wouldn't have to bother with female characters at all."
"razzel","3","62","144","29 March 2018"," So incredibly disappointed with how much this veered from the book
","After having read the book 2 times and listening to the Audio book with Wil Wheaton reading once, I can honestly say this Ernest Cline's Ready Player One is probably in my top 10 favorites. I was so excited to see this movie. I'm pretty sure that I have never been as disappointed with a movie from a book as I was with this. Other than the general game story line and the general basis for the characters, 80 percent of this movie was almost like a different story. If you are going for the wonderful 80s nostalgia of the book, skip this and reread...or listen to the audio version (Wil Wheaton does a great job). This made me really sad to see. With Steven Spielberg's clout in Hollywood, I don't know what happened to all the movie and game references. They are just gone. I gave this 2 stars, because if I hadn't been such a fan of the book, I probably would have found it entertaining."
"pbingen","5","20","40","5 April 2018"," The story could have been better. It feels like an ok 80's movie.
","This is a pretty good movie visually, especially the first hour, but the story lacks in depth and panders to a very young audience. Probably a kid would consider it a great movie as it keeps the tension all the time, but from an adult who grew up in the 80's perspective some scenes are ridiculous and things that are supposed to be jokes do not land well. And this movie relies a lot on nostalgia so it should had been targeted for adults plotwise. I saw it in a theater full of adults.<br/><br/>The movie is better in the first hour, but the plot gets less interesting after it and it is not clear why they are doing what they end up doing. In general you get a sense of risk and adventure, but the characters do not convince you of their badassery too much, you sort of have to assume they are talented. But then some of the decisions made by the protagonists may leave you disappointed and the end does not leave you too convinced that a great thing was achieved.<br/><br/>It does not help that the main enemy is stereotypically uncool and bland, it is hard to feel that the main good characters are in great danger when their nemesis is sort of a dork. I don't know if this was put there as a homage to the 80's as then it was common to have jerky guys as the bad guys, but it's 2018 and today it is clear that enemies also can have valid motives and attractive qualities. This makes the heroes shine more at the end.<br/><br/>The movie is still watchable if you have no expectations (or low if you are a Spielberg cult member) and focus on the fantasy side. It has some maze qualities that are also enjoyable. But be prepared to see very silly plot twists, jokes, and attitudes in every character.<br/><br/>I know some enjoy seeing Spielberg failing at delighting with his wizardry, but honestly is a good movie and making a movie that is less delightful only proves his greatness by missing one shoot after many on target. In its attention to visual detail is it very attractive and you only wish the movie had a more deep story. But pulling off a story for all ages is a very difficult thing and I am not surprised that some people find it brilliant if it speaks to them (this is a feel good story at heart). But I am always ready to suspend my disbelief and plugin into any adventure and I found it difficult to be awed by this movie."
"EnoVarma","9","46","104","22 March 2018"," Ready Player Wonder
","It's clearly overlong. The cute characters tend towards one-dimensional, some of the soundtrack choices are dull and the dialogue could have been sharper. In the end, however, all aspects mentioned are good enough and get the job done making it possible to let loose the mightiest cinematic imagination known to man: Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>This 71 year old multi-billionaire is the bees knees. While the movie adaptation may disappoint some of the fans of Mr. Cline's book (understandably), those interested in pure cinema will find a genius working at the height of his powers creating an entire believable fantasy world on the canvas. Spielberg's unparallelled technique always guides the eye in the right place even in the film's most frenzied moments. Raoul Walsh once stated that there is only one correct place for the camera, and Spielberg understands this - even when he is orchestrating one of his jaw-dropping tracking shots.<br/><br/>RP1 is a ride. It's the most fun you can have at the movies right now. The whole movie is such a tidal wave of cinematic wonder that the actors will not get much attention. But it is a nice cast. Tye Sheridan is a talented actor and shines with sweet sincerity. Ben Mendelsohn makes for a decent villain. And Mark Rylance once again steals the picture with another relatable characterization."

","Full disclosure. I've never read the book. I am an avid gamer. I love RPGs. I love pop culture. I love Superheros. I love Anime. I grew up watching many of the references in this film. From the moment I saw the first trailer I was hooked and intrigued how this would play out. Would it be as shallow as it looked? Would it fold under the weight of its own ambition? Would it be played seriously or fun?<br/><br/>Going in blind but hopeful was probably a blessing in disguise. I really didn't know what to expect. I've long stopped trusting reviews (he says, writing a review) for our experiences of what we see on screen are so subjective, it doesn't really matter what other people think or feel or (allegedly) what they are paid to say. It really only matters what a movie does for you. <br/><br/>For the first time, perhaps ever, I felt the movie was written just for me. The geek in me cracked a smile from the very first scene and it never left. Yes, the pulp culture references were cool, but it was more than just a painting where you point out the cameos. <br/><br/>As a commentary on where we are as a society and where it could go in the future, it was interesting to see the widespread adoption of VR. Some of the themes are already happening, others not too far away. The question of ""why do stuff in the real world when you can do it better in the online world"" is one already being asked. There's a great montage of the real world inhabitants doing a wide range of activities in their own houses, looking absolutely ridiculous but not giving a damn.<br/><br/>The actual mechanics of the Oasis plays out like a cross between facebook, Warcraft, multiplayer first person shooters - basically anything that we have online. There really isn't a game there other than freedom and the hunt for the easter egg. You just try and gain as much stuff and experience to level up, whilst paying in real world money to get better gear and weapons. Pretty accurate as things go. <br/><br/>The main plot for the control of the Oasis and the hunt for the Easter Eggs is as simple as anything in Lord of the Rings. But its the journey we go through, both in the Oasis and the real world where the paradoxes are expertly played out. There is subtle touches that may be missed (the Oasis, where everybody goes to be social, yet nobody knows your real name), the deception of everything (you have a best friend, but you don't even know what they look like), the battle against the corporations who want to use the Oasis for advertising (ring a bell?) against those that just want to keep it free. These and more themes are constantly questioned but never really explored in any detail - they are background hints served as world building as to not distract from the spectacle of the action. <br/><br/>And what action. For once, a trailer hasn't spoiled the best bets, there are entire acts of the film that are simply mind blowing. The balance between real/oasis is almost perfect, and constantly the witty script had me smiling and laughing. <br/><br/>But...and it is a but...the reliance on pulp culture means its not for everybody. What I found hilarious, others may just stare at the screen in confusion. Its a toure de force of previous films and characters from all walks of life, across multiple genres and brings in RPG techniques that many people may not fully get. <br/><br/>But if you do get it, then boy, do you get it. An outstanding achievement in film making, and to be honest, one I never thought we would have the pleasure of watching."

However I DO NOT understand how Ernst Cline would allow them to butcher his story so horribly. <br/><br/>Casting was on point and saved this from being hot garbage. <br/><br/>If you never read the book, you will enjoy the show but still feel rushed. This EPIC journey turns into a fast frantic pace that makes ZERO sense besides to push to the end of the movie."
"davidcookmedic","3","32","73","30 March 2018"," Poor adaptation of the book
","I know, they cant always make the movie like the book. The problem is that they changed a great many things from the book to make the movie. And the greatest tragedy of it all was they stripped out huge 80's nostalgia and reference that were within the book, even when not obvious the author was always sneaking in 80's stuff (his own little easter eggs). They did stick in pop culture reference, but not like how the book did it.<br/><br/>As a movie, its just another action flick with great graphics. The casting was just fine and the actors did a fine job, but stripping out the 80's (Spielberg did sneak in what he could, for example there are a couple times when you hear ""back to the future"" sounds) really brought this movie down from what could have been a really rad movie."
"PhanaticGamer","3","25","55","2 April 2018"," A Disappointing Adaptation
","As a lover of the book, I was very disappointed in Spielberg's movie adaptation. The whole thing felt like a dumb Marvel action movie, and less of a dramatic thriller that takes a deeper look into a dystopian reality of a world that's gone wrong from the poor choices of the human race, and where VR is used as a coping mechanism.<br/><br/>The movie opts to capitalize more on modern pop culture instead of the 80's, although the book states that Halliday, a child of the 80's, had created the OASIS to reflect his own interests. The pop culture references felt like nerd pandering, although you could make the same argument for the book; however, the difference being that the cultural references in the book are used to further the plot, while in the movie, they are oftentimes simple throwaways.<br/><br/>I am perhaps most upset by the character choices and how much of the mystique is removed by revealing their identities fairly early in the movie. The audience is never given enough time to build up the characters and the relationships between them, and therefor it never feels like there are truly any stakes. <br/><br/>The book is told in first-person from Wade, and therefore we are on the journey with him trying to decipher the clues that Halliday had left. This made the book version feel much more methodical an also centered the the story. The film instead has its plot all over the place and much of it doesn't make much sense. (ex. In five years, nobody ever thought to drive in reverse?)<br/><br/>Although typically a cash grab move, I actually feel like the story would have benefited if it was broken up into 2 or 3 movies. This would have given the characters enough time to be fleshed out and actually have an arc. The film feels incredibly bloated and never seems to know what is actually wants to say and why we should ultimately care.<br/><br/>I am curious to see if other people share my same sentiments, especially of those who read the book. I am finding it very difficult to find a review from someone who didn't seem to either somewhat enjoy the movie or downright think it's amazing."
"joshbarton15","9","34","79","20 March 2018"," In Spielberg we trust
","Steven Spielberg is a director whose name is synonymous with Hollywood blockbusters, having played such a big part in pioneering what they are in film today. Take a look through his back catalogue and you'll see Spielberg has delivered some of the most revered blockbusters of all time. Ready Player One sees Spielberg jump back into the sci-fi fold and it's safe to say that he well and truly feels at home delivering plenty of thrills and spills.<br/><br/>When it's revealed that James Halliday (Mark Rylance), the deceased creator and owner of the OASIS, a virtual reality world where people can live out their wildest fantasies, has left three challenges for all players to participate and gain total control of the OASIS as well as his entire fortune, it falls upon Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) a.k.a. Parzival in the OASIS to solve how Halliday's past holds the key to their future. He faces a race against time though in the shape of Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), a corporation man hellbent on getting his hands on both the fortune and control of the OASIS.<br/><br/>It's so great to see Steven Spielberg back in the genre of sci-fi, with some of my favourite films of his including Jurassic Park and E.T. coming from a genre he clearly thrives within. The idea of Ready Player One is one that would light up the eyes of a director like Spielberg, what with it's vast virtual world and array of pop culture references (including works of his own), and it's one that he takes full advantage of, delivering a film full of explosive spectacle and pulsating action.<br/><br/>Spielberg is my favourite director and I've always been amazed by the sense of adventure he creates when crafting his films. Within the OASIS of Ready Player One, Spielberg delivers some of the most visually stunning sequences I've seen in a long time, made somewhat more spectacular by the impeccable visual effects on show, handy when a large portion of the film is set within the OASIS. The visuals combined with the kinetic energy of the action make for such a feast for the eyes and, even when there's so much happening on screen, nothing seems to get lost in the background.<br/><br/>This was the worry going into Ready Player One; that all it would be is just a mishmash of pop culture references that ultimately amount to nothing. While the story might be quite basic and there doesn't seem to be much room for any character development, the references are used in such inventive ways throughout, the highlight being an incredibly entertaining sequence that sees Spielberg toying around with proceedings at the Overlook Hotel, proving that he still knows how to make us all jump. Kids could be left mentally scarred mind.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Ready Player One features a cast who all help maintain the film's energy to varying degrees. Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke are certainly actors who have very bright futures ahead of them while Ben Mendelsohn showcasing why he should be the go-to-guy for villainous roles in future projects, his turn as Sorrento here being one of the film's high points. <br/><br/>While Ready Player One may not be Spielberg's greatest film, it provides a near two-and-a half hour experience at the cinema full of immense fun. It'll be interesting to read the source material however, for now, I'd advise anyone to just buckle up and enjoy the wild ride."

","I get it! It's not a page for page recreation of the book, but that's what happens in adaptations.<br/><br/>Cline wrote the book, and helped write the script. In college i learned that the most important part of adapting books to scripts is telling the linear narrative. <br/><br/>How do we get Wade from point A to point B while keeping as many elements of the book without it being obtrusive on the narrative. <br/><br/>In this respect, the film nails it in spades 
It's Spielberg at his most creative. He directs in a world full of possibilities and wonder that serve as eye candy while the story thrusts us into this dystopian Ohio. <br/><br/>In the end, it's a fun, escapist film that reminds those of us of a certain age how great are childhoods were, with literally 1000's of pop culture references. <br/><br/>But read the book along with seeing the movie, to round out the whole narrative. <br/><br/>Both are excellent!!"

The story was absolutely horrible. So many deus ex machinas, so many illogical and forced plot points, overly prolonged run time, bad cgi, littered with cringe moments.

","The movie is action packed and has some good graphics, but the script is terrible. I won't even bother explaining all the flaws in the script but there are some serious logical errors which can not be over looked.<br/><br/>I found the character development all wrong also. The main character Wade gives up his real name in a game where the rule among players is never to give up your real name. He is supposed to be this loner player who has been playing the game for a long time, lost his parents to the game, but he slips from his hard nosed personality and then gives up his name because the writers can't think of another way to move the movie forward.<br/><br/>The movie has a bunch of references to old school video games and it was predictable to know that of all the Atari games, the one that would be the special game to player was Adventure. My family disliked me speaking about all the old references but I couldn't help myself as I saw them pop up. ""Oh that was from the movie Krull"" or ""Oh that is from a game called...""<br/><br/>Sigh. For action, the movie was good but I disliked everything else. The direction, the writing, the character development and the ending was forced. There was no fluidity to the movie.

"darryl-42069","9","16","34","31 March 2018"," A pop culture reference heaven.
","<WARNING: MILD SPOILERS AHEAD><br/><br/>Ready Player One is one of my most anticipated movie of 2018. I mean, King-Kong, T-rex from Jurassic Park, The DeLorean, and many more all in one movie? Sold. I was born in 2001. I'm 17 years old now. I wasn't supposed to know all these old references considering my age, so why I'm excited for a movie filled with mostly 80'-90's pop culture? It's because I grew up with them. I grew up with Mega Man, Street Fighter, and many more. I don't even watched The Iron Giant yet! (I'll watch it, I promise). But nevertheless, the hype is unbearable to me. The hype just get even better when I found out that the movie is directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg. This movie can't go wrong, right?<br/><br/>At last, the wait is finally over. Totally worth it.<br/><br/>For starters, the cast are great! Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Bel Mendelsohn really did a great job as Parzival/Wade, Art3mis/Samantha, and Nolan Sorrento respectively. The supporting cast did a great job as well. Simon Pegg, Mark Rylance, and T.J. Miller stood out for me. They really did a good job as Ogden, James Halliday, and i-R0k (though I don't really buy the latter as a bad guy).<br/><br/>The visual effects are stunning! Everything looks stunning and mesmerizing. The action scenes were frantic and fast, yet we still be able to tag along. The music really stood out for me. Alan Silvestri's score is both loud and exciting, and makes all the action more intense and more impactful.<br/><br/>The pop-culture references... There's sooo many of them, so multiple screenings required for you easter-egg hunters. And these references, they all felt necessary to be there, and some of it actually took a big part of the story. I lost count of how many times I genuinely ecstatic to see some of the pop culture reference that I recognize appears on the screen. Chun-Li, and the Hadouken from Street Fighter, the Akira bike, Tracer from Overwatch, the Spartans from Halo, Chucky the Killer, etc. You name it, you got it. The best part? A player summoned a Gundam in Japanese during the big battle against Mechagodzilla (reminds me of Mako from Pacific Rim).<br/><br/>However, this movie isn't perfect. There are some issues I had with the movie. There's really a lot of exposition; people telling us the story, rather than moving along with the story. This happens a lot of times, and It bogged down the movie a bit. Some of the references were shoehorned in some scenes that I thought was unnecessary. And finally, the ending isn't satisfying in my opinion, needs something more than that.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed Ready Player One. It was worth the wait, and is currently one of my favorite movies this year. I do hope they make a sequel, but considering that the author of the book is currently writing the sequel, I don't think that we're gonna have one soon. Go watch this movie at a theater near you as soon as possible. 3D viewing is recommended for even more appreciation to all the work that's been made."

I see some reviews saying that there are too many references but I honestly think the could've put more in. As soon as ""Jump"" by Van Halen started at the beginning of the film I squeeled with delight<br/><br/>Ready Player One surprised me. When I saw everyone saying Black Panther was the greatest Marvel movie ever I got hyped. Then I saw it and was disappointed.

"jaredpahl","8","9","17","8 April 2018"," Spielberg Returns to the Blockbuster in This Technologically Astounding Video Game Adventure.
","The King of the Blockbuster is back! In the decade since reuniting with George Lucas and Harrison Ford for the shamefully underrated Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Steven Spielberg has tackled the heavy subjects of World War One, The Emancipation Proclamation, and the Cold War. With the exception of a couple of big budget duds (Tintin and the BFG), the man who practically invented the summer blockbuster had seemed to grow out of crowd-pleasing summer fun. Ready Player One isn't quite a summer movie, but it is in the great tradition of Spielberg Action Extravaganzas. Enormous, assured, and a whole Hell of a lot of fun, RP1 is the type of blockbuster that nobody else in Hollywood is even trying to make. An original script based on an original novel, visualized by a cinematic genius, and played without a constant, prying eye on the sequels, team-ups, and tie-ins... Marvel, eat your heart out.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is based on the novel written by Earnest Cline, in which a young gamer, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) attempts to complete the quest for the Ultimate Easter Egg. Within the virtual world of the OASIS, late creator James Halliday (Mark Rylance) has hidden three keys, which unlock the gate to the Egg, and gives the winner total control over the grandest virtual world ever conceived. Cline's novel had the potential to open itself up to limitless story possibilities. The imagination runs wild thinking of the spectacular challenges that might face Wade's avatar Parzival and his merry team of Egg Hunters (or Gunters), Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), Aech, Daito, and Sho. Cline totally squandered all the potential his premise had. Most of the challenges in the book revolve around playing dated video games (with a controller and TV) within the virtual world, and coasting through such fantastic movie worlds as War Games and Monty Python (sarcasm intended). The book is shockingly unimaginative in the way it plays in what is the world's biggest sandbox. A total rip-off!<br/><br/>Thank God for Steven Spielberg. The man has more imagination in his little finger than Cline has in his whole body, and his movie capitalizes on the book's premise as fully as anyone could have hoped for. The first challenge; forget playing an arcade game, how about a sensational race through a virtual New York City? The second challenge; forget playing another arcade game, this time within War Games. How about a rollicking trip through the labyrinth-like Overlook Hotel in The Shining? I won't spoil the final challenge, but take my word for it, like everything in RP1, it is imaginative in ways that Ernie Cline's book never dreamed of.<br/><br/>Spielberg realizes how transporting the OASIS would be, and transport us he does. That first race is one of the best action scenes I've seen in years, so much more effective in visualizing space and movement than every other rockem-sockem, building-crumbling, CGI action-fest in theaters today. It has impact. The action of Ready Player One is as loud and chaotic as most disposable modern special effects pictures, but the difference is that with Spielberg, it makes visual and aural sense. The big battles, races, fights, etc. are almost all completely CGI, and the mayhem is cranked up past maximum, but that is what you would expect action in the OASIS to be. The overblown, CG, motion capture world full of nostalgic references is less Spielberg straining for effect than it is a visualization of how our current culture of hyperactive leeching of the past can take over society.<br/><br/>And on those digital effects from ILM. It's been years since I've seen a movie that I felt pushed moviemaking technology forward. Avatar might be the last time a film has showcased special effects that felt ""new"". Ready Player One felt new to me. We've all seen so much CGI, motion capture, and the like in movies that the phrase ""How did they do that?"" just isn't uttered anymore. Everything is CG, and most CG looks good. The sense of discovery is all but gone. However, throughout this picture I wondered to myself ""How. Did. They. Do. That?"" Spielberg uses the special effects here to liberating effect. Anything you can imagine doing in the OASIS is done. It's creativity run amok, and still, you take it all in stride. Imagining what it would be like to search the James Halliday archives or step inside a decades old movie is enough, but Spielberg and ILM's ability to make that stuff real is not to be taken for granted. This is an amazing piece of special effects work, surely deserving of an Oscar, and despite some good performances, especially from Ben Mendelsohn as the corporate villain Nolan Sorrento, it's the best reason to see Ready Player One.<br/><br/>What a refreshing movie this Ready Player One is. An original story idea is hard to come by, especially when it comes to popcorn munching entertainment. An original story crafted with an expert eye for cinematic detail is rarer yet. Ready Player One has both. It also has problems. Mostly with the few elements of the book that did make their way to the film. For example, the love story is pointless and half-baked, and the ultimate lesson of ""spend more time in the real world"" comes out of nowhere in the last two minutes. But after suffering through years of mind numbing, forgettable summer blockbusters, it sure feels nice to get something this rich, substantial, and genuinely fun. Technologically forward thinking, but with a foot planted firmly in blockbuster past, RP1 is the perfect antidote for all that is wrong with genre film today. My hope is that with this movie, Steven Spielberg can inspire more of this kind of entertainment in Hollywood. But even if other directors don't follow his lead, The King of the Blockbuster has proved that even in 2018, he is still the rightful ruler of the throne.<br/><br/>86/100"

Anyway, Spielberg paints a very dismal dystopia in which everyone escapes into a virtual world known as Oasis because reality is just so bad. Rylance is the creator of Oasis and upon his death he promises wealth,glory and control of Oasis to the person who can solve his puzzle and win 3 keys to his kingdom. That's the basic premise. Spielberg is back in the game with this movie. He has managed to make a movie that is appealing to the Post-Millennials and well as the Millennial and Generation X. However, Baby Boomers will definitely enjoy all the references to pop culture from the last 40 years that only people who have been around for decades can really appreciate.

","REVIEW - READY PLAYER ONE <br/><br/>I was very fortunate to have been invited to see an advanced screening of this film before it's world premiere so I must just say that the following is my own personal opinion. <br/><br/>During the summer of 2017 filming for this film took place in and around Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter and Spaghetti Junction so this film as with Kingsman (which was filmed on Colmore Row) was of particular interest. <br/><br/>Tipped to be a blockbuster of a film in parts I can certainly agree, I predict it will do well at the cinema but for me the film was split, let me explain. <br/><br/>Rated 12A here in the UK the film is intended for children of 12 up and accompanied by an adult and generally the film could have got away with a general 12 rating except for one quick scene involving a very famous doll which comes to life and the human swearing (which was a shock).<br/><br/>The story was interesting enough without being too complicated, the general level of acting was OK but for me as I've said by far the only reason to go and see this film are for the parts inside the oasis!<br/><br/>For us adults there are references of the 80s both films and games and for the other audience members just the sheer pleasure of witnessing such an impressive visual computer generated world, truly amazing! But because it seems to me) most of the budget was spent on this then the real world sequences suffered. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film is very enjoyable and I intend to watch it again on DVD or streaming when its released just so I can pause it and see even more of the 80s film and game references. <br/><br/>Rating 8 out of 10"
"bjorn_k","2","4","6","5 June 2019"," Boring and illogical, certainly not for fans of video games!
","I love video games & sci-fi movies, I grew up in the 80's and haven't read the book, and considering the amount of complaints on here from people who read the book that seems to be a good thing going into this movie, so seemingly this movie should be a good fit, yet this was one of the most boring, illogical and bland movies I've seen in a very long time, and I've seen several really bad movies lately.<br/><br/>The story is just stupid & makes no sense. In a future where everyone apparently spends all their time playing video games future America has apparently somehow been able to cure the obesity problem. Everyone's apparently poor but can somehow afford to buy a lot of gaming gear and yet not have to work during the day.<br/><br/>It's supposed to take place 20 years into the future, yet most of the technology, movie, music & game references are from current time or the past with a lot of references from the 80's, so apparently kids 20 years from now are a bunch of 80's nostalgics listening to Duran Duran, 40-something years before they were even born, so what they're saying is all great entertainment was conveniently made more than 20 years ago, which just happens to coincide with when the movie was made. It's cheap and shows that they couldn't come up with anything new and original in the movie. Somehow we're just supposed to cheer over and over again for pointless old movie/game references that serve no other purpose than to just show them for ""pop culture coolness"", Yey.<br/><br/>Another example: Everyone uses VR helmets - a technology that just happens to be part of current gen consoles & PC gaming. The only ""futuristic"" item are suits where you feel every impact on your body, which apparently is a good thing in competitive gaming, which makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>This modern VR world 20 years from now somehow looks like something from a video game from the PS3 or PS4 generation, what a coincidence. Especially character models look pretty bad, and the long early racing sequence is almost as if it's taken from the PS3 game Motorstorm: Apocalypse from 2011. So, that's what another 20 years of graphics technology will get us?<br/><br/>*Spoilers ahead*
A kid who spends all his life playing video games in virtual reality is surprised that a ""girl"" he meets in VR could potentially not be a girl at all *shocking*, and falls in love with the girl because, well, he watched all her twitch streams (really, you think twitch is going to be around 20 years from now?? No, but it sounds cool today because that's what all the cool kidz use). Oh, and of course the real life girl so happens to be even prettier than the avatar girl, but with a ""hideous"" birthmark on her face, ""OH NO! How could you love someone so ugly!"" I hear the movie writers telling us.<br/><br/>The game is supposed to be all about skill, yet most of the things that happen involve using coin to purchase items, which just so happens to be extremely useful for crucial plot points, see handy time-travelling grenade.<br/><br/>Hacking and cheating is apparently a complete non-issue in a video game where you can win a billion dollars or so, yep sounds about right, and when a couple of kids are close to winning said billions of dollars, everyone else is cheering for them... right.<br/><br/>When the ""good guys"" take ownership of the VR world, shutting down the game two days of the week is apparently all you need to make people spend more time with eachother again and care more their (miserable) real lives again - and not spend all their time the remaining 5 days of the week playing the game instead. I guess that's about as much as they dared to push that agenda to please both the moms & their kids watching.
*End Spoilers*<br/><br/>Even brainless movies can be good and fun, but it's just impossible to turn the brain completely off to this degree, especially when the movie takes itself so seriously and really there's no good or fun in there. Everything is predictable and shock-full of plot holes, illogical behavior with a paper thin story and character development, I have no idea how this movie is so highly rated, and it's hard to believe that Steven Spielberg would put his name on something this bad."

","The virtual world that was brought to life in this adaptation of Ernest Cline's novel is immersive and expansive, and makes one feel like they're in massive MMORPG video game. Although the real world doesn't seem as interesting as the OASIS, the film can be a wonderful experience for pop culture fans and casual viewers alike. This is, without a doubt, one of Steven Spielberg's best movies of recent memory."
"hornerry","10","10","20","23 May 2018"," Get Ready For Ready Payer One
","I have recently seen the latest Spielberg movie, and it measures up to greats like E.T., Jaws, and Jurassic Park. Ready Player One is a movie about a virtual world called the OASIS whose creator, James Halliday (played by Mark Rylance) has died. In his will he creates a quest for control of the OASIS, which Parzival (played by Tye Sheridan) had devoted his life to winning. The quest is entirely 80s themed, and is absolutely great.
All of the actors did a great job playing their roles. One of the best was Mark Rylance. He did an exceptional job as James Halliday, and the somewhat crazy man he was. Simon Pegg, who played Ogden Morrow, did a great job being annoyed at the weird kid always wasting his time. 
I loved all the 80s references in the movie. The music was amazing, as well as all of the cameos. Although I was upset at how much it changed from the book, it was still just as good, if not better. The best scene was the final battle, by far. 
I think that the moral is overused, yet important. It teaches that reality is more important than a game. Although it is necessary, it doesn't need to be in every movie and book a child ever reads. But, unlike most movies and books, it is subtle with this moral, and it does a good job of saying it's message without full out calling video games evil, like most movies incorrectly say.
You will like this book if you were a teenager in the 80s, or even a teenager nowadays. It has a lot of 80s references, but almost every major reference can still be understood today because their about such well known things. All of the music is some of the most well-known 80s music ever, and all of the videogames are immortalized legends. It takes very little 80s or video game knowledge to understand this movie, but the more you have, the better. This movie is also rated PG-13, and I agree with that rating."
"akkusosman2","10","10","20","1 April 2018"," This movie made me want to start playing video games again
","This movie uses pop culture references raging from the past and present. These references were used in a way that not only made me feel nostalgic, but also emotional.<br/><br/>This movie has a deep message about living in the present and not getting lost in virtual households. Towards the end of the film, Parzival beats the game and gets to speak to the REAL Halliday and not his avatar. He asks him, ""why did you do all this?"" to which he responds by saying that he had a hard time socializing and communicating in the real world so he made this game. Though he says that he did have a good and fun time, he also says that you need to take off the googles once in a while to eat, sleep and use the bathroom. He says ""reality is tough, but its the only real thing we have"" meaning that we should appreciate it.And once Parzival asks another question, he just says "" Thanks for playing my game Parzival"" and exits a door that ends the game. This was really touching as the journey made me realize the tough life that Halliday.<br/><br/>Ready Player One did a great job in managing its time among scenes because they spent more time on the things that people wanted to see!! (references and such)
This is a great movie and it is trully worth the watch. It will not be a waste of your time and you will have an amazing experience.<br/><br/>GO SEE IT!!"

","I read RPO way before the movie and when I heard it was going to become a film I was so excited. Then I began becoming disappointed after I heard that the first key where we start seeing character development between Z and Art was completely ripped out and re imagined. Still as a fan of the book I wanted to give the movie a shot. I'm glad I did because it was awesome. It was completely different from the book but because I read it, I already had the full character development, and tones set. I was able to enjoy a new story with the same character which made it so much fun!"

","Steven Spielberg has been inspired by James Cameron's use of 3D in Avatar as this is a film worth watching on 3D, with set pieces that are ready made for 3D viewing.<br/><br/>Spielberg has also gone for a popcorn film full of cultural references to the 1970s and 80s. If you are a vintage arcade geek, a gamer or love 1980s film, this is the film for you.<br/><br/>You can glimpse Batman, Robocop, the Tardis, Chucky the doll, King Kong. There are references to Back to the Future, Star Trek and Spielberg sends a affectionate note to one of his idols, Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>Set in 2045, the world has gone to pot and the population immerse themselves in the virtual world of the Oasis. In Columbus, Ohio; Wade Watts is living in a hell hole called the Stacks with his aunt. He finds a key to an adventure left by the late designer of the Oasis. Wade with his virtual friends have to race to against a ruthless corporation to gain further keys which gives the winner the ownership of the virtual kingdom.<br/><br/>The characters are thinly sketched, Wade does come across as naive, displaying a person who has spent more time in a virtual world than real one. The plot is straightforward, nothing very much deep here.<br/><br/>Spielberg has infused the film with lots of fun and action. However at times it is too simplistic. When the police show up at the end of the movie, you do wonder where they were for the rest of the time as the bad guys seem to have the real world all to themselves. The villain must have a really bad memory if he needs to write THAT password down on a piece of paper."
"koroxx","7","25","63","26 March 2018"," Not as good as the book, but a very good movie anyways!
","Spielberg give us a very good movie, full of geeky references - video games, comics, movies (fans of horror movies too will be thrilled) - and more than that, a very good sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>All the geeky stuff shown in the trailers are far to be the most important part of this movie. The overall universe is interesting (real world too, not only the Oasis).<br/><br/>Being fan of the book, I'm not happy with all the changes made (the first trial to get the first key is now a deadly race, and some characters killed in the books survive in the movie). BUT there is some nice ideas too (The second trial, genius).
And of course they scraped some geeky japanese references that 90% of people won't have understand, but fortunately they kept some of the most famous ones, which brings us an awsome fight!<br/><br/>Good job Spielberg, 71years old but still making very good movies for the young audience, way better than most of the blockbusters we see nowadays."
"BlackGlobe","6","8","16","6 May 2018"," Set up good. Execution, meh.
","I was excited to finally see this one. I had heard that this movie was chock full of all kind of pop culture references, odes to previous science fiction movies, Steven Spielberg and 80's music all wrapped up in a vitrual reality world. What's not to like? Well, a lot. It's funny that the narrated explanation of the time, place, backstory and plot by the main character that takes place before we see the name of the movie on the screen was more interesting than the stuff afterwards. The movie is too long. The villain is not evil enough. Sure it's fun to see Mega Godzilla, the Martian ship from War of the Worlds, The Iron Giant, and even the Alien explode out of someone's chest all in the same movie, but when the high tech virtual army given orders to prevent you at all costs from getting the three keys and winning the game turns out to be a bumbling band of nit wits seemingly dumber than the Keystone Cops that was a bit of nostalgia unecessary. King Kong was the only character that was scary, and that's another movie altogether. It should have ended after the winning player (our hero) finally meets his idol and mentor and obtains the Easter Egg. It was an emotional scene worthy of a finish, but then we have to sit through another resolution between our hero and the Curator. It probably meant something, but at this point I stopped paying attention. The movie's ending only served the purpose of pushing the film's total run time to about fifteen minutes past the two hour mark, and had a cheesy "" there's no place like home"" slant to it, but The Wizard if Oz was a better movie."

Even though the author Ernest Cline co-wrote the screenplay, it has only superficial resemblance to the book. I won't be specific because I don't want to spoil anything but absolutely NOTHING from the challenges in the book appear in the movie. It's as if they picked a few lines from the book, used the basic premise, and wrote an entirely different story. If you really like the book, stay away from this disaster."

I've since read it and noticed how different they are, so if you're a fan of the book, prepare for it to divert from the source material pretty heavily! That being said, I think actually I prefer the film!<br/><br/>I'm glad I hadn't seen any of the promo posters (other than the main one with the whole cast) or much of the trailers, which I'd say avoid (along with looking at the cast list), unless you want a couple of surprises spoilt.<br/><br/>It's fun, fast-paced and exciting, and I was immediately won over by the 80s music on the soundtrack. I was drawn in almost immediately, and have since seen the movie 3 times. <br/><br/>It's a great movie for any videogame fan, and the references to other franchises are a fun nod without being too in your face or gratuitous."
"sophiesophie-25719","4","14","33","31 March 2018"," Underwhelming
","As a viewer who hasn't seen the book prior to watching the film, that comparison is one I am unable to consider. From the beginning, RPO is visually pleasing. From the stacks of motorhomes to the virtual world of video games, the CGI is impeccable. However, this may be the film's only saving grace.<br/><br/>Throughout the plot, there is barely a hint of character building or at least an attempt to evoke empathy for the situations of the characters. The only emotional connection I felt when witnessing this 2 hour and 19 minute car crash was the faint nostalgia forced on us by either off-hand remarks or dubious references - I assume introduced by the book. It is not unlikely that these confused pop-culture nods are typical of Spielberg's work, however, they become ineffective as a result of the film's inability to entice me into its story. <br/><br/>RPO attempts to present two realities - one virtual and one real. However, both of these realities in fact appear as fantasy. In both worlds, each character has an alternate 'avatar' of him/herself. This is what causes it to be impossible to follow the character arcs or backstory's belonging to them. <br/><br/>Despite being underwhelmed by the lack of good quality storytelling, acting and directing, this film left me with a common question for the modern society. Is the world of fantasy and video games detaching us from reality?<br/><br/>Or was the moral one of many other themes introduced throughout the plot? Who knows.<br/><br/>You could have been so good, Ready Player One. Shame. 4/10"

"bass-player-blues","4","10","22","5 April 2018"," Endless flaws
","I can't believe that Spielberg would direct something like this... Another example of an iconic director selling out for an easy paycheck. The starting premise of the movie is very strong. In 2045 the world has become an ugly wasteland which is so depressing humanity must turn to the virtual world to cope. Not only is this a wonderful starting point for a sci-fi epic, it also relates to our society today. Unfortunately, that's where the promise ends. They try to sell you the premise that people of all ages cope with their depressing real lives by going into a video game world. The makeup of this virtual world is highly flawed for multiple reasons as it pertains to the movie. The most obvious flaw is the visual graphics. The movie is set nearly 30 years in the future but the graphics are obviously limited to our current technology. That simply doesn't work and makes the movie so easily dated in the real future. Also, the visual effects aren't even impressive by today's standards! What were they thinking????!!!<br/><br/>The movie is littered with endless 80's and 90's pop culture references. Every young character in the movie is also an expert on all of this. In 2045, are you kidding me?! How many teenagers and young adults are big into 50's pop culture today? You'd be hard pressed to find one. They also felt the need to play 80's songs for long periods multiple times in the movie yet they don't go with their respective scenes at all. At the start of the movie you're bombarded with endless explanation about the details of the virtual world. It will likely give you a headache and puts Inception to shame! If that's not bad enough they felt the need to play an upbeat 80's song I won't name during almost the entire intro of explanation, so there's that pointless distraction to deal with. <br/><br/>Another big flaw arrives if you consider what the masses would really want from a virtual world versus what's given to them... Living in a sad dystopian world, the obvious choice for escapism is a world filled with happiness and beauty. Instead they get stressful and often violent competitions in video games. What about the elderly, is that all they get too? There's only one person older than 50 in the entire movie and this individual seemingly doesn't participate in the virtual world. <br/><br/>The pacing of the film is atrociously bad, extremely rushed. The movie rarely gives you a chance to just sit back and take it in without spitting out tons of head spinning new information. The action sequences drag on and on and on like nothing I've ever seen before. If I wasn't with my family I would've walked out on the final fight scene it was so dragged out. I give it a 4/10 for having some fun escapism and redeeming qualities, but ultimately it's disposable and doesn't work."
"ayoreinf","9","7","14","10 April 2018"," I wish Spielberg will keep doing this sort of films, few are equal to him when fantasy is running wild
","Must admit, I stopped watching Spielberg's ""based on a true story"" movies long ago, shortly after Empire of the Sun, which I found so melodramatic I could hardly stand it. On the other hand, though I didn't see all his fantasy movies, I usually love'em, even when many don't (I just love Hook to pieces, despite some minor faults).
 
But lets stick to the movie at hand. It's a visually stunning story taking place mostly in a virtual universe, that is - in a movie - since that's what a well made movie really is. So in a way it's a movie about movies, filled with many inside jokes for movie buffs, or if you want to call it as they do in the movie - filled with easter eggs. The story is told superbly, this was always Spielberg's strong suit. The pace is just perfect, the movie runs for more than 2 hours without a single dull moment. Roles are well written, performed very professionally by all, though I must single out Ben Mendelsohn who really shines as the lead villain of the movie. <br/><br/>As a rule the movie adheres to the laws of the universe in which it takes place, so it makes sense inside the virtual world we're watching on screen. And as far as I'm concerned this is one of the best fantasy movies I've seen in a long while, and I did see most of the recent ones. I'll rank it in my top three or four of the last two years, but don't hold me to a strict time limit, it could well be one of the the top five of the last five years or so. If you have the opportunity go see it, it's one of those you'll need to see so you know what's everybody is speaking about in coming years."

Other than that, the story is just 'meh'. At the same level as a Transformers movie and far from being anything original or anything you were not expecting.<br/><br/>

At the end as the credits played was shocked to see ""Directed by Steven Spielberg"" flash on the screen. I really couldn't believe I'd just watched a movie by Spielberg.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is the story of life in the 2040's where people tend to shun the struggles of real life in favour of playing a virtual game the Oasis. Anyway the creator of the game as left some easter eggs in the game which need solving to gain access to a great fortune. Most of the movie is played out in the virtual world and Parzival is the online persona of Wade. He makes allegiances with various players including Art3mis. In common with lots of movies of this type you never really get much empathy with any of the characters. The plot is secondary to the visual effects, but they don't really have much impact as you don't really care less who triumphs in the game.<br/><br/>To be honest still haven't really gotten over the shock of Spielberg directing this.

"scandinavianmail","6","22","61","20 March 2018"," Very 1980s adventure coated with 2018 effects
","In Ready Player One, though having lots of exposition, Steven Spielberg delivers a wonderfully thrilling first third, but soon afterwards fails to keep the pace and lets the story to gradually succumb to over-reliance on characters and plot twists that were common in 1980s but look sorely outdated and tedious in 2018. This as such is largely in purpose as the story wants to be seen as a tribute to pop-culture - for some reason meaning the 1980s' culture only - but it doesn't make boring the audience any less acceptable. The last real highlight is a magnificent scene in the Shining's hotel.<br/><br/>The plot follows characters in the virtual reality and in the real world, jumping back and forth. Action involving the actual people is often poorly staged. Plot rushes from one place to another without much logic. Characters come and go as they please, and it is later difficult to remember what actually happened. The big end fight in the virtual world appears to be staged only because a big end fight needed to be at the end, having no logic, reason or real feeling and bringing nothing new to the long series of purposeless end fights in expensive blockbusters.<br/><br/>Hit and miss, and increasingly a miss towards the end, Ready Player One is still a reliable Spielberg that probably will entertain younger audiences more than those who actually remember the 1980s."

","One thing's for certain, I'm glad I waited till this was on demand. I knew about the book but had no interest in reading it because while I love playing video games, it's not something I'd like to read about. It's kind of like a novelization of a movie centered around a sports team. With that being said, the movie was better than I thought.<br/><br/>The CGI is very well polished and detailed and I liked how the Oasis was illustrated. Outside of the CGI, the story was severely lacking in both characters and plot.<br/><br/>The bad guys are so stereotypical it's annoying. They show no other degree of personality outside of being the typical cutthroat corporate types. The good guys also lacked any degree of human emotion outside. Outside of playing in the Oasis, there was little at stake for the main cast. The movie centers on straying away from online media but it touches base on this notion very lightly. In truth, the movie is really about how many pop culture references can you cram in a 140 min runtime.<br/><br/>I'm on for nostalgia if it actually compliments the ongoing story set in the present. RPO sort of treats nostalgia like an excited four year old kid who can't stop pointing and shouting at his favorite pop culture icon from the 80s.<br/><br/>As for the plot of the movie, it was all right if not too predictable. The final battle felt bloated and could had easily been shaved in half its runtime. I was too busy checking my watch than actually watching that scene.<br/><br/>This is a great movie to watch if you're bored."

","I can't believe that Ernest Cline sat and had input to the screenplay that murdured his fantastic book. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD. <br/><br/>if you read the book as an 80's nostalgia or gamer and found the way in which the story I sound through the geek filled history of console gaming then prepare to be completely disappointed. <br/><br/>This film gives literally the slightest nod to the idea of the books story and then creates its own alternate version. <br/><br/>Here are a few major issues:<br/><br/>1) The events in which the keys are discovered are depicted in a very different way from the book with the first being completely made up. <br/><br/>2) No back story on Ludus or the education system Wade Watts is enrolled in and the multiple copies of educational worlds. <br/><br/>3) Ogden Morow only appears at the very end of the film, he does not appear in the night club and aid in stopping the IOI attack. <br/><br/>4) Wade Watts doesn't infiltrate IOI, instead this version has Samantha (who is now some kind of rebel uprising leader - what?) captured by IOI instead! <br/><br/>5) Daito isn't killed in this version of the story. A part of the story I thought was quite the critical mechanism to really pump the readers hatred for IOI. <br/><br/>In terms of the film existing without the book having ever having been written - I feel Spielberg has done much better in the past. Some of the effects were stunning and additions such as the Iron Giant were welcome as they added perhaps a bit of general audience relateability. However the story even if the book didn't exist sort of chucked you in, the love and romance was very in your face pretty much from the start with no build up. <br/><br/>As someone who read the book however, extremely disappointed in both Spielberg and Cline for murmuring a great story."

","I had no preconceptions about Ready Player One before seeing this movie EXCEPT that I had grown up watching Spielberg films and so, had a soft spot for his work. I hadn't read the book on which it was based nor had I read any reviews. I was pretty much as blank a slate as a movie buff could be. <br/><br/>Coming out the other side, though, I feel a little embarrassed. Like I had just watched my dad attempt to impress my school friends with some poorly executed popping and locking. <br/><br/>I do understand that there are only so many archetypal routes a narrative can take so perhaps this film was intended for an audience of young and pre teens. However, Ready Player One appears to take the easiest cliche's from the idea of the hero's journey and renders them as predictably as humanly possible. At no time did I feel that any of the characters - nice or nasty - were risking anything or going anywhere new. The pop culture references were tired, obvious and overly commercialised at the time of their birth (believe me: I was there in the 80's) and time has done them no favours. The acting had occasional signs of life but were generally wooden. The CGI offered nothing new or interesting. <br/><br/>I really, truly wanted to like this film but to me it was a sad, tired money grab. Icky."
"The_Film_Auditor","8","5","10","17 July 2018"," Great Spielberg Adventure Film
","As a lover of Spielberg, I had high expectations for this film, and to be honest, I was not let down. Ready Player One tells a simple yet captivating story filled with interesting puzzles, pop culture references, and great action sequences. I enjoyed how the story felt like an adventure that had components similar to a quest in a video game such as collecting items, solving puzzles, and overcoming obstacles. I think this was a smart choice since it made the notion that the Oasis was a video game much more believable. I also really enjoyed the action sequences in this film. I am not the biggest fan of action movies, but I thought this film shot the scenes tastefully. The racing scene and the large battle near the end of the film were two of the action scenes that really stood out to me. There were not a whole lot of quick cuts and blurry visual effects, proving that Spielberg and his team put time and effort into those scenes.<br/><br/>Many people seem to have complaints about the film's use of pop culture references, some even calling it ""Super Smash Bros: The Movie."" I would disagree with many of these criticisms. I felt as though most of the references did not distract or take away from the film. Sure, there were moments of, ""Oh look there is..."" but overall, I did not think that I was constantly being taken out of the experience. I also think that it is realistic that everyone in the Oasis is some sort of licensed avatar. Look at games like VR Chat today, all the people running around in that game are using a licensed avatar. In my opinion, I enjoyed the references (minus the terrible line about Twitch streams) and thought it was a unique experience seeing all of the pop culture icons on screen at the same time.<br/><br/>Even though I enjoyed the film, there were some definite issues I had with it. The first issue I had, which seems to be a popular criticism, was that the characters did not have a ton of depth. You got some brief backstory on some of the characters, but mostly the motivations for the actions were brushed over rather quickly. There were many times I craved for backstory or relationships to be more developed such as the relationship between Wade and his aunt, what happened to Wade's parents, and a few other plot points. Another issue that I had with the film was that the initial 15 minutes felt very expositional. I understand that the film had a lot to explain to setup the story, but I think it could have done a better job in the beginning of showing instead of telling through narrative exposition.
Ready Player One had some issues, but overall, I think it was an enjoyable film. The quest-like plot structure along with some interesting surprises made the film a captivating and fun experience. I would recommend this film to people who enjoy action adventure films, video games, and/or science fiction.<br/><br/>The Good:
<ul><li>Fun adventure story</li><li>Some interesting surprises</li><li>Great visual effects</li><li>Execution of action sequences</li></ul>The Bad:
<ul><li>The shallow depth of most characters</li><li>A great deal of expositional dialog initially</li><li>Mentioning Twitch...</li></ul>"

","Ready Player One is a terrific film with a very well written plot and an immensely talented cast. The film is truly like no other, establishing a very beautiful and unique spectacle from the get go, creating a virtual reality world that we get so entranced in that we often forget its fictional. The animation is truly beautiful and believable, the many references to pop culture were very entertaining, and the film's overall message is immensely heartwarming. <br/><br/>One thing I will say about this film that dropped from a potential nine to an eight for me was a major lack of character development. No one, even Wade, are given enough scope for us to truly care and be concerned for their well being. While I was in a complete trance at all the action sequences, that was more so because of how beautiful it looked rather than supporting the characters. <br/><br/>While they may be underdeveloped, the cast all still make a terrific show of their characters. Tye Sheridan is very effective as the lead, Olivia Cooke is a great love interest, Ben Mendelsohn steals every scene as a cliched video game villain, Lena Waithe is a hilarious best friend, Simon Pegg is completely transformed in to this role that is greatly different from who he is, and Mark Rylance annihilates as Halliday, a role he really immerses himself in to. <br/><br/>Immense fun from beginning to end. Action packed and heartwarming, Ready Player One is a solid adventure that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good Sci-Fi or family film.<br/><br/>

","If there is any director who can make a successful and really the first great video game adaptation, he will be, of course, Steven Spielberg. The most thing I was worried about in Ready Player One is if it will be a mere thrill ride filled with many pop-culture references rather than it will be a movie with a good story. It turned out that I was right, but only about the first part. This movie is an epic adventure that will mesmerize all nerds and geeks, but it will also satisfy the real cinephiles who seek a movie with a smart and original story. In fact, this movie's story is really powerful and thought-provoking. I found myself engaged with the story and the characters, and also busy as much as the characters as if I was putting the pieces of the puzzle with them. <br/><br/>The performances are good, but the movie didn't rely and focus on the dramatic aspect as much as on the adventure aspect. For me this isn't a problem at all, because the movie should be experience it as an epic adventure, like Avengers: Infinity War, not as your typical movie experience. <br/><br/>That being said, Ben Mendelsohn as the villain, Nolan Sorrento, gave an awesome performance, and the character itself is very compelling, and it could be the best depiction of a clumsy villain I see in years. Unfortunately, The beta villain, F'Nale Zandor, is a pale character, and Hannah John-Kamen made this character even worse with an over-the-top performance. I felt that she was trying so hard to be like Gazelle in Kingsman The Secret Service, but she is far from Sofia Boutella wonderful performance. <br/><br/>I think using the narration to set up the story fast wasn't a good decision, but looking at the full half of the glass, that made the fun begins early, so this kinda a half issue. <br/><br/>The movie looks great, and the visual effects are breathtaking. Most of the movie is animated, and the animation is very beautiful and looks like the animation that has been used in video games rather than in animated movies. And that fits perfectly with the theme of the movie. Ready Player One definitely should be nominated for the Oscar for best Visual Effects, for best Sound mixing, for best Sound Editing, and I hope it will be nominated for best Animated Movie!<br/><br/>Ready Player One is my second favorite movie of 2018, but it's hands down the most enjoyable movie I've seen this year, and one of the most enjoyable movies I've watched in my life. <br/><br/>I still can't believe how this Overlook Hotel sequence has been shot..... no...no... sorry, I forgot it's a SPIELBERG film!<br/><br/>(9/10)"

This was definitely spectacular, and there were so many details. I love the overwhelming amount of familiar characters that there were to be seen throughout the entire movie. There were so many pop culture characters and obscure characters that only true nerds of movies, gaming, comics, etc. would recognize. It was especially awesome to see Jason Voorhees and Spawn make appearances as avatars in the movie as well.<br/><br/>There was a good flow to the movie and it kept its upbeat pace all the way to the very end, and that made for some entertaining stuff.<br/><br/>I will say that the movie is worth watching again, not for the story or the special effects, but for picking out familiar characters used as Oasis avatars in the movie, that would be quite a task.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Ready Player One"" is definitely worth taking the time to sit down and watch.

"jonahpad","9","5","10","19 June 2018"," Excellent Interpretation of the Book
","The movie is not the same as the book in many ways, but the screenplay was done with Ernest Cline fully involved - so if it is OK with the author then that is fine it is the Author's right to do what he wants with it. Besides which American movie studios have totally misrepresented actual historical events to the point of sillyness in film it seems a bit ludicrous to castigate a movie about a VR world and game for not being ""true"" - laughable really. As for the actual movie it was brilliant, well scripted, pacey, just the right mixture of every aspect of making a proper action movie by the numbers, which Mr Spielberg, as always makes look effortless. As a child of the 70s / 80s and a gamer I loved everything about the movie, I still have a working Atari 2600 console and a PET and a Dragon stashed and a Commodore 64 stashed somewhere, and some games. The cultural references in the movie were and are an integral part of my life and work ever since. So for me this movie was a blast from the past and hugely enjoyable. Not Oscar materiel but then neither was Star Wars or Back to the Future, and look what boring rubbish did win top awards in the 80s - Driving Miss Daisy was one - seriously! My point is that Ready Player One is about gaming and computing history and pop culture underneath the story, so it does not really matter about the story I loved it for the sheer joy of trivia that is important to millions of the original geek generation I was, and still am, a fully paid up member being displayed. Lastly the one thing as a kid I used to dream of was a fully immersive VR gaming system, as did probably everyone else my age into arcade games, and yes it did start with Adventure and The Atari 2600 and now I have Occulus Rift - so this move may turn out to be close to the truth in 2045. How ironic that would be for Hollywood who where they never knowingly tell the truth about anything."

Spielberg out did himself with his creative vision of this retelling of the novel, and the visuals were positively stunning. For any gamer, this is an absolute must see.

The movie depicts a not so distant and plausible future of gaming in VR/AR, which also touches upon the realities of the gaming culture, including its advantages and drawbacks. Not only did the movie deliver on its acting performances, but it also keeps the audience engaged throughout. Comparing every scene of the movie to the accuracy of the book isn't prudent and unfair to those who haven't read the books and simply went to watch the movie.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

So I want to set the record straight, once and for all."" - In other words, see it as an extension of the book, another way to tell the story from the eyes of other people."

There are (sometimes quite big) differences between the book and the film, but the latter does an excellent job of capturing the spirit of the original.
I saw it with my wife and children, none of whom has read the book and all of whom love the film.

NONE of the quests are the same, NONE of the characters are portrayed correctly and I'm just so disappointed that Ernest Cline's work was interpreted so poorly. I know that fitting a story so rich in details into such a small amount of time can be difficult but they could've kept at least SOME of the actual story in it! It's like the writers saw the cover of the book, flipped through the first couple of pages and then said ""yeah ok I get the gist of it"". And what a corny and played out ending, ""Everyone's happy! The bad guy gets shoved into a cop car! Everyone is alive and well and our two leads make out on a couch!"". The end wasn't supposed to be happy but more a bittersweet victory.

They didn't try to follow the story lines or specific actions/contributions from the characters at all.

This is an example of political correctness in movies destroying the movie. Yes, it panders to feminists, but it destroys the villain, who should be respected and feared, not put down and mocked.
We also get a tick-box set of nationalities as the cast, but there's no chemistry between the characters. All movies now are becoming the same.

","Directed by Steven Spielberg.

(PG-13)<br/><br/>Shortly after the creator (Rylance) of a massive--and massively popular--virtual reality program dies, his avatar announces a contest of sorts involving clues, keys, and a literal Easter egg, where the victor can claim full ownership of the fantasy world. Enter teenage Sheridan, who teams up with several other players to uncover the secrets before ruthless businessman Mendelsohn can. Clumsy storyline full of plot-holes and confusing ""rules"" populated by unexciting, ill-defined characters with a series of third act climaxes that drag on and on, yet its major failure is in the nearly non-stop parade of cluttered, garish digital effects, a stupefying assault on the eyes (and brain, trying to process all the soupy information). It's hard to complain that it all looks so flagrantly phony--it's not a real world with real people in it, after all--but the film is set a few decades in the future, so why are the graphics so outdated even by current PC/console standards? Exists solely as a pellet feeder for nostalgia and pop culture references (ooh, there's the time-traveling DeLorean...hey, I've played ""Halo""...oh, did you spot the Gremlins?), but rarely with any context or substance to warrant interest. One can find the occasional appreciable moment (a few wry lines from Miller, the surprising use of the Chucky doll as a weapon, etc.), but sorting through the chaotic farrago to find them isn't really worth the taxing effort.<br/><br/>31/100"
"captainsolo-79382","Null","3","5","11 August 2019"," So underrated
","Ready Player One is one of my favourite films of all time. I understand that fans of the book may have been disappointed. I recently read the book and it did make me wonder what would the film have been like if it had been the same as the book. But when watching the film you need to forget about that.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Ready Player One. For me it is one of Spielberg's best films. Parzival is a really relatable character. He is not one of the terrible characters who you don't care about. He has great development and his characters changes seem real. He doesn't become the hero becuase he has to, he does becuase he is motivated about winning and stopping IOI.<br/><br/>Sorrento is a great villain. I-r0k is good but for me, Sorrento stands out. Ben Mendolsohn gives a fantastic performance as usual. Art3mis is also really great. Aech is hilarious and the reveal at the end was a nice surprise. Daito is not as big of a character as he is in the book but I still enjoyed him. I really like Sho as well.<br/><br/>I also really like Halliday. Its obvious why the High Five worship him. Morrow is really a good character. Morrow being the Curator is a great way to show his presence in the film. I think Simon Pegg's performance is really good as well.<br/><br/>The highlights were the battles for me. They were action packed. The end battle did not disappoint me either. It was filled with pop culture references and cameos. The film is like a movie tribute world.<br/><br/>Overall i really like this film I watched it in IMAX 3D and it was a great experience.

"ironhorse_iv","8","3","5","21 April 2018"," It's time to level up and dive into Steven Spielberg's visually breathtaking pop culture Easter egg hunt 'Ready Player One'! Is this movie worth playing? Somewhat. It's fun.
","Set in the world of 2045, this Warner Bros film based off, author Ernest Cline's 2011's bestseller YA novel of the same name; tells the story of Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) on his dangerous quest to find one of the three hidden keys that brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance) has buried in his expansive virtual reality universe; 'the OASIS', the discovery of which will lead the winner to inherit the game creator's fortune & control of his company. Without spoiling the movie, too much, there are not a lot of filmmakers out there that could had adapted this book into film. None of them has the vast assemble of contacts throughout Hollywood, in order to convince other studios to lend out their IPS (intellectual property) for the piece, as Steven Spielberg has. He also knows how to bring out the best performances both live action and though, character animations with nearly everything being spot on, strong. He did that before in 1988's 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. Not only that, but the book film neatly encapsulates Spielberg's biggest strengths, by taking the world's obsession with the unstoppable push of CGI technology, layered with clever inside jokes & nostalgia driven- pop cultural references and combine them up into a sci fi genre that can work, both as a mystery & adventure with its treasure hunting premise and you got yourself, nearly a match made in heaven without it turning into controversial vanity project. However, there were somethings in this adaptation that could had done a little bit better, such as adjusting the exposition narrative into more of a 'show don't tell' type story. All the slog info dump in the beginning, still felt like reading a book, than a movie. Another thing, unlike the book, the film is so enamored with the world of Oasis that it doesn't spend as much time fleshing out the real-world of 2045. Where is all the mentions of environmental destruction, overpopulation, and economic meltdown from the book? Isn't it weird to see sequences outside the 'stacks', with Columbus, OH still looking pretty well kept for a city that supposed to be, in the brick of collapse. Also, I never got the idea that the world is horrible, if everybody is able to connect to the 'OASIS'. The background visuals for this film seem underdeveloped, much like most the character's backstories, besides Halliday. There's not a lot of remarkable amount of depth & development with them. Wade honestly felt like such a self-insert/wish fulfilment type character. He has literally little flaws here, but the will to fall in love. At least, in the original, he had learn to overcome greed, devastation and gluttony. In the film, his obsession with the 'OASIS' isn't healthy, as his knowledge of the creator seen too all-consuming and come across, as just unrealistic. Tye's character wasn't really that interesting, despite his acting being alright. Supporting characters like Art3mis AKA Samantha Cooke (Olivia Cooke) had potential to be a great character with her cool rebellion backstory, as well. Yet, in the end, she was ultimately reduced to a love interest. It was a bit disappointing. Nothing in the film is particularly emotional. I expected more of a moral message with their relationship. Still Olivia Cooke did alright job. The same can be said, with the others side-performers. I just wish, their emotional scenes weren't cut out of the film. Scenes like where a character is toss out of a building and another character family member having to hide her race through an avatar were very powerful in the book. Not having it, here, was a big mistake. Another deviate from the novel, I hate, was having everybody in one place. Isn't 'OASIS' supposed to worldwide network?! Where is the scenes all over the world? The lack of scope come across as so underwhelming. As for the action scenes. Some segments like the Manhattan Sky-line car race & the climactic battle scenes are visually inducing seizure due to over sensory. While others, like virtual version of 1980's Stanley Kubrick's horror movie, 'The Shining' are brilliantly staged. Either way, all the action scenes are lot better than the book. The movie takes away the numerous trials to unlock multiple gates with keys: instead focusing on winning the key as the challenge. It made the plot move faster, while, keeping the mystery, complex, and worth trying to solve. However, I didn't like how characters would magically whip some convenient Deus Ex Machina like obscure unexplained knowledge or unestablished weapons in their arsenal. Look, as much as I dig the premise of a treasure hunt inside a gigantic immersive online environment, very much; the idea of the people of 2045, being fixated on cultural references, over 50 years ago is bit jarring. Online culture just doesn't work that way. People like novelty. The film should had create more recent fictional in-universe pop-culture references to work with. You know, works from 2020-2045. After all, nostalgia can only go so far, before people forget or become unaware, of past works. A good example is how you don't see many silent era film stars as internet memes, these days. It's just unlikely going to happen. The movie push its pop-culture references too hard to the point that it reach insanity & oversaturated. It come across obnoxious, too reminiscence and annoying at times. It's hard to keep up. Despite that, the movie the movie is cheeky & witty enough, on its own to keep viewers, interested. However, some of the jokes might fall flat, because how dated, they quickly can become. At least, the movie doesn't cringe-worthy creepy jokes about masturbating & stalking like the book has. As for the pacing. The film is better, but both share the choppy rushed ending. Regardless of that, this movie is still worth plugging into, just for the nostalgia trip factor, even if the book both celebrates and critiques online culture, better. It's a film, still worth checking out."

The movie didn't do justice to the protagonists and their stories but rather maneuvered the movie in a very subtle style.(Plethora of details omitted from the Novel).<br/><br/>So, to all the geeks out there who still haven't watched the movie, don't get your hopes high, not one of the best Spielberg movies and READ THE NOVEL. 100% fun guaranteed provided you know your pop culture well ;)"

"hanamo-55303","2","12","32","4 April 2018"," Movie doesn't trust in its own source material
","I read the book twice and tried to watch the movie with an open mind. But this movie annoyed the hell out of me. It starts out strong with an upbeat 80s song and an introduction to the ""stacks."" But it quickly completely abandons the first intriguing quest of the book for an empty CGI race that feels like it belongs in Transformers. The second quest inserts CGI zombies. Halliday's obsession with 80s pop culture is not even mentioned as being the catalyst for the Easter Egg hunt, so there is no explanation as to why Wade and others randomly quote 80s lines. This is literally the basis for the whole book. Why the movie chose to largely ignore this, when there is such a resurgence in 80s pop culture thanks to shows like Stranger Things, is beyond me. I know there are a lot of Easter eggs, but I'll be damned if I caught half of them. Most of the CGI is so quick and filled with laser fire and explosions, it's hard to catch anything. The whole spirit of the book is lost and it feels pointless as a result. And the actor who plays Halliday is excellent, so it's a shame. The movie finally remembers itself in the last 15 minutes with an homage to the Atari game that started it all, but it feels strange and tacked on at the very end. With so much empty action, the movie felt so incredibly long. I thought it would never end."

","Ready Player One is a decent book. It has some flaws, but overall it works as an '80's nostalgia trip and a good read. Ready Player One is a bad movie in terms of being a movie, an atrocious adaptation, and fails even as a vehicle for '80's nostalgia. There are more easter eggs, shout outs, and throwbacks for people born in recent years than there are for people who grew up in the 1980s. The plot is as formulaic as anything ever produced by Hollywood. It is distinctly and safely structured to be everything the audience has ever seen before, to the point that the end result is dull. A good adaptation will keep what works and fix what doesn't. This movie changes everything regardless of its functionality, and the result has so many gaping plot chasms and is so devoid of charm it's a wonder if Steven Spielberg and company wanted to make this adaptation at all or if they were being forced to fulfill a contract they signed in years past. After having seen this on the big screen, I wish I had waited for it to come to Netflix. It's not even something I would want to own and have on my movie shelves, while I could have the book on my book shelf and be okay with that."
"rabbitmoon","6","10","26","28 March 2018"," Often exhilerating, but caves into formula
","I haven't read the book, so am reviewing this purely as a film. Its technically incredibly accomplished - amazing CGI, a packed, detailed screen most of the time, and the 3d is brilliant (particularly the VR scenes, the real world seemed flatter/duller which may have been intentional for the same effect as Tron Legacy). The sheer dizzying vibrancy of the VR world and all its references is often joyous and refreshing.<br/><br/>But as time goes on (and theres a lot of it) I found myself craving some substance, some humanity, some depth, character and originality which doesn't materialise. All the references to Back To The Future make me kind of wish I was watching that instead - how much more loveable the characters are in that. RP1 descends into the same formula as every other mass-market movie - evil baddie, endless destruction, slick invulnerable CGI battles, good guys in great peril, etc etc that drags on a little too long. By the end I was glad it was over, and it had lost my earlier affection. Afterwards it started dissolving fast, without much staying behind. Great entertainment, but I feel like it could have been so much more. Maybe I've been spoiled by Black Mirror. <br/><br/>If BTTF was made now, I'm sure Biff would be a megalomaniac evil time-lord trying to destroy the spacetime contiuum, and there would be an extra hour tagged on where Biff teams up with the Libyans to destroy Hill Valley with endless CGI bazooka missiles. <br/><br/>One thing I'll say in RP1s favour is that there is an amazing setpiece (the second key) that had me smiling so hard it was worth the price alone."

I loved the book, and enjoyed the movie which I'm sure I'll watch again more closely to see all the hidden Easter eggs."

"poisonivy-25023","8","4","8","2 August 2018"," 10 Pros and Cons for seeing and not worth seeing, 'Ready, Player One'.
","Pro:<br/><br/>1. The action scenes in the movie are a lot better than the book.<br/><br/>2. I like how the movie takes away the numerous trials to unlock multiple gates with keys: instead focusing on winning the key as the challenge. It made the plot move faster, while, keeping the mystery, complex, and worth trying to solve. <br/><br/>3. The acting in this film is pretty damn good. Most of the characters were interesting, enough to root for, or hate against. <br/><br/>4. It delete most of the cringe-worthy jokes from the book; such in the case of masturbating while stalking other characters. <br/><br/>5. That Stanley Kubrick 'the Shining' love letter, sequence toward the middle of the movie. It was the highlight of the film, even if it's not really that PG-13.
 
6. Lots and lots of cool Easter eggs. Plenty of rewatch value. <br/><br/>7. Great use of variety of movie soundtracks & 1980s pop hits. The movie was beautiful to listen to. <br/><br/>8. The movie is highly worth seeing in 3D. A rare moment, where 3D is honestly use correctly. <br/><br/>9. Steven Spielberg's magic- lots of movie characters from different movie studios, are able to be, in a movie, together. It hasn't been done, since the days of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. <br/><br/>10. The movie does have great motion capture performances. It was well-done. <br/><br/>Con: <br/><br/>1. It has too much of information dump toward the beginning of the film. The film should had use 'show, don't tell' more. <br/><br/>2. Way too much CGI. Certain parts of the film, gave me, a headache; such in the case of the racing throughout New York sequence. Over sensory. <br/><br/>3. All the nostalgia driven pop culture references really got tiresome, as the film went on. Some of them, don't even, makes sense or seen dated, based on the timeline. <br/><br/>4. The film is so enamored with the world of Oasis that it doesn't spend as much time fleshing out the real-world of 2045. No mention of the environmental destruction, overpopulation, and economic meltdown from the book.<br/><br/>5. Protagonist has little to no personality; not only that, but he lack a character arch. Book character is a lot more interesting. <br/><br/>6. Lack of a worldwide feel. Everything centers in Columbus, OH or in the world of Oasis. Its sucks, that scenes place in Vancouver, BC, Atlanta, GA, Oklahoma City, OK and Tokyo, Japan are cut from the film version. <br/><br/>7. The overpraising of Holliday as a God-like being. When in truth, he wasn't that good of a guy. Plus, the villain's plans to take over and monetize the OASIS, is the same thing that Holliday did to create his business. Book made him, seem more like a real-life character.<br/><br/>8. The lack of emotional stalks. Powerful scenes from the book like Daito's death & Aech having to hide her race, due to racism, were left out in the film version. It was not a good idea. <br/><br/>9. Some of the jokes really fall flat or went over the heads with some viewers; as the film's relays too much on the audience, knowing full-ahead, the cultural references punchline. <br/><br/>10. Movie has way too much Deus Ex Machina moments that it was really hard to believe. It took me, out of the movie, at times."

","Steven Spielberg seems to be epic in every cinematic genre he wants. Ready player one has a lot of visual effects and CGI but the plot and the characters is very interesting. The world of the movie is full of virtual things action and a lot of cinematic and pop culture references, mainly of 80s and 90s so its very easy for someone to follow the film, even if he is thirty years old or more."
"GoldenBlunderbuss","8","4","8","1 August 2018"," A feast the eyes and a story straight out of the Spielberg playbook
","Keys hidden in a VR game world unlock the fortune of the inventor of the OASIS and control over it, so a group of kids must stop a shady Corporation getting the prize.<br/><br/>Like ET crossed with Willy Wonka, Ready Player One is Spielberg back to classic Spielberg - the kids are fighting off the big bad business boss while trying to win the grand prize of a tech giant's fortune and control of the OASIS, a virtual reality world used by most of the planet's population to escape the horrors of their everyday lives. The tech giant in question is the socially awkward but big dreaming James Halliday expertly played by Mark Rylance in a Brian May wig (originally Spielberg wanted Gene Wilder to play the role before his untimely death in 2016) who lived pop culture references and so made all the challenges (all different to the ones in the 2011 book by Ernest Cline) based around his obsession with 1970s & 80s pop culture.<br/><br/>Characters including the Iron Giant, Harley Quinn, MechaGozilla, Chucky, Lara Croft and King Kong all make an appearance alongside references from games like Overwatch, Pitfall, Mortal Kombat, Joust, Street Fighter II, Bioshock, Battle Toads and Mass Effect and more than enough film nods like Back to the Future, Alien, Saturday Night Fever, Robocop, Monty Python & the Holy Grail, Jurassic Park, Beetlejuice, Terminator 2, Mad Max and Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. The amazing thing is that the constant search for these on-screen glimpses doesn't distract at all from the story and, in typical Spielberg fashion, the action and narrative are married perfectly with one never overshadowing the other.<br/><br/>There are a vast number of audience-made lists out there on forums documenting as many references as they can and there always seems to be one they've missed. It never ends. From the big ones (like an entire sequence set in a particular film which was completely missing from the trailer, so you'll get no spoilers here) to the little ones (like a briefly-mentioned artefact that turns time back by 60 seconds called the Zemeckis Cube, so named after the Back to the Future director), they flash by for you to either catch and enjoy or miss and never know that that was Freddy Krueger being punched in the balls by Duke Nukem.<br/><br/>Best Quote: ""I mean ... it's nothing less than a war for control of the future."""

"peterp-450-298716","8","4","8","22 July 2018"," No need to say I was thrilled. But that's because I'm a VR fan myself.
","James Halliday saw the future.
And then he built it.
He gave us a place to go.
A place called ... THE OASIS.<br/><br/>Recently I got a Playstation VR set for my birthday and since then I've spent a lot of hours in different virtual worlds. So I understand very well that in films such as Ready Player One the population spends more time in this artificial environment than in the actual world. As one already suggested at the beginning, this virtual fantasy world is alluring because there's so much to experience. But also because you can be so much. Just like in ""2047: Virtual Revolution"", it seems as if all of humanity has lost its contact with reality and is wasting their entire fortune on digital upgrades and gadgets and spend all their free time walking around in futuristic-looking VR glasses. Unfortunately, the moral is the same as in the film. Namely, that one has to cut the virtual bonds and live back in reality. Perhaps there's an element of truth here. In today's society, the art of communicating and socializing is going to waste because we do this only in a digital way.<br/><br/>The story itself was a bit straightforward and simple. The day one of the designers (James Halliday) of the virtual playground OASIS drew his last breath (in reality), he reveals that he has hidden a so-called ""Easter egg"" in OASIS. Who finds it wins a mega top prize that gives the honest finder total control over OASIS and inherits Halliday's fortune. We, of course, get a race between two camps. On the one hand, young Wade (Tye ""Joe"" Sheridan) who, along with some of his online friends, eagerly starts looking for the hidden keys. Not only for the fame and fortune but also to get back at IOI (Innovative Online Industries). This company wants to win the main prize at any cost so it becomes the largest company in the world. So, Wade gets the CEO Nolan Sorrento (Ben ""Mississippi Grind"" Mendelsohn) as a formidable opponent whose inexhaustible source of income gives him an advantage. Needless to say who will finally get the virtual short stick.<br/><br/>No, the story itself is not really epic. The images and the overall atmosphere, however, are. The first assignment with the extremely difficult road race packed with obstacles was something to drool over. The fact that a T-Rex and a frantic King Kong appeared in it was perhaps slightly exaggerated. But for the rest, this part did look exquisitely and flashy. I would also like to participate in that race. Ditto for the Doom location. To experience a death match on that planet must also be extremely energetic and exciting. But mainly Ready Player One is a huge wink and nostalgic look back on the 80s. And this in all sorts of areas. The music, the film, and the game world from this era are extensively praised. So the whole film is stuffed with references to it. The DeLorean from Back to the Future, a floating dance floor with the soundtrack of the Bee Gees, the Atari games, and a Joy Division t-shirt. And a multitude of famous characters who come to act as avatars in the VR world. You can be sure that every scene contains a reference. It's as if Steven Spielberg not only sends the heroes in search of the easter egg but also assigns the audience the same task. Find as many hidden references as possible.<br/><br/>If you are an avid gamer, you'll be thrilled by this film since most of it is purely a graphic spectacle. The opening scene where the world of OASIS is presented is a breathtaking and impressive spectacle. For others, it may be a bit too much. It's as if you're at a friend's house looking at the tube, while he's playing a super fantastic game. A little frustrating. But, I was amused by this movie. Apart from a few issues (I don't understand how Wade could get his installation working in the back of a van in the middle of a junkyard), for me, this film was really quite wonderful. And it was pretty self-explanatory that the girl behind the avatar Art3mis (Olivia ""Me and Earl and the dying girl"" Cooke) also be a natural beauty in RL. I'm not really a big fan of Steven Spielberg and think some of his films are really weak, but here he succeeds again in making my film heart beat faster. And not only because I'm actually a bit hooked on the VR phenomenon (even though it hasn't yet achieved the sharpness shown here). Ready Player One is a bit like The Goonies meets Tron. But with more technological wizardry and a different kind of treasure as a reward."

","In many reviews people are talking about the book. But this review is from point of view of a person who hasn't read that book. This movie immediately grips the attention at the very beginning and has every element that makes a movie memorable. <br/><br/>This movie is relatable to Black Mirror's concept, Wreck it Ralph concept and Zootopia concept at the same time. Animation is gorgeous, story is wholesome. Twist and turns are not unexpected but beautiful to watch nonetheless. The mild romance is quite childish but rest of the movie more than makes up for it.

"asurans","10","4","8","11 July 2018"," An Easer Egg of Easter Eggs - A Wonderful Movie
","When I originally saw this as a ""pre-production"" title and that it was going to be made by Spielberg, I knew I had to see it. Upon watching it, I was not disappointed. Now, as with every movie, there were some downsides. The classical hero who meets the love of his life and they become boyfriend/girlfriend is definitely one of my top groaners in movies. It is so typical and many, many movies are developed around that scenario. That being said, this movie had so much more in it than that.<br/><br/>We can start with the references. Not only do I like to watch movies to find their references to other works of production, but I love to see what Easter eggs get planted. With this movie being about an Easter egg planted in an ultra-VR setting, I absolutely went nuts finding references and eggs. To name a few references: Doctor Who, Star Wars, Godzilla, Zootopia, just to name a few. There are truly hundreds of references and nods to other movies hidden throughout this feature film. I know I haven't noticed or picked out all of them, but I sure do enjoy doing it.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about this movie was all the real-world video game truth about it. Today, you see both kids and adults playing games online for real money. Not only does this film portray a dystopian future, but I think it portrays a future that is not too far away and not too far off from reality. There is also some video game history thrown in here. Both old and new games are played and referenced throughout the movie.
The reference to the game Adventure which contained the world's first hidden feature, which coined the term ""Easter egg"" was a huge plus for me. As a young kid, I remember watching other people play these games or hear them talk about them. I never did play them, but I know the classics were some of the best games ever made.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this film. I especially enjoyed one of the main points behind it. ""Reality is what is real."" This sentence I hope wakes people out of their addictive online gaming habits and brings them back to the real world. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy references and Easter eggs. There's just so many. Again, great movie, highly recommended, and hope for another just as good someday soon!"

I loved it. <br/><br/>After the movie finished I looked up the user reviews on IMDB to see if other people loved it as well just out of curiosity. I read reviews after reviews of people complaining how the movie does not do justice to the book, how it is a disgrace. I was shocked. The movie got me so hooked that I decided to read the book because I wanted more of it. <br/><br/>I am now halfway through it and boy oh boy did I regret not reading it earlier. It is indeed very different from the movie from what I have read so far just the character names and setting are the same. But I still went back and watched the movie a second time and still loved it. <br/><br/>So long story short I recommend watching the movie first and also reading the book after."

Was skeptical when I heard Spielberg was gonna make movie out of this.Specially since been ages since he made anything good,that wasn't a serious drama.<br/><br/>He got his Judas money, and screwed up what could have been a great movie.
He has taken away all the depth of the book and it's story line..
Speilbergs movie , lack depth in his characters, a reason for you to care about them.
Not to mention he has taken away all of the 80s stuff,that actually helped drive the books characters forward in his quest for the keys.
And he has ofc added a dash of girl power,just so the feminazis won't gather their pitchfork ,and come after him.
All the ideas and most of what happen to wade in he book,is turned into Art3mis story instead. She has all the bright ideas.All the rest are just riding her coattail.<br/><br/>I can only hope someone pick this up as a tv series,and make like it should've been.

"siderite","8","4","8","18 June 2018"," Does justice to the book
","The book is a love letter to the 1980s, filled with references and puns and that nostalgia for the time when ""it was all a game"". It would have been very difficult to capture it all in a movie, but this film managed to get the gist of it. If there was anything that I didn't quite like was the chemistry between Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke, which wasn't. Oh, and the ending... Tuesdays and Thursdays... right.<br/><br/>Imagine a world where anything is possible and an epic quest for the keys to the kingdom. Complete it, and you will be the king. Lose and the villain will get to have it all and corrupt it after their own corporate image. A true hero's journey to find friendship, love and everything else. The perfect combination of 80's nostalgia and young adult movie. And directed by Spielberg, probably the only person who could convince all the rights holders to borrow their characters for this film that shows (briefly) King Kong, Jurassic Park, Mechagodzilla, The Iron Giant, Prince Goro, Alien, the Back to the Future DeLorean, Chucky, The Shining, Halo and so many others.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it's not nearly as good as the book, but it does it justice."

It seemed as if they were rushing to come to the conclusion. It took time to develop the story, but the relationships between the cast felt rushed. Ignoring that, I would definitely suggest watching this movie. It has tons of easter eggs waiting for you to discover."
"Tweetienator","5","4","8","10 May 2018"," Kick Player One
","I don't know the writings so I can't compare them. Ready Player One the movie is a very standard and predictable story. It is imo also almost zero sci-fi but just fantasy. I guess it works for the young - because the movie/story is well constructed giving them the impression, the hero etc. that one could be me etc. and it ""fakes"" that the movie is about them and their lifestyle etc. pp. 
I was once (in my younger days) a hardcore gamer and spend many hours per day and year to master ONE game - to a certain degree. The notion that some super kids are best in many different style of games in a virtual reality is one of the more obvious things a real gamer can detect that both the writer and the guys making the movie have no idea about pro gaming at all. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg plays the card of zeitgeist, like his last movie The Post. One could say it is a safe bet to get some applause in the media and from the millennials and such kind of an audience. The last movie of Mr. Spielberg I really like(d) is War of the Worlds from 2005. Since then 13 years have passed... <br/><br/>Like Ridley Scott Spielberg is another formerly titan of movie making lost in mediocrity, and he seems even not to be able to choose interesting stories anymore. Even the last Indiana Jones was just okayish and way from good. Another synchronicity with Ridley Scott who blasted his great Alien franchise with the last output into pieces (I liked Prometheus but Covenant is by far the weakest of all movies about our beloved alien and was a big disappointment to me). <br/><br/>Ready Player One - a fake on gaming, a fake on sci-fi, a fake on virtual reality (we won't jump around in our bedrooms playing in vr but sit laid back in a couch or lay on our beds and just do everything with our thoughts in a not so distant future. I take any bet.) Also from the technical point of view I wasn't very impressed by the CGI.<br/><br/>Okayish, if you got nothing else to do."
"adam-holbus","7","4","8","25 April 2018"," Not Spielberg's best, but still decent
","READY PLAYER ONE is the latest installment in visionary Steven Spielberg's ever-growing collection of stories. While not his best work, it is still worth at least one watch.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not terrible. For crying out loud, it's Spielberg we're talking about! He only makes good films and not-so-good films. That being said, this particular film had a balance of good elements and not-so-good elements. One of its weakest elements was that it did not offer enough surprises. This is especially odd because that has been Spielberg's job for more than 40 years. The good news is: it's not his fault. Rather, it was the writing that was more at fault.<br/><br/>Before getting into how basic the overall writing was, it is fair to say that the storyline was somewhat passable. Taking on a similar tale to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this story follows a worldwide competition to win ownership of the entire virtual reality world. One of the problems, however, was that it was only the VR world that seemed to be at stake. There was almost no connection to the circumstances of the real world, causing a lack of emotional depth to the story and making it difficult for the audience to relate to the conflict. Another problem was a lack of explanation as to how the world became such a desolate wasteland by the year 2045. This is a plot point that is barely explained in the beginning and should have been expanded more or somehow tied into the conflict that occurs in the video game.<br/><br/>On top of this, the screenplay consisted of far too much expository dialogue relating to the cultural references that appear every so often. It may be a good method for avoiding any confusion from any one without knowledge of video games, but does the audience really need a history lesson every ten minutes?<br/><br/>Keep in mind, this is all coming from someone who has never read the book. And it's certain there is a reason for the story being told the way it was. However, just as a wild thought, what would have worked better is if the story revolved around adult players and if it was more humorous without becoming raunchy. This would allow the adult video game community to relate to this film even more, since they already seem to enjoy the 80's references.<br/><br/>The cast in this film is a mixed variety in terms of talent. Some of the great performances came from Olivia Cooke, Simon Pegg (as always), Mark Rylance, and Ben Mendelsohn; all actors who held such presence in the moment and breathed life into the motives of their characters. One of the actors who lacked those qualities was Tye Sheridan, who played the main protagonist. Unfortunately, he seemed to only pretended to take his role seriously by channeling feigned euphoria as part of his character, instead of carrying a down-to-earth charisma like Cooke did. As a result of this, his performance was not believable enough and, ultimately, did not carry enough weight throughout the film.<br/><br/>One strong element of this film was its production design. Calling back to Spielberg's work on The Adventures of Tintin, the visual effects offer a remarkable view of a world that has never been seen onscreen before. Beginning with a riveting vehicle race featuring King Kong himself, it makes one wonder why Spielberg has never directed a movie based on an actual video game.<br/><br/>In short, READY PLAYER ONE may not be the best film in ages, but there is a lot about this film that simply works. One will be able to find a good a time in being taken on a visual journey and may even get a kick out of some of the pop culture references. Or if one is curious to go through Steven Spielberg's extensive filmography, this is a worthy title of looking into."

If you've read the book you won't be able to watch this movie with out thinking about the massive differences the entire time and wondering why they literally changed certain narratives to completely different ones that even served the same purpose in the story. You'll be puzzled. That being said, I tried to watch it with out a biased opinion because the book was so good that is stacked side by side, the movie has no shot. But if you haven't read the book, I can see how this would be a pretty entertaining movie with an interesting story line. If it wouldn't give away the ending, I'd tell someone to watch the movie first and enjoy it, and then read the book to really get the goods. I did the opposite which turned out to be a mistake.

","What a horrendous disaster. I can't believe how terrible. Honestly, I didn't think the masterful Steven Spielberg could make a movie so bad. And how did Ernest Cline allow his brilliant novel to get turned into something so unlike his original work? That sense of nostalgia, the feelings of awe & wonder we felt reading the novel is NOT present in the movie. Where is JOUST, and role-playing WAR GAMES, or playing a perfect game of PAC-MAN? How could ULTRAMAN not be included? All those 80s references we love were omitted. In this disaster movie, Parzival wins the keys, deciphers the clues and ultimately wins the OASIS in a manner completely different than the novel. What a huge disappointment."
"alvinchunhao","9","4","8","6 April 2018"," I'm a big fan of the book, now I'm a fan of the movie too
","An excellent movie in its own right! I'm glad that I ignored all those 1 star reviews and went to watch it anyway. People who simply want a word-to-word copy of the book, must go and learn about what makes a good movie. Do you really think the audience should just watch Parzival playing video games?<br/><br/>Was it a perfect movie? No, it could be better. I'm taking away a star. It does have most things I wanted, like good visual effect, like friendship and love, like the epic battle. Without any spoiler, I must say that some of the changes from the book are actually better ideas, better than the original plot. Spielberg and Cline do know better than ordinary audiences. <br/><br/>I highly recommend any fan of the book to watch the movie, with an open mind. And make sure you watch the IMAX 3D verion. I can't eait to see a director cut version of the movie. Or even better, a 'writer' c nout version."
"TyJustice","6","4","8","2 April 2018"," A fun, colorful action romp. Not much more.
","I have not read the book so I can't touch on how the movie stands up to that, but as far as a movie by itself it was passable. A large portion of the movie is told strictly through animation and CGI, and it stands up well and doesn't intrude on the story. The story however, does run into a lot of fundamental problems that might have attentive viewers rolling their eyes. <br/><br/>Without engaging too heavily in spoilers, there are what the narrative tries to tell us are supposed to be romance scenes that are either completely laughable or difficult to watch, and basically goes from slightly interesting to basic cut and dry fairy-tale rather quickly.<br/><br/>If you're a parent, you can probably take your kids to enjoy it and you'll be able to sit through it (as long as you're okay with the oddly liberal usage of swear words that feel thematically strange in the context of what seems like a family friendly movie) and your children will have fun with the action scenes, CGI and any pop culture references they might recognize.<br/><br/>However if you want to go into this movie seeking any sort of depth outside of what is just another CGI filled popcorn movie, maybe you'll be disappointed. If it interests you check it out but if you don't already want to see it you won't be pleasantly surprised."

","Ready Player One is another in a long line of movies that's going to invite some strong opinions. Based on the best-selling novel by Ernest Cline, the movie isn't restricted by the source material and decides to go its own direction. I can hear people already getting upset but stay with me, what they decided to put on the screen is an actual improvement. Cline does a great job in the book in bringing in cryptic and familiar references alike, but you should be able to recognize all the major references in the movie. As someone who enjoyed the movie, I think its going to help the movie reach a bigger audience.<br/><br/>Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) is a protagonist that doesn't defy expectations but is familiar enough to be accessible. He's the underdog hero that's down on his luck, living in Columbus, Ohio in 2045. Wade is living in a trailer park where each unit form ""stacks"" to save space. As Wade tells us through the opening narration, reality became so bleak that the focus shifted from trying to solve the world's problems and instead trying to find ways to escape them. The OASIS became that escape, it's a huge virtual reality universe created by James Halliday (Mark Rylance) and Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg) that allows you to experience anything. At the start, we see that James has passed away and has left his controlling interest in the OASIS up for grabs in the form of an Easter egg hunt. 3 challenges in which you win 3 keys, and no one has beat the first challenge yet. Wade and his friends Aech (Lena Waithe), Sho (Philip Zao) and Daito (Win Morisaki) compete for it fulltime and with the inclusion of Wade's crush Art3mis (Olivia Cooke). Standing in their way is Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendhelsohn) the CEO of IOI (Innovative Online Industries) and his army of employees/indentured servants. Nolan's vision for the future of the OASIS clashes with Halliday and Morrow's vision, he doesn't see a paradise, he sees potential for ad revenue and microtransactions. <br/><br/>So, if you're looking at the summary and it sounds like it might be a little too obscure for you, there's plenty to enjoy with Ready Player One. With most of the movie taking place in cyberspace, we not only spend plenty of time with Wade in Columbus, but we spend most of the movie with Wade's avatar Parzival in the OASIS. The movie relies a lot on CGI graphics, but they look fantastic. I was so immersed in each world the movie decided to visit, from a fiery molten wasteland in Planet Doom to surfing waves. To sell the plot, the visual effects needed to be top notch and the artists behind-the-scenes were up to the task. This was compounded by the jaw-dropping action scenes. If you've seen the trailers, the first challenge is an unbeatable race with unique challenges. I was blown away by this sequence, I couldn't believe that someone like Spielberg helped create it. It would have been easy to just do the same old thing but he and his team (including screenwriters Zak Penn and Ernest Cline) came to work and made something worth going to see.<br/><br/>Even though a lot of the movies goes through the avatars, all the actors and actresses still get time to bring something to the table. Tye Sheridan is decent as Wade, he's playing the bright-eyed optimistic hero that's a little too naÃ¯ve. There were times where he sunk into the part but other times he was too plucky to buy. The supporting cast picked up the slack, Olivia Cooke was strong as Art3mis, her character is less abrasive in the movie and it gives her a chance to show her natural chemistry with Sheridan. She's a hero in her own right and Cooke does a great job. Lena Waithe was just as good as Aech, her character has some twists that could have been difficult to handle but she handles them capably. Ben Mendelsohn does as much as he can as Sorrento, he's not the most captivating villain. But Mendelsohn is a veteran at being menacing and he brings his creepy demeanour to play. Mark Rylance is a frequent Spielberg collaborator and there's a reason he won an Academy Award. Simon Pegg was also a welcome addition, you're always happy to see him.<br/><br/>Ready Player One isn't a flawless movie but I could get around most of the minor problems. I found the choices for the score to be really on the nose, from using We're Not Going to Take It as the hype song before the battle to Stayin' Alive as the club music, I would have picked something a little less obvious. It was also hard to buy into some of the movie's more emotional moments. Some of the dialogue between Parzival and Artemis is cringe-worthy. There was also an effort to smooth out the rougher parts of Cline's book, his vision of Wade's reality was a lot darker and this version of the future was pleasant by comparison.<br/><br/>This movie is a triumph for Steven Spielberg, even if it borders on being hokey in small bits. I couldn't believe that an established veteran director delivered such an energetic and fun movie that fires references like one of the characters handling a minigun. This might upset the diehard fans, but I am among the faithful and the departures they take boost the material instead of detracting from it. I can't imagine that even if you haven't seen most of the included properties, you won't find something to enjoy or laugh about. With the number of obscure nods and winks, just by sheer volume, the odds are something that will hit. I recommend this highly and I would happily go to the theatre to experience Ready Player One again."
"CountJonnie","6","6","14","31 March 2018"," A great topping on a mediocre dessert
","RPO is a movie about a very possible future, where rich dominates poor, and VR dominates reality, but also about the power of belief and friendship and love, which is supposed to be more valuable than money and fame.<br/><br/>This is a simple premise that could've been given substance, if they focussed more on characters, their background, and their development. Instead, the movie focusses on effects and a lot of cameos. The effects are amazing, the action is pretty entertaining and the cameos from games, movies and superheroes are very recognizable and funny if you lived in the 80's and/or 90's.<br/><br/>But after the 1st half, the cameos are no longer surprising, they become gimmicks. The action gets repetitive, and the acting becomes flat. The message becomes too obvious, stretched out and in your face. The movie loses its momentum especially because the lead bad guys seem unmotivated and two dimensional. The movie could have been so much better, if only they invested more in the characters and their motivation. Great effects can not inflate that which is flat. And that is exactly what this movie becomes, after the 1st half.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean that the movie isn't entertaining, if only you care enough about the many cameos that might make this movie worth watching a 2nd time, and play beer games."

","Strange that a man in his 70's chose to direct this adaptation, but I guess if one person could bring it to life and do it justice, it's the master of childhood magic such as Spielberg.
So to his credit, it looks great.
But the writing, specifically the teenage dialogue, is cringeworthy. And if that's how it was presented in the book, then I'm relieved I didn't bother picking it up when it was the flavor of the year.<br/><br/>I think at 40 I'm just too old for this type of virtual reality gaming stuff. This was basically Lord of the Rings in a twisted VR adventure. I was okay with most of the 'reality' bits, but bored with the avatar VR segments.
1 Star for Effects + 1 Star for Ben Mendelsohn, merely for being the only likeable face on my screen throughout the duration.
And that's all the stars I have to spare for this 2-hour-something game quest.<br/><br/>P.S. The thing about growing up in the 80's, is not that I long for endless 80's references to put a smile on my face. All I need is that 80's aesthetic to take me back to nostalgia-land. But playing some Dura Duran and cruising in a Back 2 The Future Delorean doesn't quite make the cut."

","There was a time when a Steven Spielberg movie virtually guaranteed a great time, but more recently he's either concentrated on Oscar bait, or delivered mainstream entertainment that has seriously missed the mark (War of the Worlds, Crystal Skull). Ready Player one is his most disappointing film yet, a loud, garish assault on the senses with a derivative plot (Avatar meets Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), a glut of headache-inducing CGI-laden action scenes, and countless references to pop culture that will probably fly over the heads of many an audience (especially the younger viewers).<br/><br/>Based on the New York Times bestseller by Ernest Cline, the film is set in the year 2045 and stars Tye Sheridan (Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse) as Wade Watts, who, like most of the world's population, escapes the drudgery of reality by immersing himself in the virtual world of Oasis. Wade, as avatar Parzival, takes part in a contest created by Oasis's creator Halliday (Mark Rylance), the winner of which will be given complete control of the popular online playground. As the first to solve stage one of the game, Parzival comes to the attention of powerful corporation IOI, who are dedicated to finding the ultimate prize: a hidden 'easter egg'. What follows is a breakneck rampage through the various digital environments of Oasis, with 90% of the action consisting of computer generated characters, none of which possesses the excitement or tension of a real-life movie.<br/><br/>Spielberg seems to have completely forgotten how to tell a coherent story, his film a mess of ideas that prove difficult to follow, hindered by an orgy of chaotic, colourful visuals that do little to aid comprehension. There are also several comedic moments that fall incredibly flat. It's hard to believe that this is from the same man who gave us timeless classics Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jurassic Park."
"alfamaniac","2","8","21","5 April 2018"," Was not expecting much, still got disappointed... (mild spoileralert!)
","As the title said i did not get my hopes up when i heard about the upcoming movie. Since i have suffered through the total raping of one of the dearest storys of all time, The Hobbit movies, i was on guard about such things.<br/><br/>Still the total destruction of the plot and the characters has taken me aback. Throughout the entire movie we (with my fiancÃ©e) sat there dumbfounded with an undiscribeable uncomfortable feeling... Why? Why did they change the trials? Why did they change the personality of the characters? For the love of God, why did they change Shoto's name?<br/><br/>At the very beginning, when Wade slid down from their trailer on that pipe like a sturdy firefighter in an Axe commercial, i knew this can't be good. From there the horror grew and created a chaotic, meaningless Hollywood goo. The characters became simple and dumb, sometimes entirely the oposite of the original (for instance Art3mis acting slutty and pushing?!?!?!). The importance of the gates vanished, and so did the original role of Og... I could go on forever about the details of the disappointment, but the main thing is: there was no valid reason to change all of it.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie i heard that Ernest Cline helped ""adapting"" the book to the screen and my first thought was that after his second book (Armada) they should have known that Ready player one was a furtunate gift of god, and that he (Cline) shouldn't be allowed near this amazing story again. Seriously: they should take this masterpeice from him like a child from an abusive father, and never ever let him get his claws on it again... ever... god I'm angry!<br/><br/>To be fair: yes the CGI rocks, there were a few good action scenes, and easter eggs about the 80's (and surprizingly the 90's???), but i really can't imagine anyone who did not read the book, understanding the movie, and i deffinately can't imagine anyone who read the book, enjoying this tragic pile of excrement."
"galfarotolon","3","8","21","2 April 2018"," Not a good adaptation... disappointed
","I read the book only because I knew the movie was coming out and it was being directed by Mr. Spielberg no less. Even though his recent projects (except perhaps, Bridge of Spies) have been mostly underwhelming in my opinion, I had great hopes for this. This movie was a great chance for Spielberg to come back to the sci-fi genre that he helped transform into the blockbuster genre that it is today.<br/><br/>I felt like the book itself needed little change if any at all to fit into the big screen. It seems like the director and the author of the book (who actually also was a screenwriter involved in the film) thought differently. The plot is needlessly changed, there is basically no character development, plot holes everywhere, characters' roles totally changed or straight up creating new ones with no significant purpose (F'Nale Zandor i'm looking at you). <br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead:<br/><br/>I just don't get why they had to diverge SO MUCH from the book. The three clues and gates and the ways in which the keys are acquired are completely altered from the book version. I cannot find, in my opinion, a logical reason except from a visual persepctive. The third act involving Parzival getting intentionally caught by the sixers to achieve his master plan of deactivating the shield from Anorak's castle completely GONE and replaced by some nonesense plot. <br/><br/>The list goes on and on. I feel I could write a whole essay about what I didn't like from the movie. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you have read the book, I wouldn't bother in watching the film. I am positive when I say you will be let down, unless you go in with the mindset of this being a totally different thing from the book apart of sharing its name and very loosely its overarching storyline. <br/><br/>I gave it a 3 star rating and not lower because if you have not read the book and have nothing else to watch in the cinema, this could actually be a bearable film (plus the visuals are pretty good). Otherwise stay far and save your money on something that might not disappoint you as much."

For those who read the novel in which the movie is based on and for those who already saw the movie I won't waste time telling the plot. But bringing this story to the big screen shouldn't have been easy so I really appreciate the work they have done, both the visual effects and the CGI crew. Although I don't like much of green screen and CGI in a action movie cause it doesn't feel real, but for this movie it was necessary and wouldn't have been the same. The actors were fantastic: Ben Mendelsohn, mark rylance, T.J Miller and Simon pegg. Along with young talented actors like Ty Sheridan and Olivia Cooke make a perfect cast.

I am neither a gamer, nor have I read Ernest Cline's novel upon which this is actually based - so can only speak from an entertainment perspective. It isn't a great film - the swapping between reality and avatar existences gets annoying after a while and Tye Sheridan as the hero ""Parzival"" is not Spielberg's best casting choice - he struggles to be convincing as either the nerdy geek or the sexy super-hero as he and sassy Olivia Cooke ""Art3mis"" determine to win this dream competition. Arch baddie Ben Mendelsohn is a sort of ""Cyber-Slugworth"" though without any real menace, from a rival company who is also trying to solve the puzzle that will hand him control of this industrial nirvana and as we see, will stop at ""virtually"" nothing to thwart their enterprise.

","An absolute masterpiece filled with fantasy spectacle, true romance, edge of your seat thrills and a wonderful message. Set in a dystopian future where the virtual reality platform Oasis has become everyone's central form of escapism, it's a world that is expertly crafted from a team who genuinely love video games and films and it's a film that perfectly encapsulates and projects the beautiful marriage of video gaming and cinema, where the two worlds collide fantastically. Pop culture references a plenty and there's two sequences involving one of the greatest horror films ever made and one of the greatest horror characters ever made that made me gasp with joy at just how great of a tribute it was to those films (the same feeling occurred when The Iron Giant appears; fond memories of Brad Bird's beautiful animation in 1999) Visually incredible but also has a truly engaging story with characters you love and want to spend time around; thanks to a great script adapted for the screen by Ernest Cline, who had written the original novel, and co writer Zak Penn (The Incredible Hulk, Inspector Gadget) and great performances by Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Mark Rylance, Lena Waithe, Simon Pegg and Ben Mendleson. Not forgetting a hilarious role by T.J Miller as I-R0k! Amazing soundtrack (Hall and Oates and Twisted Sister being two particular highlights) in a similar style to Scott Pilgrim vs the World in which straight after I bought the soundtrack and couldn't stop thinking about the visuals! Ready Player One features great dedicated performances and shows Steven Spielberg at the top of his directorial mastery"

","If you are into well-made CG films, this one is definitely your thing! The story is not too complex but the visual effects are absolutely superb.<br/><br/>A touch of ""Tron"" cannot be denied. The efforts to give new CG sensations to the viewer are obvious. At first I thought it might be just another ""computer games"" kinda film but to my surprise, I enjoyed it much more than I would have anticipated. That's why I had to give it a lot of stars.<br/><br/>It really helps if you are a movie fan or regular movie goer, since the are endless references or even mentioning throughout the film towards other classic sci-fi or horror-movies.<br/><br/>I hope you'll enjoy this film as much as I did."

Highly plausible: the world Spiellberg creates could easily happen and you could easily see virtual reality experiences being how people live their lives and escape reality. The gamer world he portrays is quite accurate, from my own experiences.<br/><br/>With this virtual world created, the plot we have in it is quite intriguing and cleverly crafted.

","I was worried at the time of release that this film would be horrible, but that wasn't the case. The book is incredible, but it was never going to be a faithful adaptation, due to the copyrights. The opening car race sets things in motion and rarely slows down. The book was slightly darker at moments and this film neglects those sections.

","Review:
'Ready Player One' is a science-fiction-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is based on the Ernest Cline novel of the same name.
While watching a bunch of Spielberg movies both old and new, this one sticks out to be one of the better new ones. With CGI being what it is today, and with Spielberg being the creator of multiple fan favorites, they could get away with lots in this movie.
The film takes place in 2045, when humanity uses the virtual reality software called the OASIS to escape the desolation of the real world. Orphaned teenager Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) discovers clues to a hidden game within the program that promises the winner full ownership of the OASIS and joins several allies to try to complete the game before a large company run by businessman Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) can do so.
The cast all around is great, but Tye Sheridan are Olivia Cooke are the standouts for sure. They have great chemistry together both romantically in the real world and when kicking ass in the OASIS. Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg are fun in supporting roles as well.
I was a little concerned that since this movie is mostly CGI, that the story may get lost in the crazy world that was created. I don't believe that is the case at all. I think they blended the world perfectly and told a story worth watching.
Overall, I will be revisiting this movie soon. Anybody who loves Spielberg's direction and storytelling will love this movie.
4.5/5"
"dienanhtenten","6","1","1","18 October 2019"," There's some entertaining moments, and...
","Steven Spielberg is a famous director. I love his movies, including this film. All films he made are all entertaining.
I love the way this film entertains the fans with tons of easter eggs, to me, the fight between Gundam, Iron Giant and Godzilla is so epic. My favorite character is Art3mis, the way they created her is so amazing, but I want her to become a sharper and darker character than the one in movie.
If I was a 10 years old boy watching this movie, I would rate this film 9/10. But as a grown up person, there're some points I don't like about this movie, such as, the villain is so boring, and the side characters as well. From the beginning to the end, they didn't change at all. There're nothing special about their story as well as personality. There're some funny and entertaining moments, but I expected at least 1 touching moment. There're scenes make no sense, for example, there're no way so many kids running around street with the VR glasses on their face. Too dangerous. And IOI is so powerful that anyone can go inside their building and run out whenever you want, so ridiculous. And the main characters are coincidentally living in one city while the fact is all people in the world are playing OASIS, and also Sho and Daito are Asians doesn't mean their characters have to be Asians too, those things make no sense. There're many more ridiculous things but I think I'm stop here lol"
"danielx-83141","5","1","1","29 August 2019"," Ready Player One Review
","First off, the movie itself felt awfully rushed, and I think they could have cut it to two parts or at least three, so they could have made a trilogy out of it, in order for us to be more invested in the story/characters etc. Second, the characters themselves weren't fleshed out enough. I didn't care much about any of them. The first question was really stupid, I mean like c'mon! Nobody ever thought to go backwards or just even by an accident? - Sounds a little bit too convenient to me, wouldn't you agree? Though, Ben Mendelsohn who played the bad guy in the movie was pretty good, and I sorta liked it. As for the world building of the Oasis, it looked pretty cool. That being said, it didn't save the movie.
Verdict: the movie itself is just eye candy, nothing really more than that. It's filled with lots of geeky easter eggs that will keep you invested in seeking them and less in the characters/story. It had a cool concept, but it didn't live to its full potential."

","Most big budget movies nowadays is very dumbed down. You dont find a single movie with triple digit million budget that invites you to do some thinking. This is so everyone can get the plot. Since most people just want brainless entertainment this is the recipe for success.<br/><br/>Its the same principle if we look at videogames. In the amiga, nes and even snes era, there were a lot of games that extremely few could beat. Today games everyone can beat.<br/><br/>So since people dont like to challenge their skills or their mind, everything is dumbed down. This movie even a 6 year old has no problem keeping up with. Its very kid friendly in terms of storytelling.<br/><br/>The production quality is great and the visuals is amazing. However its extremely easy to predict whats gonna happen.

To the book we have a amazing cyberpunk story with in a dark age tech world, with cool gaming puzzles and with a incredible plot and characters.
In the other hand the movie is a ridiculous crap plot with characters out of the place and a oasis that seems to be like fan theme park and a necessary choice for a second life world for the poor ppl and losers of the real world.

","Despite its deft marketing, it's hard to believe that ""Ready Player One"" is a Steven Spielberg movie. All the typically Spielbergian touches that made him a household name are nowhere to be found: The storyline is borderline trivial, the character development is virtually non-existent, the score is unremarkable, and the whole thing is lifeless and forced. Even Ben Mendelsohn, who normally specializes in effectively playing larger-than-life villains, seems bored and spends the interminable running time looking like he'd rather be anywhere else. The special effects are terrific, which is not surprising given the movie's pedigree, but Spielberg doesn't seem to have much interest in highlighting them, they're just sorta there. All in all, it's not that ""Ready Player One"" is bad per se, it's that there's so much potential and none of it is realized, and the finished product is an overlong, anonymous corporate product that tries to pass off nostalgia and brand identification as cleverness, and doesn't seem to have much to say about its own themes."

I was disappointed with characters story arcs, development, there were few twists, surprises or depth. There was absolutely nothing clever about the story at all?
My description in a nutshell- big budget CGI in a bargain basement 'straight to video' story... Spielberg is 10-15 years past being slightly relevant.

Ready Player One. Sad to say I am not of the gaming generation, the fascination

Matrix series. I've watched those films and I haven't reviewed them because I'm
not sure of what I watched. This was a bit better.<br/><br/>In 2045 the world is really a rotten place and folks like young Tye Sheridan have retreated into their own cyber world called The Oasis. It's where with

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library and found it thoroughly enjoyable, even though we are grandparents and far removed from the virtual reality, gaming crowd. <br/><br/>This is a Spielberg movie, and even though this story is unique it has many of the movie-making elements he used in such movies as ""E.T."", ""Raiders"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""A.I."" and more recently ""The BFG"". Imaginative cinematography, interesting action, and a really killer of a sound track. That alone makes it a worthwhile viewing.<br/><br/>There is also a good story going on. It is Columbus, Ohio in 2045, it is somewhat dystopian and many have turned to a virtual reality existence in something called Oasis. It is a form of escape, it allows one to avoid dealing with real world issues. <br/><br/>Upon the death of the creator and owner of Oasis it is announced that the winner of a contest, finding obscure clues in Oasis, would be given Oasis and complete control of it. So the story becomes a contest between a few dedicated gamers and a big corporation using its resources to win the contest.<br/><br/>The key gamer is Texas native Tye Sheridan as 18-yr-old Wade, who in virtual reality goes by Parzival. He is helped by British actress Olivia Cooke as Samantha who goes by Art3mis. His intention are honorable, he realizes that people need to get back to reality, to connect with each other rather than gravitate towards virtual reality.<br/><br/>The movie is really well made, and even though it is long at 2+ hours it never wore out its welcome."

The clumsy exposition scenes really grated with me; it's a bit of a pet peeve of mine, but Spielberg usually manages to make them a little less obvious than they are here.
It honestly felt like I was watching a run-of-the-mill 80s action flick at times, the number of times I moaned 'of course', 'obviously' or 'really??' at the screen.<br/><br/>Having said all the above, the CGI was excellent and the premise fairly engaging (if ultimately a little childish) which, on balance, dragged the whole affair to just above average for me.<br/><br/>Grab some macaroni to go with the chees, or butter for the corn if you're going to watch.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Based on Cline's 2011 novel of the same name, Steven Spielberg's 'Ready Player One' is a fun watch, that sees the versatile director flex his talent for a summer blockbuster yet again. Although largely imperfect, this bid-budgeted Sci-Fi Adventure is never out of breath or visual bedazzlement. <br/><br/>'Ready Player One' Synopsis: When the creator of a virtual reality world called the OASIS dies, he releases a video in which he challenges all OASIS users to find his Easter Egg, which will give the finder his fortune.<br/><br/>'Ready Player One' is about video gamers & I'm certain video gamers are sure to enjoy this ride. The story here is basic, with an earnest protagonist (Tye Sheridan) who must fight against an evil villain (Ben Mendelsohn, in fine form). But, Spielberg is up for the challenge & he delivers entertaining sequences. I'd like to single out the sequence involving the Stanley Kubrick Horror Classic ""The Shining"". Its truly a terrific sequence, that captures both, humor & rush. Also, the visuals are to die for. 'Ready Player One' is a pure visual dream.<br/><br/>Now coming to the flaws, the biggest problem with 'Ready Player One' is that it lacks soul. While its definitely a fun watch, this story lacks soul and also hardly has any characters that you actually feel for. And thats where the Writing lacks the bite. It goes all-out in imagery & action, but its out of considerable depth. Its all great to look at it, but there isn't any genuine emotion here to feel.<br/><br/>And yet, 'Ready Player One' isn't low on its marks. Its very much, a watchable & at times, hilarious film, that delivers a bang for your buck. Screenplay by Zak Penn & Ernest Cline is up for the bets, but lack of emotional depth take away some of its glory. Spielberg's Direction, as always, is well-done. I mean, he just gave us the terrific 'The Post' 3 months ago & now a popcorn entertainer with 'Ready Player One'. Now that's range! Janusz Kaminski's Cinematography is top-notch, as ever. 
Michael Kahn & Sarah Broshar's Editing is finely done. Alan Silvestri's Score is lovely. And oh that nostalgia of the 80's music! Art & Costume Design are perfect.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Tye Sheridan shines in the leading-role. The actor brings a certain likability to the part & stays committed throughout. Olivia Cooke is a Stunning leading-lady & a delight to watch. Lena Waithe has her moments. T.J. Miller is very funny. Simon Pegg is decent. But its Mark Rylance as the deceased creator of the OASIS, who steals the show.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Ready Player One' is imperfect, but never not worth watching. Go in and have fun."
"southdavid","7","14","43","20 March 2018"," All your review are belong to us.
","I was able to attend a Cineworld preview of the film a couple of weeks before the official release. <br/><br/>Wade Watts (Tye Sheriden) lives in a slum high rise in the future dystopia. He, like the rest of the world, escape their daily struggle to live in OASIS, a virtual reality universe where everything and anything is possible. However, there is battle for control of OASIS, pitting its ideological members against a cynical and murderous corporation bent on monetarising the virtual playground. <br/><br/>Of course the plot, source novel and even Stephen Spielberg have been secondary in the run up to the release of ""Ready Player One"" as all have taken a back seat to the discussion about the thousands of licenced properties that inhabit the world of the OASIS. Some commenters have found this wave of nostalgia that the films advertising brings to the fore nauseating, so I am happy to report that, in my opinion, the film mostly manages to walk the line between the smart references and endless ""look at this, you used to like this"" moments pretty well. Occasionally they are forced, ( I recognised the bike from Akira, you don't need to literally tell me it's the bike from Akira - and if people don't recognise it, then telling them ""it's the bike from Akira"" isn't really going to mean anything to them), but mostly they are either made integral to the plot or on and off screen so fast they are simply background. It's a film that will reward pausing the film at home, and trying to spot exactly who is who and what is what at a later date. <br/><br/>But, apart from the endless cameos what of the actual film itself? It's pretty good, it's a bit patchy and some bits work better than others. Naturally when adapting a novel, even one as superficial as ""Ready Player One"" at lot of the depth has to go. The struggle of the real world is probably the biggest departure, and the idea that people live, work and go to school in OASIS and not just use it for entertainment. There are other changes to make the film more cinematic, gone are much of the sections of the book where Parzival progresses in the Easter Egg Hunt by playing Atari games and they have been replaced by an car race, that opens the film, and a section of the film that is comfortably the films best - set in recreation of the Overlook hotel from ""The Shining"". Whilst talking about that scene, I'm pretty amazed that the film will get away with the 12A rating, based on the horror elements in that scene, some parents might be better seeing it themselves first, before letting younger children see it. <br/><br/>Performance wise, the film is a bit all over the place. The two leads, Tye Sheriden as Wade and Olivia Cooke as Samantha/Art3mis are OK. Although over 50% of their performance is vocal / motion capture, their best work is done when they are out of OASIS though. Lena Waithe too, is much better in the real world than when inside the game. Mark Rylance gives another great turn as James Halliday, the creator of the game, he portrays the shy, melancholy nature of the man, without ever slipping into too much clichÃ©. Simon Pegg is less effective, ok playing the younger Ogden Morrow, but struggling when saddled by old man prosthetics. I should say, I saw the film in 3D... which I normally would try and avoid as I find the glasses blurs the action rather than enhancing it... but ""Ready Player One"" always looked clean and crisp, probably the best I've ever felt with the gimmick. 
Enjoyable whilst it lasts ""Ready Player One"" is a fun ride with some excellent parts. I suspect that come the end of the year it'll likely be pretty forgotten, let alone in a Spielberg career retrospective."

Maybe it's just badly paced, but it was just presented in a way that is so boring. No time is given to develop characters at all. The ""hunt"" itself is pretty boring.

","This is a fun popcorn flick. Great visual effetcs, great action pieces. If you're a nerd you're gonna love trying to find all the references. But at the end of the day, thats all it really is. A popcorn flick. It doesnt transcend the genre in any way. The plot is kind of simple. They rely on a lot of narration (especially at the beginning) to world build. There's cliches and there are a lot of convenient moments too. I certainly didnt hate this film but I wish it did more to explain and expand more on. <br/><br/>They dont really explain how Halliday built the Oasis or how he was able to upload memories. Maybe thats not super important to the story, but I wish I had more background on the mechanics of this world itself. I wish they had expanded more on the challenges or maybe shown more trial and error. After the first car race scene, Parzival goes to the memory museum (or whatever it was called) and the VERY FIRST memory he decides to watch gives him the answer. How lucky was it, that he chose that one? And for the second challenge, again they go to the memory museum and again the first memory they choose to watch provides them with an answer. And of course Parzival knows the movie Halliday watched was The Shining. And he knows this because The Shining was his 11th favourite horror film. Like, what? The guy was obsessed with pop culture, Im sure he also liked Say Anything a lot. And for the third challenge, our heroes dont even discover it themselves. Parzival (as well as we the audience) get told in a line of a dialogue that the sixers have already found the third challenge. Like, they dont even show us HOW the sixers discovered it, we literally just get told. It felt really lazy. It never felt like the heroes really deserved it. They basically got really lucky and stumbled into the right answers. <br/><br/>The acting was fine. Ben Mendelsohn was a little hammy at times, but overall there was nothing to hate. Nothing really to love either. But it was serviceable. I think the movie's strongest points are the special effects and the cool action. I give it a 6 because I personally needed a bit more story."
"paul-allaer","6","5","12","30 March 2018"," CGI dazzles but the movie's characters lack depth
","""Ready Player One"" (2018 release; 140 min.) brings the story of Wade. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Columbus, Ohio, 2045, The Stacks"", as we get to know Wade, a 17 year old living with his aunt. Wade, like many, spends a lot of time in a virtual reality world called the Oasis. In the Oasis Wade is known as Parzival. Before long, we learn that Halliday, the deceased co-creator of the Oasis, has left an Easter Egg hidden in the Oasis (and along with it, ownership of the Oasis and a half trillion dollars), which can be retrieved upon collecting three keys. The Oasis avatars are keen on finding the treasure, and that includes shady characters from IOI, a competitor of the Oasis. Who will find the Easter Egg? What becomes of Wade/Parzival? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: let me admit right upfront that if it weren't for the fact that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, I doubt that I would've gone to see it. Spielberg is perhaps the leading director of the last 40+ years, and I will always respect what he does/give him a chance. This is the big screen adaptation of the novel by Ernest Cline, which I have not read (and hence an in no position to comment how widely the movie diverges from the book--if at all). The movie is at its essence a nostalgic trip down into the 70s and 80s, when simple(r) computer games ruled (Atari, etc.). Long stretches of the movie play out entirely within the Oasis, and hence are purely CGI. And I'll admit it: these are at times dazzling, and always entertaining, sequences Check out the initial car race in Manhattan, with King Kong at the gatekeeper of the finish line. And with that, we are also on a treasure hunt of pop culture references, the likes of which I cannot recall having seen before. Sure, other movies have dabbled into that as well, but surely no movie has the sheer amount of them that ""Ready Player One"". I caught quite a few, but I'm sure there are tons of others that I simply didn't have the time to see. (Apparently the production team spent several years negotiating to get the licensing rights for all of these pop culture references.) My favorite sequence comes when Parzival and his friends find themselves in the setting of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" while looking for a clue to the next key. Sheer fun! However, once we are back in the real world, the movie suffers from poor character development. The movie's characters lack depth in every which way, and hence I have no emotional attachment or investment in any of them. In that sense, the movie is really just eye-candy, nothing more, nothing less, and I believe that a tighter edit of the movie (cutting its running time from the current excessively long 2 hrs. 20 min,) would've benefited the movie too. The movie features a ton of great music, both as to song placements (with lost of classic rock from the 70s and 80s) and the original score (courtesy of composer Alan Silvestri).<br/><br/>""Ready Player One"" opened wide on Thursday (after previews on Wednesday evening). The Thursday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but by no means sold out). As the end credits started rolling, the audience burst out in a spontaneous applause. Don't get me wrong: I liked ""Ready Player One"" for what it was, a nostalgic trip down into a simpler video gaming era, crammed with so many pop culture references that it will take several viewing to catch them all. But in the end, watching the movie is like watching a video game, literally. I encourage you to check out ""Ready Player One"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

WHO THE HELL CARES, he just trashed himself! What a fool; and what a garbage movie..."
"Nymeria_Meliae","8","4","9","26 May 2018"," Not for non-gamers
","I've not read the book and most negative reviews appear to come from those who have read the book. I would've thought by now, that people would know that it is very rare film can live up to or better a book. So never go to the cinema, switch on the TV etc. expecting a dramatisation of a book to be as good... a book as time to slowly build something, it is time to develop characters, it can be as quick or as slow as it wants. A film has to pack everything into a short space of time and hold the audience's attention while doing so. 
However, this is really a film for serious gamers. If you've never wasted 5 whole years, literally 24/7 in a game, building up online friendships and virtual relationships with people you've never met or unlikely to ever meet and been part of a gaming community... then you will not fully appreciate some of the nuances in the characters of this film and will be unable to bypass the pop culture references. 
I was tempted to give this 10/10 just for their reactions of meeting their rl selves. I will never forget the moment when my guild revealed their true voices in Teamspeak for the very first time. The first moment when you find out who is a block called Chuck living in their mother's basement, who is genuinely female, who is an adult, and who is a child. It was the funniest thing that I've ever experienced in online gaming... especially as nearly all the female characters were played by men, and all the male characters were played by women. And then when you actually meet fellow gamers for meets ups etc. It is a mindblowing experience... perhaps not as much these days as it was in the early days before the likes of Teamspeak, Ventrillo etc. 
So if you don't have that gaming experience, you will probably not enjoy this film so much. Similarly, I think if the book is one of your all time classic reads, then you might be a bit disappointed too. But if you've got the xp and willing to suspend the book... then this film is a blast... the pop culture stuff just adds or takes away depending on your perspective from the gaming experience. 
Give it a go... seems like it is going to be a love or hate film. For me, I enjoyed the ride, and made me log back in for the first time in a couple of years... to a fanfare of 'hey wb... long time... where have you been?' etc. But I've got rl to live now... so it was nice to catch up with ppl again, but unlikely to drag me back 24/7."

","I have seen ""Ready Player One"" last night after waiting for months and the film managed to respond to my expectations. ""Ready Player One"" is more of a pop-culture quiz where you test your knowledge about great films and references of the 70s and 80s. In every scene there is a reference to a film or an icon from Jurassic Park to Back to the Future, from Citizen Kane to Chucky. There are more than 300 references in the film to the pop culture and the more you catch these references, the more you trust your cinema knowledge. I felt pretty good about myself after I have seen this film. My favorite reference in the film was the Zemeckis Cube, which turns time 60 seconds back when used. If you can remember the fact that Back to the Future Trilogy was directed by Robert Zemeckis, that scene, were the cube is used, will make a huge sense. I had a lot of fun watching ""Ready Player One."" Directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, ""Ready Player One"" is based on the novel with the same name by Ernest Cline. Unfortunately, I have not read the book, but I heard that there are some certain differences between the book and the film. If you are a reader, this fact shouldn't surprise you because there is hardly a film that can catch up with the quality details of a book.<br/><br/>""Ready Player One"" opens in the year 2045. World looks like a post-apocalyptic place. Even big cities look like slums. Everything is unorganized, and everyone seems unhappy. People live their lives in virtual environments and avoid reality. This visual challenge is supported by the narrator's explanations in the beginning of the film. OASIS is the most popular game where everyone seems to play. You wear your high-tech gaming glasses and enter in the universe of OASIS where you can do anything you want or be anyone you want. There are no limits. You collect coins and upgrade your life standards in the game. When the creator of this universe, James ""Anorak"" Halliday (Mark Rylance) dies, he puts an Easter Egg, somewhere in this universe and challenge players to find it. The first person to find this egg will be the owner of the game. In order to find this egg, you need to collect three keys by solving different puzzles. Protagonist Parzival (Tye Sheridan) and his friends start this journey, but in the end, they realize they are up against a much bigger challenge.<br/><br/>The story seems to be classic one. I would like to call it a fairytale of modern times. I liked the combination of real life characters with their virtual duplicates. ""Ready Player One"" is progressing mostly in the virtual environment supported by computer animations, and sometimes it goes back to real life with real people. It is quite a fact that, people are getting attached to technology more and more each day. Due to the advanced technology and lack of trust among people, we start to enjoy solitude. I am one of those guys. I prefer my books and films to human interactions. Because there are expectations in the real life, but to be honest, I also envied the friendship in the film. In his film, Steven Spielberg promotes the idea of ""living in the real life because it is real"". ""Ready Player One"" shares this message out loud. This is the purpose of the film. He is using a highly advanced computer game to warn people against it, however this change is unavoidable because everyone is aware of this, and even so, they get more attached to it each day. People are happy indoors, they feel safe in the unsafe world. This is the main purpose of this change towards solitude.<br/><br/>Computer generated images and scenes are the strongest points of the film. There is a constant action, which will satisfy the fans of the action genre. The idea of the film is unique and equally amazing. While Spielberg follows a path in his film, he takes a lot of detours and shares pop culture references to aim for a less serious and more entertaining film. ""Ready Player One"" is one of the best films where you can see where the cinema technology is today. My favorite part of the film was, when the group enters in the Overlook Hotel in The Shining Universe, because The Shining is one of my favorite books. Strange enough, I find an unexplainable peace in that ghost hotel. With its atmosphere, message and soundtracks, as well as everything I have counted above, ""Ready Player One"" is a visual example of what is going to happen within the next 30 years. If I will be alive I can't wait to compare the film with the reality of 2045."

Of course I am aware of many of the references in the movie, being a gamer myself, but also a massive fan of movies.<br/><br/>Even so, I could not spot all of them and I'm pretty sure many out there have the same ""problem"". So if you want all of them, you probably have to watch the movie again. It might not fit in well with some of the story elements (very cliche), but it will help to keep an eye out for the references. Although for some you may want to google and find out when they come up (blink and you'll miss them).<br/><br/>The movie itself is well made, but you knew that with Spielberg on the helm.

Users of this world have competed with each other and a corporation to discover the whereabouts of these hidden secrets and the pot of gold that awaits to become the owner of the worlds largest company.

"AustinSober","7","3","6","19 May 2018"," 'Ready Player One' Review: High score for Spielberg
","""Ready Player One"" brings back the fun Steven Spielberg with an old-fashioned, effects-laden adventure where the world is often more important than its characters. Still, this world is guaranteed to entertain fans of nostalgia both young and old, even if the older crowd will find the basic plot formulaic and predictable.<br/><br/>The film is sort of like how ""Tron"" was back in 1982 if you replaced the made-up characters and environments with those of actual pop cultural icons. The future setting of the film is so displeasing that the majority of the population has chosen to enjoy their time inside the OASIS, a virtual reality video game where you can basically do anything or be anything. The socially awkward creator of this game James Halliday, now deceased, has left a three-step challenge that if completed, will grant the victor access to control the OASIS. The story follows Wade Watts and his friends on a quest to complete the challenge before an evil corporation that is bent on seizing control of the OASIS through the completion of the challenges and turning it into what would essentially be a pop-up ad heaven (or hell, depending on your perspective).<br/><br/>""Ready Player One"" is a great visual experience first and foremost. The use of nostalgia feels more as a means to be realistic rather than a means to capitalize on one's childhood. There are plenty of moments that are just there to be pointed out as Easter eggs, but it never distracts from the core story. The adventure inside the OASIS is fun and immersive in the classic Spielberg sense with the balance of seriousness and humor being on point. The film also does manage to throw in good messages and satire about society being obsessed with trying to escape the real world, often at the consequence of losing touch with the things of true value in the real world. The best example of this is the idea of teenagers developing a ""relationship"" online despite never seeing each other face to face. As one character quotes, ""You only see and hear what I want you to."" The message is also pushed via Halliday who chose to devote so much time to his own pop culture safe space, that he lost a close friend and a chance for love in the process. So in a sense, pop culture does serve an actual purpose. Still, purpose or not, it is very gitty to see so much on screen at once. I particularly jumped onto the fanboy train once the heroes entered the second stage of the challenge, which involves navigating a certain popular horror film which I shall not reveal.<br/><br/>This is definitely a film for kids, who will likely walk away with this ironically becoming a nostalgic part of their own childhoods. Adults will also have a lot of fun, but as an adult, I can't help but notice some things. For one, there really isn't much to the core plot. Outside the OASIS, things are pretty basic. The human characters are mostly just base level and, oddly enough, are overshadowed by the colorful avatar counterparts. The plot of an evil corporation, an underground resistance, and the inevitable revolution of little people vs elites has been done time and time before and sadly the film does nothing to mix up that narrative. The story goes pretty much where you expect outside of the visual package that is unique to ""Ready Player One's"" style. The characters aren't bad and all the actors are great, but only two really walk away with memorable depth: Watts's love interest Art3mis and OASIS creator James Halliday. Also, the exposition was very heavy at the beginning of the film. While some was necessary, there did come a point where I felt the voiceover narration from Watts was going overboard.<br/><br/>Most of this is just nitpicking as none of that ruins the overall fun factor of the picture. The world of the OASIS is worth price of admission and some good, timely messages do manage to speak through without feeling preachy or political. The fact that the nostalgia feels like it has an artistic purpose really impressed me, but I can't deny I will likely indulge into more viewings just to find all the pop culture Easter eggs I likely missed...for fanboy satisfaction.<br/><br/>Recommended.

There are some nagging issues with the underlying concepts. It's in need of a few tweaks. There are some greatness from master director Steven Spielberg but it is a flawed movie. There is no denying that it is a visually sensational action adventure. Spielberg's skills are superior although this movie is a bit of a modern references scattershot. Like Goro turning into Alien, it's a lot of recognizing familiar iconic images without it meaning anything. The only truly compelling reference is The Shining. The characters are allowed to spend time in the place and it ends with a compelling lesson. That's the only well written story arc. All the rest have some sort of flaws.<br/><br/>The first test relies on a random quote from a lifetime with little overall meaning. It would be more likely to come across the solution by accident. After years of failure, somebody should be driving off the track. Just by a process of elimination, a Sixer would have driven in reverse once. As for Sorrento, he is both omnipotent and ruthless. He's willing to kill. He has massive computer power to track down anybody. After capturing Samantha, the obvious move for him is to torture her for information on Wade and all his friends. After killing one, killing more is no hurdle. It's like Sorrento's character arc went back a step. He needs to kill off the five and tension could be build by killing them one at a time. I was perplexed by Daito and Sho's first inclusion but at least, I thought that they would make good plot devices or at a minimum, cannon fodder. The last thing I thought that they would be useful is as a real world Scooby gang. As for Wade's speech to rally the OASIS world, it should have happened sooner right after IOI blow up the trailer park. I kept waiting for Wade to call in an avatar press conference where he exposes his real identity and IOI's murder spree. Also, there is Samantha's god-awful ugly face. Yah, right. It's played up so much and yet it's only a Gorbachev birthmark. It misses a big point about that issue. She could easily cover it up with heavy makeup. Another thing, is Sorrento's big evil plan about pop up ads? Recent developments at Facebook show what actual damage to the social order looks like. This is kiddie writing by comparison in imagining the worst case scenario. In many ways, that's the problem. This could have been a deeper social commentary but it is mostly trying to be a fun videogame story. The final lesson is to go out and smell the flowers. It is the easiest and cheesiest of after school special. That's the level of the script."

","I loved this book and read it 3 times. I had been looking forward to this movie ever since and am completely disappointed in the movie. Half of the stuff in the movie has nothing to do with the book. The story in the movie is horrible and makes little sense at times. All the best parts of the book have been removed and replaced with horrible writing and random pop culture cameos just to please people who know nothing of the book. All of the actual video game playing or references are missing. All of the actual Easter eggs and gates have been removed. <br/><br/>I just hope some one buys the rights in the future and remakes it according to original story/book. Sadly this was the worse Spielberg movie I've ever seen and I love Spielberg. <br/><br/>Horrible movie."
"kluseba","9","3","6","9 April 2018"," More than meets the eye
","In the seventies, women were into sharp-dressed revolutioners. In the eighties, athletic types became more and more popular. Throughout the nineties, ideals became more material and people with beautiful and fast cars would attract people. Nowadays, geeks are all the rage. Twenty years ago, those people were outsiders because of their chubby features, big glasses and strange beards and because they spend most of their free time in front of their consoles in their parents' basement, wearing Mario Bros. shirts and drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos. Today, these outsiders have become trendy because of their chubby features, big glasses and strange beards and because they spend most of their free time in front of their consoles in their parents' basement, wearing Mario Bros. shirts and drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos. Sometimes, this world is a strange place. In order to understand more about this stereotype and pimp my trendy knowledge, I decided to give Ready Player One a shot.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much but got a very rewarding surprise. Ready Player One avoids stereotypes as opposed to my somewhat exaggerated yet quite accurate introduction. This movie could have focused on great-looking main characters who are destined for each other. But this isn't Divergent. The movie could have been overacted with overtly dramatic emotional ups and downs portraying immature teenagers. But this isn't The Hunger Games. The movie could have overwhelmed us with eye candy in form of massive flashy special effects without any depth. But this isn't Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. The film could have had a quite emotionless plot without any interest set in a stereotypical dystopian world. But this isn't Ghost in the Shell. The movie could have felt quite stretched with its ambitious running time of one hundred forty minutes and included vapid lows throughout the middle section. But this isn't Blade Runner 2049.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is better than all the movies mentioned before. The two main characters are grounded and sympathetic which makes their love story surprisingly credible and emotional. The acting performances are balanced as the characters are sometimes overwhelmed by emotions but often have to use their intellect to solve problems. The only moment when the movie overwhelms us with flashy colours is in the first five minutes to briefly introduce the virtual reality of OASIS but the rest of the movie doses special effects very well as the movie balances calm and intellectual moments with dramatic and vivid passages. The plot centered around a massive treasure chase might not be revolutionary but includes numerous clever references to pop culture of which I particularly liked the setting of The Shining, the nod to Mechagodizilla and the allusions to progressive rock veterans Rush. Moreover, the movie has several interesting messages such as the fact that nothing is as magic as our own reality. I also liked the side characters, especially the unique inventor of OASIS who reminds me of a mixture of Olaf Schubert and Tommy Wiseau. Finally, the movie didn't waste one single minute and was entertaining from start to finish thanks to an already interesting novel this movie was based upon, outstanding scriptwriting efforts and very solid directional work.<br/><br/>In the end, I can only recommend watching this movie at your local theater. You don't need a distracting, expensive and headache-inducing 3D version at Cineplex though, just go along with the old school 2D version in your small local cinema. It would suit the message and intention behind the novel and film much better. Now I can realate much more to geeks with their chubby features, big glasses and strange beards who spend most of their free time in front of their consoles in their parents' basement, wearing Mario Bros. shirts and drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos."
"jadepietro","7","3","6","31 March 2018"," Game Over
","GRADE: B- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A well-made but ultimately empty exercise in virtuoso filmmaking.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: The DeLoren and Back to the Future. Chucky the Killer Doll from Child's Play. The Overlook Hotel in The Shining. T-Rex from Jurassic Park. The holy McGuffin from Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail...items and places worth mentioning and on view in Stephen Spielberg's lively sci-fi fantasy movie, Ready Player One.<br/><br/>We are taken into the world of virtual reality while worshiping any of the above pop culture reference from the 70's or 80's along the way. Ready Player One is pure escapist fun, but your level of satisfaction will depend entirely on your knowledge base of the trends and fads of the 70's / 80's era. (My level of expertise is in the middling range. All of the gaming references and arcade entertainment in this film were scored zero, but I do have strong creds with the many filmdom referrals with aided in my enjoyment of this film.) Apparently all of our world prior to those eras is non-existent, faded relics of days gone by (except for one word...Rosebud). But celebrating the whiz-bang escapades in an advanced Tron universe may be all one needs to hunker down to prepare for a rollicking good time. After all, we are in the hands and mind of a master director working overtime to impress us, and he sporadically does, if only on a purely visceral level.<br/><br/>Ernest Cline's novel Ready Player One takes the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory premise and reboots that golden ticket to an escapist virtual reality game called OASIS where fantasy usurps a dark dystopian future. It is 2045 and as one character says, ""Reality is a real bummer."" People tune out their humdrum existence and tune in to the latest escape to an alternate world. It is there that a contest created by its crazed owner James Halliday (a winning Mark Rylance) entices them to own this Atari paradise. Unlimited wealth is the goal for whomever wins the most Easter Eggs and unlocks The Mystery of the Three Keys. Enter teen hero Wade (Tye Sheridan), a.k.a Parzival, his avatar counterpart, and his soon-to-be Scooby Doo gang: Aech, Daito, and Sho, plus Wade's love interest, Samantha (Olivia Cooke), a.k.a. Art3mis. It is they vs. CEO baddie Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), all eager for ownership of that coveted prize.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the film is only continuous chase loop after the next, with very little character development in between. The screenplay by Zak Penn and the author himself try to dole out the exposition and somewhat explain the perimeters of the game for those moviegoers that may be lost in virtual space, but it is very rough around the edges and the story goes increasingly off track. While there is no emotional connection, the movie has much eye-popping effects in its visual look.<br/><br/>Director Spielberg certainly knows his craft, how to set up a scene, establish the high adrenaline pace, and deliver the thrills. Credit him and his editing team, Michael Kahn and Sarah Broshar, the ever-reliable cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and that music score veteran, Alan Silvestri, for their massive contributions. (Highlights include an exciting race car scene and a wonderful sequence into Kubrick territory, a neon-lit disco sequence less so.) This whole enterprise may be a trifle in Mr. Spielberg legacy of films, but it remains a well-made one.<br/><br/>Less successful is the merging of the unreal and real worlds. The human story dulls in comparison with the more exciting fantasy storyline and never registers on an equal par with the virtual reality universe. And even in that unreal world, not all is right. The CGI avatar characters lack definition in their characters and renderings. Everyone seems to have an off-putting cartoonish look about them. They are upstaged by all the visual intricacies of their stunning surroundings and dazzling backgrounds. These figures lack the human details to involve this reviewer. The constant feeling of ""this is only a game"" interfered with my full pleasure of this movie and the perils they faced just seemed too remote. <br/><br/>As the film reaches its anti-climactic conclusion and the narrative strains for continuity, the film goes top-heavy and into forced overdrive becoming all sound and fury, a distracting cacophony of explosions, noise, smoke, and mirrors...the end result being overdone and empty.<br/><br/>My involvement throughout this movie was diversionary, admiring Mr. Spielberg's sleigh of hand, even if the movie itself was hardly visionary. My overall reaction was always one of entertainment with a lackadaisical resigned feeling. But Ready Player One just may appeal to a younger generation of gamers and its mass targeted audience of teenagers looking for the next thrill to occupy their short attention spans. I just needed a bit more...or less."

","For anyone who has read ready player one the book will be sadly disappointed with the movie. I know the book goes into great detail about each clue and challenges to get each key. But I would have rather the movie be in two movies to get some of the challenges the book had. The movie just gave away the keys like they were nothing, and they changed nearly every detail about the challenges in the book.

The names were right, the stacks did blow up, and there was the Orb of Osuvox, but the actual contest games were different, the way the players interacted together was the complete opposite of how they met, and there was never any wonder if main characters were actually going to fall in love because all of that was left out. <br/><br/>If you didn't ready the book maybe you will like it, but if you read the book, then prepare yourself."

"sylviann","1","4","10","11 April 2018"," An insult
","This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to review a movie. <br/><br/>This movie is a complete insult to the book. If I could give less points than 1, this would get a negative 10. <br/><br/>A movie based on a book should at least have one scene from the book.<br/><br/>It feels like they actually made an efford to completely shatter the whole plot and ""Hollywoodize"" it to oblivion. I didn't even crack a smile when I saw Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>I will not go into the dephts of why this movie is such an insult, because anyone who has read the book can see that for themselves. Also, many of the other reviews here are spot on. <br/><br/>The only thing that compelled me to actually stay at the cinema and see the whole movie is the fact that the tickets are ridiculously expensive where I live. (160 NOK =~$22) - And I bought two tickets. <br/><br/>DO NOT read the book before you see this movie!"
"swirlykev","1","4","10","10 April 2018"," Disappointing
","Firstly it's amazing how many paid reviewers are working on this to keep its rating up while down voting the genuine reviews, kind of defeats the purpose of a community review app. I knew it wasn't going to be the same as the book but this was a different story. The book was about isolation and the focus on the lead characters introverted and obsessive nature, the virtual school environment and his life in the stacks, that was what was enthralling. He didn't have the coins to leave the planet where his school was, and that was how he found the first key. The opening race is ridiculous and is just a waste of time, doesn't add anything and has nothing to do with the story. 
The book was also heavily about 80's culture and while there may have been some difficulty with licensing all the content of the book, I think rather than leave this much out it would have been better not to bother. It's a bit like making a film of the Hobbit but without any wizards, or Hobbits."
"oliverdimitri","9","4","10","1 April 2018"," For the Nerds/Geeks, Adventurers And Spielberg Lovers.
","Steven Spielberg is back. With his all new movie, Ready Player One, he brings out his A-game which apparently everyone has been waiting for since he's been doing less adventurous movies lately (which I totally disagree for that I kinda liked The BFG but not many people did). Even with last year's The Post, which was nominated for several Oscars this year, was not your typical adventure style Spielberg movie, it was one of his slow storytelling stories but the difference was that it was based on a true story. 
 Ready Player One is not just an adventure movie, it's a movie filled with Easter Eggs. They should make a genre for a movie like this for that it has never been done before, as far as I know, of course which may or may not be as far. It had Easter eggs from left to right, up and down and in every other direction. Some were incredibly visible and some are meant for the audience to keep their eyes peeled. It had callbacks from many pop culture favourites during mostly the 80's and 90's. Some Easter eggs were even from Spielbergs hit movies. The story was great but very cliche. It had a tiny bit everything. Humour, adventure, action, romance, a great cast and visually stunning CGI. 
 After being known as the better version of Cyclops after James Marsden in the X Men franchise, Tye Sheridan is at his best, although he maybe animated for the most of the movie. The humour was flavourful. The tone of the movie was perfection. The action scenes were all CGI so, no real stunts. The chemistry between the cast members are memorable although no one gets a full-on character development scene except maybe Sheridan's character, Wade Watts. The love chemistry was alright when they brought in the romance part of the film between Wade and Samantha a.k.a. Art3mis in the Oasis played by Olivia Cooke. The supporting characters were all fun especially Aech. The villain, played by Ben Menseldohn, seemed like a kids movie villain which can be accepted. 
 The best part of this movie is that it is based on a book. That much of movie was originally a book written by Ernest Cline, which I currently own but have not read it yet, unfortunately. Now after watching the film, I'm definitely going to read it. Another thing that made me feel like the movie was going to be good before I entered the cinema was finding out that the author, Ernest Cline, also the wrote the screenplay. You will defintely know when a book-adapted-movie is good is when the author is part of the movie making but when the author writing the screenplay, it's another level of reassurance. 
 Since I loved the movie so much, I just have to give it a 9/10. It deserves it. Although it maybe a movie filled with repeated nostalgia to 'The Good Old Days' as our parents would say."
"james-84064","5","5","14","1 April 2018"," Visually truly stunning, disappointing compared to the book
","Visually the film is fantastic. The imagination and graphics used to bring the world of the Oasis to life is so well done. Sadly the adaptation of the book is so removed and in place changed completely that it left greatly disappointed and frustrated. The intelligence and deeper character social elements have being removed paving the way for relationships that just didn't exist it this format and as such undermining the true intent. <br/><br/>I enjoyed it visual but not for the story, so glad I have read the book."

","It wasn't a bad movie but it's definitely not amazing. Just a middle of the road action, sci-fi movie with a weak love story.<br/><br/>It's quite different from the book which didn't make me hate it. I was able to watch it as it's own movie because other than the most basic premise of the book, it's changes so much.<br/><br/>They definitely updated it to appeal to a broader range of audiences (millennials and current gamers).<br/><br/>Like I said, it's not bad but it definitely doesn't deserve the praise it's getting. It's nothing special."

"dragokin","3","3","7","24 March 2019"," just another Hollywood movie
","I guess the only thing one might complain about while reading Ready Player One is the authors obvious intention to appeal to its readers. The fact the book found its way to the big screen confirms the assumption he had a capable manager under whose supervision this happened. Nevertheless, while reading it was fun remembering all those games, music and film, in short, all those cultural references of the 1980s.<br/><br/>And although the writer was in charge of the script, all those fun moments were removed. The end product is a forgettable Hollywood movie about the underdog saving the world while falling in love with a girl.<br/><br/>I can only assume that Steven Spielberg was under pressure from the executives to deliver in terms of return on investment. According to the media reports he succeeded, although not as, for example, Black Panther."
"TrevDA","10","3","7","5 September 2018"," Brilliant 80s nostalgia with relevant social message
","I left this movie feeling an incredible glow I haven't felt in ages. On the one hand the movie is jam packed with references to classic 1980s TV shows, computer games and movies, while it also has some very meaningful social commentary about the dangers of escapist entertainment relevant to the social media obsessed world of today. It is rare to find a movie that so seamlessly integrates the past with the future. Add to this was great characterisation, a well rounded and intriguing story and some satisfying special effects, it is hard to imagine how the movie could be any better. Also worth mentioning is how well it balances a love story with plenty of high energy action sequences. It has clearly been made with tremendous respect for the book and the 1980 source material it references. This movie will definitely be one of my favourites for a long time to come and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of classic pop culture, though I am sure its appeal will be much wider. Steven Spielberg thank you!"

On top of this mix in a bucket load of pop culture from the last few decades and sprinkle it with a little Spielberg magic of old and what you get is a future classic destined to be watched every Christmas for years to come, think Goonies pumped full of adrenaline and you won't be far off the mark.<br/><br/>You might be wondering about all the fuss surrounding the differences between the book and the film, and understandably so given the well documented polarising opinions on the subject so I'll say a couple of things on that. I'd like to add I read the book before seeing the film and my friend saw the film before reading the book and we both came to pretty much the same conclusion, both the book and the film are fantastically entertaining and neither devalues the other, this is partly because pop culture is by its very definition so vast and diverse that it would be extremely rare for any individual to have both understood and enjoyed every reference made in either the book or film so both mediums have something for everyone, also, given some of the books content and structure it's plainly obvious why it could never have survived the transition to the silver screen intact, time constraints are a big factor and the budget required for the film is another huge one. Maybe the biggest reason for it's successful transition under its unusual circumstances is the collaboration between the author of the novel and director of the movie in writing the screen play together, probably always on the cards given they are both capable, seasoned screen writers but undoubtedly played a big part in its success."

(1982), War of the Worlds and Jurassic Park series - I mentioned only couple of his Sci-Fi movies, took the Earth again by surprise in 2018. The movie script is good too although some people complained that the book is better. Also Ready Player One has a powerful message for it's addressing one of the problems that humankind has it right now: people spend to much time in VR or on social media."

","Watched 'Ready Player One' as someone who got a lot of pleasure out of the book and who loves a lot of Steven Spielberg's previous work. Despite it getting a fair share of criticism from fans of the book, that there were also enough good things said about it from critics and that many of my friends said it was worthwhile persuaded me enough to see it. <br/><br/>'Ready Player One' left me with a mixed view (or just slightly above). As a book adaptation 'Ready Player One' is severely wanting, having lost what made the book so special. As a film on its own, which is how it will be judged by me being a much fairer way to judge, 'Ready Player One' is quite decent though with faults. It is nowhere near being one of Spielberg's best, a distinction he has not hit for a while (though for me he has not sold out), at the same time it is not one of his misfires either. To me 'Ready Player One' is a middling effort.<br/><br/>Starting with its good merits, 'Ready Player One' looks incredible. One of those films where one is truly immersed in a world filled with a non-stop sense of wonder. The Oasis depiction is rich in wonder, adventure, vibrancy and imagination, the cool factor is also high. The special effects are pretty spectacular. Alan Silvestri provides the best score in a Spielberg film since 'War Horse' (and one of the best in the past fifteen years or so), providing a lot of energy and thrills. <br/><br/>Nostalgia is rife with inspired cameos of numerous significant cultural characters, like the 'Jurassic Park' dinosaur and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and even more numerous cultural references, highlights being the 'Back to the Future' Delorean and the Overlook Hotel from 'The Shining'. There is enough wit and intrigue in the writing and the story has many instances where it is fun and laden in thrills, the chase scenes especially. Particularly standing out is the one switching between real world and the Oasis. Spielberg delivers on the spectacle, the world building and the visual style. <br/><br/>Although not complex or subtle, the characters are engaging enough. Olivia Cooke is very appealing and shares charming chemistry with Tye Sheridan. Simon Pegg is great fun, while Ben Mendelssohn has a whale of a time as the villain and Mark Rylance beautifully and terrifically provides the emotion and soul that is not quite there elsewhere. <br/><br/>However, the story does tend to be lacking. There is just too little structurally in a very long, too long even, running time, no matter how many cultural references there are. With trying to take on a lot, character depth and development are sacrificed in favour of spectacle and nostalgia. Luckily those are done well, but one does wish that the characters were more interesting with the lead character in particular not having much growth.<br/><br/>This does affect somewhat Tye Sheridan's performance, shining in the chemistry with Cooke but elsewhere it's somewhat bland and cold. The script does have wit and intrigue but it can also be exposition heavy, and it is here where the writing feels rambling, unnatural and clumsy. There are aspects of Spielberg's directing that comes over well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what doesn't is the complete command of the material and giving the film enough soul and emotion (Rylance cannot bring those qualities out all on his own, no matter how well he did them). Some of the messaging is heavy-handed and the finale is far too overly-sentimental and where the sketchiness of the character development and overall depth is most betrayed.<br/><br/>Overall, diverting and entertaining enough but was expecting more. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","In this Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi film, directed by Steven Spielberg (E.T., Jurassic Park) and screenplay written by Zak Penn (The Avengers, X-Men 2) and Ernest Cline (Fanboys, Armada) based on Cline's novel, Tye Sheridan (X-Men Apocalypse, Mud) stars as Wade (aka Parzival) who joins other players Art3mis/Samantha (Olivia Cooke: The Signal, Ouija), Aech/Helen (Lena Waithe: Dear White People, Master of None), Sho (Philip Zhao in his first acting role) and Daito (Win Morisaki: Kamen Rider W, Sherry) as they try to be the first one to find all three Easter Eggs.

Will they beat him?<br/><br/>This film felt like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with CGI and for me, the sequences relying heavily on computer generated images slowed it down. Although I enjoyed the many 80s references and, if you will excuse the pun, the Easter Egg pop culture references for those in the know, the live action parts were far more enjoyable for me. Having not read the book (yet), I am sure these were made more of than in the movie but the action scenes speed by so fast there is hardly any time to register the Delorean before it is gone, to give just one example.<br/><br/>There were also some slow sections that detracted not helped by the one-dimensional characters and predictable plot but the scene in the hotel which channeled The Shining was done very well, even if it did make my son determined never to watch that movie.<br/><br/>Despite this, I loved the idea of the OASIS and the future depicted. Wade's home in 'The Stacks' felt very real and the bad guy's plan to put ads in people's visuals whilst playing the game, scarily possible. Even to the point that he was warned it could affect vision and minds.<br/><br/>I look forward to reading the book"

"letande","6","7","23","29 March 2018"," I love Ready Player One. It's so BAD!
","First of all, yes, I did read the original novel. And no, I didn't like it. The biggest problem with the book was... well... the fact that it was bad. It was really dull and poorly written novel that got a lot of popularity thanks to how Ernest Cline threw a lot of random pop culture references into it. And I kind of understand that it's cool to find a mention of your favorite stuff from the past in a modern novel. And sure, it's even more fun when there's a lot of such stuff. Retro video game consoles, all kinds of retro movies, tokusatsu, old music... People didn't really like Ready Player One. They liked all that. Their own memories about the good old times. The book itself didn't really matter. So, when the movie adaptation was announced... it was somewhat obvious how it'll end.<br/><br/>And you know what? That's pretty much what happened. Long story short, Mr. Spielberg removed most of the dark and depressive stuff from the original story and made it more friendly to young audience. So, now you can experience the story with your entire family. The movie is much more bright, the movie is much more naïve, the movie is much more romantic, the movie is much more charming. Aside from that, the movie utilizes the same exact concept with the book. Which means, it doesn't really try to be a good and interesting movie. If what you need from the movie is a good story with interesting twists and complicated characters, then sorry, you won't find anything of that here. Ready Player One isn't really bad, though. It's just dull and straightforward. I'm pretty sure they've stopped making such movies ages ago. Remember all those movies about some kids, some villains, chase in the end and happy ending? That's pretty much it. If we'll forget about all that pop culture stuff for a second, Ready Player One can feel almost exactly the same with 1989 movie called The Wizard for example. It's really hard not to compare Nolan Sorrento from Ready Player One with Putnam from The Wizard. Some scenes are some similar that I can't help but wonder if it was done on purpose. The original novel didn't give me such an expression and... well... it's pretty stupid. It's like even the real life part of the story doesn't have its own face. Also, think about it. It's supposed to be a movie for geeks. Did they really think that geeks forgot about The Wizard? The movie is a freakin' icon! And yet, Ready Player One repeats it a lot. Like I said, it's a pretty dull and straightforward movie that feels really dated.<br/><br/>And that's where pop culture comes in. Just like it did in the novel. And it works exactly the same. You won't have time to think about how bad the movie is. You'll be like ""OMG! It's DeLorean!"". And ""OMG! She has M41A Pulse Rifle!"". And ""OMG! It's the original RoboCop!"". Got it? It's just so... cool too see all those characters, weapons, vehicles, video game consoles and other stuff in a single movie that wow effect can actually blind you a little. Up until the end of the movie, actually. Especially if you're watching it in 3D. Even the pop culture part isn't that great, though. Because even that part suffered from some obvious obstacles. Mr. Spielberg sure got a lot of stuff. Even more than was mentioned in the novel, actually. And yet, he was unable to get some things that were very important there. Like he was unable to get Leopardon. Famous giant robot from Japanese Spider-man series. Which is kinda weird, since Leopardon appeared in the American comics during the big Spider-man crossover. Can't believe that he was that hard to get. Especially since they've got Gundam. Which was absolutely cool, but... it was Leopardon that used to give the original text that ultimate geeky feeling. Like you know. Many people don't even know about Takuya Yamashiro, while you're sitting there, hearing ""Yeah-yeah-ye-a-a-h, WOW!"" in your head. Really big loss for a movie. And not the only one too.<br/><br/>Another big problem in my opinion is the modern stuff. I mean, it was clearly stated in the original novel that creator of OASIS, James Halliday, was obsessed with very certain time period. Naturally, hunters tried to imitate that. And yet, here, during the big fight, in the first rows we see characters like Master Chief from HALO series and Tracer from Overwatch. There's nothing wrong with it technically, but the way they did it totally ruins the mood. Ready Player One was supposed to be all about retro. To have that awesome retro feeling of 70s and 80s. And yet, we see product placement in the first rows. I mean, OK, Blizzard wanted to show off their overrated FPS even more, but in the first rows... no. Just no. There are so many amazing old movies and games... and yet we're watching modern stuff everybody tired of. Come on!<br/><br/>As for what was changed from the original novel... Well, a lot, really. Some characters (even the main ones) were heavily changed, some were completely removed, but I can't say that it really matters. Because, like I said, the original novel wasn't really good, or well-written. Technically, you can change it as you like and you won't ruin anything important. It's not like they've removed Tom Bombadil, or something like that. Actually, I kind of liked how they made people from real world more involved. Felt just right. What I really hated was that stupid message in the end. One of those ""don't play your games for too long, kids!"" that we usually get from Nintendo nowadays. I mean, what? The whole idea about Ready Player One was that there's not much left on the other side. It's not like it's a story about kids who are way too addicted to their cute little VR game. It's not a story about the VG addiction for Pac-Man's sake! That message was so wrong in every place possible and doesn't even make sense.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't really like much was soundtrack. Which came out as a big surprise to me, since I expected much more. I mean, we've got some sort of an ultimate crossover here. They're using a lot of popular old songs in all sorts of movies nowadays. And yet, we've got only a few most obvious songs. Jump by Van Halen, Take on Me by A-ha, Stayin' Alive by Bee Gees with its own scene, designed after Saturday Night Fever, and some others. Not bad, but... with so many pop culture references you can't help, but want more. I mean, come on! Soundtrack feels a lot like songs were selected by people, who've read about 80s, but didn't really live back then. It's like making a movie about 60s and using only Elvis, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. I'm really disappointed, even though aside from what we can actually hear in the movie, there's also a lot of visual references.<br/><br/>Anyway, what's in conclusion? In conclusion, Ready Player One is an expensive, but uninspiring attraction for geeks. We've got a chance to see a lot of popular stuff from different franchises at the same place, but honestly, there's no real reason for all that. It doesn't even feel like movie makers really cared. It's like they've just got a lot of rights, mixed everything together and voilà. We've got a movie. Even the original novel tried to make things more useful. In the movie it's just that. The only meaning for copyrighted stuff is the one that movie makers were able to get it. Take The Wizard, threw a lot of random stuff into it, mix and serve. Unlike all the movies and games that were mentioned in this movie one way or another, Ready Player One is hollow. You're supposed to make your own meaning here by remembering your good times with all that old stuff. And it's a really sad thing to see. They had a chance to make a movie that geeks will remember for ages. Instead, they made a one-time attraction. Ready Player One isn't really a bad movie and you'll probably enjoy your first experience with it a lot. Especially with a good company. It's just you probably won't want to see it again. Because seeing DeLorean in the same group with Chun-Li is fun, but still, it's much more fun to re-watch Back to the Future and re-play Street Fighter II. Ready player one fails to deliver and interesting story and, unfortunately, doesn't really capture the true meaning of the pop culture. And it doesn't matter who's to blame here, the original source, of Mr. Spielberg. The fact is the fact. Ready Player One is a one-time attraction."
"Nicnnyeah","4","8","28","21 March 2018"," The book is so much better (spoiler alert)
","BIG SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>I realise that if they'd stuck rigidly to the plot in the book the film would be 12 hours long and some of the technology they'd need doesn't exist yet so some changes are inevitable, but.... ouch, some of them really sting! For example, they miss out how poor Parzival is and the fact that he can't just hop from planet to planet (he has a multi-directional treadmill in the back of his van hideout, for crying out loud!!); they don't explain the Oasis set-up at all actually (no mention of the realms and themed planets, no mention of basic avatar clothing or the fact that it's free to enter, very minimal mention of stuff in the Oasis costing real money); they completely miss out school, so no explanation of where he got the visor and gloves etc (and no school planet...); no mention of the scoreboard change being a MASSIVE newsworthy item; barely a mention of Parzival and all the other Gunters' obsessive study of Anorak's life (there's a 'museum' instead that people go to in order to study his life and likes); they change ALL the methods/situations around getting the keys, including all the clues, gates, challenges etc; they make it seem like it takes about 2 days from start to finish, when it actually took months; Parzival meets up with Art3mis almost straight away instead of at the very end; Og is barely in it; Art3mis goes into IOI as a result of getting caught by them instead of Parzival going in as part of a clever and risky plan; plus, they really pushed the relationship between Art3mis and Parzival into much more of a soppy love story (leaving out where she cuts off all contact with him for weeks); the one that disappointed me most though was that they didn't do the War Games challenge, where Parzival has to be ""in"" the film (I realise that would have relied on a massive technological leap to make it happen but I really wanted it to be in there!).<br/><br/>Anyway, now I've got that off my chest, I will say that if you haven't read the book - or if you have, but don't allow the changes to bother you like they bother me - then it's quite a good film. My husband really liked it and he hasn't read the book. Mark Rylance is fantastic as Anorak. I would probably rate it 8 if I could let the changes slide, but I can't. I wanted to give it a 5 or 6 but have settled for a 7 because I know I'm letting the plot deviations get in the way!"
"nicholasrains","Null","5","15","1 April 2018"," The remake can't come soon enough
","The two good things about the book are the concept and the plot, and the movie has neither. It does have good performances from the leads, even if some of the character development abandons the source material in disappointing and presumably unnecessary ways-and it is slightly fun to watch if you forget what you should be watching and focus on the pretty lights. In the book, the story is driven by visual detail that celebrates a distinctive period in pop culture that was largely defined by the director; it was ready made to be turned into a movie that should and easily could have been far better than the book. What a sorry twist that such a poorly written book was turned into such a poorly directed movie. Maybe the licensing was just that impossible? Maybe they didn't realize there was an audience for the story in the book? Maybe another iconic eighties director can give it a shot in a few years?"

","With READY PLAYER ONE Spielberg arguably hit a new career low. It's really baffling how unaware of its own socio-economical and cultural themes this film actually is.<br/><br/>The whole setting couldn't be more dystopian and depressing with people basically living in a virtual reality because of their frustration with real life. But the film never adresses that, never once questions the system as a whole and instead chooses to gloss reality over with its naive celebration of nostalgic escapism where 1980s pop culture is elevated to high culture standards.<br/><br/>READY PLAYER ONE is a mind-numbing accumulation of endless references with a very simple and formulaic story barely holding it all together. The way this film presents ""culture"" is ultimately very telling. Everything is being reduced to either edgy quotes or visual appearance - the Overlook Hotel taken out of Kubrick's THE SHINING is nothing more than a cool backdrop and the Iron Giant just some powerful weapon.<br/><br/>Spielberg probably thinks that a world where all cultural knowledge is reduced to John Hughes movies and the suit from Buckaroo Banzai is cool and somehow desirable. It's not."

","Aside from the movie title being misleading:<br/><br/>The movie's ""Oasis"" concept doesn't work for the movie at the point where they reveal it being about PVP capitalism, where killing people, not gathering, not creating things, is where the money is created to spend on things. How should that be a world for the people to participate in - and where are the cheaters, hackers, farmers and bot users ?
If there's only war in there to ""earn"" money: How do people get the place they want the way they want it to be, as initially shown ? Everything seems always to be tied to coins to pay with if you want anything. So in reality this would be a pay to win game. No one would play this, let alone the poor masses. It's not an escape from reality, not a better world, it's just another chore.<br/><br/>~Spoilers ahead~<br/><br/>The whole 5 admins thing at the end just shows how much the missed the point. They call for others in the times of trouble but go back to a 5man admin team once they don't need them anymore. They know a PVP loss can cause people to kill themselves (as shown in a scene in the movie earlier on) but they don't fix that. Neither is there a single word about the world wipe and the loss of (years) of gear progression, because what do they care for the people that helped them ? They're happy and get their good ending and that's all Oasis taught them. Pyramid society ""for everyone"".<br/><br/>With neither story, nor real or virtual world, including the characters there, being well done it's one of those below average movies with a big hype.<br/><br/>4 / 10 at best.<br/><br/>I wish
-this was a longer movie with a title that wasn't misleading compared to what's in the actual movie (!)
-it wouldn't just be that kids vs adults concept but instead there would be a variety of people with different skills, knowledge, relevance etc. and that in both worlds, to form an interesting story instead of one driven by an ego concept and dumb luck
-they'd take a time to shine a real light on their version of the ""real world"" that is a ""dystopia"" because we didn't really get much of why and how in there and apparently in a ghetto in a dystopian society you still get you average non-corrupt police which doesn't show up when some houses are blown up but when a rich CEO runs around with a gun (without shooting someone)
-they'd highlight any Oasis content created by players that is anything else but Oasis intro / sell / buy related but features the propagated ""better world"". There was only the PVP world they showed and it's absolutely pointless, background and gameplay mechanic lacking PVP that people are forced (!) to participate in to earn money with<br/><br/>Everything in Oasis is about currency and score and the story is about the (admin) ego. While that's so the movie still tries to deliver a message about ""we, together"" and ""Have fun. That's all that matters."" - despite the PVP scene, showing that PVP loss = attempted suicide and despite the flaws I already mentioned with the concept of Oasis.
By my understanding of the movie a high level player is also one with a lot of coins, so there'd be a high value in killing high ranking players, yet there's a total absence of cheating / hacking / gang groups, let alone the display of interesting ambush- & combat mechanics or safe- & danger zones. Not even basic FPS or stealth concepts were touched in that movie, just a little bit of plattforming and racing.
The online fame part comes without problematic people, like haters, fake news etc. but doesn't get in touch with the community that there is either.<br/><br/>If there's a concept for a suit that's able to make the user feel pain - how wouldn't a hacker try to abuse this to activate 100% pain on all sources to either easily take out an enemy or gain something from someone that way ? Why are there no custom made substitutes ? If PVP is so highly competitive why not take the next step and use drugs as people do in sports ?
They should've used the concept of brain cases. That'd have the whole concept far more intrusive, dark and questioned their ""real world"" in a Matrix style. But I guess then they couldn't have their happy ending in their dystopian society in which they fixed nothing.
The Resistance: Fails TWICE in a row with the same mistake, causing them to be found and chased. All characters are conveniently close to another. No need to travel in the world and maybe show something of it or futuristic transportation concepts.<br/><br/>Even if this movie would get a sequel it failed on all fronts, making this unsalvageable. I bet they had an initial concept but no understanding of anything, didn't visit the sources or if then only on the shallow surfaces and surely didn't take their time to finish with a polished movie that had all points covered and a setup that WORKS. It's basically a movie with cliches and references aimed at kids but being too bad to matter for anyone, literally (aside from critics warning that this will waste your time).<br/><br/>I don't understand why this is rated so good with so many flaws and so little good in it. Literally every aspect in the movie has been done better by other movies in the past. This one wouldn't even work if they'd try to turn it into pure sarcasm.<br/><br/>Literally watch anything else that did a better job instead of this.
Be it Idiocracy, Total Recall, Tron, Matrix or whatever else to cover a single or multiple categories with movies done way better than this one (also sorry: forgot some movies' names...)."

The creator of the Oasis, James Halliday (Mark Rylance) dies, but before doing so, leaves a challenge for players within the Oasis. The challenge is to find 3 hidden Easter eggs - keys, which would award the successful player with control of the Oasis and the fortune built up from the majority shares that Halliday had. Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) is one of the players and a massive fan of Halliday, he figures out how to get the first key. Sharing the information with his friends, they all embark on a virtual adventure to try and get the other keys before a megalomaniacal corporation IOI get them and ruin the Oasis for their own wealth and benefit.<br/><br/>This Spielberg film is epic, both visually appealing and a decent (albeit cliché and predictable) story. It combines a lot of pop culture mediums into one movie; from video games, to films, from board games to music - if youth culture has embraced something, a nod to it is featured in this film. I asked myself though, do the references to different pop-cultures alienate some of the audience - I'm a mega nerd but there were some things in the film that got passed me. Thankfully, despite its visual complexity, the story was almost formulaic for a Spielberg film (even if the film was based on a book). Even if you don't get the references you can still follow the story and get some enjoyment from it.<br/><br/>The cast were all decent, but they only evoked the same level of emotions from me as an audience member, as they portrayed on screen - which wasn't a massive array of emotions to say the least. At times in fact, some of the acting was almost wooden.<br/><br/>I can only give this 7 out of 10 I'm afraid, and that's purely for the nostalgia is occasionally invoked and the beautiful scenery imagined. Sure the film was decent, but the fact that I wrote decent and not amazing tells me that I have seen better and I have seen worse. All in all, an average film which looked good but was a little undeveloped on brains and emotions."

There, our attention seems more focused upon the background noise and blink-to-miss cameo appearances than the plot and core characters. Granted, those little tidbits and surprises are responsible for much of what made the book so unique, and I'm sure they cost a pretty penny to shoulder into the scenery. Are they really more valuable than character development? The main cast is basically a narrow series of templates, plain as can be, and neither the virtual world nor the real one are fleshed out any further than the fight locations in a typical game of Street Fighter II.<br/><br/>A few fun ideas do not make for a nourishing film experience.

"Scarefish","1","2","4","21 August 2018"," Ready Player Dumb
","I haven't read the book, but it hardly sounds like something that would interest me. The premise is dull, and the whole virtual reality thing has not been something that has gripped my attention. What it boils down to is fan service and references aping off of people's fleeting nostalgia with a simple cookie-cutter plot to excuse the story's existence.<br/><br/>The movie is decidedly focused on TV and film, mostly popular in the 70s through 90s, with the occasional 80s pop-rock song thrown into the mix. What I find odd is that people in the future would be clinging on to these outdated properties so seriously - it's somewhat unrealistic, as you can see if you go into a real virtual chat room nowadays as there's an overabundance of memes. It is also hard to believe that nothing new and original would have become a cultural sensation by the time this story takes place.<br/><br/>The characters are flat and basic as can be, and the acting and writing is bad to boot. This film feels like a cheesy 90s film with its cliched dramatic elements, its inappropriately placed melodrama, and its cartoonishly evil white businessman villain. The main characters emotional acting is completely wrong, as he fails to emote following the death of his aunt, yet he over-emotes upon meeting the creator of The Oasis, bursting into tears.<br/><br/>This film apparently introduces new story elements that don't make sense. The secret to the first puzzle is just something the average racing game enthusiast would accidentally stumble upon within ten minutes of playing the game, yet the film acts like our hero cracked the Da Vinci Code once he figures it out.<br/><br/>The ending is one of the worst I've ever seen that shows that the writers clearly didn't think before submitting it. Once our hero gains ownership of The Oasis, he decides to shut down the Oasis two days a week to force people to go out into the real world and experience life. There is no way this marketing practice would work in real life, as logically you'd come to think ""Oh, well people work every day of the week at all times. What about people who only get those two days off? Well, **** them, I guess, who needs them anyways?"" What real games do is they implement rested XP as a means to reward players for avoiding binging for extended periods of time, and this method proved to be very effective, and prior to this there were more serious issues that aren't addressed in this story at all, such as people literally dying from gaming marathons. There's a lot of material here to work with, but unfortunately everything is surface-level at best. I imagine anyone with any knowledge of gaming whatsoever will find this ending extremely annoying, and for me it was the cherry on top of a over-hyped heap of trash.<br/><br/>The only scene I found interesting is that Shining scene, but even that is incredibly short-lived as it's followed by a nonsensical dancing zombie platforming sequence.<br/><br/>I also don't understand why they're working so hard in real life to create a treadmill for virtual gaming. Surely a hamster-ball type contraption would abide by the laws of physics. Also, people are walking the streets playing by the end of the film, yet none of them seem to bump into each other or any of the real-life objects in their way despite being such a huge mob, and characters are clearly shown playing via mouse and keyboard earlier, which would be a much safer and effective method than walking around in the real world. The tech simply doesn't make sense if you think about it.<br/><br/>This film is yet another lacking creativity to come from Steven Spielberg in recent years, and will surely only be a blast for nostalgia-tripping 90s kids and the least demanding of casual movie-goers alike."

The fact that I love games and see all these characters from my favourite games in the movie makes me excited.<br/><br/>BEFORE YOU READ. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU CONSIDER THIS SPOILING BUT BE AWARE :)<br/><br/>But... I do not get why they have to put any romance in this amazing action/sci-fi movie... Everything went well and was so amazing until he met this girl three times and was already in love. I just think they rushed the romance. And I honestly just wish they could make this movie without any romance. It felt like they had to add more time and story, so they just made their main characters to fall in love. Like what...?
They tried to make the movie more «deep (emotionally)» but failed. Because this movie is funny and adventurous. Like I get it. The movie had some emotional scenes but they just did it in the wrong way. They were very dramatic about things that could have been avoided in the movie. Like Samantha's birthmark. 
But in the end i liked the movie and enjoyd watching it! :)"

","A lonely game developer who claimed to be happy in his own world, put him building a exhaustive virtual world with so many possibilities, with unimaginative puzzles left after his death to be cracked for ruling the OASIS. Five years of futile efforts of the members of OASIS including Wade Watt to search for the Easter egg, then sudden appearance of Samantha sparked a feeling inside him to boost further intelligent acts to crack all of the puzzles to obtain three keys. After meeting with the real world allies who were putting them aside on the VR world, Their plans took lots of impulsive moves to underscore the legendary achievement, which provides the completeness of the movie.<br/><br/>The most important notion that this movie is carrying, is it's after realization for the human world's inclination to the virtual existence. That's where i gave a big 5/5. An unpredictable move executed by the mighty Spielberg wasn't so frustrating. People keeping themselves busy with comparing this plot with the book story, is nothing but a ploy to be superior pretending to be famous film makers. It's foolish to expect something which you already know, ruins your hope.
Even some of the parts got some tin-tin touch, the animation merging with reality gave it to an unexpected vibe, you will sometimes get lost to differentiate about which world is real, it's feel like 2045 is colliding with 3045. Some small segments contain humors including the big ugly faced robot giant is being traumatized by horror chasing of the ""Shinning"" characters. Followed by unprecedented enlightenment, the movie holds classic emotions being concurrent to technological cryptic alignment with some magical appearance of the game characters. Several glimpses of the characters of your past experienced movies may put a transient rhythm to your brain with nostalgia, then again drop you back to your original space."

I did have a few disappointments though that would have made this movie into something I would want to watch again.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: 
Art3mus turns out to be a very attractive cool girl in the real world (just like she seems in the game world). As far as I can tell, her only physical issue is a birthmark on her face, which didn't look that bad to me. It kind of looked like a cool tattoo in a way which fits her character. I would have given her more real world challenges to make the love story come alive.<br/><br/>The Back to the Future music was starting to get a bit too cutesy and repetitive for me. It was good the first few times.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the ending changed the outlook of the bleak vision of the future.<br/><br/>Full disclosure that I grew up with a poster of an Atari dual floppy disk drive on my wall as something I could afford only in my dreams. So I have a soft spot for these types of stories. I have to say though, it was a fun 2+ hours of entertainment.<br/><br/>For parents, I would rate this a mild PG-13. There were definitely no F words and I can't remember any other curse words either. No nudity. There were some very mild sexuality. Even the violence was tame with wounds being shown as dripping coins. I did quite enjoy the image of losing coins and trying to scoop them back up."

"CinemaClown","Null","2","4","15 May 2018"," Pure Spielberg Magic
","Jam-packed with overwhelming nostalgia & countless references to pop culture of 1970s & onwards, Ready Player One marks Steven Spielberg's return to the genre he single-handedly revolutionised with his sweeping cinematic vision and presents the cinematic game-changer in sublime form as his latest is another larger-than-life extravaganza.<br/><br/>The story of Ready Player One takes place in the year 2045 where people regularly visit a virtual reality universe called OASIS in order to escape the desolation of their real lives. The plot revolves around the contest that was announced after the death of OASIS founder, the winner of which will inherit the full ownership & control of the virtual universe.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, it's been a long time since a film of his has been this fun, adventurous & freewheeling. Infused with a sense of warmth, wonder & magic that only he can provide, Ready Player One sets its premise by giving an overview of the fundamentals of OASIS with speed & clarity. Every frame is a pop culture galore yet Spielberg makes sure that his film has its own identity.<br/><br/>Production design team brings OASIS alive in meticulous detail and the navigation through it is smooth & effortless. While the first race sequence offers an adrenaline high & jaw-dropping thrills unlike anything in recent years, one particular standout is the film's tribute to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, ingeniously recreating the setting, mood & atmosphere of that horror masterpiece right down to a tee. <br/><br/>Cinematography operates the camera with kinetic flair for scenes set in the OASIS while events taking place in real world are drenched in cold, desaturated palette to further reflect the dismal world its inhabitants are living in. Editing isn't perfect when it comes to interweaving the drama unfolding in two worlds but the pacing is terrific. 
Instead of Spielberg's long-time collaborator John Williams, we have Alan Silvestri composing the score and he does well to fill up the void.<br/><br/>Also worthy of mention are its spectacular visual effects without which Ready Player One wouldn't exist. And as always is the case with a Spielberg film, every VFX shot is exquisitely refined, seamlessly integrated & never feels out of place. Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Mark Rylance, Ben Mendelsohn & others, and though there are no standouts, all of them do well with their live-action roles as well as their respective OASIS avatars.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ready Player One is an endlessly captivating, entertaining & satisfying sci-fi adventure that effortlessly succeeds as an awe-inspiring ode to the genre that cemented Spielberg's own legacy, a heartfelt love letter to cinema, and one nostalgia trip that you may want to revisit again n again. One of the finest films of the year so far, Steven Spielberg's latest is pure escapist bliss in every sense of the word and a cinematic gem for anyone & everyone. Strongly recommended."

"PaRappa_276","4","0","0","13 June 2020"," The film equivalent to Smash Bros.
","Ready Player One has only been out for 2 years, and it has already shown its age. The story, while an interesting concept, is very poorly executed. Lots of plot holes that go nowhere. How exactly did the world start turning into what it is now? Did Halliday ever dealt with any lawsuits when operating the OASIS, which is filled with excessive pop-culture references?
Sorrento's reasoning for ruling the OASIS is never explained. Why does he want to rule the OASIS? What gave him the idea of wanting to rule it? These plot holes could've easily been solved if they focused less on the excessive nostalgia pandering and focus more on character development. Or better yet, the filmmakers should've split the film into 3 parts (1 part for each of the 3 keys), yeah it would've been more expensive, but the end result would most likely pay off better than what we got. This movie doesn't focus on its story very well, and as a result, comes off as an unfinished mess. This film doesn't even have a strong identity, the amount of nostalgic references to movies, games, TV shows, books, and songs are so excessively in your face and so blatant, that it makes it very tedious and tiring to get through this movie. It's the same issue I have with another property that has the same issues, Smash Bros. is what this film reminded me of, because of how horrifically pandering it is to nostalgic people. Is there anything I like about this movie? Yes there is. There are a couple of jokes that do get a good chuckle out of me, some of the blatant references do make some sense in the context of the film, and the ending is very well put together for having a message that reality is the only place worth living in, as painful and miserable it can be. In conclusion, while I did love this movie back in 2018, I feel like this movie has already aged so badly. Years from now, nostalgia is going to die off as a fad, and considering how many old properties have been referenced and resold to the extreme, I don't see this film holding up in the future, especially when people stop falling for the nostalgia exploitation that companies love to abuse. There are better movies that are about video games or take place in a video game in that movie's world. Wreck-it-Ralph (2012) is one of the better examples of a video game themed film done right, it has references to real games, but they're all background references that aren't in your face nor are they the main focus, while the made-up games are the main focus.<br/><br/>I don't recommend wasting 2 hours and 20 minutes of your time with Ready Player One. Go watch one of Spielberg's other movies instead."

I just finished the movie and I can't express how disappointed it was. They obliviated almost everything that made the book so incredible while forcing a real terrible version of the original plot. Instead of using great dialogues and characters development, tricky researchs by the puzzles, the hard competition and pride between Wade, his friends and IOI, the hard challenges to go through the gate and the questions around the OASIS and the real world, they did a Ready Player One background with a really bad plot, shallow development and great visual effects and CGI."

","A powerful corporation's attempt to get complete control over a universal virtual reality medium that has become the epicenter of a diminished society in the future and the fight waged against it by a handful of highly-skilled gamers is portrayed in this Spielberg sci-fi film. Spielberg's knack for futuristic storytelling is at work here, but it is ultimately overwhelmed by the film's many, many mistakes. There is a panoply of cultural references here, but it's so layered that you might just ignore it after a certain point. Hearing people in this film rattle off one cultural reference after another can become distracting, maybe even annoying.<br/><br/>Even after you accept this film's inane premise and its risible presentation, it is difficult to sustain interest simply because the film goes on and on and on. Long before the overdue climax, you likely will have lost any emotional investment in where everything is going, for a number of reasons. In the end, the film turns out to be a moralizing parable about the divide between virtual fantasy and real life. This is a perplexing way to tie everything together because it nullifies most of the film's story and renders the two hours and change you've spent on the subject matter to be fruitless. Instead of taking this preachy stance, the film could have just kept quiet and settled for mere B-movie status.<br/><br/>I don't know the degree to which this film departs from its source material and I don't care. With or without the book, the film fails on its own because it gives us little compelling reason to become, let alone stay firmly invested in its silly premise, one which it appears to abandon in the end. Trying to make us care about a virtual reality universe for more than two hours and then largely jettisoning it, kind of renders the film a nullity. It's never a good thing when you're wondering if you just went through a pointless exercise. Spielberg with bad marks on this one. Not recommended."

I find science fiction movies are better when there are bits of realism intertwined with the science fiction making you believe in the situation. Nothing wrong with humor but he hit a pre-teen level of humor. Treat your audience as though they are intelligent and even most 11 years old's get it. From a director that pulled off Jaws and Minority report, I am disappointed.<br/><br/>There was no feeling of loss when a character died.

The second time I saw the film, I loved it, and now I have seen it three times in total.<br/><br/>The acting across the board is great, but I expected nothing less from a Steven Spielberg film. Tye Sheridan, Ben Mendelsohn, and Mark Rylance are amongst some of the biggest names the film boasts, but Olivia Cooke is the real standout for me. I have loved her ever since Bates Motel, and she's fantastic here.<br/><br/>The visual effects are completely stunning, and the action is phenomenal. The first challenge with the race in the DeLorean is thrilling, and I loved the whole sequence that took place in the world of The Shining. The extended battle at the end of the film is definitely my favourite part, with hundreds of characters from some of my favourite franchises showing up.<br/><br/>My only criticism with Ready Player One is that sometimes the real-world elements weren't as interesting as what was happening in the Oasis. Don't get me wrong; I still liked everything, but I was just so swept up in the video game aspects that I was itching to get back to it.<br/><br/>Overall, Ready Player One is another fantastic film that Spielberg can add to his repertoire, and I wouldn't complain if they decided to take us back to this property in the future.<br/><br/>SCORE: 90%"

","A whimsical slice of sci-fi adventure. Reasonable acting and the polished visuals we all expect from Spielberg. I suspect I would have given it less stars if I wasn't fond of the 80s and 90s childhood experience. For better or worse the film draws extensively on childhood tropes and memories of that era. I think it would be a solid film without that notstalgia, but if that is your flavour of childhood wonder, you'll really enjoy Ready Player One. The acting overall was okay. The villain was vanilla and I am not sure the script gives the emotional range needed for the protagonists to shine. What the film does do right though is that it is emmersive and fun. Oasis is believable and the rules of this not so far away future internally work, well enough at least. The visuals are pretty and can go way over the top without being disruptive to the flow and tempo of the movie. It spoils little to say the movie is basically watching an 80s video game unfold. This combined with a thorough PG tone maybe limits the film's emotional pay off but I think it just made it more fun. This is movie that did fun well.

My biggest beef with what I did watch of the movie was that Parzival and Art3mis did not meet in person till the very end of the book and yet in the movie they met right after clearing the first gate. My problems with this movie only continue to add up and I'm not going to list them all here. No I did not expect the movie to be a minute by minute reenactment of the book but honestly to me it seems we got a movie made from the basic gist of the summary on the inside flap and a few pages randomly selected and read before writing a script.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this movie, I'm truly glad you did, but for me it was a train wreck from the very start."

","A movie with such an interesting and relatable idea like this one has and with such a director can only end up in success and it did, mostly. The plot is very good most of the time, keeping it all interesting, the visual part is simply excellent making the OASIS look excellent while the intrigue and the action are also great. There is little to complain in these departments but the movie still has one or two aspects which weren't able to stay on par with the rest.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to say that I was kind of disappointed with the acting or with the cast itself. They simply weren't able to make themselves credible and likeable in order to truly relate with their situation and thus ""feel"" what is going on. They seemed dull (especially the main ones) and leave plenty of things to be wished for in this department. Speaking of the characters, although they were mostly teenagers, they had a tendency to act foolishly from time to time, following what seems to be a stereotype these days, but it isn't something tragic, though worth mentioning. To make matters worse here, the antagonist is pretty lame. You can blame the acting and you can also blame the plot but the final result is that his performance didn't contribute as it should to the outcome of the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I was able to ignore most of the downsides that this movie had and enjoy the story as it is, being also interested by the action and the great depiction of the virtual world (once again, the CGI is top notch). Although it had a tendency of becoming predictable, especially towards the end, it still provided a good time when put together with all the other parts which simply shined."

","Firstly, I'll say I didn't read the book but I do plan on it, so I'm coming from a non-biased perspective..That being said, from what I've read of peoples negative reviews is..""ItS NoT LikE THe BoOk At aLL"". Honestly that is the most biased thing ive ever heard. I mean, what do you expect, not all adaptations are going to be spot on. Characters are going to change to match the flow of the movie because things will change especially since we are dealing with pop culture and copyright permissions.
From people who haven't read the books, they generally say it was a fun movie, I thought it was a blast. Id give it a full 10 but the story in itself could have been cleaned up a bit. For example it would have been better if the VR was full immersion rather than a slightly better version of the oculus. (again, haven't read the book), another one is the plot itself, it seemed like they were going in the direction to destroy the oasis, because of Artemsis' speech about her dad dying because of getting in debt and how the real world is basically a dump because everybody pays too much attention to the game. It seemed like their quick fix is to just shut it down for 2 days of the week, which is probably for the better but will most likely still feed the addiction... even though they shut down the loyalty centers, that wouldn't stop the debt through the game and you still end up with a hell hole of the real world. Also, parzivals one liner saying something along the lines of missing the real world. That part of the plot bugged me a bit, but overall I'd watch it again and show other people the movie."

"nyancatcandy","6","0","0","22 April 2019"," A film to watch on a lazy day
","You might wonder what Speilberg was thinking of taking on a movie like this one. Such a talented director and movie maker, but perhaps this is not really his genre, as can be seen by watching this film. A big mix-up of pop culture references and action sequences matched with a few uncoordinated romantic flirts.<br/><br/>The first and major problem with this film, is that it fails as a stand-alone movie, due to the fact that it relies on pop culture references to entertain the audience. There are countless of them, and many are just a few details left in the background. The idea of pop culture references is a good one. It's a good way to interact with the audience and make them nostalgic when they notice a Darth Vader-mask wearing robot in the background. But here they take up too much space and are to obvious. The fact that they even used a whole sequence from Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and made the characters fool around in it, does not only feel like a insult to Kubrick's work, but it also makes this film lack a character of its own.<br/><br/>There could have been some forgiveness for all of this had there been an interesting story, but there isn't. Although the idea of having a deceased game maker host a competition (where the competitos have to find 3 keys in order to gain access to the entire game) in his own game is a relatively interesting concept, it falls short due to awkward relationships between the characters and poor acting. Perhaps the only good performance from this film came from Mark Rylance. And the supposed romantic relationship between the to main characters feel forced and amateurish. The story also feels really predictable, as you almost instantly know that the main character is going to make it and get the girl in the end, which adds a sense of boredom to the film, and takes a way the eagerness to continue watching<br/><br/>However, not all is bad. Despite some colossal missteps with the pop culture references, there is a joy in seeing the old DeLorean back on the screen, as well as some other small references. Moreover, the action isn't bad either. It's a joyful and colourful spectacle to watch that is also suprisingly entertaining. And it is what saves this movie from being a total bombshell of a disaster.<br/><br/>Conclusively, this is an entertaining movie actionwise, spiced with some nice pop culture references, but some of them were too much, removing the sense of actually watching a new movie. And a poor story and character interactions doesn't help. But it still can be a good watch on a lazy day."

They are just wonderful and amazing and heartwarming, especially for the older viewers who would find all of the 80's and 90's movie and video games references exciting. But there is also the problem. The movie is not made for older viewers since it is full with cringy childish jokes, teenage love romance moments and overall scenario that collides with the references. Not a single 14 year old would understand every reference that was put in the movie, even tho there was a reference from ""The Shining"" that lasted more than 5 minutes. Steven made the biggest mistake here in my eyes and I blame him for that because I can guarantee that those references were not there in the original book. So if he wanted the references in, he should've put the childish lore out."

","Watching the movie, I left feeling quite empty. The plot seemed quite shallow, the characters were very one dimensional. I could tell when watching it that there was so much untapped potential in the story. Like the world they lived in - the movie provided so little detail behind why it was the way it was and what it was really like to live there. And the challenges the characters had to go through always seemed way too easy. When the movie finished, I was disappointed because I knew it could have been so much better and couldn't understand why Spielberg had made such a botched job of it.<br/><br/>That confusion has since become much greater having read the book, which by the way is AMAZING! Like many other reviewers have said here, it's practically a completely different story to the movie. Apart from a similar overarching plot line, everything else that happens in it is different. All the challenges are different, the way the characters interact with one another, the pop culture references... so different and just so, so much better than the movie.<br/><br/>So for anyone feeling let down by the movie, I highly recommend checking out the book.

","After seeing this movie mentionned by all kind of posts and seeing the rating and the concept, I was definitely interested as science-fiction is my favorite genre.<br/><br/>What. A. Disappointment. The concept was great but the storyline with all its plotholes and all the cheesy moments or the cheesy lines/jokes that came right before a predictable moment were just obvious indicators that this movie wasn't made for adults.<br/><br/>One-dimensional characters with stereotypical good or bad traits, obvious lines to describe the action happening in the next seconds instead of actually using good acting skills are clear indicators that this movie was targeted at a more naïve audience, a.k.a. children.<br/><br/>The PG-13 rating leave me quite confused as I would have thought it was targeted to a younger audience. Despite the ""violence"", most injuries are just coins dropping out of an avatar and as this movie clearly stated, even 11yo children play those type of games.<br/><br/>The plot in itself is not bad but the way it was built with the dialogue and characters made it hardly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Conceptually, it was worth the watch as there are some interesting ideas in the movie. Other than that, I would not suggest to waste your time with this movie if you can't stand children movies (and that advice comes from a Marvel fan so take that into consideration).<br/><br/>It would definitely be a fun movie to watch with your little brother/sister or your children.

"Gresh854","4","0","0","22 December 2018"," Visual Masterpiece, Convoluted Story
","It genuinely sucks that Ready Player One is about a 9.5 on the scale of visual gratification but a near 3 on the spectrum of plot. It slaughters me to know how mind-bogglingly phenomenal this movie could've been if it had openly mimicked Ernest Cline's-close to-perfect flair a dose more and had additionally, indulged the classical Spielberg magic that made Spielberg SPIELBERG, not this money-hungry mainstream, cop-out SPIELBERG.<br/><br/>Okay, wait a minute. Strike that. Reverse it. Let's start this review back at the beginning.<br/><br/>Ready Player One incorporates a scale of imaginative frenzy unlike anything ever indulged on the big screen. Every single moment we get to experience invading the spelbinding world of the Oasis, it's like time-traveling into the future of virtual, technological reality. The CGI developers/ designers have crafted a universe rightly groundbreaking. It's BREATHTAKING. This is the plausible galaxy of virtual spectacle that Cline had originally described it as in his best-selling novel.<br/><br/>The action is ADRENALINE FUELED. Once you enter the first race of the film, voilà, it's game over. Heart Rate: 100, 150, 200, 250, 300...oops. I'm dead. You wanted the ultimate nerdy euphoric detonation of a life-time? Boom. Feast your eyes.<br/><br/>While all of these engrossing features surely make Ready Player One something to admire, there is however, aggravating infections that dragged it down to near mediocrity.<br/><br/>The moment where I think Ready Player One dropped the atomic bomb on the storyline was when (about an hour into the film), for some ill-advised reason, Samantha decides to kidnap Wade and make him a part of her rebellion for the rest of the movie's duration. That's about where the writers I think screwed up BIG-TIME because if they had just followed the book's basic plot structure, this movie could've been instantaneously less convoluted. They basically trashed every working element from the source material in order to give us a cheesy romance to explore half-way through our film instead of gradually building the relationship up to a satisfying climax that would've indeed advanced our characters. Character motivations have officially hit the equivalent to a Jackson Pollock painting-being that the whole shebang is now all over the place.<br/><br/>And, look, it's not just timidly weak character development that yanks this movie down, it's also the continuity of EVERYTHING. I recommend not doing this-but I unfortunately did. I started thinking about all that had happened in this movie's stream of events and literally, nothing makes any sense. Whether it be how...<br/><br/>...it's physically impossible the Oasis can possibly function with people using it in the real world (considering the movements and tangible spaces and what not), or how/why characters just discover/find other characters in the real world somehow without explanation (Samantha finding Wade), or how IOI can even function legally, or how IOI even profit from enslaving people to pay off debts, or how the MAJORILY SIMPLE key to opening those IOI slave-rooms hasn't been exposed to the public yet, or why there are so many character decisions that seem illogically spontaneous, or why GOING BACKWORDS WAS THE KEY TO WINNING THE RACE (HOW DID NOBODY THINK TO DO THAT IN FIVE YEARS! AND THE CLUE WAS SO BLANTANTLY OBVIOUS WTFFFFF), or...<br/><br/>...I could go on and on but let's just say this whole movie's ""new set of alteration in the story"" seriously made every plot element in the film feel like one colossal cluster.<br/><br/>I understand that it's absolutely necessary to change components from the source material when developing a live-action adaptation, but if you're going to do it, you better well make it good, if not, better. Plus, why even change it at all if the format was initially foolproof to begin with and you could legitimentally just copy and paste the blueprint while, in the end, birthing a more compelling and dynamic story, while even saving some funds! I just hate how this studio has turned such an intricate, thought-provoking, and plausibly crafted storyline into something so average and formulaic. It makes me consistently wonder what could've caused a decision like this (But let's be honest. They probably just chose to format the story like this so they could appeal to the modern, younger, more hyperactive audiences in order to make more $$$).<br/><br/>Ready Player One is too fixated on the visual thrills rather than investing their audience into a Spielberg suffused, enchanted story that will firmly provoke something rewarding. The film mostly seems like a cooperate made product rather than Spielberg's actual creation. Honestly, if they had-I hate to be that guy but I'm going to be that guy just this one time-pursued the novel's basic template, Ready Player One might've genuinely twisted out as a blockbuster masterpiece.<br/><br/>However, that being said, this movie is still loads of fun? Verdict Change: (B -> C+)"

","Ernest Cline's book, Ready Player One, was a master piece. It was one of the best books that I have read in a long time, so I was very excited when I finally had the time to watch the movie. I love watching Spielberg movies, but Ready Player One is an exception. The movie is supposed to be based off of the book; however, the only parts of the book that the movie retained were the names of people, places, and the pursuit of Halliday's Easter Egg. If the movie did not claim that it was based off of the book, then I would give it a higher rating.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie and character development diverged so sharply from the book that if the movie had changed the names of all of the characters and places, I would have no idea that I was watching a movie based off of Ready Player One. A major example of this in the movie are the three challenges leading up to the Easter Egg. The first challenge in the book was playing a game of Joust against a very good AI made by Halliday. The first challenge in the movie was a race through a deadly, virtual New York. A race is more action packed, but it strays away too much from Halliday's 80s character that Cline attempts to highlight in his book. A major variation in character development in the movie is that the high five all live in the same city, and Artemis is a part of some sort of rebellion. In the book, they are all just average kids that live around the world. Living in the same city made it possible to condense the running time of the movie, but it detracts from the fact that the OASIS is a global platform and that people of all backgrounds can unite to do what is right.<br/><br/>The lack of plot line continuity also made the movie hard to watch. A great example of this is the relationship between Wade, and Daito and Sho. At the beginning of the movie, they only briefly mention Daito and Sho, but at the end of the movie they are ready to sacrifice themselves Wade. What happened during the movie that Daito and Sho were willingly to die for Wade. In the book, the three of them help each other complete quests and Wade gives up a very powerful prize to Daito. Wade earns the trust and loyalty during the book. During the movie, Daito and Sho just blindly trust Wade.<br/><br/>The movie does the book a great disservice and I recommend that you do not waste your time with it. If you haven't read the book, I would recommend reading it because it is one of the best books that I have ever read."

","While a bit simple and deus ex machina at times, Ready Player One evokes the same happy adventure and nostalgia that the book did. The biggest surprise to me was the visuals - they looked excellent, both the OASIS and the contrast with the bleak reality. The egg hunt could've been better explained, but the challenges felt very happy and video game like, as intended. The changes from the book made the movie more easily and rapidly digestible. There were many spots in which I was exasperated by a character's irrationality or by deus ex machina in the plot. Art3mis in particular was around many points of frustration, particularly her indefensible decision to not go through the hatch with Wade. Her romance with Wade was also so easy and unoriginal, and when she hid from Sorrento and pals in his main room it was ridiculous that they didn't hear/see her. Sorrento getting past the hundreds of angry people by pointing a gun in the air (nobody tried to tackle him or say anything? Nobody?) and then reaching Wade, seeing him with the egg, and looking accepting and not shooting was bizarre to me. Lots of seemingly impossible situations that deus ex machina got them out of easily, like when Art3mis was trapped and the way of escaping was literally inside her device??? However, most of these points were fairly minor and I didn't feel detracted from the enjoyment of the movie, they just prevented it from being a really good one. They briefly mentioned the reality/OASIS struggle early and really wish they would've developed that theme more, as they largely left it until the end when they tried to come back to it as a concluding, central theme when it was insufficiently developed. Nevertheless, my overall takeaway is quite positive and a happy, easy movie to watch with some questionable plot points."

","The much anticipated and hugely hyped latest directorial offering from cinematic wunderkind Steven Spielberg is visually stunning, set substantially in a fantastical virtual world of 2045 called The Oasis. An early visit to The Oasis involves a race and the experience is genuinely thrilling. The movie is also visually rich with an unbelievable number of allusions to (mainly 1970s and 1980s) pop culture - by some estimates around 300 so-called Easter eggs. It seems that every scene, every wall, every item of clothing features some (often subtle, even opaque) reference.<br/><br/>This is an enormous artifice to place on the shoulders of a largely young and under-known cast, notably Tye Sheridan as Parzival/Wade and Olivia Cooke as Art3mis/Samantha and the only stars in the work are British actors Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg who are hardly recognisable in their roles. Above all, this is a film which needs a more engaging plot as the discovery of three keys is just so, well, like a video game.<br/><br/>The problem could be that I'm not in the demographic at whom the movie is pitched and with whom it is doing so well: I've never played a video game and a lot of the pop culture appearances simply passed me by (for instance, I haven't see ""The Shining"" and don't want to). The clue is in the source material, since the movie is based on a young adult novel by Ernest Cline. But I acknowledge that, for many cinemagoers - especially younger ones - ""Ready Player One"" is going to be a smash that will need to be seen several times."

","Like ""The Girl on the Train"" and any Dan Brown book exactly what makes Ernst Cline's novel excellent makes for a just decent cinematic experience. The novel engages in dense and luxurious world-building and an intricate puzzle-box plot which unfolds degree-by-degree. By necessity of their compressed run-times, movies need to get through the set up (unless you are M. Night Shyalaman whose films constitute mostly setup). The medium limits the plot points to only a few switchbacks (again unless you are M. Night Shyalaman and you put all your switchbacks into a one big reveal). The limitations present headwinds that Spielberg takes a mighty swing at slipping but with limited success. The film's key draw, as you would expect, come from Spielberg's immersive and imaginative visuals and not from the rushed plot or flat performances. The motion picture also provides nostalgic value to those of a certain age through dozens of visual references (""there's 'Bigfoot', the king of the monster trucks back in the 80s!""). In short, to misquote the immortal words of the Gin Blossoms, if you don't expect too much, you might not be let down""."

","If I were in charge of choosing a book about a dystopian society that turns to VR to make life more bearable, I'd be more inclined to choose Tad Williams' Otherlands series than Ready Player One, but let's deal with the movie that we got, shall we? We see a world of shacks and desperation, where people choose to spend most of their time in The Oasis, an online game that is a world unto itself. In the film, we only see small sections of the game,enough to know that people can choose different passtimes within, but not enough to make us understand why people are obsessed with spending their every waking moment (other than meals and bathroom breaks) in what looks like a lot of uncomfortable gear. We meet our protagonist, what's left of his family, and his friends but we don't really get any real sense of the bonds that they share, or develop. Some of this is likely due to shortened timeline. In the book, years pass. In the movie, the action is necessarily condensed, so there isn't much time to explore each character individually, let alone the dynamics in their various groupings. Because you don't know the characters enough to really care about them, it's hard to get invested in their fates, so you never get that sense of peril that makes action adventure movies exhilarating. <br/><br/>The story is pretty simple, and presented with absolutely zero subtlety. Unchecked capitalism is bad and results in a form of slavery, or at the very least indentured servitude. I mean, it's hard to argue with the point, but the movie doesn't leave any time for reflection or discussion anyway because it's constantly racing towards the next set-piece where our plucky heroes face up against The Man and his all-too-literal corporate drones. The whole thing culminates in one enormous Overwatch-looking battle. Meh.<br/><br/>Through it all, there is what should have been melancholy. It's like the ghost of what could have been is trapped in the machine. You have a solid story about the destructive powers of greed and social isolation, but the threads never go far enough for you to FEEL it to the extent that you should. Look, I didn't hate Ready Player One. It had some good visuals, lots of nostalgia, a couple of nicely played gags, and some big ideas. I liked it alright, I guess. I just wanted to love it, and I found I couldn't feel enough of it to bother. I may walk away now, think about it for a while and completely change my mind, but for now I would give it a 6.5/10. Not bad, just a hollow shell that should have been a well formed, intact egg."

","I started to like this movie from the beginning, even though the colour scheme and style was a little bit ""flashy"", It played out its charm well and started to build up a good story. The hunt for these keys and the challenge to find them was an entertaining plot and excited me from the beginning. Also the mystery of who these characters actually where in real life kept me curious.<br/><br/>Sadly the movie lost all its inner structure and tension at some point. Character progression suddenly went through the roof and the intentions and feelings of the protagonists were not understandable any more. Everything was suddenly exposed and the movie lacked of all its actual content.
A problem of most modern, especially young generation movies. There is a feeling of disconnectedness to the audience in favour of transporting a social message, instead of letting us find the ""key"" for ourselves, we are ""educated"" to do so.
Therefore a feeling of tiredness and emptiness took over for me from the middle on.<br/><br/>From some point on the dialogues and characters where just not credible any more, the story too confusing and rushed, too many references to pop culture instead of staying true to the plot as an experience for itself.
The main antagonist Sorrento (besides the character I-R0k, whom I really enjoyed as that greedy anti-gamer) turned out more and more weak, kind of ""transparent"", for someone who is leading a worldwide company, not very satisfying nor credible - this took away all the danger - of course the ""good"" guys would win because this guy was just a fool (Putting his password beside his chair.) Yeah and of course everyone would help them in the end - because they are the good guys.<br/><br/>Where there is a steep and lonely climb to success in classic movie storytelling this felt not rewarding at all. I expected more from someone that brought us Indiana Jones, ET, co-worked in movies like Back to the Future.<br/><br/>Too much predictability in favour to bring about social justice education. Started out as a good movie with forgivable mistakes, but build up on the mistakes instead of staying true to the good things going a step further."
"matthewssilverhammer","4","0","0","7 April 2018"," 'Member Grapes: The Game
","Has there ever been another filmmaker who helped influence and create American pop culture more than Spielberg? In Ready Player One, he dives deep into that self-created nerd-well, throwing familiar references at us faster than Sonic the Hedgehog driving the Millennium Falcon. It's difficult not getting geeky-giddy seeing King Kong swipe at Marty McFly's DeLorean, or a Xenomorph burst from the chest of Mortal Kombat's Goro. Unfortunately, all goodwill is lost under noisy CGI, rampant deus ex machinas, and ham-fisted morality.
In 2045, humanity spends most of its time within a VR world called the Oasis. When the game's pop-culture-fanatic creator dies, he leaves behind a mission within the game that gives the winner complete ownership. Visually and conceptually, it's highly imaginative. Even the nostalgia seems to serve a purpose, leaving us with tons of fun ""Hey! It's that thing!"" moments (ie The Shining sequence is a blast). 
The story and filmmaking, however, are shockingly inept. We're constantly being forced to suspend our disbelief, and not in the expected fantasy-sci-fi elements, but in simple character choices. Throw in some sporadic and unnecessary narration, underwhelming acting performances, and heaps of underwritten characters, and you remember that Spielberg didn't just make Jaws...he also made Hook.
Worst of all is the films overarching message. At first, it seemed to be a smart, meta takedown of corporate bastardization of nostalgia. But then it takes a turn, forcing a sudden push for ""reality"" over geekdom with a hearty, ""You dang kids need to stop your vidja games & snapbooks & go outside, dagnabbit!"" Here's hoping Spielberg goes back to creating timeless art instead of simply referencing it."

","I heard recently that the time that defines your youth is when you were 14 years old. I was born on the exact same day as Sean Astin (yeah, the hobbit guy who gave ST2 ultimate 80s cred) - so me and Sean were 14 in 1985, we are the quintessential 80s teens.<br/><br/>So I nearly cried when I read Ready Player One - it captured so much of the cultural (albeit the good stuff - there was a lot of crap) identity of the 1980's. I nearly cried again after seeing the film - because it managed to completely ignore all of that.<br/><br/>To give this film it's due, the screenplay is a reasonable adaptation. I'm not going to pretend it should have faithfully represented the book - but they got the story. Let's face it, the story isn't that complicated - it's Willy Wonka in space - but there is a lot to compress into an hour and a half.<br/><br/>However, the book is a litany of 80s icons - WarGames, MTV, Star Wars, Atari, Computer Geeks, Pac Man, A-ha, Dungeons & Dragons, Video Arcades, Anime... and of course Kevin Smith. Good luck finding any of that in the film.<br/><br/>The genuinely 80s WarGames scene is replaced with a scene from the Shining - give it credit, well done - but Halliday would have been 8 when that R-rated film came out. How the hell was that his favourite film? WarGames on the other hand inspired a generation of computer geeks (like Halliday).<br/><br/>What bothers me most is reading other reviews that are amazed about how well the ""zeitgeist"" was captured.

","So I just went and saw the film Ready Player One.
Having read the book, I hoped that a film might be made of it as it seemed like like an excellent story.
Then fairly recently I saw the advertisement for ready player one, which I recognised by the stacks and thought that it seemed similar to the the book. 
lo and behold it was in fact a film based on the book.
Unfortunately I must emphasize that it was a film based on the book rather than a film of the book because a lot of things were chopped out, things that I belive are the raw make-up of the story.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the film for others so to be blunt I believe the film is only a shadow of the book both in story and in meaning.
I would still see the film as it is fun and interesting but if you were the kind of person that finds a story ruined to be very disappointing I wouldn't necessarily recommend seeing the film however if you have not read the book or do not mind a story change then the film is definitely worth a watch.
If the movie of the Last Airbender was a zero and Harry Potter was a 10, I would place this as an 8 on the scale of book to movie conversion.<br/><br/>Unfortunately everything seems rushed despite large chunks of the story being omitted, a mini Love Story that locks at self-employed before the films even halfway through, a plot line that removes tragedies and replaces them with overly convenient situations simplified for the masses to be able to understand.
The book worked well because it had a lot of meaning that a geek or someone technical could understand and take pleasure in understanding but the film was spoon feeding."

","I wanted to like Ready Player One, but I didn't.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like it because it soothed my ego to believe that a legend like Steven Spielberg could deliver a massive hit like the ones he produced during my childhood, any time he wanted too-and he may have (the box office has not come in yet). The only difference is, I did not feel that cinema magic he is known to deliver while watching this film. If anything, it felt more like watching Michael Jordan when he joined the Washington Wizards as a ball player. Sure, he was technically proficient at the job, but it was not the same as the Chicago Bulls era Jordan. That is what this Spielberg movie felt like-a movie that should have given up sooner. And at 2 Â½ hours long, you'll understand what I mean.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is based on the 2011 sci-fi novel about a teenager named Wade Watts, who lives in the futuristic, dystopian slums of Columbus Ohio. It seems everyone in the world is hooked on a virtual reality simulator called the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation) where people can engage in all types of simulations to satiate their needs and desires. Now hidden within the simulation is an adventure quest called Anorak's Quest-a challenged bestowed upon the gamers in the OASIS by one of the creators of the simulation-James Halliday. Winning the search will lead to immense wealth (trillions of real world dollars) and actual world ownership of the virtual reality world known as the OASIS. That's a hell of a prize and Wade is determined to win it. What die-hard gamer wouldn't want to go for such an award? Even better, what corporation wouldn't try to capitalize off that opportunity? Luckily, Ready Player One answers that question in the form of our antagonists-an evil, faceless corporation named IOI (Innovative Online Industries). <br/><br/>IOI's CEO-Nolan Sorrento-and his army of virtual reality indentured servants, who look like futuristic Planet Fitness customers, all work tirelessly to defeat the challenge. Seems like a pretty cool concept, right? I get why it was made into a movie. Now, I have no exposure to the source material, so I'm reviewing it solely as a movie, but the setup for Ready Player One is excellent. It's the midpoint and conclusion that are brutal to dredge through.<br/><br/>The film opens with the same spectacular car race you've seen in all the trailers, and it's as thrilling and nauseating as any scene you've ever seen in a Michael Bay movie. Which is odd for Spielberg because he's a master at showing action in a discernible way that maintains the intensity without vomit inducing editing. From that scene, Wade readjusts his strategy and figures out how to win it and secure the first of three keys to winning Anorak's Quest. He also shares the secret with a competitive gamer he's enamored with (Art3mis), and a small circle of players (Aech, Daito, and Shoto) who form his gamer squad. Aech (aka Helen Harris) is a giant black male avatar with Neanderthal and cyborg features whose indeed a woman in the real world of this film. This wouldn't be a problem for me if all of Aech's companions weren't given beautiful avatars while Aech's is horrific in appearance. Is it a statement of Aech's self-worth as written in the book-perhaps-but that same message could have been delivered without reinforcing offensive Hollywood stereotypes about people of color that have existed since the dawn of cinema. The character is portrayed by real world actress, Lena Waithe-a fellow Chicagoan and Columbia College alum like myself. To see such a talented woman represented this way is disappointing and I would think Spielberg would know better. But I digress. It's on to the second act, and this is where things seem to improve before falling flat. In the second act, a scene that plays homage to The Shining is one of the best moments in the film, but after that, the cat and mouse chase between our hero gamers and the hokey villains at IOI drag on far too long and in an incoherent manner. I wasn't remotely bothered like I usually am to have to take a bathroom break during the movie (and I was assured I didn't miss a thing when I did). <br/><br/>Ready Player One's biggest problem isn't the visuals-Spielberg and his team nails that. It's the lack of character development. There was never a time I felt vested in the fate of these characters. Even the characters are dismissive about the stakes in their lives. Wade's family is killed by the CEO of IOI, and his expression of grief is as short-lived as a gamer whose avatar dies at a crucial point in the game, but they get over it quickly because they know they get to keep playing the game. The attempts at humanity are muddied by Halliday's cryptic musings about love and life, and the characters in the game never seem vested in saving the lives of their avatar companions. That's because there are no real world stakes like there were in the Matrix where if you died in the real world, your avatar died as well. Well, there are stakes, just not stakes you care about, like the loss of all the coins they've collected. That's how empty Ready Player One is. Human life isn't valued in this film. Neither is humor because it's quite stale. All that matters in Ready Player One is the goal of winning the game. That seems contradictory to Halliday's original intent for the OASIS-valuing life over winning the game."

","Reading the book a few years ago felt a joy and although it's never going to be a classic it felt like I was watching a movie rather than reading a book and it was a fun romp that also warmed my heart. 
Books like ""Ready Player One"" by Ernest Cline are meant to have a live-action version. Whoever's read it that I know feels the same way.
I was thrilled Mr. Spielberg was on for doing the movie and got excited.
Casting came out and I was fine, actually very fine, especially with Sorrento being played by Ben Mendelsohn.
Went to watch the movie and it had none of the cool or important stuff from the book. Normally, I don't mind re-doing some bits (LoTR fan, but liked the movies so much, even with alterations), but there is almost nothing left and the plot, if I can even call it that. Characters lacked any development that made them so great in the book and the pacing and editing were a complete mess. Hardly wordy of a starting director, let alone Speilberg.
What happened to this project is beyond me. The book was written so easily to film, the cast was really good, the director, but in the end we got a dumbed-down, super-cut with heavy alterations that is nowhere at all as fun or as interesting as the book.
If I give the characters other names you probably will never tell that it's ""Ready Player One"" that is how much has been hacked, re-written or totally skipped from a really good source material!"

However, there are already movies out there covering this topic. Fantastic movies like the Matrix. Spielberg never comes closes to the quality and intensity especially the Matrix offers. Spielberg picked the main actors of Ready Player One by his well-known scheme, young to very young, teens and twens. Maybe because he does associate the online community with those ages. In fact, through the whole movie, there is a remarkable presence of immature fantasy, the whole world of online games and virtual reality has been visually and conceptually buffed up causing an unrealistic impression.
A weird, frenetic story accompanied by those nerd type youngsters, having every answer to every machine-human interaction, in seconds, while everything else tumbles upside down, story elements that do not fit together or make no sense, and in between those reminders of that humanity is at loss, and we all have to cope and destroy whatever cliché evil together. 
All in all that was the taste I had, when watching this movie, immature, overdone fantasy garbage for teens, who use mobile devices to an excess, but have no clue about its technical realization and no ambition whatsoever as long as the can use it.

His only escape from this harsh and boring reality is a cliché virtual reality game that is actually a ripoff of Sword art online, a japanese light novel that was published in 2009 whereas a book, which this movie is based on, is published in 2011.

","Most of the time I read others reviews and go see the movie based on that, this time I read the book first then went to see the movie. I knew there would be changes, there always are in the conversion, but wow...<br/><br/>I went and saw the movie in IMAX 3D which was visually stunning. Everything in the OASIS was crisp and stunning and you wanted time to slow down so you could take it all in. 10/10<br/><br/>As far as character development it was very shallow and it was hard to see the avatars reflected on the personalities of the actors. It was the standard good vs. bad definition a complete black and white contrast with almost no gray areas. It was also given the Hollywood makeover and all of the main characters we mostly without visual flaws and seemed perfect, which is a stark contrast to the book. 2/10<br/><br/>As far as the sound track, it was good and had a few popular songs from the 80's but did not enhance the movie at all. It seemed like everything was thrown in to a nostalgia effect, almost pandering. 3/10<br/><br/>The theme of the 80's was very consistent through the book and being older got most of the references but had to look up just a few. The movie seemed like it was pandering to a younger audience only taking a few songs from the 80's and a few icons from the decade. It seem like it was geared to a gamer audience in their late teens to late 20's. 5/10<br/><br/>As far as the source material from the book, it is almost as if someone read the first 2 chapters then opened the book in three random places and read two pages in a row, and then cobbled the movie together from that. 1/10<br/><br/>The rest of the review is a comparison of the book to the movie.
So just like the movie the book focuses on Wade Watts and him being a Gunter, someone who is obsessed with finding the keys and the egg. The book mostly focuses on him and takes place over the course of a year after the first key is found. the movie seems to speed this up and all keys seem to be found with a few weeks.
All of the challenges to earn the keys are completely different. They completely removed the elements of the gates from the games, which was the challenge that had to be overcome to actually earn the key. Anorak's Almanac was completely removed as being able to be converted to a physical form, which was a key thing in the novel. It instead was converted into a 3D Youtube archive of Halliday's life. 
In the movie they added a rebellion/resistance movement which was found nowhere in the book unless you consider the Gunters, but they were either solo or joined a clan and were only together in the OASIS not in real life. 
In the movie ""The High Five"" all lived within what seem Columbus Ohio, where in the book they lived all over the world emphasizing the scale and how integrated people lives and the OSAIS were.
Many of the characters had major flaws such as social anxiety, weight issues, paranoia, etc. in the book. That was all removed for the movie. 
There are many many more things that are different, but these are just some of the most standout things that I took away from the movie and book.<br/><br/>If this was approved by Ernest Cline, I hope it was to boots his book sales so people can actually see what a good writer he is and how much better the book was. I hate to be that guy, but please read the book, you will value it so much more than the movie.<br/><br/>tldr: Overall the movie is good as a stand alone, completely separated from the book, but if you are looking for a 2 hour eye-candy/gamer geek-out movie that has little Easter eggs, you will like it. 
But, if you have read the book pass on the movie and keep the memory of the book as a gem on your mind so it is not tarnish by the pandering cash grab Spielberg made it."

","Plot; In the future, a planet in the throes of severe economic strife escapes into a virtual online world called the OASIS where many become preoccupied w/a contest embedded by its creator that will give the winner complete control of it.<br/><br/>I suppose it's fitting that a movie filled to bursting with ""Easter eggs"" is being released on Easter weekend. If you've read Ernest Cline's novel (or seen the trailers) you know that Ready Player One is a story steeped in pop culture; primarily 80s in the novel, a bit less so in the movie. Cline's novel is, among other things, a love letter to the 80s. It's not subtle, but it's genuine and comes from a place of true affection. The movie, on the other hand, seems to simply be throwing these things against the screen to see what sticks or to check off boxes to appease various demographics. The result is that the story's beating heart is often missing. And speaking of the story...<br/><br/>...it's different. Very, very, very different. If you have a slavish dedication to the novel, be prepared for disappointment. The basic premise is the same, but not much else. Translating a novel into cinema always requires changes, but here those changes often feel like someone said ""I really like what you did there, but let's do it completely different."". Once again, much is lost in the translation. Ernest Cline isn't one of our great writers, but his RP1 did an exceptional job of world building and getting inside the head of our main character. Much of that gets lost here amongst the spectacle. <br/><br/>Visually speaking, this film is a winner. The OASIS is a fully immersive world that will dazzle and delight. You could watch this movie a dozen times and not soak in even a quarter of its detail. Many technical Oscar nominations await. <br/><br/>Ready Player One works on the level of fleeting popcorn cinema, but like so much of Spielberg's forays into the genre the last few decades, it's more a work of obligation than one of passion."
"haileyjonas-59968","6","3","8","30 March 2018"," Not bad, but not great
","Visually, this movie was great. Spielberg and Co did a great job at making the Oasis come to life. Obviously some of the physical items had the animated edge to it, but that works because that is what the Oasis is all about!<br/><br/>My issue lies in the plot itself. I didn't mind the changes from the original book plot - after all, watching video games and movies being played out is not exactly exciting on the screen. However, a lot of the characters major development arcs are cut out or significantly altered. Keeping spoilers to a minimum, Wade's brain wasn't there, and while that let Art3mis and Aech shine, it was eliminated their arcs as well. The plot just kind of kept walking, trudging through what could have been (and was in the book) an engrossing story, but spent more time on how pretty it all is. Halliday may have had something right - what we see on screens is great, but reality is still better."

","Ready Player One was a masterpiece as a book, but if they kept every detail from the book and put it into a film, it would be a hot mess. Spielberg took the initial idea, and created a great film. The challenges in the book are not movie material, and would only sell to a niche audience, but when you have less obscure references, a larger audience is included. The movie is definitely worth a watch for anyone, but I highly recommend reading the book first. 
The comedy was hilarious, action sequences were interesting and chocked full of Easter eggs. The movie didn't force too many references, and they don't add too much to the plot. It's also fun to watch and count everything you can see. A great soundtrack.

","What better way to celebrate Easter than by watching a movie where an Easter egg is a main plot point? I had no idea this was based on a book. I didn't recognize any notable actors here apart from T. J. Miller. This movie tells the story of how in the future there's this virtual reality world called the Oasis. The creator died and said whoever found his Easter egg after collecting three keys will inherit his fortune. I admit the characterizations could be better.<br/><br/>The real selling point is how beautiful this film looks. It features a practically incalculable number of cameos of fictional characters. The one with the most screen time is the Iron Giant and he deserves it. The final battle is easily the best part, although the ""Shining"" bit was great too. It seems like we're getting more and more movies with tons of cameos. Not great, but it was certainly unique. ***<br/><br/>I regret to inform everyone that this is going to be my last review on this website.

"gdeangel","8","3","9","2 April 2018"," Groundbreaking and clichee at the same time
","The best future fantasy stories maintain a anchor in the present (or past) reality of the audience's universe. ""Hey Jude"" playing in the background as Roland stalks through Midworld. Micky and Bugs skydiving in a ""Toon Town"" world full on novel characters crafted from the blank page to star in a live-animation watershed film. Ready Player One abounds with these side-bars to pop culture's past great moments. Atari 2600 references. Holy Grail references. Magazine covers shared with Stever Jobs. Orcs. Halo Master Chiefs. Bitcoin analogues. Debtor prison analogues. From Excalibur to the Rubic's Cube, it's pretty much all there. Even the 70s make an appearance with a hackneyed disco number you can probably guess. <br/><br/>We are provided these connections to overcome a natural disbelief in a 21st century with a virtual reality world that is so jacked that players will don interactive skins for the thrill of experiencing the receiving end of the nut-shot. Having done that, the film can get about the business of being less spectacle and more ""universal story"" . <br/><br/>The story is not that new. The forces of evil are aligned with corporatism, debt collection, megalomania, greed and power. The forces of good are checking the boxes of innocence, principles, righteousness, equity, diversity, and having really interesting hair. But the bits of soul searching are sprinkled in with just the right amount of visual eye candy, action sequences, and character development (I won't say they have much acr, but the structure of the film gives the writers a freebee as supporting virtual CGI avatars ""grow"" into their revealed true-world life-action counterparts.<br/><br/>And this is where RPO is truly groundbreaking. The film is a 50-50 of live action and stylized CGI ""realistic"" animation. ""Gamer"", a film with a similar premise, simply swaps between one live-action ""player"" and another live-action ""avatar"". But here we get a full blown animated virtual avatar world that the story jumps into and out of that eventually by the end we don't even raise an eyebrow when the deceased creator of that world shows up as a very real looking human talking to a 3-D rendering of Cloud Strife 2.0 . <br/><br/>I liked the film generally, although I found the ending relied on a dues ex machina  (arrival of heretofore non-existant police)] more than I would have liked. I would have like to see the main ""real"" villain done in by one of the ""in-game"" villains. I also thought that in-game, out-of-game link up's between the five good-guys was more than a little implausible. As was the fact that an entire mob of people from the hood simply parted like the red sea once a single handgun appeared. Perhaps that was a subtle way of suggesting that the 2nd amendment will have gone the way of the dodo by the time this virtual tech appears. <br/><br/>This film is not for kids. In fact, it's going to be mainly wasted on anyone under the age of 25. But nerds over 40 -- this is the film for you!"

"davidarcher","8","3","9","1 April 2018"," Pretty good movie - and the CGI actually makes it a better movie.
","I strongly prefer movies that feature people and practical effects, and I generally loathe movies that feature endless CGI sequences. Ready Player One is somewhat unique as the CGI sequences inside the ""OASIS"" virtual-reality world are far more interesting than the live-action sequences. Coincidentally - or maybe not -- this was also true of the original TRON released in 1982. (More on TRON in a moment.)<br/><br/>Ready Player One is set a few years in the future in a somewhat dystopian Columbus, OH. (Is that redundant?) Much of the population spends most of its time immersed in OASIS, which is far more attractive than their real world. ""Gregarious Simulation Systems"" (GSS) is the company behind OASIS and is by far the world's largest company. GSS's sole owner died recently and is leaving 100% of the company to the person who solves three online puzzles.<br/><br/>The movie moves back and forth between live actors in the real-world and their CGI avatars in the online world. In terms of the movie-going experience, the online world is far more attractive and interesting than the real-world sequences and some of the sequences - such as the auto race through Manhattan - are breathtaking. The online world is also jam-packed with references to the 1980s such as Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, Batman, etc., etc.<br/><br/>The movie's one weak point is that it's VERY derivative of the original TRON. I kept expecting Jeff Bridges to appear and exclaim ""This could be a free system!""<br/><br/>The cast was fine, although - and I may be showing my age here - I had no idea who any of the younger cast members were. (Most of them apparently appear in a lot of TV series.) Among the slightly older cast members, Mark Rylance was wonderful as the recently deceased owner of GSS who pops up frequently in the online world. (He is one of my favorite actors and would be fascinating to watch even if he was reading a phone book.) Simon Pegg appears briefly as his former partner (think Paul Allen, Steve Wozniak or Henry Flagler.)<br/><br/>If you liked TRON, Matrix, Wreck-It Ralph, MMOG or VR, see it now.

","Ready Player One (Spoiler Free Review)<br/><br/>This is a fun movie. When I found out that Steven Spielberg was making this movie I right away read the book a year ago. The book is great but the movie is even better. You dont need to read the book in order to understand this movie. Ready Player One is a Blockbuster masterpiece in the ""video game movie sub genre"". Ready Player One in summary is a movie that takes place in the year 2045 Ohio, Columbia when the creator of a virtual reality game called the OASIS dies and leaves a hidden easter egg and when found the player inherits all of the OASIS and its fortune. This dystopian Sci-Fi movie very much speaks to us today as a society at whole especially in a time when entertainment can keep us from true reality. This is what Steven does, he tells you a story with strong emotional characters, he allows the camera movements to move the story and he ends the movie with a strong message for the masses. This movie is two hours and twenty minutes but it goes by so fast you wish for more. If you love easter eggs this movie is the easter egg of easter eggs especially for 80s kids also perfect time of release when VR is popular in game consoles. Yes the book was super fan service so the movie took it to another level. You will be surprised. 
The movie is PG13, for partial nudity (woman's bare back is seen) and language<br/><br/>With so many many blockbusters coming out back to back this movie is underrated and most likely not receive much in the box office.

Wade's parents died in the aftermath of a cataclysmic cyber event when many systems failed.<br/><br/>The only escape is through the online VR world, OASIS.

IOI is a video game conglomerate and manufactures most of the VR equipment used to access the OASIS. Sorrento has amassed an army of debt-indentured gamers to seek the keys.<br/><br/>Similar to Blade Runner in some aspects, run-down cities, economic/environmental collapse but differing in an absence of androids and most of the action occurring in VR. There are many cultural references, ranging from the gamers having to fight King Kong and Jurassic Park style dinosaurs to the Iron Giant battling Mechagodzilla.There is also a game sequence set in The Shining where , Aech encounters the Twins and is drenched by the blood filled lift. <br/><br/>Coin earned in the OASIS not only allows gamers to build equipment and artifacts in VR but may also be used in the real world. Being killed online has serious consequences in both worlds as it reduces the gamers status and holdings to zero.

I went into it thinking it was going to be another questionable book movie, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how much it had to say bout our society and humanity. Other than the obvious one of our interest in video games because of our disappointing lives. But more than that it discusses things like the use of micro-transactions that ruin peoples financial situations, why we cherish friends or significant others even though we only know them on the internet and have never met them, and many other things. So this is classic sci-fi in the sense that it has something to say about our current society and culture.<br/><br/>And about the inaccuracies to the book, there weren't to many, and I won't elaborate so I wont spoil anything, but honestly the inaccuracies didn't really take away from the film like many other times in book adaptations or remakes. The special effects were obviously beautiful and I was visually dazzled the entire time. The problem with most CGI orgies like Marvel movies and many others, is they lack the story to make it great, and thankfully this film did not fall into this category. It retains spectacular visuals while still maintaining a good story to keep you at least mildly engaged. I came for the visual effects, and left with a surprising feeling that it was much more than that. Some of the humor in it was hit and miss, some I laughed at, and some I rolled my eyes and felt it was lame, but again it doesn't take away from the experience.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend it, even to purists who read the book."
"Troy_Campbell","6","3","9","30 March 2018"," Joyful spot-the-reference adventure.
","It has been ten years since Spielberg last went full blockbuster (Indiana Jones 4) - his effort in the last decade predominantly spent on Oscar-bait historical dramas - so it's a delight to see him back in gleeful popcorn mode. Set in Columbus, Ohio circa 2045, this pop-culture adventure follows the pure-of-heart Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) as he searches for the ultimate digital Easter Egg within the OASIS, a virtual world that has all but replaced the real one. Adapted from Ernest Cline's cult-classic novel of the same name, the script is a labyrinth of references to movies and video games that progresses at such a fast pace there's barely a chance to realise just how banal the follow-the-clues plot actually is. There are so many winks and nods it's impossible to catch them all on a first viewing, but the standout by miles is a lengthy sequence that pays homage to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. It's completely unexpected, but remarkably funny in a heartfelt way. The opening set piece is an exhilarating car race with crazy injects (T-Rex! King Kong!), however the action slowly decreases in excitement until a climactic battle that is disappointingly uninventive, save for the fact that we see Disney's Iron Giant in combat. The visualisation of the OASIS is a tad off-putting too, the in-movie virtual world consisting of almost-photorealistic characters who occasionally suffer from the uncanny valley effect. Some may argue this is intentional, but it's distracting nevertheless. This isn't close to reaching top-tier blockbuster-Spielberg, and at 140 minutes is waaaay too long, but Ready Player One is a joyful spot-the-reference romp that offers up enough to put a smile on your face."

","I've watched this once in October, and, despite having great graphics and 80's music, I don't really think this is a decent film.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't get why most characters have to use swear words in almost EVERY situation, especially the way they call their money, equipment, and their other personal belongings as....well, that derogatory s-word (e.g. ""If you lose your $#*%, well, you lost your $#*%"", as Wade says [No, I am NOT using that word!]). I mean, I really enjoy playing video games, but I do not use ANY foul language at all. I just don't see how this is intended for younger audiences because of that, even though I'm aware of them watching recent action films like the ones from Marvel (e.g. Black Panther, Infinity War, etc.). I think whoever made that film that way must have watched too much videos by those like AVGN, Pewdiepie, and Markaplier, but that's just my opinion....<br/><br/>Secondly, the films message they seem to give out just don't match what was happening. One was when Wade actually won the contest, and had a conversation with a deceased CEO of oasis, he tells Wade that video games are meant to be fun and it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you play the game. Um, really? The players of oasis HAVE to stay alive as avatars in order to keep their belongings and stuff, ESPECIALLY in PvP, otherwise it's ""Winners keepers, losers weepers"" as the old saying goes. So how is that playing for fun, exactly....? Also, even when Wade became the new CEO of Oasis, did he bother to lift ""losing your stuff when defeated"" rule, so everyone ACTUALLY gets a fair share, even when losing? I would if I were him! I would've had the new rule stating that anyone's avatar gets defeated should leave out (NOT losing!) about 1% of their money they are currently carrying WITHOUT ever decreasing their wallet in that way! If video games are more of a ""lifestyle"" than ""fun"", then I would do that.<br/><br/>I'm going to have to agree with some reviewers on lack of character development, and pop-culture references that ANYONE has heard of over a million times already. :p"
"lucascantids","3","2","5","27 March 2019"," Really bad acting, made it painful to watch
","It's a good movie for children. When I saw the sinopse for the plot I expected them to explore more the idea of people escaping the reality to live in a virtual world, but this idea is not developed in the movie.<br/><br/>Instead, it's just one more of those super boring and predictable plots in which there's a clear end goal since the start and the hero will chase after it during the whole move, fighting vilains and making allies along the path.In the end, there's gonna be some kind of morally correct happy ending in which the good defeats the evil.<br/><br/>It's really that kind of story that we all know, the recipe is followed 100%, there's nothing new at all. The one thing that could have made this movie different was the idea I mentioned before, about ppl seeking to escape reality, but that is ignored so I am really disappointed.<br/><br/>The acting is really bad, nothing is convincing. It doesn't make you enter that flow kind of state which happens when you're really into a movie. You just force yourself to finish the movie even though you're really bored and slightly annoyed for the bad quality of the plot and the acting.<br/><br/>I would suggest anyone thinking of watching this movie to skip it and watch something else. Maybe children might enjoy it though, since they aren't aware of anything I mentioned above."

"chrissav-99599","3","2","5","1 September 2018"," Book vs. movie is not the real issue here...
","...it's simply a complete lack of character development and their chemistry, regardless of whether you've read the book or not. Admittedly, having the read the book just makes it more frustrating, as so many exciting and entertaining elements were omitted in the movie. That being said, I didn't mind that, nor did I mind that they created a different version of the story, rather than stick to the original. What I did painfully mind, was that I neither at any point during the movie cared about what happen to Wade & Co. (or between them), nor did I buy their poor acting (in a way to rushed story). It was so shallow and plastic ufantastic, that it's sad, especially given what could have been an amazing movie. It pretty much feels, as if Spielberg did not care about the movie at all, it was just another paycheck. For all the ones that rated it so sky high - I can't help it think, that they get paid to hype up the movie, or are under 16. So many 8 to 10's are just not believable. One final comment - if you do decide to watch the movie, and you get frustrated about the character development, interactions and pace during first 15 minutes, but hope it'll get better. It won't."
"nstiver-83354","9","2","5","31 August 2018"," Imaginative and fun
","I hadn't read the book going into the movie, so I had absolutely no preconceived ideas of what I wanted it to be. From watching the trailers, all I knew is it would be pop-culture filled, and hopefully an exciting tribute to everything relating to video games and film from the 80's. Walking away from the film, I can only say good things about it. Sure there are some issues (Parzival being more interesting than Wade himself, disconnections from the book, a utopian visualization of an online gaming world, and an unrealized real-world), but none of those took away from all the things the film did right.<br/><br/>I'd like to nickname this movie the better Spy Kids 3D that I never knew I wanted. Spy Kids 3D is one of my favorite childhood movies, not because it can be critically praised even to the slightest, but because it was simply entertaining to watch as a kid. It had giant robots, futuristic car/bike races, a seemingly endless gaming world that sparked your imagination, and a prize for the one who reaches the final level. Those aspects of a movie were enough to keep me happy then, and they sure as heck keep me happy now when done at a much higher quality. <br/><br/>Though the overarching plot was simple and mildly cliche, one can't say it didn't have them wanting to be a part of it. As a gamer, the idea of corporations abusing control of the largest gaming mediums and shoving ads and micro-transactions in our faces is downright scary, and quite frankly already happening to some extent (especially on mobile devices). So just for that, I found myself interested. To add to that though, the idea of an extremely well hidden literal easter egg that gave the finder control of the entire Oasis kept me feeling like I could relate to the cast of characters.<br/><br/>As fun as the film was though, there was an underlying lesson to be learned that, though subtle and vaguely explained, I can sincerely appreciate. No, it wasn't just , ""Don't play too much video games kids, go outside every once in a while."" I'd like to believe it was much deeper than that. The average person in the world of Ready Player One was struggling with more than a video game addiction. They were struggling with an identity crisis, completely losing who they are as people. Everyone in the main cast of characters had this issue to some extent, and you could see how it was allowing them to lose who they were in the real world. At the end of the film, the Oasis goes full-circle when the easter egg teleports Parzival to an Oasisized version of Halliday's childhood room. It's here where Halliday makes some quircky comments/gestures about how video games were an escape for him. He didn't really care about the Oasis and the easter egg as much as everyone wanted to believe. It was simply a way for him to escape from some of his embarrassments and failures in the real world. Halliday was the creator of a virtual universe that the entire world would lose themselves in, that ironically only he himself saw beyond."

This has been completely stripped out of the film to appeal to a younger audience (Minecraft, Halo, Overwatch, yawn..) in one of the worst scripts ever devised.

","Let me start off by saying sure, maybe the movie wasn't a perfect 10/10 movie but I rate movies on how entertaining they were for me. That being said this is definitely a movie worth seeing in the biggest screen you can because the visuals are amazing. Not many directors can capture the sense of adventure like Spielberg can. I don't need to tell how great of a filmmaker the man is but he truly was quite possibly the best choice for this movie. The movie itself is compiled of references and Easter eggs but not to the point where it becomes annoying or takes you out of the movie because that's part of what it's about. The story isn't the best but as a film and video game fan I was entertained from start to finish. The characters could have been better developed but they are still very likable and you will most likely be rooting for them the whole time. Ben Mendelsohn is a pretty solid villain overall and he gives a great portrayal as a CEO corporate asshole who wants the entirety of the Oasis for himself. But I don't have to tell how great he is as a villain as you know from Bloodline or Rogue One. But to stop myself from continuing to ramble on I would highly suggest seeing this film in the theaters, I loved this movie, it was exciting, very fun, immersive, and most definitely a crowd-pleaser.

","Although I loved the book, one shouldn't judge the two because they are different in their own right. With Ernest Cline writing the screenplay, his vision for Ready Player One is still preserved and, with Spielberg's help, is simply modified to fit a wider spectrum of audiences. If you decide to watch the movie (which I highly recommend), be ready for changes made, yet despite them, just embrace the pure magic that this movie has created, and the Ready Player One essence we've come to love will stay majorly untainted.<br/><br/>Visually the film is stunning, and I think it might be a step beyond what we have seen for visual effects in movies up to this point.<br/><br/>This movie is very important because it bridges the gap between the video game world with modern culture in many different ways, and by replacing some elements less-suitable for the big screen like the Joust match or the angst-filled search for the keys, the movie became much more enjoyable for a wider audience.<br/><br/>About the issue of non-80's culture being added into the movie, it might displease some but it is necessary for the newer generations to visually relate and connect with the movie in similar ways that the previous generation can connect with the 80's references."
"esikerin","6","2","5","1 April 2018"," The book is so good - let's change it completely and create a move!
","I can't understand how and most important question why Ernest Cline created such a script that destroys so many cool things about his original book.<br/><br/>I can understand why War Games has been replaced by Shining - this is just more popular movie reference that more viewers will understand. But why to change everything that made this book so good?<br/><br/>Many cool concepts from the book buried under tons of action scenes. Instead of slow character development we get into the action scenes right away. <br/><br/>We see real faces of all the main characters almost in the middle of the movie, which absolutely ruins climax of the first real life meeting that happens only in the end of the book. Well, you say - they needed to alter the book to have screen time for the actress that plays real-life Artemis. They could fix it very easily by showing real actress in the OASIS instead of that CG generated character. BTW, in the book - Artemis in OASIS looked very similar to herself in real life (just a little bit different). So they could easily give the screen time to the actress while staying true to the book. This is just a very bad excuse.<br/><br/>They removed references to many Atari games vividly present in the book. In the movie they only showed adventure. This is a movie about nostalgic references. Yes, I understand, Hollywood bosses decided that viewers don't remember Atari games from 80's.<br/><br/>In general all those changes made the key climatic scenes in the book so flat and so anti-climatic in the movie."

"neobateman","6","2","5","31 March 2018"," Superficial entertainment by Spielberg.
","Ready Player One is based on the Ernest Cline novel of the same name, however the film adaptation is largely different to the original novel. In the year 2045, the world is a dystopia. There is no place for humanity to go, only the OASIS. The OASIS is a virtual reality video game that allows the player to create their own worlds and experience adventures of your deepest imagination. When the creator of the OASIS, Halliday (Mark Rylance) dies. He leaves behind three keys to secret easter egg which are hidden somewhere deep within the OASIS. Any player has the opportunity to find the easter egg and if they do, they inherit all of Halliday's riches and full control of the OASIS. One of the those players is Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), a down on his luck teenager who lives in a gigantic trailer park with his aunt. His opponents are the evil company known as IOI, run by the devilish Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). I was incredibly excited for Ready Player One. The trailers were fairly vague on the story and characters. However they showed off some amazing references and characters from the 1980s. I was hoping to see another gem in the realms of E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark or Jurassic Park. I hoped that this film would bring back some of that Spielberg magic that I thought was missing in his latest films. I left the theatre satisfied but still yearning for more and not in a good way. The positives first, the action scenes in this film are amazing. They are incredibly thrilling and brought me back to my childhood memories in which the DeLorean from Back to the Future could go up against King Kong. Whenever action hit the screen, the film started to pick up and it was incredibly entertaining and thrilling. One segment in particular was fun, in which the main characters visit a famous film set (won't spoil which). The main story itself was also interesting, where Wade and his virtual friends delve deep into Halliday's life and backstory. Halliday even though his role is extremely limited was by far the best character of the whole film. The idea that perplexed him to create the OASIS is incredibly fascinating. However the rest of the characters really did let me down. Tye Sheridan is a very talented actor, however there are very little emotional grounds that his character Wade hits. I was extremely disappointed by that, a mid act twist really lost me and my connection with his character disappeared. The writing for his character was very basic and I was disappointed by that. Same thing can be said about Ben Mendelsohn as the villain. His character is very similar to Director Krennic from Rogue One. Mendelsohn is always great as a villain, however they are often underutilised and uninteresting. This is why I enjoyed so much in Darkest Hour as he really played against character. The rest of the cast also feels a bit generic and mediocre. The themes feel a little hamfisted (particularly through Mendelsohn). I enjoyed many aspects of Ready Player One, the special effects are simply incredible. One of Spielberg's best looking movies. The score by Alan Silvestri added adrenaline to the story and felt right at home with the subject matter. I thought the story was interesting, but it felt a little thin as I guess Spielberg and the screenwriters wanted to make room for more movie / game references. The characters are underutilised especially Wade Watts. I would definitely recommend a viewing for fans of movies and video games. This can be incredibly entertaining on a superficial surface level viewing. A overall fun and thrilling adventure that could've used some better writing and characters but one I can certainly see myself watching again."
"Xerra-Baldy","5","2","5","31 March 2018"," Good popcorn movie to watch if you have NOT already read the book.
","Review can be summed up by the subject line. The book is a classic to many, many people due to it's huge cultural 80's references. I think a movie was almost a bad idea as, no matter how long it was (2h,20mins), it would never be able to be accurate to the film without removing huge chunks of the story.<br/><br/>And they did.<br/><br/>Not going to put in any spoilers but they shifted a lot of scenes around - like having the main characters meet much earlier - and also the situations of these chars. One scene, which involves a huge part of the book, they even swap which character is involved. Kind of daft when that character deliberately put themselves in that situation to try and resolve a situation. Vague, but people who've read the book and seen the movie should know what I mean.<br/><br/>Big race at the start was obviously just put in to do some heavy CGI for the popcorn brigade that would demand it. That's not even in the book at all, for heavens sake.<br/><br/>Plot lines from the book where the founder of the companies backstory was much more developed. <br/><br/>I could go on but I know it was always going to be a tough book to film. The movie is ok on it's own but, if you do see it, I really recommend you read the book afterwards. If you've already read the book then it's your call on seeing the film but I do suspect you will leave the cinema unsatisfied.<br/><br/>It's kind of like being given a cheese sandwich and then finding there's no cheese in it."

"lacatusalexandru","10","2","6","26 August 2019"," Ready Player One - Best SF movie ever
","Steven Spielberg is by far one of the greatest directors,most of the movies he made are a masterpiece and Ready Player One is Spielberg's greatest achievement in cinematography.
It may be just my opinion but I've never seen an SF movie which can deliver what every SF needs to deliver to the audience but partialy fails to do it and those things are: a great story that isn't too complicated for us to understand(almost every SF movie has a plot that is hard to follow or understand sometimes),an amazing cast who's characters are great written,astonishing visual effects,the balance between drama,comedy and adventure and a director who is 100 percent dedicated to his film.
I don't know if Ready Player One will have a sequel considering that is based on a book that has no continuation but just like the movie it has a great ending,but who knows maybe Steven Spielberg will consider to make a sequel.
Overall,Ready Player One is and it will remain my favorite SF movie,a movie which is better than the source material its based on and I say this because Steven Spielberg's film is adapted for us,the fans of games,movies and other pop culture things,not to mention that is the movie that has the most easter eggs in the history of both films and games."
"corrado-prizzi","1","2","6","12 May 2018"," A hurried time-waster

"StorieLuver","2","2","6","30 April 2018"," Rehash of ""Surrogates""
","First, I must explain that I have NOT read the original book, so I cannot speak to all the reviewers giving this movie a ""1"" due to its ""differences from the source."" I went into this strictly to judge the movie on its own merits, and as an allegorical story for a society already too obsessed with technology, it failed. In the very first minutes vis the expository narration, it was made clear that this story paralleled Bruce Willis's 2009 ""Surrogates."" Basic gist of both: spineless humans can no longer handle reality, so they're resorting to escapism via technology; the conflict in the story is resolved when the virtual alternative is destroyed (at the behest of its creator, who has realized the error of his ways) and humanity is forced to resume living in the real world. So when Z goes ""shopping"" after his first win and the ""bomb"" that can destroy the Oasis is introduced, I figured, ""Here we go, that's what'll solve the problem."" But NOOOO, even after learning the hard way that the bad guys are willing to KILL other living, breathing people over the silly fake world, our dimwitted protagonist still insists on saving his precious ""safe (fake) space."" When the villain finally sets off the bomb, I figured ""Ok, Z will now have an epiphany and LET the bomb go off."" Nope. And then when he finally ""meets"" the creator of Oasis, he is immediately shown the literal ""Big Red Button"" that practically screams ""HIT ME NOW!"" How much more obvious can it be that what the programmer actually WANTS is for Z to destroy his misbegotten fake world and force everybody to finally face reality? And hasn't Z supposedly learned, from meeting his friends in real life and experiencing it with them, that reality is better? Isn't that the message we're supposed to be getting on Samantha's rooftop? But no, there's a total cop-out in the end with that ridiculous ""compromise""! Ultimately, ""Surrogates"" presents the same story but with a more appropriate ending. I would've given this movie a ""1"" but my nostalgia as an 80's baby earned it the second pity star."
"cjziebold","8","2","6","29 April 2018"," Enjoy the Book, and Enjoy the Movie
","I read the book a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed all the 80's references to movies, music, and video games. I was hesitant about seeing the movie, but Josh reassured me that it was worth seeing. It is worth seeing - it is different than the book. The quests for the keys follow different puzzles/mini-storylines, and there are other changes. The changes do not take away from fundamental enjoyment of the story - it is a fun trip down 80's memory lane. I had the sense that Ernest Cline and Steven Spielberg purposely made the changes to be able to reference even more 80's trivia that appealed to them and any movie fan. If Cline could have included every trivia reference that he had probably wanted to include, the book would have been twice as long. He was able to play with these other 80's memories by working with Spielberg. Finally, this movie is reminiscent of the original Spielberg movies we grew up with - fun times!!! Enjoy the book, and enjoy the movie as an inspired by but separate entity."
"MCMCMLXX","1","2","6","17 April 2018"," No return (was there ever a return to have??)
","There is this constant hype regarding Spielberg's supposedly return to form, albeit a return to the 80's style fantasy sci-fi work. But this man has given more in movie making than this stuff (Color Purple, Saving Private Ryan). <br/><br/>But these movies are also about the ACTORS. Spielberg's stories are basic stuff. Nothing that isn't formulaic, but he directs in his way with a good cast at the helm which makes for a better movie experience than his input. <br/><br/>Which is one reason why I twitched and fretted and got annoyed so much throughout this film. The actors were so dull. The hero frets about her birthmark. The dull boy who solves the puzzles doesn't even go to school. How did he even read? Oh, that's right - there is no reading in this dystopia! Now that is dystopian (Ray Bradbury has better dystopian fables in his little pinky). <br/><br/>The ending was magnanimously tiresome. Trite, garbage and not even sentimental (which honestly would've been a tad better). The actors looked dulled and transfixed on ending their scenes because none of them were engaging. The Walking Dead extras would've been more interesting when they are dead than these actors. <br/><br/>So who's fault is that? Everyone's - casting, directing and producing. I have no doubt the book is good, but so was Schindler's Ark (which has since been retitled as List). So we can't blame the source. <br/><br/>What always seems to be the issue with people's romance is like having a body of a Ferrari but the engine is a lawnmower. We all have the tendency to overdramatise our desires in having something substantial, and I never thought Spielberg was able to deliver this. You've seen Jaws recently (and it is far better than this movie because of the actors)?<br/><br/>So what we are left with is an overindulgent unsatisying movie that really has no point nor any nostalgia for the ones who went through the western version of the 80s, or even let the younger generation get gravitas of what some things in pop culture were really like. <br/><br/>It must be like what it is as being presented to me as the 60's (ie, nothing of the sort). I wasn't alive then, so I get a very diluted second hand account. <br/><br/>Hell, without Michael J Fox, this movie was doomed to fail for me anyway. It's ALWAYS the acting in Spielberg films that succeed (Drew Barrymore was more engaging than the plastic alien). <br/><br/>Spielberg is not the auteur that some people want him to be (and he himself does not perceive this either). But it has to be said that when you see a movie like this, you'd even welcome a fake mechanical shark because at least it looked better than the cartoon we were shown throughout. <br/><br/>I feel like the whole world is kinda trapped in an arrested development. We need to have grown up stuff - that's what I liked as a kid (look at Warner Bros cartoons!!). With a movie like this it should've been grown up!!<br/><br/>P.S: I'm not giving spoilers away in this report, but I was so disappointed that the movie did for The Shining. Damn, I was with my 12 year old and I wanted him to see THAT film when he's older with me. Now,the best bits have really been shown in this Ready Player One. They really could've mentioned that before you watched it (ie: this movie contains The Shining spoilers....)"
"jboothmillard","6","2","6","7 April 2018"," Ready Player One
","When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was fascinated by the amount of pop culture characters and references I could spot, reading more into it, it looked and sounded like something right up my street, so I went to the cinema with high expectations, directed by Steven Spielberg (Indiana Jones, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, The BFG). Basically in the year 2045, much of Earth has become slum-like cities, so most of the population escape the desolation, entering the virtual reality world of the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), where they can be and do whatever they want, engaging in numerous activities for work, education and entertainment. The brilliant and eccentric creator of the OASIS, James Halliday (Mark Rylance), passed away a year ago, before his death he left his immense fortune and total control of the OASIS hidden within the immersive realm. There is a worldwide contest called Anorak's Quest, that Halliday designed to find a worthy heir, the first to find the Easter Egg, finding the three keys and following the clues, will inherit the wealth, and gain full ownership of the OASIS, among other gifts. This has garnered thousands to play the game, including ""Gunters"" (""egg hunters""), and video game conglomerate and virtual reality manufacturer Innovative Online Industries (IOI), its CEO Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) has a mass army of players known as Sixers (due to their six-digit identification) seeking to claim the prize. However, to date, no one has managed to finish the first quest, a vehicle race across an ever-shifting version of New York City, because when you are killed in the game world, you will lose everything you have earned in your character progression. In the slums of Columbus, Ohio, living with his aunt, is an orphaned Gunter, 18-year-old Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), in the OASIS his avatar is Parzival, his best friend is male avatar Aech (Lena Waithe), who serves as a virtual mechanic, he later befriends well-known player Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), he saves her from being ""zeroed out"" by King Kong. Wade decides to study the virtual OASIS library and archives to learn about Halliday's personal life, hoping to find a hint to finish the race, he watches footage of Halliday regretfully accepting the resignation of his partner Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg), Wade notices Halliday saying to ""go backwards really fast, as fast as you can"". So at the next race, Wade reverses from the start line, finding a hidden, safe path beneath the race track, going under all the obstructions, including Kong, he reaches the finish line and gains the first key from Anorak, Halliday's avatar, and a clue to the next quest, Aech and Art3mis, as well as players Daito (Win Morisaki) and Sho (Philip Zhao) also follow the path to finishing, and the appear atop the global scoreboards, becoming known as the ""High Five"". IOI takes interest in them, desiring to learn their real-life identities, then bounty hunter i-R0k (T.J. Miller) overhears Wade tell Art3mis his real name, so Sorrento approaches Wade and attempts to convince him to join IOI to solve Anorak's Quest, but Wade refuses. Sorrento retaliates and has his assistant F'Nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen) attack Wade's slum, killing Wade's aunt Alice (Susan Lynch) and her boyfriend Rick (Ralph Ineson), while Wade is rescued by Art3mis' real-life friends and taken to a Gunter hideout, where he meets Art3mis' player, Samantha Cook. Working together, Wade and Samantha look at more archive footage of Halliday, they discover that Halliday and Morrow fell out because Halliday once dated Kira (Perdita Weeks), who later became Morrow's wife, then in the OASIS, Wade wins a bet with The Curator, Morrow's avatar, and gains access to Kira's memories, leading to the second quest, as well as a special reward. Using the clue of a creator who hated his own work, they work out that they have to enter the world of The Shining, the Stanley Kubrick movie, hated by the creator of the original book, Stephen King, surviving this horror realm, the High Five each earn the second key and the clue to the final quest, which is located in Castle Anorak on Planet Doom. Zandor discovers the Gunter hideout and kidnaps Samantha, while Wade is rescued by the real-life players of Aech aka Helen, Daito and Sho, back in the OASIS they learn that IOI has erected a gigantic forcefield blocking access to the castle. Wade sends a message to all OASIS players about the activities of IOI, convincing many to join them to fight against IOI and the Sixers. Aech, Daito, and Sho lead the army of players, while Samantha is able to cause a distraction and shut down the field, allowing Wade to access inside Castle Anorak, where he sees that Sixers have found the Atari room. Sixers are trying to determine which Atari 2600 game was Halliday's favourite, choosing and completing the wrong one leads to one being zeroed out, Sorrento and Wade recognise the right game is Adventure, but Sixers who successfully complete the game are still zeroed out. Sorrento activates the Cataclyst, which zeroes out all players on Planet Doom, but the Curator's reward is revealed to be an extra life, allowing Wade's avatar to survive and continue the quest. Wade deduces that the goal is not to win Adventure, but to find its own Easter Egg, upon doing so, he is given the last key, Wade uses the three keys to open a gate in the castle. When it opens he is congratulated by Anorak, who presents Wade with a contract to sign, but Wade recognises it as the one Morrow signed on his termination, he turns it down, the avatar of Anorak transforms into a projection of Halliday, who reveals that this was a final test, one that centred on his biggest regret in life. Halliday shows Wade the Big Red Button, which will wipe out the OASIS, if he feels that is for the best, and awards him with the Easter Egg, transferring control of the OASIS to Wade, he questions if the projection of Halliday is actually him and is he is really dead. In the end, Sorrento and Zandor are arrested, IOI is heavily restructured, Wade opts to share the OASIS fortune with the other members of the High Five, Morrow offers his consultation for a small fee, the High Five decide to have the OASIS shut down for two days in a week, to coax people to spend more time in the real world, while Wade and Samantha start a romantic relationship and move in together. Also starring Clare Higgins as Mrs. Gilmore and Black Panther's Letitia Wright as Reb (Safe House). Pop culture references featured and mentioned that I recognised and spotted included: Spider-Man, King Kong, Freddy Krueger, The Iron Giant, the DeLorean time machine from Back from the Future, KITT from Knight Rider, The A-Team, Batman, the Tyrannosaurus Rex from Jurassic Park, King Kong, TRON, Last Action Hero, Stars Wars, Alien, Beetlejuice, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Superman, Star Trek, Michael Jackson: Thriller, The Shining, Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, Chucky the killer doll, RoboCop, Godzilla, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but there are plenty more. The performances are all good, especially Sheridan as the young hero, and Mendelsohn relishes being the corporate villain, for many this could be considered ""nerd porn"", something for all the geeks who love to spot all the recognisable things in the worlds of movies, television, music and games, but at the heart of it, there are also fantastic characters you actually care about, a terrific engaging story, and brilliant special effects to bring the chases, battles and action sequences to life, it only has slight predictability, there is something for everyone, a fabulously vibrant, fun and enjoyable science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Good!"

I can see this as a movie that people would dress up as their favorite video game characters to attend. My only regret is not doing the D-Box seats, perhaps next time!

","Steven Spielberg's new nostalgia laden flick ""Ready Player One"" hit theatres this past weekend and I was there. If someone is going to whip up a nostalgia flick, who better to do it than the 'Berg himself? He is the REASON for movie nostalgia, having churned out a string of 80's hits including E.T. (1982), Poltergeist* (1982), and Gremlins (1984), amongst others. Ready Player One, in my humble opinion, did not disappoint.<br/><br/> Set in 2045 in a dystopian Ohio, Ready Player One follows the story of Wade Watts, a teenage gamer who spends most of his waking moments (like the rest of society) in a virtual world called the OASIS. OASIS is a virtual game world created by eccentric gaming pioneer James Halliday, touted as the new ""Steve Jobs"". The story gives us the back history of Halliday's creation, and how it started as a passion project, quickly to become extremely successful and then threatened by corporate greed. Halliday then passes away, but before doing so, offers a challenge to OASIS users - find the three keys using ""easter eggs"" left behind by Halliday himself, and the kingdom is yours.<br/><br/> Enter Wade Watts and his band of merry misfits, a series of friends he plays along with in the virtual world, knowing them only by their virtual avatars and pseudonyms. Combine a journey for the keys, teenage heartstrings, a corporate villain, quirky comedy, nods to nostalgia, eye popping visuals and a mind blowing homage to Stanley Kubrick, and you've got the thrill ride that is Ready Player One.<br/><br/> While I find the overuse of CGI trying at times in newer movies, it fits here due to the subject matter at hand. You can't have a virtual world like this without CG, and the production team did a great job of flipping between reality and the virtual world, while maintaining continuity. I did see the movie 3D and I think it worked nicely to pull the viewer into the story - it was used properly and didn't feel gimmicky at all.<br/><br/>Story wise, there isn't much new here formula wise - you'll see what I mean when you watch it. I think the producers understood this and added some elements of mystery that work quite nicely. In some respects, you are playing the game right alongside the characters, which is fun and thrilling at the same time.<br/><br/> Overall, Ready Player One is a fun family film that earns it PG-13 rating for some mild sexual references and violent video game action scenes, but is definitely worth the experience (and will be joining my movie library). 8/10.<br/><br/>*yah yah Tobe Hooper blah blah"

","I LOVED this film! From start to finish I smiled more than I can remember. Spielberg continues to show the world that there isn't a task he can't accomplish. Being a fan of the book I knew the film wouldn't completely follow the original storyline. And after seeing the movie, I was completely fine with that! Don't listen to the negative people telling the booklovers to boycott! The characters were each amazing both in and out of the OASIS. For die hard nerds like me who know everything and then some about the video game/film industry, this movie brings a crazy amount of nostaligic tears to your eyes. From seeing Ryu from my beloved Streetfighter, to flipping out and seeing tracer from Overwatch. Rylance and Spielberg continue to be Hollywood's best duo behind Tarantino and Jackson. That race scene .. my oh my that race scene. The music was oh so perfect also! While it has it does have the same silly flaws other movies have ..

I think it's problems is the underacting , I mean in some parts I thought the main lead was just basically rehearsing and not doing it emotionally, I think it's a movie too watch if you have nothing too do or just a person who likes gaming a lot like me , but i do think that Steven Spielberg is back and not making trash movies, but just keep in mind that Hello Kitty is in this film."

It also cashes in on nostalgia from a few classic movies from the past....most notably ""The Shining"". Some may enjoy this....I didn't particularly.<br/><br/>Most of all, this film is not very original. It is another ""video game players use their skills to save the world"" flick. If you imagine a composite of ""The Matrix"" and ""Tron""....but with an tone and level of engagement more like ""Tron""....you will have a pretty good idea what to expect.<br/><br/>I don't really recommend it unless you are a hardcore gamer...and maybe not even then.

","I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was such a delight to watch. Only Steven Spielberg can deliver such high quality. The race sequence in the first half of the movie was out of this world; best animated one I've seen for sure. The special effects were top notch. 
The pop culture references man, if I write about them, it'll be an entire separate 500 word article; and I just got like half of them. The video game ones kinda went over my head however I got like 90% of the movie references. 
The story for me was a little too long. Not enough time was spent on character development and it felt rushed. Things happen too quickly between the characters which defy normal conventions. 
That aside a major part of the movie is really engaging. If you're a movie buff who is into sci fi movies, this is the one you cannot miss."

","Lets face it, Steven Spielberg has been streaky in the past few years. I absolutely love some of his earlier stuff. Jaws, Jurassic Park, E.T., are just some of the titles that I love from him. Even some of the work from the 90's like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are excellent. I did like his last effort (The Post) which was a solid politically based news drama. I wasn't overly impressed with the marketing or trailers for Ready Player One, but Spielberg's name being attached meant I was curious. At the very least I expected to ride that nostalgia wave that I feel a lot of others wanted to experience as well.<br/><br/>The film is set in the year 2045. The world is vastly different and everyone is immersed in a virtual world named the OASIS. The protagonist Wade uses his virtual character and enlists the help of a team to find a hidden easter egg in the OASIS. The creator of the OASIS has hidden three keys that lead to the egg and the one who completes the challenges to earn the egg will take over the creator's fortune and also control the virtual reality world. The CEO of a corporation named IOI is attempting to gain control of the egg himself, thwarting Wade's quest.<br/><br/>This has to be one of Steven Spielberg's most ambitious and toughest films to make. The film is heavily computer animated as expected, and there is so much on screen. There are plenty of references to pop culture of the past. You will see movie and video game references everywhere; you are bound to miss many of them because some come and go quick. Licensing to use these characters must have been hell but it was done nonetheless. Visually the film is nice, some of the computer animation might be distracting but its still fun to look at.<br/><br/>I do think the film is overlong and drags quite a bit in the third act. I know the film is following a literary work so its hard to criticize some of the plot holes or advancement of the plot. I don't feel like the side characters were as fleshed out as they could have been. The film gets too busy making references and delivering action that it kind of loses its heart. I did however really enjoy the entire segment with The Shining, fairly brilliant stuff.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed with the soundtrack. I wanted more 80s nostalgia in term of music. For example, some of the songs used in the trailers could have been utilized but isn't done so. The film isn't always smart and some of the pop culture references feel ham fisted and tacked on but I feel like the film was better than I thought it would be. I'm actually pretty infatuated with Olivia Cooke at the moment. She's quite a talented actress having recently seen her in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, and Thoroughbreds. I want to see her in everything.<br/><br/>This film isn't touching some of Steven Spielberg's very best but its a better film than what we've been seeing recently from the filmmaker. its certainly a better film than The BFG and War Horse. Overall, visually it provides actions and a lot of references but suffers a bit as the film wears on. Still, its an entertaining watch, which is really all I was asking for from Ready Player One.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

It was visually stunning as you expect from Mr Spielberg but it was terribly corny. Of all his movies - great movies - this is easily the most tedious. I didn't care about the characters at all."

"jalowry-06949","8","2","6","31 March 2018"," It's so much fun to watch
","I really like it. The animation is great. It is like watching a cartoon most of the time. The whole world is addicted to playing a virtual reality video game called the oasis. Where you can be anything you want and do anything you want. The creator of the game dies, but before he dies he decides who will take over the oasis by making a game out of it. He hides three keys in the game and an egg. If you can find those keys you get the game and inherit all his money. So obviously everybody is in it to win it. One character called parzival has developed strategy for finding the keys by going into the creators memory bank. 
This made me think that they were a lot of people who probably gave up and went back to playing the oasis like it was before Halliday died. Which I think is understandable. Cause it's really hard to find the keys anyway. 
There is also an evil corporation trying to find the keys. I don't know what there motive is other just jelliousy. 
Anyway Parzival and his friends the High Five all compete to get the keys and of course they find them. I knew this would happen before I even saw the movie. But it didn't bother me. The ending could of been different though. When Parzival gets the last key. Halliday appears in the game and shows him the attic where he grew up playing games. He shows him a big red button and if he presses it it will shut down the game. I think he should have done it. It would have been climatic and it would have mattered more than what he did. He could redesign things and made the game better too. Or re release the game in a better way. But none of that happens. Few things were changed and it went back to normal gameplay with a few differences. But this movie also has so many references to other movies and other games it's part of fun just trying to find everything when you're watching it. It has replay value, which is a good thing to have."

","""Ready Player One"" (2018) is an adventurous science-fiction film, in which people can enter a virtual game-world away from the dystopian everyday life. The developer of the game made a riddle. Who solves it, gets the control over the game and thus improving their life. Steven Spielberg is the director.<br/><br/>First of all, it needs to be said that those who read the book will probably see this movie with a more critical eye for obvious reasons. I did not read the book, therefore I can only speak for the movie.<br/><br/>But there are already some problems in the story. Some aspects do not make sense to me. After five years only one was able to solve a quiet solvable challenge? And near the end, the behaviour of the villain? Lastly, I could not understand the message of ""Ready Player One""; I just could not get convinced of it.<br/><br/>Besides these flaws, you get nevertheless an entertaining adventure. The easter eggs of pop culture hidden in nearly every scene makes the movie fun. However, one also needs to actually know those references. Apart from that the effects for creating the virtual world are fantastic. The settings are also incredibly well-made. So, it does not lack in adventure and action.<br/><br/>Looking at the cast, everyone acted on an acceptable level. Tye Sheridan as the protagonist Wade played his role equally well as Ben Mendelson as the villain Sorrento.<br/><br/>If you are familiar with pop culture, love video games or just find your entertainment in action and adventure, you are not out of place here.<br/><br/>That's why ""Ready Player One"" gets from me 6.0 out of 10 points."

I can't say it was necessarily bad or that I regret watching it, but I definitely wouldn't watch it again (especially considering it's long running time).

The virtual world aka ""the Oasis"" is just down right ""beautiful"". All the actors in the movie were good and especially the bad guy , he was great. The movie also stays true to its source material , a book of the same name by Ernest cline. The movie has great cgi and there is absolutely nothing I could find to pick apart this movie. It's that ""flawless"". In the end , Ready Player one is not a video game movie , its a fun ride , with great characters , an edge of the seat plot , loads of Easter eggs and one egg to rule them all ( not a lotr reference). it's one of those movies which brings out the kid in you , ten years down the line this movie will be called a ""classic""."

I loved all the pop culture references and almost whooped and punched the air when The Iron Giant appeared! Then there's the Dolorian, Godzilla, The Overlook Hotel sequence, Robocop, Alien, even ""f*****g Chucky"" and sooooo much more.
This nostalgia has been criticised by some reviewers, but trust me it's totally relevant to the virtual world that has been envisioned in this movie. And what's so wrong with a bit of nostalgia anyway!
This is a completely thrilling movie. A shining example of how a popcorn movie should be. The actors performances are perfect in the roles they play, particularly Tye Sheridan & Olivia Cooke.
There is also a warning to all game players out there for a very possible future. As wonderful as Virtual Reality may seem - it's not REAL - so be careful what you wish for!
Most of all though this film is a roller coaster ride of fun & thrills.

"Badmoviessuck","4","1","2","26 January 2019"," Style over substance
","Ready player one is nothing special.
Just a bunch of pop culture stuff thrown around to give people nostalgia and why they do that they forget to make an actual good story.
This movie is style over substance.<br/><br/>CGI & VISUALS
Let me say pros before we say cons.
The visuals and cgi are phenomenal one of the greatest i have ever seen in my opinion and the race scene captures that perfectly.
The creativity and all that amazes me and i thought this movie was gonna be great but sadly not.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
The characters are all bland.
They atleast manage to give them some backstory and a desire but it's a really cheap one. It is ""get the key cause it's necessary for the plot"" there is no reason to why they want the key other than they want to control Oasis.
It's excusable if the protagonist want's the keys to control Oasis but if all of them are after the key to control Oasis it's really unoriginality and lazy writing.
But anyways the side characters are bad (as expected) they don't have that much screen time and they should have at least made Aech into a more important and well developed character but she is just a side character.
Wade is a mediocre character who dosen't change as a character which makes the whole adventure pointless and Samantha is a boring love interest (i'll explain later.)
All of them are cheap.<br/><br/>ROMANCE
The relationship between Wade and Samantha is rushed.
In the beginning they are instantly friends and then even faster they are nearly lovers.
It was excusable cause There was a conflict happening when IOI attacked but that conflict got abandoned after Wade's aunt and uncle got killed (which was a great scene but never got developed into a greater reason for Wade stopping Nolan) so they never talked about Wade and Samantha's relationship and then when it was most convenient they just kissed.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
Nolan had so much potential.
The scene were Wade meets Nolan.
Instead of making him a corepret a-hole they should have made him a lover for pop culture and his motivation for controlling Oasis is understandable but wrong.
And him killing Wade's Uncle and aunt was the perfect way to make the villain more threatening but they failed at doing that.
And the bounty hunter was just bad.<br/><br/>VERDICT
It's a bad movie and i understand people who like this movie but i just don't find the enjoyment"

It was a disaster! I cursed Steven Spielberg for ruining my picture of RPO. I could not forgive Ernest Cline for participating and writing a script so far away from the book.

I saw it premiered on Netflix.
First I thought no way! I was so disappointed, and promised myself never to watch that sh.. ever again.
Then I checked out all the reviews on IMDB saying it was actually a very cool movie. Ok, I had nothing else to do, and pressed play, thinking I would turn it off again or just look down on my phone or whatever.
At the same time I promised myself I would see the movie without thinking about the book, storyline, plot and so on.<br/><br/>And daaaaamn! The movie is actually not that bad! It's a cool story.

","This is a movie that heavily relies on nostalgia to force the viewer to enjoy the film. There are literally thousands of references to movies, games, etc. from the past, with little to no future pop-culture references. If this movie takes place in the future, why is everyone so fixated on the late 1900s?<br/><br/>Nostalgia aside, the story is quite average and predictable. There are no real surprises or awe-inspiring moments.<br/><br/>Edit: I've just finished reading the book, which gave much better insight about the nostalgic focus, and it fleshed out the world significantly better. I think the movie's changes to the challenges weren't bad. I understood making the film's focus on action rather than mental puzzles, with less focus on actually playing through the old games and movies. It was more cinematic that way. The movie's biggest failure was that it didn't convey just how massive the game was and why it was so hard to solve the clues. Plus the Sixers seemed way more ruthless and unfair in the book, which made the book's final battle have much higher stakes and way more exciting than the movie's climax."

Absolutely no chemistry between Parzival, Artemis, and Aech. In the book they would sit around in an OASIS room chatting and busting each others chops. That was missing in the movie. No time to get to know the characters. Plus Halliday looked and talked like Garth from Wayne's World. ""Party on Parzival"".

If you take away all the self-indulgent references to 80s pop culture, you end up with a really disappointing shell of a movie.<br/><br/>Apparantly this movie has been created solely to pander to nerds and gamers, and judging by the box pffice numbers it looks like it worked. Yeah, I liked ""Back to the Future"" and all that too, but if you spoon-feed me those references over and over again, it starts to feel like you're trying way too hard to push those nostalgic buttons.

","I can't imagine that anyone who read and liked Ernest Cline's dazzling novel could be satisfied with this film adaptation of it.<br/><br/>Which is odd, since Cline co-adapted the screenplay. Maybe he wanted to avoid the trap of the movie never living up to its source, so he decided to take the thing in an entirely different direction so it would be harder to compare the two. In any case, what lives on the screen resembles the novel only in the barest of outlines. Gone is the cleverness of the novel and its geeky reverence for 1980s pop culture. In its place is a soulless attempt to recreate one of those adventure movies from that decade, like ""Goonies"" or ""Back to the Future,"" but without the sensibility to pull it off. Again, very odd given that the director of this film, Steven Spielberg, practically redefined the adventure sci-fi movie. But he feels like the wrong match for this material. The movie is like watching a movie about 80s nostalgia made by someone who doesn't feel it and is trying to manufacture it based on a guess as to what it might feel like.<br/><br/>Mostly the film is just visually overwhelming. A bunch of visual effects artists vomit a bunch of CGI on to the screen to see what will stick, and the end result is to numb the audience into submission.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

It was the idea of all the pleasures and nostalgiac pop-culture interests from a persons childhood co-existing in a common universe: Star Wars, Star Trek, Dungeons and Dragons, etc... all within reach of each other and interacting. To make that work, you needed the 1980s nostalgia element from the novel, which the movie almost completely threw away. <br/><br/>However, there were some things the movie did better than the book - the reason I didn't just give it a 1-star rating. First, the movie spends more time in the real world, outside the OASIS, and offered more of a resolution to plot threads going on there, for example the fate of the villain. Also, Tye Sheridan was charismatic in the lead, and created a more sympathetic hero in Wade than the book version. In the book, we don't see much indication that Wade develops any appreciation of the real world or the dangers of getting over-immersed in the OASIS. In the movie, however, Wade eventually does learn to see this, which I think was a big improvement to the character.<br/><br/>So to sum up, if you could combine the good from the book with that from the movie, you might have the perfect story. I won't ever understand why the film makers made such a drastic departure from the 80s nostalgia themes of the novel. I guess it was out of a concern that the original story targets too narrow a demographic. It's true that only GenXers will appreciate the majority of the references, some of which are pretty obscure. However, that didn't hurt the success of the book, so I don't see why it was an issue in its film adaptation."
"MissPTT","1","1","2","23 September 2018"," Nonsensical
","Short version: This is a terrible movie. It doesn't make sense and it's boring.<br/><br/>Long version: There's so much to pick apart here as almost nothing in the script works. You never really understand why this competition is of international significance. You don't see that the oasis is more than a game, which of course it would be - it's school, work, banking, politics. Without this you don't care who runs it. <br/><br/>The competition doesn't make sense. What is the design here? What are they looking for in a winner? No one seems to know much. This major hunt starts with a car race that's not linked to any game or movie or Halliday in anyway and we're supposed to believe no one tried doing it backwards in 5 years?<br/><br/>The characters have no development. In the book they are loners online and offline, they meet as competitors and when they come together at the end it's a joining of geek minds that makes them unbeatable. The film was just random kids who are mates. Every character is weak. The girl is meant to be strong willed and smart, in this she is merely pretty and supportive. The Japanese brothers are meant to be, Japanese! That's right, the world consists of other countries who can also use the internet. There's also meant to be a disconnect between thier online selves and real selves (they look the opposite, are not related in real life etc) but this movie didn't play with that at all. Which is surely one of the more interesting things about living a virtual life?<br/><br/>I read the book and didn't really like it. Somehow this movie has removed everything that worked in it."

","It's good to see a sci-fi movie where the writers actually did some research - did their homework.
First, a comment on the main complaint from low rating reviews about it not following the book. Movies and books are different mediums w/different ways of presenting/emphasizing their POVs. And, every retelling of a story will change it, often for the better. <br/><br/>The CGI, action, dialogue were so overwhelming it might require seeing twice to appreciate it all. The mostly '80s music wasl spot on - must have been a good decade for music. The subtle cameos by Chucky, Railgun, MechaGodzilla, Wired Magazine, a Gandalf typecast were hilarious. <br/><br/>My only negative is the over emphasis on teen heroes, teen stereotyping and subsequent romance all to attract that large paying demographic."

This was kind of like a video game minus the one joy of user input to correct my (your ..his) course. As an 80's teen this made me feel less nostalgic and more irritated. I felt like I was at a party and I was on the outside of a clique or a joke. I could clearly see all my stuff but I just couldn't quite make sense of it. I didn't feel connected to it even though I felt like I should be. I hope Steven Spielberg gets back to just telling some great stories. The kind of movies that moved me and that I still love revisiting and remembering. I left this one wanting to forget it."

","Spielberg provides a film that marries 80s pop culture nostalgia with a VR gamer's delight.

The legendary director weaves a coming of age tale that has the underdog battle the corporate Big Boss.<br/><br/>The story itself does not waiver too much in terms of overall story arc, nor does it have much of a twist.

","I have one rule when watching adaptations; as long as it tells an equally good or better story, the writers can make whatever changes they like.

The sometimes sluggish pacing of the book isn't fixed, instead the slumps are bizarrely shifted around. The film rests so hard on the books myriad pop culture references while barely supplying any context as to why they're there. It's like Spielberg wanted to show off how many industry mates he has and how many licences the studio paid for.<br/><br/>As a fan of the book I was dissapointed and as a movie fan I was bored.

"zkonedog","9","1","2","30 July 2018"," Spielberg Can Still Make The Popcorn Thriller
","At its heart, the story behind ""Ready Player One"" is a popcorn cinema thriller just waiting to be made. After reading the book, I remember thinking that it could probably be even better as a film, considering it is easier to see/feel being inside a video game than it is reading about it. Director Steven Spielberg proves himself more than capable of handling both those fronts, proving he still has the chops to make a terrific popcorn flick, and also make it even better than the source material.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Parzival (Tye Sheridan), who spends most of his time (like most people of this future) inside the OASIS (think of it like a massive multiplay online game that everyone is hooked into). On an Earth that has been decimated by plagues and riots, with many residents living in vertical ghettos, this digital realm is the closest to happiness that most people can get. Halliday (Mark Rylance), the creator of OASIS, has left three clues scattered around (based on his childhood nostalgia) that will give the winner of his little game essentially the keys to the kingdom. So far, no one has been able to crack even the first code, and that includes a team of nefarious drone-types put together by Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). When Parzival, with the help of the mysterious Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), solves the first puzzle, it sets off a race to determine which faction will ultimately control OASIS.<br/><br/>Like I said, this is perfect fodder for summer action/adventure movie fare, and Spielberg captures it all perfectly here. The action/chases are pulse-pounding, the visuals are engaging, and the entire film is littered with ""easter eggs"", or callbacks to 70s/80s nostalgia. For anyone who grew up with that pop culture, this will be a real treat. Even younger viewers, however, should also still be interested in some of the technical concepts thrown around, while of course being amazed by just the sheer amount of things that transpire in every scene.<br/><br/>Even more impressive? Spielberg's take on the material is better than the novel source, and I honestly don't think it is all that close of a contest. Ernest Cline's book had some great ideas, but spent far too much time moralizing about them in the ""real world"". Here, Spielberg realizes that the real meat of the story takes place inside the OASIS, and thus that is where most of the movie is set. This makes for a much more engaging experience, coupled with video games/film being easier to replicate visually than via the printed page.<br/><br/>So, overall I was much more impressed by ""Ready Player One"" than I ever thought I would be (it's one of the best purely exciting films I've seen in quite some time). After a run of more personal or politically-themed epic films, this one proves that Spielberg can slip right back into ""cool guy director"" mode without a hitch!"

","It has been a few years since i read the book, but one of the best things of the book was the way to the first key and what happens directly there after. Sadly most of that part of the story was cut and, in case of the first key quest, completly different. From my perspective it might have been better to split it into 2 movies instead of pressing all of it into one.
The whole thing about art3mis being not quit as ""ugly"" as she was in the books, was almost a given or only the people who also read the book would have realy enjoyed the movie. 
From the moment the movie was anounced, it was sadly clear that the big fight at the end would be what it was in the book, after all there sadly are really expensive license connected to some of the figures. It was stil quit satisfying nonetheless."

","The year is 2045 and most people have lost all hope of a better future and rely on gaming in the Oasis, a virtual world where anything and everything is possible. Parzival In Virtual Reality (Ty Sheridan) or Wade in real life (also Tye Sherdan) enters the Oasis often, but now there is a new wrinkle: the creator of the Oasis Anorak/James Halliday (Mark Rylance) has died and has left a legacy and has left clues to 3-Keys or as he called them, an Easter Egg, and the one who finds the 3-Keys will inherit all he owned in life and will gain control of the Oasis. Wade decides to find those keys and win. <br/><br/>There is simply too much CGI in here and after a while, it put me into la-la land. The story bounces back and forth between real life and the Oasis with Virtual Reality. And, truth be told someone liked playing with the CGI buttons too much and we find ourselves watching everything in the Oasis for way too long. And all became quite boring for me. Yes, the CGI is fantastic, no doubt about it, but when it goes on for too long I find myself dozing off. The story could have been cut back some, but like I said someone liked playing with the CGI buttons and I dozed off many times. Not good. <br/><br/>There is a love interest for Wade/Parzival and that is Art3mis in VR (Olivia Cooke) and Samantha (also Olivia Cooke) in real life and she is also into finding those keys. <br/><br/>Am glad I was awake when Parzival and Art3mis danced to the music of ""Staying Alive"" Very nice. <br/><br/>Notables: Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento a bad guy who wants to make sure Parzival doesn't find the keys; Simon Pegg as the Curator who has access to all of Halliday's memories in life; Mark Ryland is also Anorak, an Avatar an all knowing Wizard; Win Morisake as Daito, a friend of Parzival; Philip Zhao as Sho, also a friend of Parzival; Lena Waithe as Aech/Helen, friend of Parzival and he is a very muscular mechanic. (you did say ""he"", right? ) Yes, anyone can be anything in the Oasis. Weren't you paying attention? <br/><br/>If this was shorter and finding the keys was quicker, this may have been okay, but it wasn't. It just went on for too long especially with too much background info between Parzival and Art3mis. <br/><br/>This was a CGI-Fest and there was too much of it. On the whole I would say it's watchable if you don't doze off, but to be fair I would say Gamers may love it for whatever reason. They love this stuff. (5/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes.

In both films the protagonists has to solve puzzles, and prove himself to the exiting owner to gain new ownership. I didn't see much point to the film except an exercise in CGI on a massive epic scale. The amount of license-clearing to exhibit all of these trademarked characters must have cut heavily into the budget.

Going back and forth from the real world to the virtual world, it all worked smoothly. The story isn't even far fetched as you see how it is now, with most people addicted to their gadgets. I can see this future happening. The cast in the real world was good even though they don't play the major parts. The major parts are mostly virtual and are inside the game. It reminded me a bit of Tron, a movie that blew my mind away when I was a kid. But Ready Player One is so much better, so if you're a fan of that kinda of stories you will like this movie. The fictional characters are legion and even if you're not a gaming geek I'm sure you will recognize some. Steven Spielberg did another good job coming with a totally different movie again.

That's what really hooked me on the book.<br/><br/>The comedy was almost non existent. The few lines that were supposed to be funny were lost on the audience in the theater I was in. The story line was drastically changed and again, the 80's challenges were all but removed. I walked out more disappointed that the essential part of the story being based around the 80's was taken away, more than they changed the story from the book. <br/><br/>I expected the characters to be more isolated and independent. The interesting parts about the relationships was all removed and it was a buddy movie. That was what I liked about the original story and made it great to follow. Were they going to get together and help one another or would they stay apart? The movie version was predictable and bland. <br/><br/>Maybe Mr Spielberg should watch ET, The Goonies or Back to the Future again before he makes another movie set in the 80's or has a strong underlying theme based on 80's pop culture.

There were too many details that weren't followed through. We're introduced to Wade's aunt and then she pretty much just.. dies right after. Samantha had a birthmark on her face that she was insecure about but after they meet it's never talked about again? It was obvious they were plugging things in from the book and it was awkward. <br/><br/>The character development was something we'd see in a movie like this from the 20th century. It's 2018, and I'd really love it if Wade didn't tell Sam he loved her after knowing her for a few days. That is my biggest pet peeve in movies. There's almost nothing that makes me feel attached to any of these characters and quite honestly if they died I wouldn't care. If that is the case for a film, it's not good. <br/><br/>Otherwise, I did enjoy everything else. Yes, even the dozens of pop culture references. Those were actually my favorite part of the film. As a teenager I think it's awesome to see an ode to classic video games especially because I wasn't there to experience them with everyone else.

The only moral (or the conclusion) of the story is stated in the title of this review. Of course it is a fake hope! No such thing happens in real life. As one of the main characters says: Reality is really only thing that's real. And, also of course, this movie has almost nothing to do with the novel. You expected otherwise? If so, you're just a 10 year old kid. Smart, but naive. Movie and games are business and it's all about the money they make. Novels are somewhere on the opposite side: good for ""borrowing"" ideas. As far as the acting and other ""technical stuff"" (editing, photography and so on) goes, this is nothing but a standard movie made by the man who has a lot of money, influence and well crafted skill.

","This book was basically a giant (and entertaining) adventure in nostalgia. And the film was fairly similar. Of course, the book was better. And I do not say that because they changed things (you have to) or because books are usually better (they are). The issue here: the book fades over the second half when the conceptual novelty wears off...the film starts so fast that it fails to establish the characters all that well in the first place. So while the adventure is fun and the references are great, that lack of exposition leaves you caring less as the story goes on. The concept was still inventive and the story still worked, but the stakes would have been higher with more complex characters and more developed relationships. Also, Cline's preachiness in the hands of Spielberg leads to this movie trying just a BIT too hard at points. Shocking, right? All that said, I still mostly enjoyed the ride, and you will too."

LISTEN to the audiobook- it was 1,000 times better. We were very disappointed with this, and if they had honored the book, like with Harry Potter or Hunger Games, it would have been a legendary movie. The 80s feeling was also wasted and not enough there. Sorry- I thought it would be fantastic, and came away with a very different feeling."

","I haven't read the book, so I can do no comparisons in that regard.<br/><br/>Here's what I can say about this movie: the visual effects were quite good. Not realistic, but that was not the goal. On the contrary, their goal was establishing a virtual-world with an aesthetic comparable to modern games, such as Overwatch and the like.<br/><br/>However, this seems to be the only redeeming quality of the movie. The romance was forced, the story was uninteresting and not compelling, the characters were largely underdeveloped, the exposition was lazy, and the humor mostly fell flat. The writing was an afterthought, and the movie tried and failed to make up for this with its impressive graphic effects. Seeing the high reviews and Spielberg's name on this film gave me high hopes, but overall, this film was a disappointment and a waste of two hours."

"ddangtruong23","5","1","2","19 April 2018"," It just feels so... empty
","I haven't read the book, so no, this is not one of those the-book-is-better reviews.<br/><br/>I came into this expecting great things, because well, it's Spielberg. And the movie indeed started pretty well. I was awed by the world building and excited for the potential of the story, but all that excitement promptly shattered because I quickly realize that behind the visual epicness, the whole thing is just so empty.<br/><br/>Every character feels like a cliché. And it's not because of their characteristics but because their motivations are so boring and their backstories are poorly presented.<br/><br/>For example, one of the main character has a tragic backstory that is only briefly mentioned with one line of dialogue and then entirely forgotten. Another one went through his own tragic but never expresses any feeling towards it for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>It's like the backstories are not there to raise our suspense or emotions but only to fill a checklist, so once we're already done with them, they can be safely ignored for the movie to move on with the action scenes.<br/><br/>That of course could still work if the actors were a bit more relatable or charismatic. But sadly, the two leads here are way too awkward and boring to carry the movie without a compelling script. <br/><br/>So by the middle of the second act, I already started asking myself why I should care about any of this and if the villain is really so bad. After all, the actor playing the main villain is the only one doing a good job."
"Toad1951","6","1","2","18 April 2018"," Good for what it was, bad when comparing to the book.
","I found that in comparison to the book this movie was about 20% correct. I guess I've come to expect more perfection out of Spielberg movies as he usually does very solid work. That being said outside the book this was a 7* movie by itself but it could have been and 8* or 9* had it the book more closely.<br/><br/>On closer review all 3 Keys and gates were almost entirely wrong, though they pretty much nailed the last 1 on 1 scene.<br/><br/>The stacks in the real world were correct and done very accurately but he was never caught until he wished it. In fact it was only after finding the original key near his online school (in the book) that he actually earned sponsorship (real world money) to move away and plan his whole invasion of IOI.<br/><br/>In the Oasis he had no money to start, and he couldn't travel anywhere, which is part of the reason he found the copper key in the first place. there was absolutely no drag race. <br/><br/>Without doing a side by side book to movie for it's entirety let just say it was and wasn't the same story. They took enough away that it wasn't the same but the characters, main plot line, and ending were pretty exact. do yourself a favor and read this book!

"espeche-g","1","1","2","18 April 2018"," Read the book? DON´T WATCH IT!!
","A total and complete disaster. I´m really disappointed.
It's my first time reviewing a movie here and I felt that I needed to vomit all my thoughts here, where I'm sure other people like me (who read the book) will in a way appreciate my words (forgive my english.... it´s not my first language so you may find some typing errors).<br/><br/>I just came out of the cinema almost crying, whining to my wife explaining all the details the movie incredible missed or absurdly changed. I waited so long for this movie and I cant believe it misses SO MANY KEY PARTS of the book!!<br/><br/>In my opinion, the best part of the original story is the character development. Wade going from 0 to slowly building his own empire. How he gets to know other characters, winning their trust, learning new skills.... Everything cooked up slowly. But in the movie, everything is thrown at the table expecting us to magically connect the dots, missing the excitement of seeing all the things Wade did to level up his character.<br/><br/>For example, all the pages dedicated to explain how Wade spent most of his time wondering alone at the school premises, reading and learning on his own, wishing having better gear, money to travel and spend time in other worlds with other cool people completing cool quests, how he managed to find the first key ALONE and all what came after that, the massive global reactions of the people seeing for the FIRST time in YEARS a NAME at the billboard, and how he kept hanging out with Aech like nothing happened despite being the worlds´t famous person on earth... lots of things that kept us hooked to the book that somehow Spielberg didnt´t felt or perhaps didn't care to have them on the book.<br/><br/>Also, I´m curious about Ernerst Cline reactions to this movie. Is he happy? sad? expected it? Or did he only care about the money? Perhaps he thought this was his one and only opportunity to have his story produced and moreover, by the Oh Mighy Lord Spielberg. Maybe he knew Spielberg wasn´t following the storyline and only cared having his book delivered on the big screen, at any cost.<br/><br/>As others people pointed in other comments, this story has to be organized in 3 movies, one for each Key. That would be awesome. Hope i'm alive to see this someday, produced by anyone who felt the same things I felt after devouring this book in less than a week."
"Grumphy","2","1","2","17 April 2018"," I guess that title makes sense because it is a film about a video game... an online video game... with billions of players... but ah nostalgia or something
","So. Apparently there are a lot of people quite unhappy about the way the book was adapted. Now, I haven't read it, so I'm willing to give it the benefit of a doubt and perhaps it might contain something resembling at least a half decent story. Be it as it may, it seems that Spielberg chose to settle with the most crass and cliched aspects and run with them. The film is littered with menial 80s references. Seems like in the 2050s time is on a standstill and nothing relevant has happened for about half a century. However, even the more numerous than the references, are the plot holes, but I'll let that slide because otherwise I'd never finish writing this. Suffice to say the film is held together by the swarm of plot holes and convenient coincidences.<br/><br/>Acting is forgettable but that's understandable. All things considered. Situations and dialogue do not lend themselves to great moments. So once again. Would mainly blame poor writing on this one, than the actors and actresses themselves.<br/><br/>Visually it's alright, I guess. Though there are a lot of questionable decisions. The future does not really seem like the future. The OASIS does not really seem like an advanced VR computer program. And the people running around in the streets, in the real life, while wearing VR headsets is straight out moronic, but the bright colours, flashing lights and empty action scenes should keep the kids in their seats, chewing their popcorn.<br/><br/>The overall film direction, moods, ""plot twists"" and characters are all just so bland, generic and manufactured, that it's tough to care about the characters and their ""problems"". It makes me question how much Spielberg really spent time on the project. Especially considering that 'The Post' came out a few months earlier. Which wasn't all that great either but should definitely have higher score on IMDb than 'Ready Player One'. At least it seems that Metacritic agrees with that as well.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that the film has nothing to offer. Nothing good anyway. It's mindless and did I mention that it's full of story breaking plot holes? But what does it matter right? There's a good guy who likes a girl and he does some action stuff and beats the evil dude because there's always the unnecessarily evil dude and in the end he gets the girl and everyone lives happily ever after and that's all what what you really want so you just don't care how badly it's all presented."
"wesluger","5","1","2","17 April 2018"," Unauthentic
","Ready Player One offers some good scenes, like the race to the first key or the Shining sequence, but the weakness of the plot and the prodigiously uninventive directing rapidly leads to boredom. We end up wondering if Steven Spielberg really is behind the camera or if he just got offered a fat check so the Nolan Sorrentos who plotted this movie could put this incredible icing on the Welovetheeighties cake they are trying to shove down our throats. I love the eighties. I grew up in them. But we are supposed to believe that the children of our children will develop a fascination bordering on fetishism for an era as remote from them as the 1940s are for us? I don't buy it. This is not a sincere film. ""A fanboy knows a hater"" as Wade would say. I don't know if the brains behind it are haters but they are clearly no fanboys."

"Breumaster","9","1","2","11 April 2018"," Get ready for some action! ;)
","When I saw the trailers, I completely underestimated the movie's relevance. This film leads you into a mix of virtual reality and reality. First I thought, this is maybe the first time I will be disappointed by a Steven Spielberg movie. But I had a feeling, that I should give it a try ... and I did. That was a very good decision. It's definitly a movie for the big screen because of many opulent pictures - there is much to see and admire. :)<br/><br/>It's the story of a VR-Mogul, who invented the ""OASIS"", a VR-world, where everything can happen. All the world joins the Oasis for mostly the whole day. But the maker is gone and want's to pass the Oasis posthume to somebody who is worthy, someone who is responsible. So the whole world starts to hunt three special easter-eggs from the owner, and solve riddles to become the new owner of the Oasis, as the main character does. There are also a few sidekicks that make the story very interesting.<br/><br/>""Ready Player One"" is a very fluent told story about the dangers of being online all the time without a raised indexfinger. This movie is all about the chances one can take and friendship, to team up with friends and covering friends. With it's 2 hours and 20 Minutes, the movie was so stuffed with action sequeces that make sense, but not only that. Over the whole movie there are hidden hints from the 70's till today, many strong pop & rock-songs from the 80's, and many allusions to earlier games and Anime-Characters. The audience is bombed by hints and things, that let us remember earlier times, when we were young. And now our kids do the same. So it's a perfect movie for modern families. :D<br/><br/>It's for fathers and mothers, who played with game-consoles when they were kids. It's for kids, who will love this version of online-world and friendship-story. So the whole family can discuss the dangers of being always online without demonizing the online world we have today. And I can say that I was perfect entertained over nearly the whole movie. So why giving it only 9/10 Stars? It has one mediocre logical error in a key-scene that catches the eye. I can't tell what it is without spoiling. If that wouldn't have happened, i would have given it the full 10 Stars. I like the message of the movie. :D"
"latnlvr-92498","10","1","2","10 April 2018"," Don't listen to the negative reviews! This movie takes you back to everything great.
","I never read the book but, I also never go in expecting the movie to be just like the book. I go in knowing full well the limitations of time and technology that goes into making a movie. Nowadays though, that has been a big blur as technology has caught up quite a lot. 
So with that in mind go see this movie and it will take you back to your first video game experience and your awe and wonder of how technology has come up in the world. From Pong to today's hyper real gaming systems. It will also take you back to the first great movie that put you at the edge of your seat waiting to see what comes next. This movie certainly put me on edge more than once. Also remember the first time ET met Elliot and you said to yourself, Aliens are cool and friendly. Or the time the DeLorean from Back to the Future first sped up to 88 MPH and you thought wow!!! how cool. Or remember the great on-line game you played and you met all kinds of cool friends from all over the world, and you actually met some of them and have been friends since then.
This movie is that and a whole lot more. This is really all new stuff with a bunch of old stuff mixed into one. The references are too numerous to mention or count but you will have a blast each time you recognize one of them.
Go see this movie for the pure fun of it. The pure enjoyment you will get from seeing all your favorite movie and game references. Go see it with lots of friends or family because you will be talking about it for a long time to come. I predict this movie will make the top 10 all time movie greats! but, if not I don't care because it will be engraved in my memory as one of them."

"james-pavlick","2","1","2","9 April 2018"," God awful
","This movie was terrible. I learned long ago that movies often have to make sacrifices in interest of time and continuity when adapting source material. I understand that you can't fit everything from a book into a movie. So long as the overall material value and integrity is maintained, I'm willing to let the little things slide, I.e. the Harry Potter series or the Great Gatsby. And then there are the abominations. Movies so poorly adapted it's like they looked at the book (or game) cover and came up with their own movie. Starship Troopers and Super Mario Bros come to mind. This movie falls squarely in the latter category. It is the quintessential horrible movie adaptation of all time. Zak Penn should be tarred and feathered before being thrown out of Hollywood. Spielberg, who I thought could do no wrong until this movie, has clearly lost his magical touch. Too many indie movies? Too much money? Whatever the case, he's become fat and lazy and complacent with his accomplishments. The only thing that this movie got right were the names of its characters. There is no direction in this movie, just special effects. Just an inundation of a steaming pile of garbage masquerading as a cohesive movie. The actors are not at fault this time around, a rarity. They worked with what they had."
"thomaseodea","2","1","2","8 April 2018"," Terrible
","This movie is terrible. I've never written an IMDb review before, but I honestly felt it was necessary to say my bit in this case, because somehow this movie has gotten some very high ratings.<br/><br/>To start off, the world this exists in is unrealistically and boringly constructed. It's supposedly set in 2047, Columbus, a city which has become the most populous in the world because it was where the Oasis game was created. This is a nice idea, but the entire point of the game is that players don't need to be near to each other, I don't see why they would move to overcrowded, expensive, uncomfortable Columbus just for this.
The introduction given to this world is not at all well-done either - the main character flat-out narrates the way the world is, and yet still manages to explain a lot of useless things, and simultaneously glossing over some important details.<br/><br/>Very early in the movie, the main character's aunt dies in a supposedly sad and dramatic scene - this is impressively underwhelming. The aunt had only a few minutes of screen time at that point, and no background given. She wasn't even a particularly protaganistic character. This underwhelming death was made even more difficult to care about by the main character's reaction - after a short amount of time, he seemed to have forgotten about it.<br/><br/>This is just one of many examples of very poor character development - the main character's relationship with Artemis is forcibly crammed into a few very short and uninformative scenes, until a point where we're supposed to feel empathy for them as a couple. Their attempt to do this quickly and professionally fails, completely.<br/><br/>Some parts and details of the story are completely inconsistent or illogical - generally I'll let these things slide in stories, since it's not really the point of the story, but they were so bad here I felt they needed a mention in this review. There are too many to list, but since this is a Spoilers review, I think anybody reading it will already know what I mean.<br/><br/>The ultimate morals and themes behind the story were slightly more reasonable, but still somewhat lacking. The end of the movie quickly shoved in the way in which reality will always have a certain charm over simulated reality, but this was never really proven throughout the movie - all of the protagonists met in a simulated reality, and their battle against corporate control was fought there.
The movie also showcased an example of excessive corporate control which can come about from a brainwashed public, which was reasonably well fit in, but was not made a particularly central part of the movie.<br/><br/>On the flipside of things, there are some nice subtleties in the movie that possibly deserve a mention. It includes countless references and Easter eggs to other parts of pop culture, but also subtleties with character's clothing, wording, and other similar things. Unfortunately, these are difficult to spot, shrouded by the mess of bad CGI and plot.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie itself could be worse, but it's very predictable.<br/><br/>Finally: the CGI and cinematography. For some reason which still confuses me, the parts of this movie set and filmed in the real world still looked unbelievably fake and awful, which only contributed to the unrealistic setting and characters. I have no idea how to describe it any more than that: it just didn't look like reality.
The cinematography was neither notably good nor bad.<br/><br/>I was only able to break my way through this movie watching it with a group of friends, laughing at the ridiculous plot pacing and story. I would almost recommend it for the hilarity of the flaws, but it is definitely not worth watching alone or in cinemas."
"davphv","4","1","2","8 April 2018"," Special Effects overload
","Definitely a movie for the MMP crowd. Very soft on plot but heavy on special effects. Not for anyone over age of 40 unless into MMP. It's like a spy movie, star wars, transformers, TRON all spliced togther. Many references to Apple Jobs/Wozniak and old video games, and you live almost the whole movie inside OASIS. It little more background in the real world would be appreciated. It looks like the world is overpopulated and poor. I'm sure the book did a better job on background, since the movie is 80% special effects, 10% plot, and 10% fantasy. The hero is a orphaned nerd. The heroine is pretty and inexplicably living on her own with no visible means of support. Don't the players have to pay for using OASIS? Nobody works, nobody eats, nobody sleeps.

Lots of visual goodies, but no story at all. For me Ready player one is about friendship and loyalty, even though being physical apart. We saw this created in ""Super 8"". The book also invites the reader, to take part in the puzzle solving mystery of the ""egg"". This part is not even in the movie, and the puzzles are not even the same - not even close. Driving backwards in you car, is not on the same level as, competing with a Lich from the D&D environment, and on an 80's arkadegame. <br/><br/>I admit that I lived in the 80's, and played on the arkadegames myself.

","I would keep kids away from this movie because...<br/><br/>To pay to see this movie is like paying to see a kid play a video game...<br/><br/>Gender bender theory theme thrown about (albeit subtle) as players can assume a different Avatar sex personality and thus provides the Utopia environment for falling in love with the 'real' you... not the 'projected' you, given that everyone knows that Avatars are not necessarily the sex of the 'unknown' user... Liberal-progressive-utopia.<br/><br/>Lesbian reference... The 'black' girl of the movie is indirectly declared lesbian, as she doesn't say no to the 'naked Shinning lady', but 'goes with it'... however her Avatar happens to be a mean, masculine, tough-looking dude... Denial is in vogue?<br/><br/>The movie kind of makes the point that 'reality' is better than V.R. fantasy...
However they settle for preaching that 2 days of reality a week is a healthy or positive habit???<br/><br/>The good points of the movie are...
Lots of reference to 80s-90s movies and games... if you grew up on those years or know about the history of the video games, you may enjoy to think back about them video games (Atari, Coleco, Adams, Commodore, etc.) Also makes reference to a few old movies... nothing major... action scenes are ok... nothing breathtaking... it may pass as an action movie...not a blockbuster...<br/><br/>Overall I was disappointed, I was expecting a Spielberg 'mind-blowing' experience, instead we get a preachy, gender-bender positive reinforcement, liberal utopia preaching movie... barf!!!!!"
"ryanroberts800","4","1","2","5 April 2018"," Not the book
","If you loved the book, don't expect much from the movie. Most of the essence of the book is lost in the film. The story is supposed to be about this great mystery, a labyrinth of clues and research leading to the discovery of the three gates and ultimately the egg. The movie, instead, uses 30 minutes of voice over to painfully tell us exactly what's happening and what will happen. There is little to no character development, key plot points are either changed or missing completely, and characters who were prominent in the book are left out of the film. The first gate is changed, which I don't have a huge problem with. The problem I do have, however, is the fact that everyone knows you have to win the race to get the key. This ruins the spirit of the competition, no one is supposed to know what needs to be done to get the first key, it's a giant mystery, that's the point!<br/><br/> Scenes at Ogg's were left out, Wade is not inprisoned in a loyalty center only to escape by hacking the computers, there are really no scenes in the basement where they work out the clues, there are no spaceships, and on and on. The biggest injustice was the way in which Wade gets the extra life, which is by beating Hallidays high score on Pac-Man, on the game that was originally in a Pizza shop from Halliday's youth. Instead, he's just flipped a quarter simply by watching an old clip of Halliday.<br/><br/>Again, don't expect much if you're a true book lover. It was a fun movie, but ultimately a disappointment."

The characters are one dimensional and make huge leaps that the audience has to contend with.

"LloydBayer","7","3","12","28 March 2018"," Ready Player One lacks a solid story but excels as pure escapism at the movies.
","Breaking the post Oscars lull is Spielberg's Ready Player One, a Sci-fi action-adventure throwback to not only the golden 80s of cinema, but also popular video games and music of that era. In fact, there are so many references in rapid succession that if you blink, you'd miss a few. That's not saying the film is perfect. For a project assembled with layer after layer of pop culture references, including the movie magic of Spielberg's yesteryears, Ready Player One lacks a solid story. Also, what should be a thoroughly nostalgic experience at the cinema is overladen with visual effects just because the studio (own Amblin Entertainment) can afford it.<br/><br/>Still reading? Good, because despite some blaring faults, the film is still watchable thanks to a few terrific moments that hold everything together. Now imagine stepping into a virtual world where you can be whoever you want to be. Thanks to our current and rising addiction to social media forums, the film predicts that by 2045 much of humanity will live in isolation but connected through virtual reality. Called the OASIS and linked in via VR headsets, anyone can do pretty much what they want, and accordingly reap benefits or face the consequences. Staying alive and rising to the top of the leaderboards often require expensive power-ups and upgrades in both the OASIS and the real world. Which is where we meet Wade Watts, the underprivileged teen protagonist who dreams of winning the ultimate prize - a glowing Easter egg that comes with immense fame and fortune in both worlds. But getting there is the ultimate challenge, especially when Wade has to compete with villainous corporations in addition to the A-Team, King Kong, T-Rex, Freddy Krueger and Lara Croft to name just a few. 
 
With the Easter break round the corner, Ready Player One is perfectly placed as an understated pun in itself. But in blaring its trumpet, the film tries to be the mother goose of golden Easter eggs with references to several cinematic 'events', the pinnacle of which is a fantastic tribute to a classic horror film. It's gets heavy handed from there, and because we are looking at photorealistic CGI characters, the film turns out to be more animation (albeit in ultra-high definition) than live action. While that's not such a bad thing, watching this for nearly the entire length of the film can get rather tedious. The teen romance that begins to take shape midway doesn't help either and neither is it required.<br/><br/>Yet among all the frantic action and chaos, Ready Player One has a nuanced message about the disintegration of society and everything that's joyful about real human feelings. As Mark Rylance's James Halliday, founder of the OASIS puts it, ""As painful as reality is, it's the only place you'll get a good meal"". That's an insignificant line in the film if you don't stop and understand what it means. Ponder a bit and it's clear that we wouldn't need any form of escapism if we were all living in a perfect world. But reality bites. We know it and that's why we invented escapism. The movies have always been an escape, and despite the lack of any relatable character, the film more than makes up with social commentary that stings. The fact that the film is set in the future but made to look like the past only cements the notion that while the future is blank, the past has many fond memories we can always escape to. Without really trying hard, that's all this film tries to be. And who better than fanboy number-one to take us back, to the future."

"jimmycoffin-751-212853","5","2","7","20 June 2018"," Read This Review
","I had alot of trouble just getting 3-4 minutes In to the movie.
I gave It one more chance recently and finally watched It through just because I,m such a sucker for the 80s, and for Steven Spielbergs classics.
What We have here at first glimpse Is an overload of bad CGI. It's sad to watch really.. Once upon a time One of the greatest Directors of our time. spellbinding us with down to earth wonderful storytelling with supernatural scifi elements that everyone today concider among the greatest movies of all time.. and back In the 80s, It was all practical effects! That's why His movies Still looks awesome today!, Not this tragedy that Is on display for two hours In Ready player one.. The concept of this movie thinks it comes away with.. Is the actual concern.
A movie that disguises Itself as a videogame, Therefore It doesn't matters How much CGI they put in there, But It does!.. It really does.. To the point that old fans will be very disappointed at Spielbergs approach to the genre that He once created. Can't the man himself figure out why the new Indy flopped? A reviewer here wrote ""Relies heavily on empty nostalgia and pop-culture references but lacks engagement and a solid story of its own"", That's exactly what This Is. And It's sad when todays movies feel so empty and cheap and then our fav directors following the same pattern that makes us hate movies.. Like Black Panther, all marvel crap, Disney tearing Star Wars apart til there Is nothing left etc.. All this destruction of Film as an artform Is actually pretty scary. When was the last time Ive watched a really really good blockbuster?? That would be Nolan's Batman.
I could watch Ready Player through tough.. I,m getting numb with this kind of lazy filmmaking that You allready knows what youre in for. It comes as no suprise all movies will look like Avengers. That's the goal of every big movie. SO that makes every movie today voiceless.. without identity really..
crisp and clean Is what sells abviously.. and That's pretty scary too.
Many Cgi artists concider themselves real artists.. colouring everything on their computer..ofcourse everything will look pitch perfect, and sure, it fits well with scifi, just not all scifis. But that's the problem.. no matter how many cgi artists I look at It comes down to one thing. they share a identity. and that's identity Is the same programs they draw on . the same colour palette. Poster, lightning, symmetry perfect. and that's the problem with all of todays movies. they start to look like siblings. Siblings In a computer world where there really Is no original. The original image Is inside a computer. Ofcourse I can appriciate digital artists to, Ofcourse it looks clean and badass. 
But when everything and every movie does the same.. well. then you know it gets stale and tiresome pretty fast. It's like putting a lense over your favorite artists. make it more shiny.
I'm glad that Spielberg felt nostalgic and made the movie.. It would just be so so much better If he created It like in the old days.. then the 80s flirtation actually had worked too. who cares If It doesn't sell well just because the kids want to see more more more CGI without any plot??
Ready player one would have come to be appriciated as a cult movie, loved by his old fans and find alot of new fans when they grow up from their Hulk smash Thor In unrealistic CGI.
A movie with this concept, done right would have had a helluva long shell life. If Spielberg had kicked out every single cgi effect maker and just made It real. every single effect. Just like In the good ol 80s days.
They could have dumped King Kong, Iron Giant, Trex and all that nonsense And just went all In creating the Gundamn And mechagodzilla fight real.
Keeping the race without the eccess of throwing every silly thing there Is.
The less the more impact when It actually are action scenes of this ridiculous magnitute. Everyone knows that."

Regardless of how true the movie stayed to the book, Ernest Cline had a hand in the screenplay. Remember that.

"rgkarim","9","2","7","30 March 2018"," Ready For Action, Visuals, and Nostalgia
","Robbie K back with another review and tonight it is on movie I have been looking forward to for a very long time. The latest book gone pop culture, tonight's film is all about the references (and merchandising) as the world seeks out an adequate video game movie to come to life. So, let's get started with a slight alteration to the style, as I review:<br/><br/>Title: Ready Player One
Director: Steven Spielberg
Writer: Zak Penn
Original Author: Ernest Cline
Starring: Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn <br/><br/>
LIKES:<br/><br/>Acting: Let's get this like out of the way (as most won't care). The cast of this highly CGI world is on point in regards to making their characters come to life. Sheridan in particular does a lot of the heavy lifting, balancing the geek, leader, and vulnerable roles all into a nice admirable package. Cooke has the edgy, heroic nature down, a virtual Wonder Woman who combines brain and skills to deliver the sassy goods to the group. These two have wonderful chemistry together, two leaders who incite a rebellion of imagination, accomplishing it with grace that many young actors fail to deliver. Ben Mendelsohn makes a good villain as well, a corporate wannabe who has only the eyes for cash and lacks the brains to go with the brash. <br/><br/>World Creating/Visuals: No surprise here, Spielberg's team invested a lot of time bringing the world to life. Ready Player One's visuals are stunning, taking the imagination of Cline's book and making it pop to life on screen. The various planets all have dynamic visuals to bring each one to life, with exciting, pristine villas grounded by the rugged battlefields of volcanoes. The real world of a future dystopian society is nicely created with their settings and with direction meshes well with our heroes' journey through the cyberspace. And as for the characters themselves, the team managed to recreate the various pop culture references in fantastic design but adding its own twist to correlate with the movie. The heroes have that video game feel, immersing you further into the virtual reality setting as if you were part of the rebellion. <br/><br/>The Action: The trailers promised action, and by George did it deliver... on most of the movie. Ready Player One starts strong with some action-packed sequences where racing and FPS/Third Person battles reign supreme. The theater shakes with the intensity and brings a promise that the rest of the movie is going to be just as fun. The rest of the sequences semi-deliver on this promise, primarily the final battle that has some incredible parts. Nonetheless, Spielberg's department did a bang-up job bringing the rush that video games bring, primarily the selling point for seeing it in the theater. <br/><br/>The Nostalgia/Reference Hunting: However, the biggest selling point for me was the thrill of hunting down all the cultural Easter eggs/icons that they paid a fortune to portray. My eyes were busy seeking everything crammed in this movie, trying to see which 80's icons made the cut. While 80% are video game references, you'll find various movie, television, and song references shading the oasis, most cleverly brought in to bring life to the scenes in a meaningful way. I'll admit, the replay value of this movie comes in trying to track down everything hidden, like the Easter egg prize they are all seeking. The key demographic of this movie is going to be the fans, nerds, and gamers, as their eager eyes will enjoy seeing their favorites come together to battle the corrupt evil at hand. <br/><br/>
DISLIKES: <br/><br/>The Lack of Challenge: Let's get this settled, the movie is not the book, and to be fair a movie about the actions of the book might have been duller to the general audience. However, the movie could have taken a page for challenging puzzles and cultural integration, because it didn't quite execute this component as well. Most of the quests for the key were diluted compared to brainteasing nightmares of the novel, that could have involved more research and diving than what we got. In addition, some of the solutions were a little more like backdoor cheats than true solutions to the impasses at hand. <br/><br/>Character Development: I agree again with my fellow reviewers that the character development suffered a bit as well. Parzival and Art3mis get some decent backstories and growth, but the other characters are sort of thrown into the movie like hamburgers on a flat top. They have those moments that sizzle, only to quickly become fully cooked and dropped back into the background. Even worse, the legendary skills that were boasted in the book/movie are not really delivered for our supporting cast, such a shame really. Not the worst character use, but also not what I had expected. <br/><br/>More Action: Surprise, surprise, Robbie wants more action. Ready Player One's scenes are incredible at times, almost as if we have visors on our heads and living the game. The problem for me is... they were too short at times and didn't feel complete for me. I didn't feel this too much until near the middle of the movie when the film hit a slow snag and could have used one or two battles to liven it up. However, the biggest thing I wanted, was seeing the millions of dollars of references used more than the fleeting glances we got. The moves done were cool but watching Parzival and crew work together with the iconic game crew rather than background noise would have been nice. <br/><br/>I-ROk: This character wasn't utilized much in the book, so seeing him mentioned in the credits was a surprise. Sadly, they didn't do much with this character, to the point where he was almost not needed. The gaming community knows about epic hunters, villains, and rogues, but this movie failed to deliver on those grounds, instead getting a sarcastic flop. While the main villain was expected to be a rather incompetent jerk, his prized mercenary should have had a little more bite to back things up. Perhaps then the epic climax might have worked a little better, well that and maybe foregoing the van chase at the end... that wasn't needed as much. <br/><br/>The VERDICT: <br/><br/> Ready Player One the movie is not the book, and the purists who want that book to real life are going to be disappointed with the changes that were made to liven it up. However, Spielberg's take on the film works in regards to action, visuals, and giving us the ultimate finder book of geek references. While the story needed some more wit and character development, the main tweaks needed to be using more of their merchandizing, more of their characters, and pushing their villains to be more. Had these elements been more explored, it would have given this movie more of the finesse it was looking for. Still, this adventure deserves a theater run given the special effects. <br/><br/>My scores are: <br/><br/>Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.5"

","First off, the animation is ASTOUNDING. The aniamted sequences were the best thign about this movie. Every time we went back to the ""real world"" it was boring and slow burning. I saw this in a theatre full of people and every time TJ Miller's character made a ""joke"" or refrence to somethign (tootsie pop commerical) next to no one laughed.

"gavinp9","7","2","7","29 March 2018"," Fun, but missing a bit of heart
","'Ready Player One' is based on the 2011 book by Ernest Cline (he co-writes the screenplay here), and as with all novel-to-film adaptions, the movie's not quite as good. Ironically, it feels like there's more action in the book! That being said, this is still a Spielberg sci-fi epic, with plenty to see and experience. It's a conglomeration of 'The Matrix' and 'Avatar', with people in 2045 essentially living their lives in a virtual reality world (the ""Oasis""), created by Halliday (Rylance) & Morrow (Pegg).<br/><br/>Wade (Sheridan) is the unlikely hero, trying to win the 'game', which is a mix of 80s/90s video games and other TV/film references/characters - you could spend the whole movie glimpsing/placing cool things: 'Back To The Future', Gundam, Halo, Ninja Turtles, Iron Giant, Tron, etc. This is fun, but often makes it feel like quantity over quality. Has some good songs, but I would've liked more. Helping Wade against the evil Sixers/IOI, led by Sorrento (Mendelsohn) is Artemis (Cooke) and Aech (Waithe) - with Sho (Zhao) and Daito (Morisaki) thrown in near the end for good measure. There's not much character development and it's hard to care too much when they spend most of their time as cartoonish avatars in the Oasis.<br/><br/>Plenty can be inferred from this bleak future, where everyone is disconnected from reality and humanity, instead spending all their time online - pros and cons both ways. The ending is satisfactory, but I feel like we needed more time in the real world, especially with the secondary characters, especially Pegg and TJ Miller. It does differ from the book in a few areas, but it is great to see a lot of it realised on the big screen - the battle at the end is quite spectacular and the car races suitably chaotic. It's good, without being exceptional."

","Let's start with the bottom line: This is the most enjoyable Spielberg movie in the past 15 years. Notice I wrote ""enjoyable"" and not ""best"". It's still a kids movie - the plot is simple (it's about literally looking for a MacGuffin - an Easter egg), stuff is spelled out, spoon fed to the audience and repeated twice (even the secret of the 3rd challenge is revealed twice!), so don't expect anything smart. However, it's visually stunning and I regret watching it in 2D because it seems to be the only movie since ""Avatar"" to be worth watching in 3D. Sound is also impressive.<br/><br/>There are tons of pop culture references and for us 80's kids, this is a delight. I bet the kids watching this will miss many of those references but for us they are obvious and straight in the face. And there's one big gem in the middle of the movie which I won't spoil, so I'll just say that Kubrick fans will have a blast - I don't know if it's part of the original book but i'm quite certain it was a treat for Spielberg to handle.<br/><br/>With references to movies, songs and games appearing almost every two minutes, I have no idea how they could have afford it - I know it's a blockbuster movie but still, the royalties were probably huge (unless the studio owns the rights).<br/><br/>The music was an obvious Alan Silvestri work. I thought perhaps it was John Williams trying to imitate Silvestri because it's a Spielberg movie and there were so many 80's references, but checking the credits, it's really him.<br/><br/>Mark Rylance was brilliant as Halliday and I honestly didn't recognize him until checking the IMDB credits now. I also didn't recognize Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>Aech's voice was terribly miscast (but there's a reason for that, revealed later).<br/><br/>All in all, it's a fun movie. If you're an 80's kid and if you liked ""Avatar"" and/or ""Wreck it Ralph"", you'll enjoy this film."

"jdesando","Null","2","8","28 March 2018"," Spielberg makes an exciting call home again.
","Steven Spielberg's world has always been virtual realities of adventure and nostalgia, from King Kong and T Rex toIndiana Jones and ET to Close Encounters. Once again in Ready Player One he goes adventure- fantastical into the gamers' world of the virtual where a hunt for an egg can be Easter's annual hunt or a serious search for happiness among goggles and graft. This film is solid Spielberg, not great Spielberg but with enough pop-cult allusions to please even the most fervid geek.<br/><br/>Young Parzival (Tye Sheridan) is the likeliest gamer to discover the three keys that will win the Easter egg and the vast Oasis empire, which has enslaved the world to games, and my Columbus, Ohio, in 2045. More like ""mesmerized"" because the world of trash and piled-high trailers or ""stacks"" is what the virtual gamers like him are hoping to escape. <br/><br/>No need for me, at least, to see how our civilization, and my precious city, is in danger of enslavement by smart phones. Just look anywhere in public to see the absorption technology engenders to the exclusion of old-fashioned socializing.<br/><br/>Recently I was a visiting professor at a high-end college classroom. As I walked in 10 minutes before class, every one of the 13 students was on a smart phone. Very depressing image about a time I used to cherish as an undergrad to gossip and schmooze face to face.<br/><br/>It's not difficult to figure out Spielberg's game of warning us all about our consuming games and more universally, smart phones. Yet that acclaimed director keeps his childlike fascination with the complexities of family and love, as Tye, like us, finds there's no place like the home and love, the latter the most real place on earth. Although the film misses the intimacy and poetry of his greatest hits, it provides enough adventure and sentiment to please the general public.<br/><br/>Great director Spielberg can dazzle with graphics lovely to behold and still juxtapose those fantasies with real world shenanigans, bad guys and all. You'll want to find a zero-gravity dance hall right after the movie; Spielbergean sentiment will have you do it with your best love, not some virtual fantasy."

"fredlondi","1","3","16","11 April 2018"," The bleakest depiction of the future since ""Idiocracy"" **SPOILERS**
","Let me say this - I hate video games. I hate them with a passion. I feel that they've made people so creatively bankrupt that the only art they can think to make are drawings of video game characters, and the only videos they can make are themselves reacting to video games. Video games of today are trying to be movies - and vice-versa - and Ernest Cline's novel showed that books are following suit. <br/><br/>So, when I heard about this film, I wasn't excited to see it. But I was hoping to be proven wrong, as poorly-promoted films like ""District 9"" did in the past. But, right from the start, the film proved to be a chore to sit through. <br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes were some of the most visually and mentally exhausting moments I've seen in a movie. You are bombarded with a metric ton of exposition, then a rush through all the ""worlds"" of the OASIS with barely enough time to take it all in, then thrust into a race where entirely too much stuff is going on. Wrecking balls swinging, King Kong smashing, cars flipping and wrecking everywhere. <br/><br/>The race sequence sounds awesome until you realize the film made two grievous errors. First, for being an escape from a drab and depressing dystopia, the colors used in the OASIS are equally bland and blurry, everything cast through a blue filter. Something more cartoonish with brighter colors would've been a better approach to further distinguish the virtual world of the OASIS from the real world. This leads to the second problem - because the OASIS is depicted in such a drab color scheme, it's very difficult to pick out any of the ""easter eggs"" everyone's talking about. I saw this film in IMAX 3-D, and at any one moment - even with thousands of digital creatures on screen - I couldn't see more than four objects at a time. And, more often than not, you don't see things long enough for you to even recognize them.<br/><br/>What no one will admit, and die-hard fans of the book will surely deny, is that ""Ready Player One"" is basically a rehash of maligned ""The Emoji Movie."" It's an attempt to portray an invasive technology as fun while completely ignoring the real societal harm it's done. Sure, we see how crappy futuristic Columbus, Ohio looks, but there's no awareness of cause-and-effect, that the existence of the OASIS was itself responsible. It's blamed on some nebulous global cataclysm like the equally-awful ""Maze Runner"" films. Even one of the villains is actually played by T.J. Miller, the main character from ""The Emoji Movie.""<br/><br/>Near the end of the film - which runs about an hour too long - the film's internal logic starts to crumble, making you ask questions like---<br/><br/>When a bad guy plugged into the OASIS is just about to complete the Atari 2600 game that unlocks the final key, why does the hero girl in the same room plug herself into the game instead of walking the ten feet up to him to stop him? <br/><br/>When the main character is trying to virtually stick the key in the final lock, all the while trying to keep his balance in a truck driving through the real world, why isn't anyone else standing around in the truck trying to help steady him?<br/><br/>And when the main character finally prevails, why are all the minions researching pop culture for the bad guy celebrating? Didn't that moment mean they'd failed?<br/><br/>Also, let's face it - if a virtual reality video game system became this prolific, there's no way we'd all look like movie stars. Yes, I get no one would pay to see that, but if you think you can spend nearly every hour of the day playing video games and look like Tye Sheridan, you're kidding yourself.<br/><br/>On top of all this, the film is just depressing. It's completely ignorant of the emotional weight of its own premise. The defeatist attitude of the main character saying ""There's nowhere left to go. Nowhere but the OASIS"" is itself shocking. To think that any generation would be so jaded to think that the rest of the world isn't worth exploring just because others have is just sad. It made me think there are people out there like that already, fat and unhappy as they spend hours on end playing video games and ignoring the outside world. To this film's credit, there is a brief moment where the main character's uncle is shown having wasted the rent money on the game, but this doesn't make the main character reflect on his own choices. And, minutes later, both his uncle and aunt are killed, aborting any satisfying resolution.<br/><br/>The film also took a dismissive attitude toward depression itself. The film makes light of suicide, showing a person so distraught over losing his credits in the game that he attempts to throw himself out a window. The plot is also driven by the depression of Mark Rylance's character as Halliday, the co-creator of the OASIS. Each one of his clues left to the gamers was a clear cry for help, pointing to his mistakes and regrets in life. But, again, there's no reflection on the part of any of the characters, no realization that they, too, could be like Halliday in the future, and perhaps want to change their ways in a ""Christmas Carol"" kind of way. Nope - it's just on to the next ridiculous action scene.<br/><br/>Finally, it was depressing from a cultural standpoint. I found it strange that in 2045 people would not only be obsessing over nostalgic pop culture, but exclusively pop culture from the 1970s and 1980s. It made me truly wonder about the permanence of anything created from the 1990s onward, particularly today, when trends seem to rise and fall quicker than ever. I think the film could've helped itself by having the bad guy be the one focused on older pop culture from the '70s and '80s while the heroes reference things from today. It wouldn't have fixed all the film's problems, but it would've been a start. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Ready Player One"" painted the bleakest picture of the future in any film since ""Idiocracy."" The visuals and the world of the game (what surprisingly little of it we actually see) is little more than the peeling paint job covering a stark reality. Even the resolution to close the OASIS two days a week couldn't get me out of the depressed feeling I had walking out of the theater. This isn't simply a matter of a film not being for me - it was a genuinely shocking realization of what the world is for some people. <br/><br/>The OASIS is fast becoming a reality in our world, and we should take this work as a cautionary tale."
"LogicIsEverything","Null","2","9","3 January 2019"," So messy and boring, very disappointed.
","This is by far the messiest half and half human actors animated with cartoon characters film, so messy like a nightmare. What we got in this movie are randomly assembled figures, characters, scenes and settings from many many sci-fi and animation cartoon movies. It's like a cook who's gone crazy so he put all the overnight leftover with some newly cooked food and throws them into a big wok and pot, mixed them together without thinking. So when you eat the mixture, you just don't know what's what but you can see so clearly that most of the stuff scooped on your plate are things you've already disposed long time ago.<br/><br/>This is a very hollow and childish film that might be only good for the teenagers or those who refuse to grow up or still live with their parents even they are already 30 or 40 years old. This is also the busiest film I've ever seen, but it's so hollow, so pointless, so formulaic and cliche'd, with poorly executed quite uninteresting scenarios and storyline. You just felt numb after it ended, you felt nothing, like a bystander watching a clueless farce."

","I was going to headline this review as ""Avatar as envisioned by Steven Spielberg"" but that would be unfair. By now everyone knows that it's a movie based on a very dear novel by Ernest Cline. But I don't need to read the book to realize this movie left the book's lovers disappointed. Characters weren't as fleshed out as they were probably supposed to be, and there's too many movie clichÃ©s that are supposed to be homages.
Well not every movie by Spielberg has to be a ""Schindler's List"", but this definitely fell under ""Minority Report"" category, as the fast pace wouldn't give enough time to develop characters -- or develop our care for them. Since most of the action is animated it really felt like Avatar, except with a freakton of more product placement (even more than Minority Report, damn).
What I haven't seen mentioned yet is something that irked me: Alan Silvestri just recycled many of his soundtrack motifs for this movie. Again i don't know if this was intended as homage, but I thought it was too corny.
Nonetheless, damn if I didn't feel giddy as a little boy when i saw that Holy Hand Grenade being activated. This movie is a rollercoaster where the visuals are more than the plot, and it begs to be rode again and again."

"cadillac20","8","2","9","26 March 2018"," Great, nerdy fun in a great adventurous package
","I'm not going to lie, I may be a little biased here. I'm both a huge Spielberg fan and a huge fan of 80's retro, not to mention a massive nerd. So, this movie, as well as the book, were for me through and through. If you're not any of these things, you probably won't understand the love for this property, and if you're only one or two of these things, you probably won't like the property as much. But for me, this was the most fun with a film I've had this year and may have all year long.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar, Ready Player One is the geekiest of geek stories about a virtual world called the Oasis where the world spends much of it's time doing pretty much whatever they want. It's created has just died and he's left for the users of the Oasis an easter egg, hidden in the game, that when found will give them control over the Oasis as well as enough money to make them rich for life. After this egg is Wade Watts, aka Parzeval, and several of his friends, while the dastardly corporation IOI, led by evil corporate overlord Sorrento, try to get it to monetize the entire thing.<br/><br/>The book this is based on was never an amazing classic in the way some speak about it. The story elements of it felt very fanfictiony and rote. Typical nerdy protagonist whose a regular, losery guy in real life is an amazeballs dude in the Oasis who becomes the hero, gets the girl, blah, blah, blah. The movie isn't too different.The cast is all fairly good in their roles, though most of them feel very plain and relatively dull as characters. Tye Sheridan, who is an excellent actor, makes for a decent, if unremarkably white bread, lead. Olivia Cooke is the badass vixen and love interest, also very typical, but also with great presence and chemistry with Tye. Stealing every scene they're in is Lena Waithe as Aech whose both funny and badass. Opposite them is Ben Mendelson as very typical corporate baddie Sorrento and the usually funny TJ Miller voicing digital mercenary I-R0k, who is in fact funny here. Mark Rylance shows up in flashbacks as, what amounts to, the most emotionally meaty role with Oasis creator Halliday. For arguments sake, you could say that he is the lead character and that the real journey is his, with the characters all being just the witnesses to his story.<br/><br/>As you may be able to tell, there's a lot here that's fairly typical and cliche. That was true of the book too. But that's not really why people are here. It's not why people loved the book. And it is here that the movie actually excels in quality. Spielberg has crafted one of his best adventures in years and hasn't made something this fun in a long time. Though fans of the book may balk at the many, many changes made by Spielberg and novel-author-and-script-co-writer Ernest Cline, it's for the best as many of the events from the book wouldn't work as well on a visual level. And the movie looks absolutely amazing. The Oasis and it's avatars are a spectacle to behold and the action is fantastic. Other scenes, like one taking place in a very familiar and famous movie location, are fun, creative twists. While the real world scenes don't work quite as well, they still hold up with Spielberg's typically great attention to detail and world building.<br/><br/>Some of these scenes, in particular an early race and the climactic battle, are worth the price alone. And the geeky references, not just to 80's pop culture, but geek pop culture in general, come like shots from a video game weapon. The audience I saw this with had a blast and would giggle with glee every time something familiar and awesomely nerdy would show up on screen. There are moments that nerds everywhere may not know they needed to see that show up and it's truly a sight to behold. Some people may not be able to appreciate a film as pure spectacle, and they are certainly entitled to that opinion, but for the rest of us, the man who invented the summer blockbuster returns with another winner yet again. This is a love letter to geek culture and wins based almost purely on being a fantastic ride.<br/><br/>Ready Player One takes the blockbuster filmmaking bible to heart and delivers in spades on fun spectacle. I imagine Spielberg had a ton of fun with this and they could not have found a better director, someone who knows exactly what this film needed to succeed. It certainly won me over put my fears to rest as to whether it would be a good film or not. It won't be for everyone, but for anyone looking to just have a good time with the film, you can be rest assured too. This one's a winner."

"Peeb_Alex","3","1","3","9 March 2020"," Too unreal to be entertaining
","The thing about movies (even science fiction) is that they need to have some level of believability to them to keep them relatable. This is what makes horror movies scary, super hero movies exciting and heartwarming, action movies entertaining, etc. Ready Player One doesn't have that level of realism. I could never see the events that happen in the movie play out in reality and I don't see anyone ever making some of the choices that the characters make. It's a Sci fi movie that lost it's Sci. You can write a movie about anything but that doesn't mean you should. I could write a movie about a ghost that becomes friends with a sentient sofa and they teach baseball to a family of dolphins in space, but it would suck. That is Ready Player One."
"parrot007","6","1","3","1 December 2019"," Wanted to like it....
","Ready Player One plays things extremely safe. While I haven't read the book, I get the feeling some of the artistic elements were lost in it's translation to a modern era film. What I mean by that is that it takes away your ability to be imaginative when everything is shown visually. It has some fun action and effects, but is totally unoriginal. Furthermore, it has A LOT of pop culture references that people seem to like, but none of them have any purpose and to me, they take away from it's identity.
The story is simple and entertaining enough, though it doesn't have some plot holes and non sensical moments. Characters are pretty two demensional and writing is a little flat.
Overall it's an average movie, but there's another thing:<br/><br/>*this is a rant*
I want to talk about the message at the end of this movie; it just annoys me and feels out of touch. When you say ""reality is the only thing thats real"", what exactly do you mean?? When you say that, you raise the question, ""what is real?"". Most of this movie takes place inside the Oasis. Are the lessons these characters learned and the things they acomplished and the relationships they formed ""not real"" then?! If you say yes, then then thats pretty dumb because all you're left with is the message ""don't spend your whole life playing video games"" which is hilariously ironic. You're telling me the guy who invents a whole virtual world because he seems slightly autistic and dose'nt fit in socially says that that experience isn't real, wtfðŸ˜‚!? What are they trying to say? .
Let me tell you my opinion: Virtual/gaming experiences CAN absolutely be real. My definition of ""real"" experience is one of genuine substance and growth. The right types of games and other media absolutely do grow us as people. It doesn't matter if they didn't occur in the physical world. We could have learned things, felt emotion, or in the case of online gaming, met people, worked together, learned to negotiate, coordinate, stratigise. How is that not real? If you think I'm over interpreting this message, but what else does can it mean?
*end rant<br/><br/>This movie could have done a lot more with its setting, but it chose to be average and draw the widest appeal possible, yet sunnenly becoming rather pretentious by the end."

","Ready Player One is the return of Spielberg with his work as director, and does not disappoint with his new delivery. A quite entertaining film with moments dedicated especially to pop culture, especially gamer culture, I think that many characters, especially young people, will especially enjoy this work for its enormous amount of direct and indirect references to this genre.<br/><br/>The movie is designed to entertain pleasantly, it achieves it with its fantastic special effects, incredible sound design and special soundtrack to activate that nostalgic sensation. With a simple story and a premise without over-complications, the film does not fall into a large number of holes or over-saturation, does a good job presenting itself as it is. A tribute to the world of entertainment.<br/><br/>Very entertaining, it is fantastic to admire the incredible action scenes, although if I had to highlight the bad points, well, I would say that this is a film without real motivations, we do not get to feel a great attraction for the characters, each seems to represent an archetype already established without new samples of originality, the creativity of the film lies with its visual presentation, not with its characters which end up being simply averages. Perhaps the only character who really enjoys both the performance and the background story is the creator of the OASIS, which appears a few times, but each time is an emotional sensation that feels like a direct message to the audience. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear too much and the rest of the film is with the main characters which are not bad, but not very good either. Also, it reaches a point where the film is very dependent on references to video games, movies or the like, denoting a sensational overuse for it. Despite this, it is quite fun, entertaining and with excellent special effects, very good for entertaining us."

He had a significant input adapting his book into what translated onto the screen. That being said, I have not read the book and based my opinion purely off of what I saw. This was such an amazing nostalgic thrill ride to watch. The pure 80's vibe collaborated with the ever changing world of RPG video games was what made this come alive. This story is what people have wanted from Hollywood for forever.

","Ready Player One is a very entertaining movie. First it is a fun adventure movie, typical for Spielberg. Fast paced action, lot of good effects, tongue-in-cheeck comments and jokes. Not really a dull or slow moment in there at all. Spielberg knows how to make these kinds of movies, and he does it well, once again. It helps to have a good story to work with, and in Ready Player One he got it (based on the book). Nothing that reinvents the genre, stripped to it's bones it is quite a typical quest adventure story. Riddles, hidden clues, and one grand prize that one good and one evil team races to get to first. But not every movie need to invent and evolve, it is enough to do it well.<br/><br/>The other part is the massive amount of hidden ""Easter Eggs"" and references to other movies and pop culture (mostly from the 80s and 90s) that are abundant throughout the movie. Some are evident and an integral part of the story, like King Kong, the KnightRider DeLorean combination that Parzival drives, the dancing from Saturday Night Live and so on. Others are more subtle and hidden, some visual detail in the background or comment, like Sorrento's comment about Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. It is fun to find and recognize them, prompting a quick trip down memory lane. There are likely a lot of them that I haven't found yet.<br/><br/>Well, another reason to watch it again. Goodie!"

","I think Spielberg was making a tribute to Stanley Kubrick. There are many scenes, referenced as pop culture, that are right out of Kubrick's The Shinning. If you haven't seen this movie, please do. It's on Netflix! Even when they show a quarter in the beginning of the movie, it's dated 1972. A reference to the Apollo program lunar landings from 1969 - 1972. What does this have to do with Stanley Kubrick? It's a good question, but the answer may never be told. You can easily search the internet, or YouTube to find out. Another possibility for IOI is a reference to Jupiter's moon IO. Not sure on that one. I did not read the book, but the same author, Earnest Cline, wrote the Screenplay for RPO. It may be more proof how it strays from the book to add hidden references to Stanley Kubrick (1928-1999). James Halliday even looks like him."

","I saw some reviews for this film, and I'm left thinking if I'm watching the same film as the general viewer or the critics. Seems to have put people into extreme camps of love or hate, and I tend to be in the latter.<br/><br/>I'm from the generation whom this film will likely relate to most as it spreads on very thickly the cultural references from the generations most notably from 70s, 80s & 90s etc. You can see Back to the Future, Terminator 2, Pac Man Space Invaders, Atari and so on. Actually one of the good parts of the film is its homage to 'The Shining' movie, but as you can tell that's the problem but then again it is reflecting modern media life (so much nowadays is just retro homages).<br/><br/>The story is something derivative, and really the actors just can't grab your attention to invest any interest, and it doesn't help that it's a long movie. Speilberg directing it does a good job as ever with special effects, but it doesn't help that the story is something you've seen enough times. Really if you've seen The Maze Runner or Hunger Games, you've got the gist already of this movie (i.e. maverick youngsters against the big nasty corporate). Then again maybe that's just another retro reference to Tron.<br/><br/>Anyhow, best leave it at that, you may find this cod computer game on screen of interest to you, but it wasn't for me. I expect this as a regular daytime filler on TV in time in the Xmas schedule in years to come."

","From a cultural point of view, the film certainly does not carry any value as such. However, this is the film's attraction, I think it's not worth it meticulously to look for meanings and dig into the plot. They just need to enjoy and look for Easter eggs. I think I found half of it, because of course I can't know everything mentioned in the film. However, the most obvious Easter eggs pleasantly surprised, and I think they would have been more if the copyright holders had not clamped their content (intellectual property, rights to films, characters, franchises, names, and so on). It is sad of course to realize that everything and always in culture and art is tied to the financial side. Nevertheless, the film delivers quite ? Impressions mass, despite the obvious shoals of the film and inconsistencies in the story and the elementary flaws of the universe.

That said, I can watch the screen in the next row just fine. This past August I watched bits and pieces of ""Ready Player One"" flying back and forth from NYC to San Diego. It really grabbed me. I thought the action and CGI looked great. It still looks good on DVD but it little else going for it. Uninteresting characters and an uninteresting story are a bad mix. And I'm sorry, I find constant references to other (and usually better) movies a little tiresome. ""RPO"" is one '80s movie reference after another. Despite all of the action, it's gets kind of boring after a while."
"AnishMisra","8","1","3","25 November 2018"," Ready Player One Review
","Ready Player One is a film directed by Steven Speilberg. I had this film on my watchlist since the film was announced as the plot-line of the film intrigued me. Also, the trailers of the film looked quite promising which increased my anticipation for this film more. After having watched the film last night, I can say that I was satisfied.<br/><br/>Plot: Follows Wade and his group of friends, who have to retrieve an Easter Egg in the Virtual Reality world of the OASIS before Nolan Sorrento from IOI does.<br/><br/>Story and direction: I have been a fan of Spielberg films and it was good to have him back in the zone he is best known for: adventure filled films. This film is a joyride. From the story to the visuals, everything is breathtakingly gorgeous. From the first visual, you can see the meticulous detail Speilberg and his team have gone through to portray the digital and real worlds. I was just in awe. But that's not only it. The story has a message underneath this sparkling and dazzling adventure. Its shown that how people engross themselves in technology so much that they forget to differentiate between what is real and what is virtual. Also shown nicely is the way how people disguise themselves in the virtual world. Some of the pop culture references are just spot on. I can imagine the hard work that must have been endured to ensure this. The make-up work is so good that I believed that the actors were really that age they are portraying on the screen. Janusz Kaminski as the cinematographer is just awesome in his camera work. Michael Kahn and Sarah Broshar have done some great editing. Although I do miss John Williams' score, but that doesn't go to say that Alan Silvestri has done a fantastic job (including bringing back his famous Back to the Future theme). Some places that needed improvement was surely the finale which felt stretched. Due to which I think the length of the film could have been shorter. Also, the villains needed a lot of worked. They were cliched and did not have any specific motive other than just wanting the Easter Egg.<br/><br/>Performances: Tye Sheridan just knocked it out of the park. Same can be said for Olivia Cooke. It was good to see Lena Waithe in mainstream cinema and hope to see her in some other ventures. Philip Zhao and Win Morisaki gave decent performances. It is always a delight to see Simon Pegg. Mark Rylance lived the role he was offered. T J Miller has provided some awesome voice-work in the film. Ben Mendelsohn and Hannah John-Kamen were good but the characterization for their characters was not there, which made them look dull and boring.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Wade and Samantha meet for the first time in the real world. The scene was so beautiful that it is quite difficult to express that in words.<br/><br/>Verdict: READY PLAYER ONE for me is a visual treat and I enjoyed my time watching the film. If big action scenes along with a CGI fest, is your cup of tea, you are in for a feast. Otherwise, I don't recommend the film.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."

","I remember seeing the first official trailer for this film back in December of 2017, I immediately knew this film was going to be a success. Steven Spielberg made a masterpiece that was in production for over three years and the end result was excellent.<br/><br/>
The Shining sequence was pure cinema magic, In my opinion this is one of the best-kept secrets in film history, It completely surprised audiences around the world and paid homage and respect to arguably one of the greatest horror films of all time.<br/><br/>
There was only one negative problem I had with the film and it was the fact that the first act of the film was rushed, if we could have seen a little more of the real world at the start of the film it would have created a better narrative. Within three minutes of the start of the film we already get to see the OASIS and for me I would have liked more character development as we learn little about Wade Watts himself until the end of the first act which lasts about twenty-minutes.<br/><br/>
Overall this film is one my favorites of all time and Steven Spielberg made a truly spectacular movie. It will be remembered for many generations to come."

","I just watched the film for a second time and I enjoyed it no less than the first time, I thought this doesn't happen any more... Most of the Hollywood films feel very similar nowadays , with same old shoot and chase scenes... Although there is a lot of shoot and chase in !Ready Player One"", the film makers had a creative approach towards the film action... Every gun, every outfit every character has a special detail added to it, it's a nerd film made with deep love of pop culture... I think what makes the film different from a lot of other similar movies is the side story of Oasis creator, which adds a story within a story ... An important thing to mention that overall experience of on-line gaming community is presented in a correct way which makes this film more enjoyable for those who like on-line computer games...

"g-hbe","7","1","3","22 September 2018"," Fast & fun, but lacking heart.
","There's a lot of hype surrounding this film and when we saw it come up on a streaming service we decided to give it a go. It was only at the end that I realised the reason for my lack of satisfaction - it's a kids' film. Packed with fast-paced action, massive, noisy set-pieces, giant robots and gibbering jargon it assaults the senses almost without a pause, but sadly the story is wafer-thin and there's little of the superb 'family feeling' that we normally see in Spielberg movies.
There are a few good references to older films and classic computer games but let's face it, anyone can do that. So, impressive as the spectacle is (the CGI is quite something), ultimately for me it is a 'one time only' movie, never to be watched again. I have been a Spielberg fan since the days of Duel and Jaws, but he's slipped up with this one."

"zfischer-20437","3","1","3","4 September 2018"," A Badly Paced Mess
","I loved this book a lot. I'll get that out of the way right now. It was fun to read and hipped me to a lot of media I still love today. I know it's not great, but it holds a special part in my heart as a book I loved as a teenager. I almost walked out of the theater at least 4 times while watching the movie. The ""Welcome to the resistance"" line had me out of my seat, getting my coat. I only sat back down to finish it because I realized this trainwreck was probably almost done so why waste 10 bucks.<br/><br/>That being said, I'll try to look at the movie as a movie and not as an extension of the book in this review.<br/><br/>So the movie is really badly paced. It clips from one scene to another at such a breakneck pace it got hard for me to follow at points. As someone who read the book before, it was easier for me to follow for the most part. But my poor girlfriend, with whom I watched this with in theaters, was left feeling like she was always one step behind. It felt like RPO had so much to show me but so little time. It just rushed everything at you so briskly, that you don't have enough time to take it all in.<br/><br/>As for the plot and story, it was either too predictable or just didn't feel right. The plot just seems to happen for the most part, mostly because of the previously mentioned pacing. Things just move from one thing to the next, not feeling very natural or like any sense of progression happens. The only moment that really wowed me in the entire movie was the Shining scene. It was so cool to watch it all play out. It was the only time I really felt like I was apart of that universe or that I was in the OASIS with them. The lead character actor wasn't fun to watch and the girl who played Art3mis was boring as all hell. Maybe she wasn't written well, but it felt like Art3mis was chalked up to ""The Girl Character That Likes The Boy Character"". The ending felt really hokey and awful. I won't spoil it, but it makes all the hard work that Wade does almost moot in a way. It's really weird that they chose the ending they did.<br/><br/>The visuals were fun to watch, which is the only good part for me. The action set-pieces were a blast to see. Although the constant current media nods and other properties almost jarred me out of it whenever I saw a Spartan from Halo or Tracer from Overwatch walking around. Also the battle scenes were just so crowded with so much stuff, it was hard to focus on anything. It just felt like so much was happening, I couldn't concentrate on anything. But altogether, the visual aspect was a real treat and a standout part of the movie.<br/><br/>All and all, I wish that this movie was so much more. Maybe if they had split it up into three films, one for each key, it would have been better. It would have allowed for a more in depth story and not this blink-and-you-miss-it pacing. I really wanted this to be a good movie, but all I got was just more proof that Spielberg has lost his touch."
"hectorhtr","7","1","3","2 September 2018"," Spielberg returns but like before?
","The most spectacular Spielberg (Indiana Jones or Jurassic Park) returns filming and narrating masterfully.
Although there are many problems that I can give you, it is the abuse of references to popular culture, which should be in the background, which bothers me the most.
A functional casting in the worst sense, with a protagonist is anti-charismatic.
I should delve deeper into the themes proposed by the film because as it is proposed is simple and flat, sending an almost toxic message about the world of videogames. You should leave so much nostalgia and tell a decent story.
Anyway, it's a good movie with its pluses and minuses.

I understand that translating a book to a movie is not an easy thing (though someone of Spielberg's caliber should be able to do it) and yes, the visual effects were great despite the crammed advertising of big game companies, but even if you were to change the storyline to fit the big screen how can you so utterly loose the soul that made the book so great? The witty dialogue, the mind bending puzzle solving, the attraction between the characters, the bond they had and the journey of Wade, all that was lost on the screen under a thick layer of game advertising that paid no tribute to the author in any way.
Why couldn't he have just made his own movie? It feels like he's taken a painting, stripped it of its beauty, pasted a bunch of ads on the canvas and sold it under the original painting title. At least have the decency to maket the film under your own name.

","Nostalgia...is a thing of the past. And so is nostalgia.<br/><br/>Had this movie come out 20 years ago...fantastic. I would've marveled at the countless references to the 1980-70s. But, too bad: there's been so many HEY, LOOK! HERE'S A REFERENCE TO THE PAST! movies and TV shows recently, that frankly, I'm sick of looking into the past. This movie is so outdated by this point, it actually makes sense why they released the failure of The Darkest Minds a few months later. YA movie series are past their prime long before 2018.<br/><br/>Basically, this OVERLONG movie is a cartoon with bad graphics when it comes to humans. Which is weird. In TODAY'S time, these bad human effects is about normal, but this movie's set in the near future where this really should've been dealt with. But, I digress. This movie sucks.<br/><br/>What you get is a horrible future of humans that never work and just play VR to escape not working. Some pretty boy is the obvious savior when an Easter Egg is presented to, I guess, save all mankind. <br/><br/>This movie has zero heart, characters that have zero chemistry, generic nostalgia in graphics and score and the one saving grace is what they didn't ruin in the trailers: the Stephen King reference.<br/><br/>I perked up then. It's about an hour into a bloated 2 hour, 20 minutes mess. One of the million pop culture references takes center stage for quite a bit of screen time and I loved it. But, then it went away and the bad writing and stereotypical playbook happened.<br/><br/>This story was so concerned with showing better movies and ideas of the past, it forgot to have one of its own. When the movie was out of ""the matrix,"" I was depressed. When it was in ""the past films nostalgia"" I was checked out. Again, nostalgia is definitely nothing new these days.<br/><br/>Absolutely not recommended.

","The Good Guys battle the Bad Guys within a video game for control of the game and its real world fortunes. Very Ambliny. Shallow and superficial. Any hope for real drama lost in the ultra-hi-tech CGI rendering, (the real star of the show), and the fast paced tweeny patter. The moral of the story being, according to the main character, gamers need to spend more time in the real world. At least two whole days per week. Because reality is the only place to get a decent meal. And, of course, a little down home lovin'. <br/><br/>Video game freaks will love this movie. Others? Maybe not so much. Worth the price of admission to see the special effects. Although that can get a little old about halfway through a two and a half hour epic. It has everything moviegoers have come to expect from the Spielberg camp. Except drama. And a soul.<br/><br/>5 stars for effort."

","Straight off, I have not read the books - let that be known.<br/><br/>That out of the way, ""Ready Player One"" lives and breathes by it's references.<br/><br/>The plot by itself is interesting, it tells of a future - and the troubles it brings - that does not seem so unimaginable but the way it is told is a bit uninspired. There's no cases of particularly good acting, and only a few bad one.
But, all in all it's a decent movie.<br/><br/>If you're not that familiar with 80's pop-culture - tho there are some more recent references scattered throughout as well - I would probably skip this one for as I stated, this movie really does live and breathe by its references, if you don't get them you lose a lot of it's charm."

","I have not read the book, so I'm purely reviewing the movie as it is.
I have always been a fan of Spielberg, but this movie had me worried because when I saw the trailer, it really looked rather wierd.
The first 10-15 minutes I felt the visuals looked rather odd, computer game like, if that's a description, but after a while, it all melted together, and became a great way to differentiate between the VR world and the real world.
The story was great, and had my attention all the way through to the end.<br/><br/>I really hope people don't skip it, just because the visuals are different, because I can honestly say it's a pretty good movie.
The movie manages to be different, than most other movies, and all the pop culture references were great.<br/><br/>Spielberg have done it again."

Also, too much lens flare. <br/><br/>Positives: The stacks.<br/><br/>Negatives: The movie.<br/><br/>What a load...<br/><br/>I gave it a four because I love Spielberg and I said ""Oh"" out loud twice... if not for those two things, I would've gotten the 1 that it deserved."

","First off, it is a nice movie.
But the deviation from the book is so massive that it's no longer Ready Player One but a different story set in the same universe where the main characters have the same names by pure coincidence.<br/><br/>While some changes were certainly necessary for a movie adaptation, the scope and type of changes in the movie are just insanely bad. Changing the main characters and story to such an extent is not only unnecessary but laughably stupid.<br/><br/>In a frame set by the book the challenge design makes no sense and the story progression outside the OASIS is completely counter to anything that fits the world built by Ernest Cline.<br/><br/>Overall, it can be very much recommended for people who have no interest in the book but as someone who has enjoyed the original this was just yet another in a long series of severely disappointing adaptations."

Plus it's bursting with so many of its own ideas and spectacular set pieces, that you never feel like there's a lack of imagination. <br/><br/>Exciting, spectacular, funny, the best blockbuster of 2018 so far."

","Ready Player One was pretty terrible. Like, at levels that I didn't think it would reach. Especially in competent hands such as Spielberg, but Hell I guess he saw how much this 80s nostalgia trend was bringing in and thought to himself ""hey I member when my movies made lots of money!"" The sad truth is the nostalgia isn't even the problem in the film. Its the lack of coherent world and story it's taking place. This world doesn't make a lick of damn sense!!!! Like headache stupidity!!!! You have unlikable plane run of the mill characters that the whole time are spatting out basic knowledge in this universe which there so a custom to. (So why the hell do you have to explain ever little thing like it's the first time you encounter this situation. Is it cuz you don't want to lose your audience and think they're just dumb babies needing you to hold their hand. Cuz christ knows if one person starts thinking about how this world works they would realize how damn Ridiculous this all is!!!) By far the worst film I've seen of Spielberg's. He really showed how out of his element he was making this. Along with whoever the hell cowrote this sceenplay!!! If not for the nice visuals, fine cinematography and one interesting part in and clever part in the middle. (You'll know it when you see it) I'd give it a rating lower than a 3.

From a movie stand point, the film was done with the understanding of how to drew a crowed and make money.

","I had make an account just for this review, it was THAT disappointing...<br/><br/>When i heard about this movie and what it is about, i got super hyped, as a avid gamer and someone who loves pop culture references.
I haven't read the book or even knew this was based on a book (which apparently is pretty awesome from what i hear) so my dissapointement has nothing to do with that aspect. <br/><br/>It felt like just another badly made generic Hollywood adventure/love story with shallow characters, a stupid message trying to sound smart and deep, inside a shell of pop culture references to pull in the audiences since gaming has become so mainstream.
It is the movie everyone has seen a million times with a different skin.<br/><br/>I honestly only enjoyed like two scenes in the whole movie and chuckled lightly maybe thrice (laughed out loud once, at the end when the directors name was shown), with nothing really memorable and tons of stupid loopholes and characters acting in a non believable way and sadly no character development whatsoever.<br/><br/>The only reason i would recommend watching this is if you where to be high enough to only care about the bright visuals (graphics were mediocre, but bright and colorful), pop culture references and you do not wish to have to think at all. 
But for that purpose there are so many other better movies, this is just a new option if you have ""seen it all""<br/><br/>I am actually really sad to leave a review like this, i wanted to really enjoy this movie, it combines so many things i love and has so much potential, instead it chooses to dangle them in front of me and obliterate them.<br/><br/>Funnily enough i didn't know Spielberg even directed this till the end, and at that point i was not surprised at all, seeing his name as the director was actually one of the movies best moments because it was the only moment that made me laugh out loud, i am starting to feel like he is a master troll, if he made this as a intentional troll, then 10/10 kudos to you Spielberg.

","Several decades into the future, the world has become obsessed with a game that has many different worlds to play in. If you die playing, you go back to step one and lose everything that you have accumulated. The deceased designer has created a contest within the game where the person who solves the clues gets control of the game and the half trillion dollar empire. Needless to say, corporations play the game. <br/><br/>The film centers on Wade Watts of Columbus Ohio. He has a group of on-line friends as they attempt to find the keys and clues. After he gets the first key, he draws attention to himself and not all in a good way. The film is also a love story. <br/><br/>I loved the graphics in the game, more so in the beginning than end. My main criticism of the film is that it is aimed at kids but drops the F-word. Spielberg did this in ""Super 8"" also, I am not sure why he feels he needs to do this. It certainly did add anything to either film. <br/><br/>Good classic rock soundtrack plus Bee Gees. If you want to see a more adult film, ""2047 Virtual Revolution"" I found entertaining."

The characters were flat, the movie was nog engaging, storyline was boring (makes me lose interest in ever wanting to read the book) The 80's reference are all not that special and note worthy really. Not good enough at least for me te keep myself interested in watching the movie. It has an anti climatic ending and overall very dull movie.

","Ready Player One (2018):<br/><br/>Halfway through Ready Player One,a lengthy sequence of The Shining was included which I was totally unprepared for..Who would have thought that we are going to see The Shining,one of the greatest horrors of all time,on an Imax screen and Perfect 3D...A pure Spielberg master-creativity in bringing us one of the most nostalgic adventure movie with mind blowing VFX...<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>In the year 2045, the real world is a harsh place. The only time Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) truly feels alive is when he escapes to the OASIS, an immersive virtual universe where most of humanity spends their days. In the OASIS, you can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone-the only limits are your own imagination. The OASIS was created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance), who left his immense fortune and total control of the Oasis to the winner of a three-part contest he designed to find a worthy heir. When Wade conquers the first challenge of the reality-bending treasure hunt, he and his friends-aka the High Five-are hurled into a fantastical universe of discovery and danger to save the OASIS.<br/><br/>My Review:<br/><br/>Spielberg has been a great storyteller from the beginning, a master of the camera, it is as if he sees each edit in his head before the film is finished.Even when present young-age film makers are stumbling upon each other on who is gonna make the best visual wonder,Spielberg a man who is almost 75 has most visual telling abilities than most of the other makers.Steven Spielberg is the father of spectacle.The film-maker's singular vision in weaving ambitious drama around cinematic sorcery launched the age of blockbuster entertainment.In Ready Player One, he returns to an arena he predominantly parented with the optimism of a kid who hasn't forgotten what it's like to be an audience..<br/><br/>Ready Player One is a truly awe-inspiring, towering piece of work, the work of an artist absolutely confident in his abilities and artistry, his finger on the pulse of world movie goers. With a salute to eighties pop culture, and video games, the characters hurtle through the worlds in the film, encountering some of the more famous and infamous characters of the eighties. What I liked is that they are not the major characters, they simply exist in this work called The Oasis. Slipping into this virtual world you are as likely to encounter King Kong as you are the T Rex from Jurassic Park (1993), the cast of Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and the totally unexpected Overlook Hotel of The Shining (1980) and hilariously creepy ""Chucky"" too..<br/><br/>Because Spielberg is quite the master of crafting giant spectacle with heart, you get some truly jaw dropping action sequences in the film, more so because we're inside VR and the filmmaker is no longer confined to the boundaries of what can be realistic. The scale is so huge and sprawling that it feels like Spielberg is just showing off what is possible with cutting edge CGI and an unlimited imagination nowadays..The Mega Race at the start itself is worth the ticket price...Make no mistake; there are legitimately jaw-dropping action set pieces in Ready Player One that rival anything seen in even the most impressive blockbuster franchises, and they leave a lasting impression. 3D is one of the best I have ever seen<br/><br/>Ready Player One is flawed too..Performances are just decent..Nothing special except the charming presence of Olivia Cooke..She is absolutely stunning....As per the plot,Ready Player One is a typical Spielberg-ish adventure set in virtual world..There are no surprises and turns..It just gives you an long-lasting expression...<br/><br/>So,Ready Player One is a crazy nostalgic ride with the best VFX you will see in recent times..Spielberg's epic craft..<br/><br/>My rating 7.5/10"

These were MY favorite arcade games, but really, just a PORTION of the whopping 57 computer/arcade games, mentioned in the book.<br/><br/>I CAN understand the need for a re-write, to make this story comprehensible to the modern audience (avoiding the details of playing the games, as is in the book), while still including enough of the references to the legacy early computers and arcade games... NOT TO MENTION the early Techy Movies (such as ""War Games"") and early Adventure movies (over 87 movies were referenced directly!) to really connect, directly to me. OK, yeah, I'm 68 years old now, LOL, but young at heart... for eternity.<br/><br/>I think it's VERY RARE, and nearly IMPOSSIBLE for ANY movie, ANY story, to manage to bridge the gap between generations, as well as ""Ready Player One"" managed to do. This MAY be (IMHO) the MOST successful movie (and book!) to have managed to pull this feat off! I really can't think of a near second!.<br/><br/>Lastly, I will say that I feel privileged to have been able to watch ""Ready Player One"" in a modern Hi-Tech Digital theater (yes, they have those in (expat) Thailand, LOL), as the amazing graphics and graphic realizations within the movie deserve to be seen on the BIG SCREEN. Having said THAT, I can't wait for a HD version of this to show up on the Internet, as I TRULY need to watch it a few more times, to be able to catch all the nuances I'm sure I missed the first time, as I was being totally overwhelmed by this masterpiece of Steven Spielberg; quite possibly one of his finest works, if not his finest."

","I never knew steven spielberg though i watched most of his movies and i was amazed to know that he directed saving private ryan (one of the classic war movies). The first question that came to mind then was , what is so different about both movies ( other than the genre) ? 
first thing on the top of my head was: A purpose. 
I felt that mostly everything in Ready player one had no purpose or message and it was just another show of visuals or action scenes( which were splendid by the way)
There was no meaning to the format of the tournament. No meaning to kira's character. No meaning to the rebellion. and much much more. I kept waiting for a moral or transformation but all i found was a bad ending and dissapointment.
the movie had absolutely no character development and below average dialogue. It makes me sad that a book rated 4.3/5 became such a movie.

"ccamp89","7","1","3","14 April 2018"," Imaginative and fun, though lacks an emotional core
","In the grand scheme of blockbuster filmmaking, you could definitely do worse than Ready Player One. It boasts plenty of style, imagination, and dazzling visuals and Spielberg lends his experienced hand to stitch everything together in kinetic fashion. It's worth a recommendation on the strength of its best set pieces and its sheer exuberance. On the other hand, the movie also feels somewhat ungrounded and overblown. Its glaring issue is that the characters largely fail to anchor the movie and give it the emotional core that it needs. They're serviceable, but lacking in depth nearly across the board and the lead, in particular, does not carry the film too well. It also suffers a bit from the Speilberg schmaltz factor, mainly in its resolution. Still, it's a fun, mostly well-directed film that stands out in a sea of generic blockbusters.<br/><br/>3.5/5"
"obiegimmie","5","1","3","13 April 2018"," ""Ready Player One"": An Enormous, Fantastic, Breathtaking Mess
","""Ready Player One"" is based on a 2011 novel of the same name by Ernest Cline. For the most part, I felt the film lacked real substance or meaning. It seemed terribly derivative, and quite honestly I felt the film could have gone in different directions. Rather than create a fascinating thriller that thrives on character study and exploration, that explores the bounds of the human imagination when exposed to something as intangible as technology, the film focuses on spectacle. Quite possibly the thing I disliked the most was the lack of character building. Typically, there needs to be an exciting or tense backdrop/situation for a group of characters to work around. Most importantly, the said backdrop is tangible and actual and has stakes to it. With RPO, the immensity of the plot happens in a virtual world, where it is made clear at the very beginning that death there is not permanent nor applicable in the real world. In order to construct a somewhat competent action film, and to create actual chemistries and relationships between various characters, which is what the film aspires to be, there needs to be some traits or weight to them. These characters were generic. There's Wade Watts, the lead, who has no defining characteristics to him, his girlfriend??, Samantha, who has a birthmark, and there's Wade's best friend, Aech, (underused, and fully capable of replacing Samantha as the romantic lead, please the chemistry is there). I did, however, had some fun with the bad guy and his company, IOI, the antagonist that competes with Watts to locate several keys/clues within the game. The world was interesting to me, especially the concept of the loyalty centers and the premise of the corporation itself. I was captivated in the character studies surrounding Sorrento and his ascent to the head of IOI, Halliday's relationship with Kira and how he interacted with her and Morrow. I think the stories surrounding these characters deserved to be fleshed out more. <br/><br/>This is not to say that this is a terrible film , or even a bad film, really. It's fairly competent and has some impressive visuals, some incredibly entertaining, well-paced sequences that are performed and written well. For example, a scene is a spin-off/tribute/montage to ""The Shining,"" in which the characters interact with settings and characters from the original Kubrick film. I had a lot of fun with these scenes, like the fluidity of the car chase scene, or the creativity and colorfulness of the club scene, or the nostalgic giddiness surrounding the Iron Giant sequence. I loved a good amount of this film, yet it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>50%<br/><br/>C"

","Steven Spielberg's résumé of directing heartfelt and visually stunning action, horror and science fiction movies has been incessant culturally since the mid-1970s. The latest blockbuster hit from Spielberg is Ready Player One, a supposed science fiction film that takes place in a futuristic real world and another of a massively multiplayer online game. This adaptation of a book by the same name captures moments of wonder but ultimately fails to deliver its complicated story.<br/><br/> The story begins with a narration by the chief character of the film, Wade Watts, also known as Parzival in the online world of the OASIS. Wade, played by Tye Sheridan, describes what the OASIS is, how it came to be, and the current competition going on within the game. Wade is a Gunter, a person that plays the game to solve the mystery put in by the creator. As explained in the narration, the character that solves all three of the enigmas gain control of the OASIS.<br/><br/> Early in the plot, Wade's obsession with the creator of the game, James Halliday (Mark Rylance), helps him solve the first puzzle. With the help of his friends Art3mis (Olivia Cooke) and Aech (Lena Waithe), Wade is able to solve the second enigma. However, he is now being pursued by a rival company that is looking to take over OASIS. Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn ) is the CEO of IOI, and he contacts Wade about helping their company take control of the game. When Wade refuses, Sorrento sends soldiers to assassinate him and take the OASIS by force. <br/><br/> Many of the problems with Ready Player One start from the onset. The long and drawn out narration takes up the first 15 minutes of the film. The pacing screeches to a halt before anything can start. Spielberg's attempt to fill the audience in on the world and story could be shown purely through visuals, as the narration echoes later in the film's dialogue. The lack of transitions within the game make the film feel like it's happening in only a few hours. <br/><br/> The problems with pacing bleed into other aspects of the film too, namely the action scenes which are either so fast that they're bordering on incomprehensible or drag on far too long. Science fiction can often be slow, which is part of the reason I also consider this an action movie, but it ultimately fails at being either. Sci-Fi typically has rules, but the OASIS does not. The amount of plot inconsistencies regarding how the game actually works shows how little Spielberg understands gaming. Games have rules, games an objective from the beginning and gamers don't play videogames that take years to have a purpose. There is no explanation as to what the OASIS does or what rules it has
. 
 Spielberg and editor, Ernest Cline, have far too much experience to produce such a disjointed mess. Cline even wrote the book, which makes it even more disappointing to see something so confusing and nonsensical. <br/><br/> Not having read the novel, it seems like Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski, the cinematographer that's worked with him on movies like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, do not understand how to put this source material on screen. While the film looks visually stunning thanks to Kaminski, Spielberg's references get in the way of his work. Spielberg expects the audience to munch on their popcorn and smash their buttery hands together in applause whenever something they remember pops up on the screen. The pop-culture references turn from feeling out of place to borderline insulting before the film is even half over.<br/><br/> Where this aspect is at its worst is during the action scenes. In the last action scene alone, there are seven references in the first minute. The references don't always make sense either, as the film is supposed to be taking place in the 2040s but properties like Gundam, The Breakfast Club and King Kong wouldn't be nostalgic in the context of the movie. <br/><br/> What's most frustrating about these issues would be forgivable had the story been told well, but that fails just as badly. Along with the pacing problem, it seems like this story is too complicated for a single movie to properly explain. Having three completely different puzzles to solve makes each of their discoveries feel cheap and forced. There was no structure, and while the real world plot is entertaining, it feels tacked on to give the result of the competition consequence outside of the game. There is no room for any character development or proper story progression, which hinders the otherwise solid performances from a talented cast. <br/><br/> The lead actors, who are ironically the youngest and least experienced people at their craft, really put their best foot forward. Tye Sheridan does a fine job as Wade, and the lack of character falls more on the direction than his performance. He excels in using Spielberg's witty dialogue and delivering it in a very natural way. Cooke is more of the same, as she plays her character well and has very good chemistry with Sheridan during their budding romance. The romance plot, which is where both of these actors really shine, is the only part of the film that feels realistic when it comes to video games. Both of them do an excellent job at feeling awkward about meeting somebody they're attracted to from a video game.
 
 Mendelsohn excels as the villain, playing a smarmy business CEO in yet another film. This role seems perfect for him, as it was in The Dark Knight Rises and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Outside of the business, he really sells himself as somebody just regurgitating references to make people think he cares about OASIS. The filmmakers may not have seen the correlation between Sorrento and themselves, but it definitely makes its way into the final product. <br/><br/> While the actors do their best with this material, Ready Player One feels like an undeserved sequel. While it has already broken even in the box office, most seem divisive on the film. The characters and world feel like they should already be established, but Spielberg does not set them up in a way conducive to this structure. With added characterization and a more streamlined story, Ready Player One would feel like much more than the visually impressive nostalgia celebration that it is."

I loved the characters and found myself really rooting for them.

In this case, we have a clear example of a captivating, soulful, and socially insightful work of fiction completely stripped of any of the qualities that make it great. The action sequences in the film are fantastic, of course, if a little too fast to appreciate at times. I shan't get into details, but Wade's sheer wishy-washiness in the film, the lack of character development, the absence of genuine camaraderie, the lackadaisical writing, the formulaic speeches, and the addition of hackneyed structural tropes all combine to make the film much less than it could have been."

And sometimes, an author's property is purchased for the name, knowing that much of it may not be perfectly translated from page to screen.

","Spielberg is at it again, based off of Ernest Cline's amazing novel (I have read it by the way, awesome book, now I am reading it for the second time). Ready Player One is based on a world of Virtual Reality, a world called the Oasis is alive and real. The year is 2047 and people all over the world basically live in the Oasis. 
 
The story is about a young man named Wade Watts, and his adventures in the Oasis. In the Oasis you can pretty much do anything, create anything, and be anything. An Imagination makers dream come true. <br/><br/>I loved this movie, but I also love the book. Read the book first it has a lot more detail in it then the movie does, and the movie didn't follow the book all that much but it was still a great movie. Spielberg works his magic and wonder, just like he did with Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones. It is a story of imagination and every gamer's dream. One wonders if the Oasis can one day become a real thing. <br/><br/>The actors did fabulous in their roles, Tye Sheridan was fantastic as Wade/Parzival and Olivia Cooke was as Samantha/Art3mis. The rest of the cast was great too. I loved the soundtrack, classic 80's and 90's music and pop culture. The song at the end by Twisted Sister was perfect for end battle theme.

You should immerse yourself in this glorious visual treat on the biggest screen available, the way it was meant to be experienced. The CGI FX are on such a grand scale, they are palpable. I truly wish I could have surrounded myself in it wearing the VR headgear they use in the story. This is completely & totally a film made for me, as I've always said I would live inside a movie or television, if it was possible. I even caught all the obvious Easter Eggs, & a lot of the more easily missable ones, although I never played a few of the games shown in it, I still recognized the ones I did see. I know there are many I missed though as they sometimes whizz by at lightning speed. <br/><br/>It was a thoroughly engaging, & very fun trip watching all the pop culture woven into this thrill ride of a story that reminded me a bit of Charlie & the Chocolate Factory with a villain thrown in to wreak havoc with our hero, Wade Watts AKA Parzival & his merry band of OASIS dwelling geeks. I loved the soundtrack which was on pointe, & major kudos for the characters' avatar designs. Well done!

I like the human elements that were woven in, as well. having the contest much earlier revolve around Halliday's life and his regrets made for a much more compelling narrative.

I dreaded the thought of having to sit another hour to resolve the last third of the plot. If you like action films, the last hour will perhaps satisfy, but IMHO the meager plot became just the usual excuse to show what computers can do. For me, it was tedious and pointless. The characters weren't further developed. One could surmise the outcome. The conflict between reality and virtual reality really wasn't explored. The '80s memorabilia and shout-outs to a vast number of sci-fi stories may delight, but it's all pointless really. The best part was when the movie was over. And I can't get over Mark Rylance in his role as Halliday, after his Oscar-winning performance in Bridge of Spies... bad casting choice IMHO."

","I love futuristic and unique films that create their own realities, realms or worlds. From iconic films such as Inception to even great tv shows like Game of Thrones they can allow us to escape reality and have a unique viewing experience. <br/><br/>Ready Player One certainly has its moments but it is not anything special. The pop culture references are great and I'm sure many would have loved The Shining references and scene. It was a treat to enter the setting and location of such a great film. Not to mention other references to other films. The plot is also reasonably unique and somewhat flows. <br/><br/>However the downfall is the childish and unnecessary love story between the two main actors. This did not work at all and it was nauseating to see Wade close the doors to the lawyers to kiss the girl in what was a very childish and unneeded scene. A lot of teenagers and amateur film goers might have enjoyed it. Romance can work well when it is done to enhance a film and adds value. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of our time yet this is not some of his best work. The great soundtrack is also not enough to save the film."
"MovieManChuck","Null","1","3","6 April 2018"," Spielberg's back, but for the worse
","2/4<br/><br/>I got the pleasure of seeing Spielberg's first ""crowd-pleaser"" in over a decade in theatres. The veteran director is characterized by works spanning the 80s and 90s, and his name was recognized by both buffs and casual movie-goers alike. Now, he's the center of attention again with his comeback: Ready Player One.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it for what it was, but I was very disappointed. There were many plot holes, and (for me) many questions left unanswered. As far as the book, I haven't read it and can't criticize the story itself.<br/><br/>The special effects are the best I've ever seen in a Spielberg movie. He truly brought it to life in a unique way. Another theme prevalent in the cinematography was dimming the colors in scenes not in the OASIS. Also, the background was blurry whenever Parsival and Art3mis we're together in the OASIS. I thought these were very nice touches. The nostalgia, however, was as abundant as it was obvious. (especially The Shinjng sequence) It called for a far more subtle, less in-your-face type of throwback. In addition, the references could be very forced or out of place (the race at the beginning with the T-Rex and King Kong). In short, it was tired and overbearing.<br/><br/>Our protagonist, Wade, is a resident of Columbus, Ohio in the year 2045. He lives in a ghetto known as ""The Satcks"" (trailers stacked on top of one another) in a world so filled with problems that all anyone does is escapes reality. This is done in a virtual world known as the OASIS. Halliday, the creator of the OASIS, made a contest to find an Easter Egg. Whoever found it would gain control over the entire OASIS. While this isn't a drama, one can't help but wonder what exactly these problems are, as most of what you see outside of the OASIS is the small trailer park community. <br/><br/>In the OASIS, Wade is among the elite, which is the opposite from his real-life status. This is where his best friends are, in this virtual world.
In the OASIS, you never truly know what's going on. You have to fill in way to many blanks, because the OASIS feels like more of an unfinished concept. Also, since most of the movie takes place here, in this mystery world, the blanks become plot holes rather rapidly.
Secondly, since the movie jumps between Earth and the OASIS, the character development aspect felt lacking. It's a shame, these were relatable characters, and you'd want to know them in a deeper, more complex level. Instead, it felt like the 2 hours that they were on screen equated their entire life-span.<br/><br/>The OASIS is where Wade's entire life is, except for his tough-love aunt and uncle. One definite negative was the light-hearted manner in which the movie took into account their death. When Wade learned his ""stack"" was going to blown up by the IOI, he called home to have his drunk uncle pick up the phone. When he doesn't listen, the stack toppled over and they both die. The scene cuts, and there is no sign that Wade is conflicted emotionally (as would be the norm) until almost half an hour later. He confronts the perpetrator with a very weak blow: You killed my mother's sister! This is another example of weak character development. Spielberg should have established emotional connection between the characters. On the contrary, Halliday was overly developed compared to much more pivotal characters. These proportions ultimately felt shallow.<br/><br/>The IOI felt more like a government agency than a private organization. It gave one missable scene of clarity what would happen if they found Halliday's Easter Egg. The OASIS under the control of the IOI would be flooded with subscription fees and micro transactions. Considering they killed everyone in Wade's stack and practiced forced labor, you think they would do a bit more?<br/><br/>This movie doesn't resonate with you the way Jurassic Park, ET, Jaws, or Indiana Jones did. It feels like Spielberg's last goodbye to the movie industry, in which he did so much good for. At the same time, this didn't feel like Spielberg. This movie is more in the spirit of Linklater, only more haphazardly crafted. This movie is proof that Spielberg has another epic movie in him. As opposed to reliving the 80's, he only reminisces them."
"ferguson-6","6","1","3","5 April 2018"," Easter egg hunt with goggles
","Greetings again from the darkness. While there is a massive target audience for Steven Spielberg's return to fantasy adventure filmmaking, I am most certainly not part of that esteemed group. Although I very much enjoy throwbacks and tributes, I haven't touched a video game controller in 3 decades, and of course have not read Ernest Cline's popular novel - the source material that inspired Mr. Spielberg to veer from his recent heavy dramas (the exception being THE BFG). Still, being a movie lover, I couldn't help but be intrigued by the project.
Seemingly a match made in Virtual Reality heaven, we get one of the premier fantasy filmmakers joining forces with a screenwriter (Zak Penn) who has had success with comic book adaptions, and a bestselling first novel from a geeky author. Fascinating to watch, the film plays like Mr. Spielberg's $175 million personal toy box. <br/><br/>There is a story, though one could argue it exists solely for the purpose of pushing the visual FX envelope. A Steve Jobs-type guru named Halliday (Mark Rylance) designed a 3-part contest of skill and strategy with the grand prize being full control over OASIS - a virtual world that allows the players to be anyone or anything they desire. Since Halliday's death, most people in this dystopian future of the year 2045 spend their waking hours immersed in OASIS. Some use it as an escape from their bleak lives, while others are attempting to solve the mysteries of the 3 keys.<br/><br/>Set in Columbus, Ohio, which we are informed is the fastest growing city in the world (why??), there are two factions vying for the grand prize: true gamers/gunters and megacorporation IOI being run by corporate villain Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). Tye Sheridan (MUD) stars as Wade Watts, whose avatar is Parzival, one of the more thoughtful characters. Olivia Cooke (THOROUGHBREDS) plays Ar3mis, a rebel gunter (egg hunter) out more for revenge than victory. They are part of a group of misfits who label themselves 'High-Five', even though Parzival gets left hanging every time. <br/><br/>Near non-stop action and relentless pacing result in a whirlwind of lights and colors and visuals that are mixed with more 1980's pop culture references than anyone could possibly catch in one viewing. As a primer, you should brace yourself for a key role from THE IRON GIANT (1999), as well as various appearances and nods to TRON, BACK TO THE FUTURE, Freddie Krueger, Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY, the Holy hand grenade (Monty Python), the infamous Big Foot monster truck, a speeding DeLorean, the 1960's era Batmobile, that hideous A-Team van, Christine from CHRISTINE (1983), John Hughes, King Kong, BEETLEJUICE, and a personal favorite, Buckaroo Bonzai. It's also a kick to see the Rubik renamed Zemeckis Cube. The most stunning sequence for this old geezer was the virtual recreation of Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING (1980), especially the focus on Room 237. It's these kind of nostalgic injections that prevent it from coming across as an overblown CGI spectacle with VR goggles.<br/><br/>Others in the cast (more time as voices than real people) include Lena Waithe (""Master of None""), TJ Miller as a bounty hunter with some of the film's best one-liners, Simon Pegg as Halliday's former business partner, and Phillip Zhao as Sho. Surely you've figured out that this one isn't about the cast. OASIS is where your imagination rules and Easter eggs are driving plot lines. Alan Silvestri takes over the music from usual Spielberg collaborator John Williams, and delivers one of my favorite references (and one of the oldest) in the film - Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971). Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski must have been exhausted by the time filming was complete, though we can't always tell what was filmed and what was created in the lab. Spielberg is a master manipulator when it comes to nostalgia, though we can't help but wonder if he is making a statement with this being the next evolution as our society becomes ever-more-involved with their phones and personal devices. At least maybe some kid will leave this film with a greater appreciation of research."
"austin0731","6","1","3","5 April 2018"," Spielberg's new entry of childlike wonder and nostalgia
","Ready Player one captures some aspects of the wonder of game and fully utilized the sense of 80s nostalgia in a way that none other than Steven Spielberg would be able to. The film delivers a brilliant message about the purpose of gaming and perhaps an extended metaphor to life much like the way in which many of Spielberg's film presents big messages in relatively simple yet heartfelt and genuine narratives.<br/><br/>Perhaps none other can helm such a project and not make us seem like a completely bloated film filled with attempts of selling the 80s nostalgia for commercial success.<br/><br/>However, inspire of these praises to the film it does seem lacking in some areas too. I personally did not see the development of the characters or the sentimental values that characters hold, even though as previously mentioned Spielberg does manage to deliver that sense of genuine emotions and themes. It's just that in many cases these aren't delivered through the characters themselves.<br/><br/>While simple but effective is often Spielberg's calling card in this case many of the story beats were predictable and thus unimpactful. Much like the recent ""BFG"" which manages a good ideology but lacking in complexion and further intrigue. <br/><br/>While the many references were certainly enough to have fans dig through frame by frame for ages there also just was this sense of underuse and lack of purpose of these characters. In other words they just seem to be there, of course it is impossible to fit all of this into the span of a movie but perhaps that is exactly why this was an absolute challenge for any director to take on."

There is infinity of references to pop culture. Any person will get a tear out, they may find their character, video game or favorite movie. It's the movie with the most easter eggs I've seen. For those born after 2000 do not worry there are also references for you. The plot is very complete, has action, love, sadness, nostalgia, and has a good development. In the end the film leaves you a message, of what reality means, friendship, insecurity, and sometimes we have to take risks and take a leap or dare to be what we want. The CGI of the film is too good makes you feel in OASIS, the performances are good mainly that of Tye Sheridan as Wade Watts / Patzival."

And each one goes out of it's way to include references to the original, include original characters aged and older, and plays on the audiences nostalgia through intertextuality (thank you Nerdwriter for that term). But none of them compare on the nostalgia scale to Ready Player One, a film almost entirely composed of pop culture easter eggs.<br/><br/>It's the future and humanity has pretty much given up on fixing the world. Poverty and corruption are rife, and people have stopped caring, instead opting to spend all their free time in the virtual world of the Oasis; an MMORPG so developed that its virtual currency and the real world currency are interchangeable, and that people go there to learn and to work, as well as escape the brutal reality of the American slums. The creator of the Oasis passed away, and left the keys to his inheritance to any player who can solve a series of impossible tasks. So impossible in fact that no-one's managed to solve the first challenge in five years. Enter Wade Watts, or Parzival as he goes by in the Oasis, who kickstarts an avalanche of quests, clues, celebrity, and corporate intrigue when careful puzzlework helps him figure out how to beat the first challenge.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple, and in fact feels like an easter egg in itself, resembling the action adventure movies of the 80s like The Goonies, Labyrinth, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. We have our protagonist, a misfit group of friends, a love interest, an over-the-top antagonist, a quest, and a series of puzzles and mysteries to figure out along the way. In the narrative department, Ready Player One is not breaking any new ground, but it's deliberately not trying to be. In my opinion this is the most subtle and foundational easter egg of the whole movie; that it feels - at its core - like a movie from the 80s/90s, and follows all the same beats you would expect from those kinds of movies.<br/><br/>As a result, Ready Player One's first and foremost priority is in pure entertainment. It's a movie of spectacle that strings the audience along for two and a half hours, and rarely flirts with anything deeper. Of course there is subtext, but it's never focussed on. The whole idea of an MMORPG taking over the lives of millions across the globe as they seek to escape the harsh truths of reality are as relevant today as they've ever been. It also flirts with the identity crisis such a dual-life would result in as well, and the blurring of lines between virtual and reality, but again it's only ever subtext and a big thing is never made of any of it. I could see the source material as being ripe for a full-on satirical interpretation, but Spielberg's movie is not it.<br/><br/>Instead, Ready Player One's depth comes from it's celebration of nerd culture (and boy did I feel nerdy watching this movie). Every frame is painstakingly filled with references to something somewhere that you would consider nerdy. Sometimes it's obvious like King Kong interrupting a race, or Iron Giant and a Gundam fighting Mechagodzilla, sometimes it's lain out in the dialogue like the offer of a Millenium Falcon, figuring out which Atari game fits the puzzle, or chanting a spell from Excalibur, sometimes it's an avatar or NPC like Harley Quinn and Joker in the virtual club, Duke Nukem being beaten in PvP, or Tracer from Overwatch in the final battle, sometimes it's an item like a weapon or a vehicle like Akira's bike (not a Light Cycle, I promise), the Battlestar Galactica, Monty Python's Holy Hand Grenade, or a coffin shaped like a Photon Torpedo in Star Trek, sometimes it's a setting like Planet Doom, Minecraft World, or the Overlook Hotel, sometimes it's something in the background like Dungeons and Dragons graffiti, a Donkey Kong Jr poster, or someone wearing a Joy Division T-shirt, or sometimes it's even an action like the T-800s thumbs up, a hadouken from Street Fighter, or a dance-off to Bee Gees Stayin' Alive. <br/><br/>And what I've mentioned is just scratching the surface. To list everything out would take up the entire review and then some, and then I'd probably have still missed out a whole bunch. And even with my own proliferation with pop culture, I still missed over half of the references when I was there, either due a lack of knowledge or familiarity, or simply because I went in deciding to just enjoy whatever I saw, and not to spend the entire time dissecting every scene. Because you could easily go into this movie and spend the entire time picking out every morsel of reference, homage, and easter egg, and end up missing the grander tapestry, at which point you have to wonder why you bothered watching it in the first place.<br/><br/>Ultimately Ready Player One could've fallen at the first hurdle. It could've skirted the easter egg rich universe entirely, or conversely made each reference feel forced and shoehorned in. Instead Spielberg toes the careful balance and makes sure that every little thing either has meaning or importance to the plot, or is so far in the background, surrounded by like-minded homages, that it doesn't even matter. Above all, everything feels natural and like it fits. There's nothing to do with sports or politics or history, it's entirely composed of pop culture spanning from the 40s and 50s all the way up to the modern day, and doesn't appear to favour any type or era of reference over another. Movies, Games, TV shows, even Music and Food are covered so long as they fit the geek requirement.<br/><br/>Of course being set in a virtual reality, about two thirds of the movie is entirely computer generated. But this is not a criticism. The visual effects are fantastic. I went in expecting some rough edges borne of entirely CGI characters, but there wasn't really much of an uncanny valley to cross as each character is so wonderfully unreal. Even for a video game, the effects are so good. It kicks it up at various points, blending CGI and live-action together really well, like with Halliday's library of memories. And of course every reference and homage is recreated to perfection as well. The Gundam appearing in the sky looked like a live-action version of the anime, and the Overlook Hotel is exactly as it was in The Shining (although a little crisper, of course). If nothing else, this attention to detail makes Ready Player One incredibly immersive. It didn't take me long to get dragged into the world so completely that I forgot I was sat in a cinema.<br/><br/>The only criticism I feel I can muster that feels fair is a bit of rushed pacing between the second and third acts. We spend so long establishing the world and getting to know our characters, and suddenly we need to have the big finale and wrap everything up, so it opts to skip out a massive key detail entirely and cover it in dialogue. Also the whole quest to find all three keys should take weeks if not months, but instead it feels like it takes place over a few days at most, and the transition between the second and third acts is so quick it literally feels like a snap of the fingers. The sense of timing is completely lost.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is just pure entertainment and spectacle. There's nothing deep going on here, there's nothing particularly groundbreaking in the more technical aspects, the characters are interesting enough to get you emotionally involved but little more. Spielberg used to be the king of Blockbusters, and while he's focussed more on period and dramatic pieces recently, Ready Player One shows that he hasn't lost his touch. I lost myself in this movie as it strung me along from one plot point to the next. If nothing else, it showed me not only how deep my nerdiness goes, but also shows how comparatively shallow it is compared to others. I give Ready Player One a high 8/10."
"amonteirojr","6","1","3","4 April 2018"," Will Spielberg bring back that lost art of making a good Matinee movie?
","It's easy to dismiss RPO the movie, it's a lighthearted and predictable adventure aimed for families with a sprinkle of oddities and hard sci fi concepts here and there but never going very deep. But that's ok because the movie does not aim for high art but for pure entertainment, and it delivers.<br/><br/>It's funny all those book fans giving crap to the movie but forgetting completely that was Ernest Cline himself that adapted his story to the screen! And I'm glad they changed it because as a movie a faithful translation of the book would be terrible, there is still a lot of telling and explaining to the audience, which is often a bit annoying but thankfully not very long, the many pop culture references are still here but organically used both as a world building tool or as plot devices that blend with the narrative and not become more important than the movie itself and only for that alone I must say this is a sucessful adaptation even if not a perfect package. And If you are invested in the universe you can still read the book and fill the gaps the movie left, they compliment each other.<br/><br/>The characters are very much archetypes, but still charming enough to invest in their journey, there's a certain naiveness that makes Ready Player One feel like an 80's movie made with today's technologies and sensibilities, i was surprised that Spielberg, at the age of 71, could still speak to a modern audience like this although the good old men still comes out with a slightly patronizing but valid message ""kids, don't waste too much time in the virtual world"" because as older people (I'm 45) we know that this is some time we'll never get back."

Fun, dumb and more fun! It may look like a kids movie but if I'm honest, unless you're over 30 and have played a lot of video games in your day, this movie may not be for you. I however, fit that category. I thought it was unique, exciting and great fun. I wouldn't care if I never saw it again but I still enjoyed myself. There were some eye rolls here and there story wise, but in Spielberg fashion, the acting and directing was great. Mark Rylance and Ben Mendelsohn killed it. So good. The main hero characters could have been recast in my opinion. They were good but nothing special. Now the Visual Effects were insanely amazing. An impressive visual spectacle with movie and video game references galore. And I mean GALORE. Like almost too much haha! Sound design of Spielberg's team was flawless and impressive yet again. Music was good but not great. Not too many memorable themes but still helped tell the story. Oh and one more thing I have to mention, the fight choreography and how it was shot was amazing! Wasn't too much of it but it was noticeably great. Compared to say, Black Panther where is was choppy editing and CGI cartoon feel. Anyway, not recommend for all audiences but if you happen to fit the target audience, you'll enjoy it for sure!"

"gdcadad","5","1","3","3 April 2018"," I give it a big MEH!
","***SPOILER FREE***
Let me begin by saying, I'm at big 80's fanboy because I lived through them during my teenage/young adult years and loved (almost all of) it! I just read the book last week and I just saw the movie today, so they are both fresh in my mind. <br/><br/>As someone who is old enough to have geeked out to all of the references in the book, the movie feels like it dumbed things down for the general masses. Too many of the exciting things from the book never made it into the movie. The movie plot is thin and it relied too heavily on the visuals, trying to make it appear to be more than it is. The hunt for the keys is too quickly/easily resolved. I know that there are details that would be practically impossible to bring to the big screen, but they took a lot of liberties with the story line in the movie and it lost a lot of its appeal.<br/><br/>The cavalcade of easter egg characters and visual references in the film doesn't make up for what is taken from the main story. I know I missed a lot of these references having only seen the movie once, but I don't care. There isn't enough interest in the main movie to keep me coming back for those hidden gems along the way.<br/><br/>Also, there is a bit of ""bait and switch"" going on because several of the songs used in the trailer are non existent in the movie. I know this happens in other movies as well, so while I'm not surprised, I am very disappointed.<br/><br/>High potential and mediocre results. 5/10"
"jimmyarnqvist","9","1","3","3 April 2018"," Seems the readers are the only ones disappointed.
","I saw the trailer for Ready Player One once it was announced and I was immediately hooked. I marked the premiere date in the calender and I have been waiting for it ever since. Once the tickets were released, I booked an IMAX-show and off I went, without any special expectations. The result? I was blown away! It is probably one of my best cinema experiences ever, and I've friends who say the same. Absolutely, the story has it flaws and from what I read, it differs a lot from the book. However, it entertains and it doesn't feel as an two-hour long movie. <br/><br/>Why is it awesome and why am I blown away? The visuals are AMAZING! Totally worth an IMAX-investment. To top the visuals, there are a bunch of easter eggs. Probably one easter egg every minute, so difficult to ""catch them all"" the first time, that I've to see it at least once more to realise how many easter eggs there is, and as this wasn't enough. The story is interesting and gets you hooked, even though it is obvious how it will end. But it is entertaining. The cast is phenomenal and very fitting in their roles. Big ups to the 11 y/o who does a remarkable premiere on the big screen!<br/><br/>Don't miss this movie out on your cinema - You'll be disappointed if you see it at home in couple of months. Go see it!"
"jacobfeltner","10","1","3","3 April 2018"," A Complete Thrill Ride, Start To Finish
","I will admit, I had read the book before going to see the movie and enjoyed the book very much. I had heard, prior to seeing the movie, that the movie was nothing like the book, so I became worried going into it. While they do take many liberties with the book, and the story ends up being vastly different, I adored this movie so much.<br/><br/> This movie is pure fun from start to finish, with some of the most mesmerizing spectacle and action sequences I've ever seen take place on screen. I was absolutely blown away by some of things I was seeing. The effects in this movie are some of the best you'll probably ever see, and are used quite often in the movie due to most of it taking place in the Oasis. This is one to see on the big screen for sure.<br/><br/> The performances are top notch in this movie for the most part as well. The chemistry between the core group of kids is very good, and they all do quite well with what they're given. The clear standout however, is Olivia Cooke. For me, she stole every scene she was in, both in the Oasis and the real world. Tye Sheridan does quite a fine job of carrying this movie as the lead actor as well. <br/><br/> Lastly, as many know, this movie is full of pop culture references. Some find this to be empty, pointless eye candy, but I honestly don't understand that. Many of the references found in the movie have actual reasons to be there, and in some cases are quite important to the plot. They don't exclude anyone from this movie either. The Oasis is very diverse among pop culture. No matter what you're a fan of, I'm sure you'll find something in the movie that is in line with you and what you like, which I found to be very cool as well. <br/><br/> I will admit the story is not super flushed out in the movie, but I found that it didn't really need to be for me personally. Everything ends up completed and answered in the end, and I felt the movie did enough explaining to where the story didn't end up hindering the movie. The dialogue isn't the best at times either, but once again, it's not an often or reoccurring problem in the movie. <br/><br/> Overall, this is a movie I will continue to watch for years. It's an instant personal classic for me, and I loved every second."

","In spite of the hype, I walked into ""Ready Player One"" with a certain level of apprehension. Given the source material (likable in its own right), it's easy to expect a movie adaptation to crumble under the weight of its own references. But what Spielberg does here (and it's to his immense credit) is tap into the adventure movie escapism that's really at the core of this thing. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, you have to work for it. The first act is pretty much all setup and cumbersome world-building, sweetened by dazzling effects. And I'm pretty sure the wealth of easter eggs are there to ensure repeat business (or at least give the pause button a workout). But it's actually what goes on in the real world - the interactions between the characters - that makes this so fun. The effects in this movie are impressive, but I found myself taken with the little touches here and there. It's when Spielberg and Alan Silvestri riff on themselves that calls to the movie fan in me. And there's an unexpected heart to these characters and this world that'll have me coming back. <br/><br/>It's a rare example of a movie living up to the book and standing on its own.

All characters are in fact extremely thin and the plot quite predictable."
"gortx","Null","1","3","1 April 2018"," A Film about Pop Icons by a Pop Icon
","The notion of pairing a film about Pop Icons with a Director who is himself one (not to mention creating much of the iconography within the story-line) should, in theory, have resulted in either something grand or a fascinating disaster. But, as with much of Spielberg's work over the past decade or more, it ends up landing softly in between. <br/><br/> The plot is pretty simple even with all the high tech diversions. In the future (2045), an eccentric Game Developer Halliday (Mark Rylance, fine as always) has created the ultimate VR world where we are told millions chose to spend much of their 'waking' hours - Oasis. When Halliday passes on, he leaves behind the ultimate 'Easter Egg' - solve three clues, and you can inherit the rights to Oasis. Halliday is like a kinder, friendlier combination of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg (complete with elbowing out his co-founder Morrow (Simon Pegg). Our young hero Wade (Tye Sheridan) and heroine Samantha (Olivia Cooke) use their knowledge of Halliday and Oasis to try and decipher the riddle. Coming up against them is a generic corporate baddie Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). <br/><br/>Of course, a film like this isn't about the plot as much as it is about the visuals and effects, and, ever the pro, Spielberg has assembled a talented team to pull those off admirably. His long-time Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski shot as much of the movie on film as feasible, but, with all the CGI parts were digitally captured and rendered. I saw it on 70mm film and it looked very good even if a movie about VR isn't the best usage of the medium. And, of course, much of the joy/task of watching R.P.O. will be a game of 'Spot The Pop Culture Reference'! Many of the images are so densely packed that it is impossible to see them on all in one viewing. This is one Blu Ray/Stream that will re-watched over and over by many.<br/><br/>There is fun to be had with R.P.O. even if it never truly takes off. The cast is game. The concept is understandable, and the payoff is suitably well delivered. But, without being ageist - this is very much a film from an older man's perspective. All the 80s and 90s references are explained as being from Halliday's childhood, but, it certainly doesn't help make the movie seem any less an exercise in half-baked nostalgia. Would kinds two decades from now really find pop culture artifacts from 65 years earlier to be the hippest thing on earth (and, in the case of Harryhausen's Cyclops - nearly 90 years)!?? A few more nods to the 21st century would have been nice. Couldn't the bland white middle-aged evil Sorrento have been a woman? A minority? A robot? But, this plays very plays like a movie that could have been made in the 80s if CGI technology had existed. As one friend said, it's like a Spielberg 80s movie - not one he Directed, but that he produced -- i.e. BACK TO THE FUTURE, THE GOONIES, *batteries not included etc.. Instead of his usual composer John Williams, we get Zemeckis fave Alan Silvestri who contributes another of his 2nd rate Jerry Goldsmith-like scores.<br/><br/>READY PLAYER ONE is a decent diversion. Spielberg is such a master that even when he outright fails (B.F.G., HOOK), his professionalism never allows them to be truly awful. And, maybe, that's a problem with his more recent work. If you don't take big risks, you rarely achieve greatness. R.P.O. isn't bad, but, it's oh so safe."

They write a book and then make a film that changes the story so they can look at it and go, ""here's what I should have done"" or ""this is better visually"". If you haven't read the book then don't worry, there's absolutely no reason you need to read it before seeing the film.

However, the graphics alone are not enough to save this film.<br/><br/>I thought the avatar designs were fantastic and I understand how a movie like this could not have been made until now. However, the graphics alone are not enough to save this film.<br/><br/>The film starts with the basic world setup and then Wade enters the OASIS and that's when the book was thrown out the window (probably 2 minutes into the movie). They removed Wade being in school, which is not bad, except that his school leads him to the first key. So no school means the copper key challenge is altered. Instead, we get a car race where the winner gets the key and the clue to the next key. Yes, the car race scene is great. Godzilla, King Kong, and dozens of other film/video game references play obstacles the racers have to overcome to get to the finish line where Anorak awaits with the copper key and the clue to the jade key.<br/><br/>Though not in the book, I love the addition of the Delorean. What I did not like is that apparently, the first challenge is now to ""drive backward"" through the race so you can go under the obstacles and make it to the finish line. Since Parzival's driving a Delorean I was hoping for a reference to 88 mph, but alas, there was none.<br/><br/>They also sped up the storyline, which was easy to do when they cut out half the challenges. There's supposed to be six of them-three keys and three gates. They eliminated the gates all together and instead just made it three keys and the first person to collect all three can open the magical door that leads to the egg. But they didn't stop there. They changed every single challenge. There are pieces of the six, but only if you know where to look. For the most part, every single obstacle they have to overcome to get to the egg is brand new. It was like reading an entirely different book.<br/><br/>I did like how they added in a caretaker who is in charge of Halliday's journals which are like home movies people can watch in a ""library"". Since it is is a movie there are certain parts that require a visual conversion so that they work better on screen. I get that, but sadly, that is-I'm convinced-the reason there is no Flycsync. The first gate challenge is supposed to be a Flycsync of Wargames and the third gate challenge includes a Flycsync of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I was so looking forward to the Monty Python reference, but they removed it entirely. They also removed all references to Wargames. Perhaps it was a copyright issue, but more likely they thought it was too meta. Playing scenes from movies within a virtual reality within a movie was going to come off as boring. What were they going to do? Cut out of the virtual reality to give us clips of the films that they'd have to use graphics to update so they looked as polished as the OASIS?
On the other hand, that didn't stop them from adding a brand new second key challenge that involves entering The Shining. We get the ax, the twin girls, the sea of blood, and the hotel. I do not understand why The Shining was added in. Why bring in that movie when you already had two great movies completely related to the actual storyline to use? Wargames is about a kid who plays a game that ends up being real stakes and Monty Python and the Holy Grail is about knights (like Parzival/Percival) who are searching for the Holy Grail A.K.A. Halliday's egg.<br/><br/>Another plus that I will give the film is the Iron Giant addition. I loved that movie and his scenes were fantastic!<br/><br/>Some of the problems I had with the film are likely ones you might not care about. For example, there seems to be an emphasis on Citizen Kane with at least two ""rosebud"" references that I can remember. Though the film is a classic and I am all for a good ""rosebud"" reference, I thought this story was an ode to the 80s, so I'm not understanding why a 1940s film is being referenced. My other problem is completely personal. I have never been the biggest Superman fan for one simple reason: Glasses on and slicked back hair = disguise. I thought that was so stupid growing up and constantly argued with my dad about that.After Parzival wins the first key he becomes famous and Art3mis gives him the ""Clark Kent disguise"" so he can walk around in the OASIS unnoticed. Why? Because apparently in the movie his avatar is made public, while in the book, he's still able to walk around without people realizing who he is. Why not just dress him up as Spiderman or something?<br/><br/>You'll notice I said that Art3mis gave Parzival the disguise, and that's because they become allies immediately. They start working together immediately. He falls in love with her and tells her at the club within the first third of the film. I really have no problem with all of that. Avatars working with other avatars is fine. The problem comes halfway through the film-that is when I decided I did not like it and I actually started to get bored.<br/><br/>Though I found the message in the book cliche (see my book review for details), I still believed it was central to the storyline. I couldn't imagine the book any other way. Apparently, director Steven Spielberg and author/screenwriter Ernest Cline could. Apparently, what I thought was crucial was something they had no problem throwing out the window.Art3mis refuses to meet Parzival IRL. She makes a point about how he'll be disappointed and how they should never reveal who they truly are. Then when Ogdon Morrow comes to collect the High Five and bring them to the safety of his home, Art3mis still refuses to meet Parzival face-to-face until after the quest is complete. He does not meet her until the very last scene of the entire book.Cliche, yes, but I still thought it was a good way to end the book. It gives us the life-lesson about the pros/cons of virtual reality and how we can be whoever we want to be as our avatars.<br/><br/>However, in the movie, they meet about halfway through. After Sorrento blows up Wade's home, Art3mis's ""guys"" kidnap him and bring them to her ""rebel base"". She's leading up a rebellion against IOI, and there's some story about her father who was indentured to them and died while working off his debts. This leads to about half of the movie, or at the very least more than I would have expected, taking place in reality. All five are riding around in Aech's van, Wade/Parzival and Samantha/Art3mis have formed an alliance to stop the evil empire IOI.<br/><br/>I swear this whole film seemed more like an ode to Star Wars. Sorrento is the evil Emperor, Ogdon Morrow and James Halliday are Yoda and Obi-Wan. Art3mis is Princess Leia, Parzival is Han/Luke, and the Sixers are the Stormtroopers.During the final battle where all OASIS avatars rise up to battle IOI so the High Five can win the egg, Art3mis disguises herself as a Sixer and brings down the magical barrier Sorrento had put up to prevent anyone from entering the third challenge. That entire scene gave me flashbacks to Obi-Wan bringing down the gravitational shield in A New Hope so Han could fly the Falcon out of the Death Star.<br/><br/>I have no problem with Star Wars references, but I just expected so much more out of this film. Sure there were amusing parts and it is a good film, I guess. I guess they found the key challenges and gate challenges too ""boring"" for a film. I guess Flycsync is only cool to me. I guess the suspense of Parzival and Art3mis not meeting until the very end is not essential to the storyline, so I guess this movie is ok.<br/><br/>As a book adaptation, I would give it an F, possibly a D-. As a movie, I would give it a B. For a Steven Spielberg film I would have thought it would have been much better."

","First of all yes, it's different than the book, that being said I still LOVED the movie, not just the movie but how people reacted to it in the cinema, you could hear gasps and ""oh my God!"" ""this is so cool"" every time a classic made an appearance on screen. There are so many hidden easter eggs and references that i will probably rewatch the movie a few times just to spot them all.<br/><br/>The special effects are AMAZING, really really amazing, Industrial Light & Magic are THE masters in their craft, this was such a complex movie in terms of VFx and animation but the result is perfection.<br/><br/>The only ""negative"" thing I would point out (and it's not even about the movie per say) would be the closing credits (i know the majority of people don't care about this but oh well), I expected a MARVELesque very visual type of credits but it was old school black background white typo kinda thing.<br/><br/>Overall i'd say go watch it, and if you have read the book, give it a chance!"

Spielberg tried but didn't succed combining this to make it a good movie. The romance in the movie also backfired making it exceptionally boring.

Don't want to talk about what happens in the movie too much, but vibes of all the classic 80s movies eminate throughout this, though don't think this is all there is. If I try to explain this in movie terms, think The Matrix and Scott Pilgrim, with a heavy mix of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (and some classic Back To The Future sound/music bites).

"Hallelujah289","10","1","4","28 June 2019"," I got the message
","After watching nihilistic TV series ""Westworld,"" Steven Spielberg's geeky love letter ""Ready Player One"" came as welcome relief. Like ""Westworld,"" ""Ready Player One"" deals with the pitfalls of technology and at times, the mercilessness of the powerful, however where ""Westworld"" falls into indulgent shoot 'em up ""Ready Player One"" actually has something to say about the disenfranchised coming together in a constructive, rather than violent way. The stories and the focus may be different, but in a similar landscape of advanced gameplay technology ""Ready Player One"" shines as the story I want to remember, because it shows the best and the worst of human nature.<br/><br/>""Ready Player One"" impresses because it while it is a PG-13 family film it shows the consequences of violence in appropriate ways. Characters can hurt, their family can get hurt, and adults don't always think much of children or their mortal lives. While calling out treachery (especially of conglomerates), ""Ready Player One"" also showcases the worth of friendship and the penalty of sacrifice. Friends willing to risk what is most valuable to them make for deep connections in the film, and sometimes ten year olds are people whose character we can aspire to. Children's films like ""Smallfoot"" which also came out in 2018 don't connect because there is no risk so there is no reward, and also there is no connection to the characters. Unlike in ""Smallfoot,"" what I enjoy about ""Ready Player One"" is its consistency and the way it goes there if it really is gonna go there. Stephen Spielberg doesn't shy away from showing an emotional brutality that can exist, but he also doesn't shy away from what can replace that given the chance.<br/><br/>Not having watched any trailers, I didn't know what to expect with ""Ready Player One,"" but I enjoyed its mix of retro 80s soundtrack and advanced CGI. I haven't read the book. I didn't even know there was one. But I did enjoy the film on its own merits, and most of all for the kind of open-eyed (instead of blind) optimism it has. I really feel like this is an excellent film for reasons that goes beyond its production values. No, I didn't always enjoy the character designs or kind of the fact that both the lead actor and the creator of OASIS remind me of the way Stephen Spielberg looks like (although I don't really begrudge a harmless nod at self-portrait, if that's the case), but still I enjoyed the kind of values like integrity and teamwork and loyalty that went into the film, enough so I want to recommend it to everybody in today's jaded era."

","If you've read the book, you will hate this movie. If you have not read this book but have seen any other movie ever, you'll probably still think this movie is pretty poor.<br/><br/>It's a great story (in the book) but they mangled it so much only the general synopsis & character names are the same. It's soulless pop-culture references are thrown together with no logic or charm, clearly the screenplay had no geeks to give helpful advice like ""Halo is poop for jocks so don't reference it, unless you are going to have the lead geek disparage it."" I'm not hating on Halo but I'm questioning why they didn't reference Skyrim, Doom or something more geeky & less obvious.<br/><br/>The casting was quite bad, a typically Hollywood cast of good looking wood & painted plastic. Given this is a story about geeks it was very strange to see how pretty they all are. Obviously future geeks will spend more time in the gym than at their computer. Not a single memorable performance given in the entire thing, the Simon Pegg narration was about the best performance of the lot & I'd say that was one of Pegg's most forgettable moments.<br/><br/>Most of the added plot points don't make sense which combines with illogical story telling to render the ending haphazard & unsatisfactory, It felt rather bolted on in the typical Spielberg way. He's a good director but a terrible story teller & he really needs someone to explain that having money + directing talent does not make one a good creative writer.<br/><br/>I give this a 4 because the CGI was very good, the set scenes were well placed & they did get the world (real & virtual) very accurate to the descriptions in the book. That being said this shouldn't have been called Ready Player One & the character names should have been changed."

So many reasons to be... 
The first reason is it has a lot of Easter Eggs that I was amazed to see in one movie.
The second reason is that the story and the way to tell are new and cool.
The third reason is the cast, the cast was good in the VR mode, but it was not that good outside of it!
The fourth reason is the CGI, it was fine as a movie in 2018, but as a story-line in 2045, it wasn't that good.
But it wasn't mistake-less, it has some drops too!
The biggest one is that the voices weren't fitting on the Players in the VR mode.

","There is a common tool used in movies that makes you say ""Hey I Recognize That!"". This movie took that concept and made an entire movie about it. The utter lack of creativity on the part of the writer is appalling. He had not a single original idea in his tiny little brain so he stole the iconic parts of every successful movie and jammed them into a soggy pile of human excrement mixed with a heavy dose of colors screaming in your face so that someone will say ""Hey I recognize that thing!"""
"NarniaIsAwesome","3","1","4","26 August 2018"," Ready Player One is... Predictable and a Bit Monotonous.
","The only reason I bothered to watch this film was because of the 1980's element I saw in the trailer. I realize the movie was based on a book which I have not read, so I cannot compare it to that, but I can say that it was a disappointment.<br/><br/>My first criticism is that there were not enough 80's references for me - not visual ones, at least. Yes, they had a DeLorean, a 'The Shining' sequence, and Mechagodzilla, but I hoped for more Starsky and Hutch/Dig Dug/Terminator stuff! Clearly, the scriptwriters felt that teenagers (the target audience) would not understand or appreciate any more deep cameos.<br/><br/>And then we come to the general story: kids living in a cliche ratty future who rely on a really weird dude's game to get rich. The action scenes are honestly dull because there's too much going on and we know what will happen anyway. But not like we care, because the characterization is useless.<br/><br/>'Ready Player One' is a film for teens that don't really care about the 80's who like watching other teens be cool by having spiky hair. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because they play some nice oldies songs."

"cristiandeiana","1","1","4","24 July 2018"," An absolute pile of garbage
","So let me get this straight, I'm supposed to believe that society has fallen apart and people are all obsessed with gaming. We aren't even given a clear explanation about what went wrong with the world, which should clearly be an important factor to help drive the story. People can apparently play games everyday without a care in the world, and I feel like I would have to be completely ignorant to just accept that and enjoy the movie without questioning this fatal flaw. If you want to watch a story about a world harnessing the power of VR then watch Sword Art Online. At least the anime can identify more realistic issues concerning the overuse of such technology and its effect on the real world.<br/><br/>A sci-fi is supposed to at least attempt to answer such questions, and to paint a world which is believable enough for the story to be built around and so in retrospect it falls very flat. Even the characters are very flat, with no attempt to build any depth into their character or backstory, which leaves you feeling no connection or care of any of them.<br/><br/>Not only does Ready Player One fail to tackle any of these problems, but in itself as a movie it's mediocre at best. As a comedy it's predictable, as a romance it's cringe worthy, and in fact all it has going for it is it's lame overuse of CGI and over the top action scenes. We are living in an age where we have the most incredible resource of technology available to us to make high countless high budget movies, and in that sense we're really lucky. But all we get are is an endless collection of superhero movies and rubbish like this. <br/><br/>I'm disappointed with cinema for creating such garbage, and Steven Spielberg should be ashamed of himself for creating such a thing. People need to stop promoting and advocating such rubbish because it's killing cinema."

A group of kids hunt for an easter egg inside of the most popular game on the planet (or so it seems). They have to outsmart, and outwit adults and big corporations as they search for the magic egg that gives the finder control and major ownership of the game. We have kiddie romance, murder, and all sort of stuff along the way but that is about it. I laughed exactly once during the Terminator 2 scene but honestly, the movie was not funny and the CGI action was not particularly impressive if you are a gamer already.

"jackmeat","8","1","4","20 June 2018"," Great movie, didn't read book, reviewed as a movie
","My quick rating - 8,1/10. I will make this clear. I did NOT read the book. This is watched and reviewed with that aside and do yourself a favor, don't read the IMDB reviews because all you will get is ""the book, blah blah blah"" and zero stars. In other words, people who don't understand how to rate a movie. This flick is a visual beast, I cannot stress the sheer amount of detail that is conveyed through this movie. It is almost astounding that the CGI has come to such levels as this, to blend in and out of the real world seamlessly. Of course, through action scene after scene you know it is all animated, but you won't think a lick of that as you just watch in awe. Granted, a $100+ computer generated demo wouldn't be worth your 2.5 hours, but if you take a story and mix in some characters as well, you will find a hit. I really didn't think Spielberg could still pull off such action, yet with emotion, but alas, he does. The characters themselves, aside from the lead, aren't introduced in the real world until a ways in, so you kind of learn who they are long before you see. Kind of like the Internet, huh? What this movie has, is the creator of a video game world, called the Oasis, that exists in virtual reality and basically everyone lives in the oasis. It provides your gaming, dreams, life experiences, etc. All the things you want to do, but can't in the real world. This is partially one of my flaws of this movie. Assuming the Oasis is ""Facebook"" lets say (last income report shows Facebook has 1.35 billion unique members) what do you think the chances of 5 people becoming online friends all live within miles of each other? Ok, put that part aside but it just isn't gonna happen. So as our characters are very briefly introduced, minus the main character, Wade (Parzival), we learn little things about them through their interaction in the Oasis. There really isn't much development to them, then again, they didn't want a 4 hour movie either. The nuts and bolts are there, enough to make sense to their avatars in the Oasis. Well, the creator (who had to be around my age) dies, but leaves behind an easter egg (hidden treasure in the Oasis to win) that grants the winner of three keys, in various challenges, the rights to the entire Oasis, and all the stock, and power that comes along with it. As anyone would want this sort of power and money (the word trillions is used) everyone is vying to solve these puzzles and win. This is where all your action comes into play. But along the way, human emotion does get involved, and leads to the actual underlying theme of this. Yes, throughout you may have thought it was just ""How many 80s references can you jam into a movie?"" but really this is more of the game creators life unfolding to another generations eyes. Along with this, the movie also does a decent job of pointing out the real life struggle of how trapped one can become into this online world, ultimately to the point of losing ones identity. There are quite a few ideas that are tackled in this film and though they aren't all crystal clear in how, the end will at least give you an idea of what the movie was trying to say.
Now back to the book thing. One movie, in particular, that is imitated in this movie is ""The Shining"" and is done quite well, I might add. I will tell you this, if you, like me, read the book first, and then saw the movie ""The Shining"" you would be irritated due to the changes that were made. But if you go on, as I did not, and slam that movie, just like people slam this one, then you don't know how to critique a movie for its own merits. I am not going to go out of my way to read the book, and if I do read it, and agree that much was lost in translation, I won't be coming back to change my opinion. Just sit back, enjoy the plethora of cool references to the past, and enjoy a great movie for what it is. A visual masterpiece, a story that may become all too relevant in the near future, and a good time."

I got an hour into this film and had to turn it off because I found myself angered by the whole plot... it is not the same as the book at all, it is hardly even based against the book, unless you count the name, the names of the characters and the fact there's a completion, nothing, at all is the same.

","I was a bit disappointed by this film. I enjoyed the book and I love Speilberg's films as much as anyone else, but I was not a big fan of how they handled this story. This is also how I feel about the characters. I think they could've spent more time on Wade in real life. I also thought they explained the OASIS well and I really loved Mark Rylance's performance as James Halliday. <br/><br/>Although what may be my main issue with the movie is the romance set up with Parzival and Art3mis. I just couldn't believe it. I thought Art3mis gave into Parzival too quickly especially since she showed him how much she didn't care for him earlier in the film. And I thought the chemistry between them in real life was even more rushed and unbelievable.<br/><br/> I also was not a fan of TJ Miller's character in the movie, and thought Ben Mendelson's character as the CEO of this very large company trying to win the Easter Egg contest in the OASIS in order to profit off it, was taken down too easily. This also applies to his attitude at the end of the film that seemed like it didn't fit. However I did think Mendelson gave a solid performance as he does in most of his movies.<br/><br/>There were also many plot holes in this film that I noticed throughout my watch. Maybe one of the biggest ones that I can't seem to understand is how Parzival/Wade didn't notice the hidden message in Halliday's message until the moment that was convineint for him, despite him stating that he's watched it (if I remember correctly) hundreds of times or more. The rules in the OASIS also weren't always so clear and didn't alwyas apply at the certain points in the movie. <br/><br/>It's a good and enjoyable movie with beautiful visuals and nice action scenes, however it hard to oversee some of the clear flaws that the film presents.<br/><br/>RATING: 7.3/10"

With ample opportunity to contrast the virtual utopia with the real world of the impoverished Stacks (towering trailer parks amidst dystopian Wall-E landscapes), Spielberg cuts between realities, with little of the flair of his far superior sci-fi Minority Report. In a virtual realm where your avatar can be literally any thing you like, references to gender or race are reduced to quick gags. The greatest confusion lies in the ""real is good"" and ""big corporations bad"" morality, which seems to want to critique the use of entertainment to distract the populace from real world politics and economics, but then says forget that, let's just have some fun!<br/><br/>Aside from Rylance, the entire cast (even Ben Mendelsohn) struggle with two-dimensional characters and dialogue served with a whopping side-order of cheese. But is it bad writing or sly-satire of clunky 1980s teen movie dialogue? Still, this is Spielberg, and whilst it's over-puffed, over-stuffed and over-long, he delivers one stand-out sequence, serving up an amazing tribute to Stanley Kubrick, which also plays on how books and films are very different things indeed.<br/><br/>Confused tone, message and target audience (it wants to be a family movie, but has a mature rating, with a few scenes that'll likely scare little ones, and a smattering of adult language), but the special effects CGI bonanza looks great. No drama or tension, but in terms of bold, brash, unashamed blockbusting popcorn munchers, Ready Player One definitely entertains."
"kieranljones","8","1","4","25 April 2018"," One of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in the last year
","Greatly entertaining, visually stunning geekfest... Loved it. Could have been developed further with a darker undercurrent but it is a movie for everyone (tweens included) and I don't feel this significantly detracted from it... Still sufficient levels of violence with blood replaced by villains bursting into coins etc, quite well done I think. <br/><br/>People who are moaning about it being different from the book..... Who cares? Go review the book. These are reviews for a movie."
"Ptlolbblhrth","Null","1","4","25 April 2018"," If you go to movies just for CGI, hollywood propaganda and no story...this is your movie.
","Anybody claiming this is an 'instant classic' has no taste. There I said it. Now on to the review.<br/><br/>First and foremost yes I have read the book. What might you ask are the differences between book and movie? The movie keeps the hunt, Oasis, character names and title...basically everything else is different. Hyperbole? You decide.<br/><br/>OK even ignoring the book (for the most part) this was just bad.<br/><br/>There is a fortune up for grabs and it's all yours for the taking if you can figure out the clues. How do you ask do you compile your research? Go visit the library that was conveniently built just for this hunt. No no personal notes aren't necessary that would require work on your part.<br/><br/>You have a race that everybody fails to complete but they just keep trying over and over the same way...for years.<br/><br/>You are in a 'virtual' environment with goggles that block the real world but run down the street like you are holding a rifle shooting. No nothing bad could come of this. Never<br/><br/>Or better yet you randomly jump, punch and kick the air in front of you on real city streets to do things in the virtual. Completely unnecessarily and makes no sense but hey it 'looks good' on film so lets do it anyway.<br/><br/>You have a multi-story structure that is notoriously unstable that has bombs going off on it. What do you do? Run towards it even after it starts to lean towards you. After crashing right on your heels (after you know your brain kicks in and the 'OMG I'm going to die' gets you running the other way) you walk away without a scratch.<br/><br/>Later you are abducted by some mysterious resistance who's base is immediately raided by the Sixers (convenient? no not at all) then your 'love interest' who just happens to be a member sacrifices herself and gets caught so you can get out a convenient (see a pattern) hatch and are again conveniently saved by your 'bro' who randomly shows up out of nowhere and turns out to be a woman but after just a few lines of dialogue you trust 'her' completely and go along...<br/><br/>After a 'climactic' (or cliche could be used) car chase and ending back up where you started in the 'stacks' the common folk storm out to confront the big bad who was chasing you. Do those hundreds of people (that are within arms reach of him) rip him limb from limb...no no he pulls out a pistol that he holds aloft and the 'seas part' for him. Because you know pistols fire like miniguns that have infinite ammo and they were all going to die...<br/><br/>To top it all off the bad guy is such a moron that when he invites our 'hero' in to threaten him he has his password for his rig on a post-it note in plain view. <br/><br/>This is just off the top of my head. To say it could have been so much better is a no-brainer at this point. Go read the book and forget about this ridiculous nonsense.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it a 2 was because the CGI was pretty well done and those people deserve credit. Everyone else involved with the movie should be ashamed. This includes the author of the book. I am tired of giving them a free pass while they sellout and their works get butchered."
"clemens-mm","4","1","4","11 April 2018"," Unemotional and uninspired overlong CGI ride
","The movie failed to trigger any emotions and therefor any entertainment. It felt bland, generic, forseeable. Also it relies way too much on unimaginative CGI. Here and there has been nice ideas but they either felt rushed or forced. <br/><br/>Beside that due all the CGI it felt more like an animation movie than anything else. The story was nothing more than a 3 line pitch. <br/><br/>In comparison Wreckin' Ralph really dived deep into computer games history at a much better pace. So better watch Ralph again than this mess."
"eduardo-g-melguizo","6","1","4","10 April 2018"," even worse than the book
","The book being a horrible piece of fiction, but quite profuse in its imagery, a movie seemed like a really good chance to build on its strengths and try to round the story and the characters into either a decent movie for kids/young adults or a good sci-fi product.<br/><br/>disappointingly, the only thing that remains is the imagery (watched it as IMAX 3D, I imagine lots get lost with any other version) and a hint at the end about a very different movie focused on Halliday (which could have been but is not).
Mark Rylance and Olivia Cooke have good performances, even when their parts do not lend themselves to that. for the rest of the characters, there is simply not enough entity to build anything. maybe this was meant to be a larger movie at some point (a better one too).<br/><br/>everything else is a fiasco, with a not well developed 2nd act, a therefore lazy 3rd act, and plenty of rolling eyes moments. comedy is interspersed here and there and references are thrown around like some people use cheddar on salads: just because it's there in the fridge and what the heck, let's use all of it. that's a problem with the book as well, but at least the book operates as a window into the mind of the writer (meta-interesting, not interesting itself). here it seems just an attempt to make it more palatable to audiences of all ages, without really trying to provide any consistency.<br/><br/>6 because, hey! it is movie kind of coherent and some sequences are actually entertaining, maybe even worthy of another watch. just not the movie as a whole."

The first part did a good job sticking to the first part of the book, so I am looking forward to finishing the book. The special effects are great. The 80's and 90's nostalgia are mixed in very nicely. The character development was done quite well too. Unlike Star Wars The Last Jedi, this movie was not full of SJW / liberal feminist agenda.

"TheMovonka","8","1","4","7 April 2018"," Happy Easter...Egg
","Ready Player One may be criticized and reviewed out of many perspective. Let me summarize it like this. Alongside a quite weak and superficially installed story where virtual reality becomes standard daily life, a mediocre cast pulls through 140 minutes try hard writing including all the modern e-sport wordings they could collect. So most of the general viewers would rate it as an ordinary fantasy/action movie. <br/><br/>Still, I have never experienced such pop culture celebrating festivity for the joy of 80is and 90is kids. If you have a little nerd in you, have been playing video games and watching movies during your life time and feel happy to see Ninja Turtles alongside with Halo fighters supporting Japanese anime characters and hints for our all-time favorite movies like ""Back to the Future"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Breakfast Club"", ""King Kong"" or many more, well then enjoy smiling to the screen, looking out for more hints and goodies in the background and jump on the quest of Ready Player One to rescue the OASIS. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg used his pack of licenses, contacts and that he is the creator of so many pop cultural artefacts to present us a never ending avalanche of lovable things we players and movie enthusiasts can relate to. Not an ""outstanding"" movie, but a great homage to our inner kid!"
"julenpadilla","8","1","4","7 April 2018"," A fun time
","This movie had the lot. Great CGI, cool transitioning effects, and a decent plot at that. I think the focal point of this film were its references though. It goes from the 80's and upwards. People of all ages will surely get at least a couple of the references demonstrated in this film. It's a great time for anyone, and you won't feel as if you absolutely wasted your money by watching this. I at first questioned this movie asking myself if it could sustain itself apart from all its references, and it sure did. The plot is unique in its own way but at the same time having a predictable outcome, which makes it alright for a movie that heavily rely's on its pop culture. The movie was colorful and didn't feel stale at any given time, ensuring that the audience were kept captivated. Ignore all the negative reviews, this is supposed to be an enjoyable nostalgic film filled with lots of action, and it does just that."
"sultan-5","7","1","4","7 April 2018"," They forgot how the movie got its name
","OK, OK, OK. I won't bore you with another description of how this movie isn't like the book. Well, except I kind of will, in a different way.<br/><br/>Before I begin, though, as a stand-alone movie, it's pretty good. Really, I see a lot of haters on this site, because it does pretty much get way off track with the book, but as a movie judged by itself, it's good. If you haven't read the book, then you'll probably enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>And, I have to say, the integration of The Shining -- a classic -- as a key quest in the movie was enjoyable. Even if it wasn't in the book.<br/><br/>But I have two complaints about the movie that I didn't see in other reviews.<br/><br/>First: In the book, there is a subtle reference to Parzival being named for Percival. Percival was one of King Arthur's knights who, in some versions of the story, was the one who found the Holy Grail. Subtle foreshadowing as to the outcome of the movie. Clever. In the movie, Art3mis just spells it out for you early on just to make sure you got that. No nuance. No fun later when you make the connection on your own.<br/><br/>Second, if you see the movie without the context of the book, you'd have no idea at all why it is named Ready Player One. As a valentine to '80s pop culture, the book makes you wait until very near the end but does give you the revelation. There is a dramatic moment in the book when Parzival learns what his final challenge will be when he suddenly faces the screen all of us who came of age in the '80s (i.e., popped quarters in stand-up arcade games) remember so well: Ready Player One. That moment was totally squandered in the movie. It could have been used to powerful effect. Instead, it didn't even make it in."
"trashliev","10","1","4","6 April 2018"," Great Improvement

Oooh, Im facing this task and it just happens that somehow Im the best at, and really really fascinated with some lame one square game, or a silly movie from the 80s, which no one even born in the 90s cares about, image those born in 2033... Empty references dont make a good story. But for its target audience was fine, Rihanna has sold more records than the Rolling Stones and their 60 years career, no wonder the book is a hit. Great premise though, Spielberg saw the potential and gave some lessons how it should be done."

"theblurbq","9","1","4","5 April 2018"," Ready Player One: Press Start
","Steven Spielberg's latest film is an adaptation of the phenomenal Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. While the movie differs from the book, sometimes greatly, the core story is still the same: nothing beats reality. I had to see the film twice before being able to write a fair review because it is so visually overwhelming that you completely miss lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>Spielberg's film opens with a walk through the Stacks alongside our lead character narrating how humanity got here; but it's when we enter the Oasis that Spielberg truly proves he is the master of film making. In an age where technology is starting to dominate everything, filmmakers are faced with a unique challenge: how to preserve analog in a world of special effects.
Well known for his unique ability for story telling, Spielberg chose the perfect story to show the world that you don't have to choose between analog and CGI, you can have your cake and eat it too. The world of the Oasis is so fantastic and boundless that you completely understand why everyone lives inside of it instead of the real world, sort of like a reverse Matrix. The fact that the Oasis is virtual reality makes it an easy sell for CGI.<br/><br/>While being eye-poppingly pleasing, Spielberg is also true to the message of Ernest Cline's best-selling book. Our hero of the story Wade Watts, aka ParZival, sees the Oasis and Halliday's prize as a way out of his crappy life as a poor orphan sleeping on his aunt's washer and dryer. It's only when he meets our heroine Art3mis that he realizes there is something truly bigger going on around him.
Relevant to what is happening in our own time, it is centred around the fact that it only takes a small group of dedicated people to change the world, for better or worse. It also highlights one of the main downfalls of social media, people creating a false version of themselves online either for confidence reasons or malicious ones.<br/><br/>The film is tremendously fun, packed with pop culture icons from not only the 80's but the 90's, 2000's, and present, making it even more relatable to people of all ages. It's a classic story of the underdog rising up to save the day and get the girl that has been modernized for our generation. 
Ready Player One is a perfect example adapting stories, the film is both close enough to the book to make readers incredibly happy and different enough to stand on it's own, something only Spielberg can do. Ironically it also serves as a great template on how to make a video game movie."
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","4","5 April 2018"," A Quest for Easter Eggs
","In a way I probably shouldn't be surprised that a film about a kid hunting for Easter eggs in a computer game is full of Easter eggs. In fact, this film seems to be somewhat of a tribute of everything that happens to be Eighties pop culture, even though it is based on a much more recent novel and has also been set in the future. Still, is you want to see the protagonist drive around in the Delorian from Back to the Future, then this is certainly a film to watch.
 To be blunt, I actually quite liked this film, and it actually met my expectations, which is very, very rare when it comes to a film. A part of me, upon discovering that Spielberg had directed it, was satisfied that I was going to enjoy it, though it seems that he has been hiding away for a while, only to suddenly make a come back (though it seems he has basically been behind the scenes a lot). Then again, this film really seemed to drag me back to the golden age of my childhood, and kept me interested all the way through.
 For those who don't know, an Easter egg is a hidden thing in a computer game that die hard enthusiasts go out of their way to look for. Mind you, I've never been that dedicated to a game that I would go hunting for Easter eggs, but interestingly the term has now also transferred over to movies to refer to subtle things hidden in the film that usually gives a nod to something that came along before.
 The film is set in a dystopian future where everybody plays in a game called the Oasis, namely because life in the Oasis is so much better than life in reality. The founder is your typical computer geek who has no social skills whatsoever, and even though he made a mint out of the game, he has resisted temptations to flood the players with advertising. However, he has died, and has left a challenge for the first person to find the three Easter eggs he has hidden in the game, and in doing so they will pretty much gain ownership of the game.
 Not surprisingly there is an evil corporation that wants that coverted position, and they are basically pouring huge amounts of money into the project. Mind you, I get the impression that they are pretty much making a bucket load of money anyway off of the game, but as is the case with many of these companies, they always want more. So, the film comes down to a struggle between a group of kids and this evil corporation over who will win.
 In a sense this film seems to be about a war against those who are seeking to monetise fun, and to monetise it at whatever cost. In a sense there is no limit as to some people's attempts at making money, and when the stakes are high, they will go out of their way to tip the playing field in their favour. In the end it is always a question of money, and there is simply an attitude that any problem can be solved simply by throwing money at it. However, it is the little guys in this film that win out over those who really seem to be cheating to tip the balance in their favour. Another thing that seems to come to mind is this whole debate over net neutrality.
 Another thing about this film is that it had a lot of elements of Charlie and the Chocolate factory, though you never know Wonka's plans until the end. Yet, like that film, we have the rich kid who gets to where he wants simply by throwing bucket loads of money at the problem, yet in the end is never actually able to overcome his own shortcomings. As in this film, money doesn't always mean that you will get what you want, because sometimes the knowledge that you need to complete the problem is just a little out of reach."

"springfieldrental","9","1","4","4 April 2018"," Spielberg's still has it!
","At the age of 71, Spielberg still has the energy and creative juices he did in his heyday on rolling out his latest work, ""Ready Player One."" He has been quoted as saying this movie was the toughest work he has expended making a film since the production of ""Saving Pvt. Ryan."" Whatever sweat Spielberg had perspired in creating this soon-to-be classic was well worth it. 
""Ready"" is more than a simple comic book-based picture. Ernest Cline, who wrote the book ""Ready"" is based on, expands his screenplay on the underlying theme of the movie with a message today's obsessive video gamers should learn from and adopt. 
Spielberg himself is an avid gamer, as detailed in the book ""The 15 Geniuses Behind the Lens."" The director's pastime, which he incorporates visually and rhythmically-paced in all his action films, serves as an ideal template in ""Ready."" His selection of the New York Times bestseller of the same name is a natural for Spielberg and his mastery of the incredible interchange between reality and virtual reality is breathtaking. 
As others have noted, the episode of ""The Shining"" is the highlight of ""Ready."" To incorporate all the memorable moments of the Stanley Kubrick classic was seamlessly integrated into the film. 
The only nit-pick I have in not giving a full 10 stars was the drawn-out Godzilla battle that resembled more of a Marvel Comic sequence than the brilliance Spielberg exhibited in the rest of his film.
It is rare an audience breaks out in applause at the end of a movie. But the showing I attended the place erupted in spontaneous clapping, appreciating a well done and well-deserve recognition of approval. This film is not to be missed, especially on a big screen."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","1","4","4 April 2018"," What we really have...
","Steven Spielberg's ""Ready Player One"" is somewhat the paradox, in both good and no so great ways. As ""Ready Player One"" opens, we see Ohio in 2045 with vertically stacked trailer homes. It's the home to 18 year-old Wade, played by Tye Sheridan. All the while we hear ""Jump"" by Van Halen from their ""1984"" album, back from my youth. <br/><br/>Spielberg orchestrates nostalgia for 1980's and '90's culture, which reveals as part of Zak Penn and Ernest Cline's screen narrative based on Cline's 2011 novel. The worthwhile message that what we have is our reality, and risking yourself gives life is nearly lost in 2 hours and 20 minutes of visual spectacle eye candy, and intense action for thrill sake near the end. <br/><br/>""Ready Player One"" tells the story of the perils of the constructed virtual reality world called OASIS, where game created avatars compete to discover the 3 Keys. Possession of those Keys grant the victor reign of OASIS from its late Creator Halliday, played by gentle suffering Mark Rylance. <br/><br/>Master gamer Wade's avatar is cool handsome Parzival. His intimate rival is beautiful free-spirited Art3mis, played by strong vulnerable Olivia Cooke, who intends to beat him. <br/><br/>Much of the story occurs in the virtual OASIS, where authentic risk, danger, and even love are not necessarily real. Or are they? This where ""Ready Player One"" falters somewhat. Although, the visual imagery evokes that sense of wonder in the amazing motorcycle races, and cool high tech. Wonder lies in the love story of Parzival and Art3mis. Dancing together in the air of the rave-like club, Art3mis cautions Parzival that he doesn't really see or know her. That he might be disappointed. <br/><br/>That discovery in the real world is the most intriguing and human story. In that world Wade poignantly says, ""I'm not disappointed..."" That made the movie for me. I think Steven Spielberg seems so compelled to marvel the audience in the thrills of OASIS, instead of trusting the unique humanity of Sheridan and Cooke. Love stories really move. Spectacular visual CGI effects and lifelike human capture amaze, but are essentially narrative gravy. <br/><br/>""Ready Player One"" is the tale of the brilliant man, who didn't risk falling in love and regretted that for the rest of his life. Consequently, he created the virtual world OASIS where he could simulate the greater he never risked. And the rest of the future world in 2045 embraced living that virtual life as opposed to the real one. Perhaps, this is our caution for the obsession of virtual reality games, social media and similar constructs. <br/><br/>Toward the end ""Ready Player One"" bogs down in gamer war and chases. The movie could have easily been half an hour shorter. Fortunately, Tye and Olivia's collective humanity remind of the purpose of it all. What we really have is reality in life. And what makes that all worth it, is taking a risk and having faith."

","A visual spectacle jampacked with so much information, it's almost impossible for one puny human brain to process it all.

If you are a movie and video game geek and you were born in the 70's you will adore the nostalgia. Millennials will love the message of fighting the corporate behemoth of greed and inflation that will probably make this Oasis world a very distinct probability for the vast majority of us that will be priced out of the world of luxury that is dangled in front of our eyes by the financial elite. (Many of us are now living the majority of our lives in screen virtual reality already.)

"therealmoftf","6","1","4","3 April 2018"," The best video game movie ever created, but nothing like the original book
","Now let me start off by saying that I am a massive fan of the original novel by Ernest Cline. It is one of my most treasured pieces of literature, and as a gamer, it appeals to me on pretty much every level.<br/><br/>This next segment is important: before you walk into the theater to watch this movie, you have to remember one thing: THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING LIKE THE BOOK. Only about 15-20% of the original story is present here in Spielberg's adaption, so if you were hoping for a 100% accurate recreation of the book, I'm sad to tell you that you won't find it here.<br/><br/>Is the book better than the movie?
Yes, in pretty much every way. The clues are way harder to find, more thought out, requires the main character to also find something called ""Gates"" which has been entirely scrapped for the movie and it has a way more pressing atmosphere of risk and defeat. It's, in a way, more realistic. So if you enjoyed the movie, I HIGHLY recommend you to go pick up the book, as it is simply a better and more detailed experience.<br/><br/>Now, is the movie still good?
Yes. Yes it absolutely is. The visuals are stunning, the audio is well put together and the story is relatively easy to follow and immerse yourself in, even if you're not a gamer at heart (like a lot of us are).
If you are a gamer, you're definitely going to appreciate all of the references Spielberg put in this. Whilst watching the movie, I made it a point to try and spot as many references as I could, but that turned out to be impossible, as there is simply too many to catch all of them in only one viewing of the movie. But I'm pleased to report that the references I did catch definitely satisfied me and even made me laugh at times.<br/><br/>Summary:
Ready Player One is a one-of-a-kind adventure that pretty much has to be experienced by anyone who calls themselves a gamer, or is interested in any form of gaming or pop-culture. With amazing visuals and jaw-dropping action, the movie is pretty much just a lot of fun to watch. Just don't expect it to be like the book in any sort of way, because then you are going to be disappointed."
"Spoffdarko","4","1","4","3 April 2018"," Disappointed
","This is a difficult review for me to write.<br/><br/>First and foremost I am a huge Steven Spielberg fan. I firmly believe he is one of the finest film makers the world has ever seen. Right up there with Kubrick, Hitchcock, Lean, Kurosawa, Lynch and the other great pioneers of cinema.<br/><br/>E.T. was the first film I ever saw in a Cinema, and as a 6 year old it left a huge impression on me. I have followed Spielberg's career and films ever since, I have read many books about him, watched interviews, documentaries, and all the extras on all his films. I almost feel like I know him personally. He is to me, like Halliday is to Wade Watts, someone to be looked at in reverence and awe. His films shaped so much of my childhood, and I will always be grateful for his contributions to popular culture. So many of the cultural touchstones we enjoy and take for granted nowadays would probably not exist without him.
So, with a heavy heart, we come to Ready Player One.<br/><br/>I was extremely excited to learn that Spielberg was starting production on a film centred around a Virtual Reality universe that made huge references to 80's popular culture. When I first heard about it, I decided to pick up a copy of the book (which I had never heard of). Having read the book I enjoyed it, but did not think it was amazing, just quite good. The film, however, I felt had the potential to be something spectacular. I thought the collaboration of Spielberg and Cline would take the book, and with a little re-writing, a tweak here and there, bring it to the big screen in awesome fashion.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the fact that he was a little ""starstruck"" by working with Spielberg, but I cannot believe how much Ernest Cline has allowed his material to be torn to shreds and thrown in the trash can. Worse, actually, that he co-wrote the script, so he must have excised a fair chunk of it himself. I would genuinely say that a large proportion of the book is not present in the film, the setting, characters, and a handful of references and scenes are all you get. I would say 75% of the book is gone. I understand fully that books need to be changed and adapted to be made into a film, but something went massively wrong with Ready Player One.<br/><br/> I simply don't understand how the team behind this production (including Cline himself) could consciously allow this hatchet-job to happen. I am by no means an Ernest Cline fan-boy, but there were so many scenes in the book that would have translated brilliantly into the film (and not even ones that required licensing deals) and these great scenes were discarded. I won't spoil it by describing what the scenes were, but some of them would have given us more sympathy with Wade, instead they were glossed over and we don't really see his plight of having almost no money, no prospects, and living pretty much hand-to-mouth in a dystopian society. He just comes across as a surly teenager, which in the book, he is not. In the book he is a likeable guy who is struggling along in a life that has dealt him a poor hand.<br/><br/>Two of the challenges for the keys were changed completely, and this is to the detriment of the film. The original challenges should have been kept (or kept and changed slightly if licensing was an issue) and the ones created in the film (whilst, admittedly, being spectacular to watch) should have been side-line challenges that Wade takes part in and not the key challenges themselves. Many of the 80's music and videogame references are simply not there, perhaps due to aforementioned licensing issues? But for a film that sold itself on a retro 80's pop-culture vibe, the 80's nostalgia feeling I had during it was surprisingly low, I think that was mainly down to the music and there not being enough of it or having the wrong music playing in the wrong scenes. For example, Van Halen's ""Jump"" is totally wasted in a scene where Wade is just making his way around the Stacks. The music was put to far better use in the trailers (which, incidentally, were better than the film itself).<br/><br/>Much of who does what, and how things pan out in the story has also been changed around drastically, basically to give the actors something (or a bit more) to do. Art3mis is brought into the real-life part of the story far too early in an attempt to give the story some emotional grounding, unfortunately their relationship in the Oasis actually works better and is more believable. The villain Sorrento remains pretty much as he does in the book, but at the end of the film appears to have some kind of a change of heart that made me feel nauseous. <br/><br/>Even after my rant, there is some good stuff to be had here. The visuals are absolutely incredible, there are some references which catch you by surprise and are very welcome and there are some genuinely thrilling and funny scenes. In particular, the back-story of James Halliday and Ogden Morrow is played out well (even though you don't see very much of them).<br/><br/>So, all in all RP1 for me was a disappointment. After following the project from the beginning, watching the trailers almost every day since they released my excitement for this project had reached fever-pitch. Sitting in the cinema waiting for the film to start my hands were trembling slightly and my mouth was dry, I could actually feel my elevated heart rate, that is how much I wanted RP1 to blow me away...It failed.<br/><br/>I have to close by doing something I don't want to have to do. I have to lay the blame for my utter disappointment at the feet of my hero. I am so sorry to say this, but I fear he may have lost the magic that made him and his films so special. Spielberg was by far the most influential person on this project, ""The Captain"" as it were. I feel that this time ""The Captain"" steered the ship so far off course that no-one knew where it was going until it was too late. I don't understand how something with so much potential could have gone so wrong in the hands of a true genius.<br/><br/>The last 15 minutes of the film are a complete waste of time, some of it is actually laughable. I almost get the feeling that the end of the screenplay was not proof-read, and was just filmed mindlessly with no actual real thought behind the outcome.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you can't guess what happens, Wade wins. Then he decides to perform a huge rug-pull on all the people who risked their avatars in the battle to help him win. He closes the Oasis on Tuesdays and Thursdays, apparently to make people spend more time together in the real world. So after all his speech about ""I love the Oasis so much, are you willing to fight to help save it?"" he shuts it down for 48 hours a week...Cheers buddy! As a gamer he should know better than anyone how angry gamers get when the servers go offline for ONE hour!<br/><br/>What a shallow and soul-devoid hero Wade is, did he spare any thought for the people who earn their living from the Oasis? who receive their education in the Oasis? the lonely people (which Wade once was) who have no family or friends and use the Oasis as a means of social interaction? apparently not...<br/><br/>You see, Wade is now ok after his big win, he has a nice girlfriend, a nice fancy loft apartment and a fat wedge of cash in the bank. Who cares what closing the Oasis a couple of days a week will do to the people who are left in the slums?<br/><br/>In the end, Wade shows early signs of becoming the very thing he was fighting against in the first place...<br/><br/>Shame really..."

And for five years nothing has been uncovered, until Wade( Tye Sheridan ) begins to stumble upon a clue, and starts to go further, but a big cooperation will stop at nothing to make he doesn't.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Steven Spielberg really shows he's still got, I'd sit through this more times then A Wrinkle In Time. The effects are enjoyable, so where the pop culture references, and yeah there are plenty of them. Although through the first part when in the real world it was pretty dull, but that got better has it went. Scenes in THE OASIS are also fun. The actors play there roles perfectly, everybody just really shines. Sometimes it's not about the ending, but more about the journey, and Ready Player One is a prime example of that."
"catorrence1","10","1","4","2 April 2018"," A great adaptation for a great story
","As a fan of the book, I was intially skeptical that things would be radically different. But what made me so relieved when they announced this movie was that they hired Ernest Cline, the author of the book himself, to write the screenplay. What this does is allow the author to tell a different story that he wanted and had the ability to but still maintain the essence and spirit of the original story (one reason why the Harry Potter series did and is doing so well because of J.K. Rowling's involvement). Because of that, the changes were understandable and they did not hurt the over all story at all. <br/><br/>A bunch of people are saying stuff like 'too much nostalgia' and 'not as good as the book'. I have two things to say to these people:
 1) nostalgia is literally on every page of the book. Since it's this nostalgia that Halliday, the creator of the OASIS, chose to use to hide his massive fortune in, and only those true fans of what he loved in the 80s could use it to find his fortune, the nostalgia's overall importance to the story is significant. 
2) Books will always be better than the movies. It's hard to condense a 300-400 page book that one could read at your own pace into a movie that has a limited amount of time to tell a story. Some changes will be made, but that doesn't mean that the spirit of the story is missing. The creator of the YouTube channel Cinemawins makes an interesting point: '9 times out of 10 the book is better, so why spoil the movie?' He's talking about the experience and spirit that the movie brings. And since Cline was involved in the screenplay, that spirit of 80s nostalgia being used to forward a coming-of-age story and the characters using that nostalgia to hunt down the greatest fortune in history which is hidden in a massive video game is everpresent in this movie. <br/><br/>If you like the 80s and even early 90s, you'll love this movie. If you love the book, you will enjoy it if remember that changes happen between book and movie. If you want a good enjoyable experience then go see this movie because it's one this year's best movies so far in my opinion."
"eternalcreeds","8","1","4","2 April 2018"," A Hero's Quest for All Ages
","First of all, do not compare this movie with the book, because there are some things which need adjustment for a transition from a book to the big screen. It's no surprise that movies need to make profits thus it must appeal to as many audience as possible. <br/><br/>If you enjoy video games and movies in general, RPO is a fun ride. It uses the familiar hero's quest plot that everyone can relate to. It's not too complicated or too complex, which is a good thing considering this is also a movie for kids above 10 or so, but still has rooms for the older ones to recognize the 'easter eggs' in the movie. As a fan of video games and movies, I found myself smiling everytime I spot a reference that I am familiar with. It's visually beautiful too, though sometimes the CGI felt a little bit unrealistic/cartoon-ey when the players are inside the OASIS.<br/><br/>Although there is a lesson about how technology plays a role in our lives nowadays, the movie failed to portray several things like the background of the world in 2045, why Wade Watts lived in the stacks and what is happening with the world (disasters, hunger, energy crisis, etc), which should've been an interesting point to present. It also lacks the depth of the characters' development and their motivations (except Art3mis). It somewhat felt like Spielberg wanted to focus more on the pop-culture references as much as possible than the psychology of the characters.<br/><br/>The portrayal of James Holliday is amazing. Mark Rylance played him brilliantly. Hands down my favorite character in the movie, which sadly deserved more on-screen time.<br/><br/>Regardless you're the fan of the book or not, it's not a movie to be missed."

This is not to say the movie was perfect. It has its flaws, but most of them are minor. And if time is given to think about the story for a few minutes, many of those flaws can be easily explained.
This is not the book. Anyone expecting this to be a translation from page to screen will be sorely disappointed and angry. But this movie still holds its own and can stand on its own feet.

The villain speaks to so many current game industry issues relating to getting as much money as they can out of gamers, feeding off and trying to build addiction. Seeing so many throwback and current pop culture and gaming references made me smile every time but it also had a lot of heart. This movie is even more relevant with the growing popularity of VR and so I think this is a great time for it to be in theaters.

Visuals were amazing as well as plot development and pacing. I wasn't bored for a second, even in the ""real world"" scenes, the movie managed to pull me in. Also helped by a strong cast. There are references galore as well as many suprises. As a old school horror fan, a certain sequence mid-film is probably one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a movie.

"terrellrobinson71","9","1","4","31 March 2018"," Steven Spielberg + Ernest Cline = Pure Pop Culture Fun! Wanna Play?
","For someone who has grown up with some of Steven Spielberg's films whether it's suspenseful and intense (""Minority Report"", ""Jaws""), shocking heart-grabbers (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List""), made from the heart stories (""E.T."", ""Hook"", ""The Color Purple"", ""The BFG"") and of course, purely fun spectacles (""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", the ""Indiana Jones"" films), It's safe to say that Spielberg is the master of filmmaking. So imagine my delightful surprise when I found out that he decided to take on Ernest Cline's pop culture bonanza ""Ready Player One"". As it turns out, after seeing Spielberg taking on real-world dramas like ""Bridge of Spies"" and ""The Post"", the movie version of ""Ready Player One"" is Spielberg's return to the fun, good-hearted blockbusters we all know him do so well and he has managed to craft an even better adaptation of the book that I would've expected, imagined and thought of. Set in Columbus, Ohio in the year 2045, the story is about Wade Watts (the appealing Tye Sheridan), a timid young kid who hides from his trailer home known as ""the Stacks"" (In which trailers that stacked from the ground upwards one after the other) and enter into the virtual reality world known as the OASIS. A world created by the late James Donovan Halliday (the excellent Oscar-winner Mark Rylance, one of Spielberg's regulars) and Ogden Morrow (a terrific Simon Pegg) where you can be anyone you want and do anything you want. Before he died, Halliday created an Easter egg in the game in which the winner will win his entire fortune of half-a-trillion dollars and control of the OASIS. So, Wade, known as Parzival in the OASIS, along with his best friend Aech (Lena Waithe) and his first crush, the Manic Pixie Dream Girl, Art3mis (the feisty and energetic Olivia Cooke) goes on a extraordinary quest to look for the egg once they have to pass three missions and collect three magical keys. But there are other people, like the IOI (Innovative Online Industries) and its ruthless leader Nolan Sorrento (a appropriately slimy Ben Mendelsohn), his sinister sidekick F'nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen, a wowzer) and bounty hunter i-rOk (an comically smarmy T.J. Miller) would do anything--really, anything-- to get to the egg first so they can control the future for their own sake. It's a lot to take in, but Spieiberg knows what he's doing in terms of delivering an visually exciting adventure on such a grand scale with a lot of Easter eggs that we need to keep more than an lookout on. There's some clever nudge-nudge, wink-wink's to ""Back to the Future"", ""Alien"", ""Gremlins"", video games that we used to play or currently being played and there's even a sequence set to Kubrick's ""The Shining"" that is a dazzler to experience, even in 3D. What's even more impressive about ""Ready Player One"" splits the line between the virtual-reality world (which was done with Motion-Capture Animation) and the real world. Screenwriters Zak Penn and Mr. Ernest Cline himself manages to keep the spirit and the heart of the book intact, but also creates some genuinely exhilarating sequences, cool surprises, warm human moments and slyly quirky humor that it's hard to resist the moment you step into the world of the OASIS. Even some of the characters including Daito (Win Morisaki) and Sho (Philip Zhao) gets some dimensionality than we expect. ""Ready Player One"" is pop-culture fun from start to finish. Much like the book, a lot of people will love it, some will hate it. But the real amazing thing of this film is that audiences will get to experience Spielberg make movie magic again and much like Halliday's Anorak, he lures us into this world as if he is the creator of the OASIS himself. It's awesome seeing the man at work and the movie rocks because of that. Game on, Gunters! Game on."
"burlesonjesse5","7","1","4","30 March 2018"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Ready Player One
","Ready Player One is my latest review. It has director Steven Spielberg channeling his inner Blade Runner, his inner dystopia suture, and his inner young adult. For instance, check out his lead actor (21-year-old Tye Sheridan). Tye kinda looks like Spielberg did back in the early to mid 1970's. Trippy.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Player"" is Steven's take on virtual reality in slumming Columbus, Ohio (circa 2045). Although overwrought, over-plotting, and overlong at 140 minutes, Ready Player One still comes off as one of the best technical achievements of this year or any other year. Oh and by the way, Jobe Smith, aka ""the lawnmower man"" called. He wants his new and improved simulation headset back, stat!<br/><br/>Now Steven Spielberg's career in movies has spanned to almost 50 years. He has made bad films (Hook, The Post), boring films (Lincoln, Bridge of Spies), and stupendous masterpieces (E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark). ""Player"" while totally recommendable, gives you your money's worth yet falls somewhere in the middle. <br/><br/>In truth but not drowned disappointment, ""Player"" is not as invigorating, emotionally engaging, or majestic as Steve-O's finest work. Still, Ready Player One has an eye-popping look that's one for the ages. ""Player"" is a candy-coated fever dream, chocked full of pop culture references, blink-and-you'll-miss-it moments, 80's relics (Atari), 70's and 80's tunes, and elaborate movie references (you won't believe what Spielberg does to reenact Stanley Kubrick's, The Shining). Seeing this flick once is not enough for every scene has blotches of special effect nooks and crannies. Heck, once the DVD comes out, you'll be hitting the scan button like a mother.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I mentioned earlier that Steven Spielberg has been directing for five decades. I'm not lying when I say that this is unlike anything he's ever done. To my dismay, I thought no A-list filmmaker could reinvent the science fiction wheel with cojones the size of Texas. Guess what, Stevie came in and proved me wrong. Bottom line: Ready Player One gets a three star rating from me. With its lushness, its forced razzle dazzle, and its yearning to be unabashedly avant-garde, I might be ""ready"" to see it again."

"regula1","7","1","4","30 March 2018"," A Return To Big-Screen Spectacle, But Not Spielberg's Best
","At the heart of this adaptation of Ernest Cline's 2011 novel is a fairly simple premise: the real world sucks, but a virtual reality world called the Oasis allows people to forget about reality for a little while. For Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), that concept is enough. But there are others who want the Oasis for themselves, and still others fighting to stop them, with virtual consequences spilling out into the real world.<br/><br/>The mainstream appeal to this film, at least based on the advertising alone, is the nostalgia vibe that permeates this film, like so many other films and TV shows these days. And this is certainly a reference-laden film, what with the main character's vehicle of choice being a certain time machine.<br/><br/>However, aside from all the references is a story of a struggle between the little guy trying to keep a good thing going and maybe improve on it for the benefit of the people and an evil corporation who sees only profit in their world, and will do anything to claim the throne.<br/><br/>The key lies in the storytelling, and for the most part this film actually manages to tell a well-paced story that gives just enough technical details to keep you going but doesn't bog itself down in minutia. Though the film does sometimes go out of its way to indulge in a reference, most of the time sticking the landing, the fact is it comes dangerously close to going overboard in its treatment of pop culture references, especially if the same fact is repeated several times in the span of a few minutes.<br/><br/>The main disadvantage of this film is when it leaves the virtual world and enters reality. We as the audience bond to the virtual avatars of our main characters, and beside the villain, who we see more in the real world than the virtual, we see relatively little of our protagonists in the real world, which is a good thing sine the actors and actresses, though competent, really don't engender any lasting connection between character and viewer.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say this film is best appreciated on the big screen, but probably not at full price. Be prepared to do some Googling if you didn't live through the 80s."
"hjalsayegh","7","1","4","29 March 2018"," This is not the book.... at all!
","The movie is an adaptation from the book of the same name. The writer himself Ernest Cline is created as one of screenplay writers which suprised me. This movie... has nothing to do with the book. <br/><br/>I expected a few changes, that's normal considering the amount of references to pop culture in the book and how licensing works for movie adaptations. Thing is even the plot, characters and end message were changed. <br/><br/>This went from a coming of age story, a boy learning that escaping to ""his oasis"" is not the solution. You have to fight for what you want. sacrifice everything for those you care about. There is also a message in there regarding the dangers of corporate takeover of the net, seven full years before the net neutrality issue came up. <br/><br/>What does this one do? The challenges are changed completely. The characters that he meets along the way and is united with them against a common enemy are his buddies from the beginning. Even the lesson changes to simply... the power of friendship. <br/><br/>That's it. Oh and gaming is for the young that love to play not corporate thugs, who fund their development and market them in the first place. <br/><br/>To me this is such a childish plot it's barely a six star movie however because of all the nostalgia they throw at you and the epicness of the final battle I'm adding one extra star. I'll admit, it was nice seeing some of my favorite characters from the 80's and 90's on the screen battling it out. The kid in me liked it but the adult that I am was disappointed with the overall emptiness."

Yes, I was alone in the theatre, therefore I could shout with glee at every 80's reference I spotted out. Just so you know I owned and played Atari's Adventure, and too this day thinking it was not as cool as ColecoVision's Venture!! But anyways, the movie was pretty bad ass, some of the best CGI interacting with humans yet!! This movie revolves a young boy named Anakin Skwalker, oh wait, Wade, who lives in a bleak future, no its not a Netflix sci fi, the poor are poorer and, well you know. But too escape it all there's the OASIS, a virtual reality world, where you can virtually be anything or anyone. The creator of this world was a super genius and now also a corpse, but before he went off to chill with Hawking, and Chris Farley, he hid some easter eggs in his world and created a contest, in which the winner, gets to rule OASIS. But of course the virtual world is also a cash cow for greedy corporations and they have created a virtual army, but made of real people, virtually, that train virtually night and day to win it all for themselves. Luckily for Wade he has a pretty rad group of pod racing virtual friends to help him on his quest... Along the way meeting Art3mis, spoiler alert, sparks fly between the two avatars, does Wade ever meet the girl hiding behind the avatar, well ya know she doesn't really look like the avatar, and Wade is all about love man, so looks don't matter. Unfortunately when they do meet, our worst fears are true, shes a monster. She has a huge birthmark across her face, children run in terror. But Wade true to his word, sticks it out.

That is just reality.<br/><br/>But this movie diverges so much from the book I'm really surprised they even still called it Ready Player One.<br/><br/>That being said if you can somehow put the book out of your thoughts and view this movie as something completely different it is certainly visually entertaining and showcases the capabilities of CGI.

It is fun and it is worth the 7.5 rating, but it drags on a bit and the characters are not overly exciting. I think it might be the fact that each person in the film is two characters so it is hard to connect with them. Don't get me wrong, this is a movie you should go see for sure. It is fun and entertaining and filled with action and great scenes that will take you back to your childhood. <br/><br/>The special effects are amazing, as you would expect, and the story is told in a compelling way, as you would expect. The problem really comes down to the actors are not that strong and the writing is a bit rushed. Of course the film is over 2 hours so I understand why they had to rush through the story as it was adapted from a book that was very detailed and had 400 pages.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, or rent it.

They made sense given the film needed to be for a wider audience, and you can't fit the whole book into a 2 hour movie (I get very tired of reading reviews where people are disappointed about things being left out. I guess they all want a 5 hour movie?) Overall I really enjoyed this. It captured the spirit of the book while being its own thing entirely."
"valen060","8","1","5","2 April 2018"," Wired and Geared Up! Log On to Spielberg's Virtual Thrill Ride!
","I was overwhelmed with the last four decades of pop culture nods and tributes to video games, TV, music, and film throughout that I didn't even know where to begin on this! The virtual concept began to remind me of titles with near similar parallels to Sword Art Online and Dot Hack Sign in terms of individuals who enjoy online gaming, but find an objective that will change their lives completely compared to ordinary play. Whereas the destructive action sequences are reminiscent to say, Tron and Akira.<br/><br/>In 2045, Wade Watts is an average individual who lives a derelict lifestyle in the slums he calls ""The Stacks."" He finds his escapism by entering a virtual realm called The OASIS, where its creator and founder James Halliday has unfortunately died. In his video will, he may grant one player astounding wealth to those who can find an Easter egg he personally hid somewhere in this virtual space, leading to an all-out treasure hunt.<br/><br/>Since the mid-70s, Steven Spielberg has taken his audiences on many adventures in various places of different eras whether it be fantasy or even real-life events in history, including meeting the unique characters that appear onscreen. They would fascinate, enthrall, or even touch us in an emotional way and Ready Player One (based on the book by author Ernest Cline) is another interesting addition to his library of amazing titles. The cast did splendidly, especially Tye Sheridan as the lead guy Wade who starts off as a simple gamer with no ambition. Then upon meeting unique users that share similar interests, it's a team-up that's worthwhile. Likewise for TJ Miller as mercenary and scene stealer I-Rok is a great stand out. I may not have read the book at all, but it doesn't really matter if you did or not. Never once was I lost in the film's story. The choice of classic 70s and 80s era songs also provided mesmerizing accompaniment and nowhere short of spectacular in the most pivotal scenes. It also contributes to a lesson in the consequences of greed, technological dependency, and non-conformity in the film's true nature. Left me pondering over how society may reach this fate if not tread lightly.<br/><br/>Won't be disappointed. Pop culture at its finest! GAME ON!"

When I saw the skyline, I couldn't help myself. I pointed at the screen and shouted like a kid ""It's Columbus, I can see it!"" But there was one inaccuracy that really irked me.

"stevendbeard","8","1","5","31 March 2018"," Stunning Visuals
","I saw ""Ready Player One"", starring Tye Sheridan-Cyclops in X-Men:Apocalypse, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse; Olivia Cooke-Bates Motel_tv, Ouija; Mark Rylance-Dunkirk, Bridge of Spies and Ben Mendelsohn-Darkest Hour, The Dark Knight Rises.
This movie is based on a book by Ernest Cline and is directed by Steven Spielberg. It takes place in the not too distant future, around 2045, when most people spend most of their time playing a virtual reality game called Oasis. It was created by Mark and you can do anything or be anyone in the game-it's only limited by your imagination. As you can guess, Mark is rather wealthy and he leaves a video will-knowing he is going to die-saying that he has left 3 keys hidden in the Oasis, and whoever can find all three will win his entire fortune and total control of the Oasis. Tye and Olivia are the top scorers-both are big fans of the 1980's, as was Mark-and their biggest competition is a corporation run by Ben. Ben is the typical corporate greedy type that will do whatever it takes to make money. The visuals are stunning and their are lots of Easter eggs scattered throughout the movie. It's fun just waiting to see who you can spot next, from the Iron Giant to King Kong to ....well, I don't want to spoil any of the ones that are not shown in the trailers. The music is good too, if you like that 1980's period. I remember hearing Rush, Van Halen and the Bee Gees just to name a few. Overall, I really enjoyed it-FYI: For a movie with lots of Easter eggs, I figured there might be an extra scene after the end credits, but alas, there wasn't.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action, violence, bloody images, language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 20 minutes.
I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"lawrenceconwayvulcan","9","1","5","30 March 2018"," A visual blast
","In the early 2000s Steven Speilberg made 2 future dystopia movies. A. I. Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report that to be fair left auidences cold. However his return to the sub genre is unlikely to suffer the same fate. From when the first bars of Jump by Van Halen plays we get an adventure that is a blast from start to finish. Much has been made of the use pop culture references in the film, I quite enjoyed them in particular The Shining sequance which faithfully recreates the film. Tye Sheridan makes for a dashing hero and Oliva Cooke more than holds her own as the girl of his dreams. Ready Player One is up there with the best of Spielberg's entertainments."

"TheMovieDiorama","8","1","5","30 March 2018"," Ready Player One hosts an exciting online lobby filled with childhood nostalgia.
","It's extremely easy to get consumed by the tidal wave of pop culture. The moment the Iron Giant appeared I'm sure many thought ""ehh meh gewdd take my money, best film ever, Overwatch rulez!"" but, let's take a step back to critique the film and not the references. The world is entranced by an online virtual world known as the Oasis, where the recently deceased game designer has hidden three keys that lead to his fortune. A group of rebels try to find the keys before a tyrannical corporation take the money for themselves. It's good to see Spielberg back at what he does best, crafting big family blockbusters. His technique and style is riddled throughout the long runtime which in itself feels nostalgic to the likes of 'E.T.' and 'Jurassic Park'. On a side note, I shall not be making comparisons to the book as I've not read it (ain't nobody got time for that). Having said that, this film was SO much fun. I've never smiled so much during a cinema experience as I consistently muttered ""oh that's the bike from 'Akira'. A Gundam? No way! Ohhh he just performed a Hadouken!"". Part of the appeal is the barrage of pop culture that immediately sucks you into the virtual world that has been intricately designed. The narrative, which dips occasionally, balances the virtual universe with reality to create a simple yet compelling story. Like a video game, it's incredibly linear with a few plot conveniences but that in itself feels reminiscent of retro adventure games so it actually works. Character development was satisfactory and tackles the inherent issue of romanticising with online avatars who could look completely different in the real world. Supporting cast were great although I felt Sheridan was slightly underwhelming as he constantly gave dramatic speeches about the Oasis. The visual effects were absolutely stunning, even during chaotic action sequences everything was crystal clear and beautifully directed. I could watch this film forever and not want a ""Game Over"". The definition of entertainment."

It also spark some good conversation in the car on the way home which Is the mark of any good film. I own some movie theaters and have booked and played many of Mr. Spielberg's films over the years and would like to thank him for a steady stream of good films.

"Afflock","9","1","5","30 March 2018"," Very good film. Fast pacing and engaging storytelling makes the time fly.
","The storytelling has Spielberg's touch. The visual affects are top notch by ILM and made me realize how much CGI has been improving from them. The IMAX 3D was rendered well and not the over-the-top in your face variety but added to the storytelling and wonder of the OASIS. It is best to forget you read the book when seeing the movie, as many aspects were adjusted for the medium. Though, the author of the book Earnest Cline was a screenwriter and kept the concepts, many aspects were altered for storytelling reasons. Felt like Ready Player One was inspired by the book but only loosely based on it. It did keep much of the nostalgia, but with fewer expositions, and expanded the time period for the references to be more relevant to younger audiences. <br/><br/>The movie did feel compressed to keep the action and pacing steady, which caused some things to be left unexplained, though it benefits the movie experience. It is a good popcorn flick and will stir conversations with friends afterwards. Can see how the DVD will be popular to pause scenes to find all the Easter Eggs. <br/><br/>While the only real negatives come from comparing book to movie, which is the case with almost any screen adaptation of a book, this is a solid movie on its own and worth watching and would recommend the IMAX 3D format."

"keal","8","1","5","29 March 2018"," Extremely mediocre film on all levels
","As a fan of Spielberg's films, I was disappointed at how generic the story was, and that many of the crucial action scenes have the typical Hollywood choreography where the actor jumps a chasm, for example, and juuuuust makes it to the other side - first missing it but then using an item like a pick to stab the wall and is hanging from the end of the tool. Whew, just made it! I sighed and facepalmed now and then when scenes like this came up, which they did with growing frequency towards the end.<br/><br/>As a gaming fan, I thought everything was a total miss. No real retro game characters like Pac-Man. What few characters were recognizeable were shown in the trailers. The movie was all about solving puzzles, and they were all centered around non-gaming stuff, mainly 80's pop culture stuff. Nothing went deep into gaming skills or techniques. It's as if the whole video game atmosphere of the movie is just to mask a simple adventure story. The worst part? The entire movie hinges on a video game that only a supergeek would have an interest in seeing onscreen. I shook my head during the climactic scene.<br/><br/>As a nostalgia fan, I really think the movie really failed to deliver. The music throughout the movie only helped remind me how lame the 80's actually was. References to old movies were not really pointed out. Much like a tourist on a trolley through a place like Universal Studios, it's up to us the viewers to point at the screen and tell people around us 'oh that thing is from the movie blah blah and oh that thing is from....'. The movie really felt like a boring tour of pop culture. Where a movie like Guardians Of The Galaxy infused comedy with the pop culture references, this film just puts stuff up on the screen so it can be noticed, and then it's gone. No humor, no fun.<br/><br/>To sum this movie up, it's a really cliche Spielberg action film with poor videogame and pop culture references just tossed in with no real heart. Watch this movie once if the trailer piques your curiousity, but this will make you glance at the time on your smartphone if you dare watch it again. Spielberg seems to be weak in the comedy department, which is what Ready Player One sorely needed. Best part of the movie? Olivia Cooke. Sadly she was on rails with the script and couldn't exude her usual deadpan comedy skills as she did in Thoroughbreds, a great film which just left the theater before this movie came in."
"gerry_barnaby","10","1","5","29 March 2018"," Epic Masterpiece of pop-culture and a reflection of how the movie and game industry is.
","Wow Steven Spielberg once again shows that he hasn't lost his touch in making an epic masterpiece and visual effect movie that has so much nostalgia, spanning three decades of pop-culture that anyone that loves gaming and films will recognise.<br/><br/>I read that Steven Spielberg and his wife read the book, which prompted him to make this film and what Ive heard is the book itself is very fast paced and basically tell you everything, but it one of those cases that the film is actually better than the book. 
Rather than having the same old story where character give everything away by explaining everything or having to explain everything to the audience, were given a 2 hours an 20mins epic ride of visual effects and nostalgia from gaming, anime and movie character that has spanned across from the 80's to today's industry that the audience will sit in ore of just how awesome this film truly is.<br/><br/>You might be thinking ya it just a film about nostalgia with a weak plot, but you would be wrong their, what Steven Spielberg has done with this story is add something between the line of the film's story itself. It's one of the biggest middle fingers to the companies that have become corrupt not just in the gaming industry but the movie industry as well.<br/><br/>You may be thinking how is this possible? well, it's a sutal hint with the main villain of the film played by (Star wars: rogue one villain Ben Mendelsohn who plays Sorrento who in the virtual world look like an old school evil superman character. 
What I mean is his character is a perfect representation of companies like Konami, Activision and EA, which if you're a gamer like me you understand what I mean by that, the film as a whole is a perfect representation of the state of the gaming and movie industry has become today in our world with microtransaction and corporate greed.<br/><br/>I love how Spielberg has secretly put this in the film very clever as it works for the story as well and doesn't compromise it any way, special the acting with Tye Sheridan playing the main role of the film with an outstanding performance along with co-star Olivia Cooke as well as the rest of cast as well this film is just outstanding.<br/><br/>From what I saw there are at least 100 or more characters spanning across so many games like battle toads, halo, Comand and conquer so many more as well as movie characters like Chucky which was hilarious to the iron giant to anime and Comic book characters from DC. Seriously this film is like a porn film for nerds and geeks alike with all this nostalgia and the epic battle scene which won't disappoint this truly is a film not to be missed.<br/><br/>The Music choices as well just add the films perfect direction and the sutal message's this by far is one of the best films of 2018 and a must to watch. This will most definitely be the most paused film on home video with look for certain characters."
"hanshoffnung","10","1","6","5 May 2018"," If you are more or less 50 years old you MUST see this movie
","Aimed at our generation, the ones being teens in the 80s, the references to our culture are countless. You will enjoy every single moment of this movie, with NO bad moments, just a compilation of nice things we loved.
The CGI usage is at the top level, surpassing even Transformers. The race, the dance in Oasis, and everything is so amazing that i will watch this movie many times just to enjoy them.
The 35mm choice is winning because we old school people know that nothing beats analog film, and coupled with anamorphic lenses you get that Spielberg look that has market the success of the most successful director in history.
Go an give yourself a present, enjoy. 
This movie will be part of the top 100 cult movies of all times IMO."
"moviemattb","10","1","6","30 April 2018"," Ready Player One Is Roger Rabbit For A New Generation!
","When I first the trailer from Comic Con, I just got completely hooked and have never felt this much hyped on Steven Spielberg movie in such a long time. After making some drama movies, Spielberg was able to return on making fun entertaining movies again, like when he made movies that were fun such as ""Jaws,"" ""Hook,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Minority Report,"" and many to count. The movie itself is based on a book by Ernest Cline while he co writes it with Zak Penn, as the movie itself is about a teenage boy name Wade Watts as he lived his life at the stacks in Columbus, Ohio. He has a huge admiration of James Halliday, the creator of a place that takes inside virtual reality called the OASIS, where everyone can do all the things they want to and it is filled with many pop cultures references as it deals with movies, video games, 70s and 80s music, and more. Watts goes into the OASIS as his avatar Parzival, where he comes across with some friends he meets and has a crush on girl name Samantha Cook and her avatar Art3mis. However, an evil cooperate name Nolan Sorrento as he is trying to take over the OASIS, while finding an Easter Egg that Halliday has hidden. So Wade and his friends must save the OASIS, and retrieve the Easter Egg before it gets into the wrong hands. Before I continue, this will not contain any spoilers as the movie had just come out a while go, so I rather you go see it without ruining the surprises. This movie is filled with surprises, and really had such a fun time to see this on the biggest screen as possible. I thought the story that I describe it, may sound similar about good guys stopping the bad guys before getting into the wrong hands, but for what it is I think it is told well for what it needs to be. The characters as I'll admit, there are some moments where you a know bit about their backstory (particularly Wade's and Samantha's), but not develop enough. Despite this, they're still likable, and I do have some relations to Wade's character, as he is like me that he really admires Halliday for being one of his idols and learning so much history about him as he has so much love for nostalgia. For me, I have so much an admiration for some of my favorite filmmakers like Spielberg, for example, as he has a love for making movie and always has a passion for telling stories, and getting to know about the characters. Wade is somewhat relatable, and nothing more I can say about. The cast in this movie all did great. For the adults, Mark Rylance, Ben Mendelsohn, and Simon Pegg have all given very good performances, but for the young actors Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke are outstanding, as they both have a really great chemistry, and the romance is somewhat sweet. For Alan Silvestri, I thought his music was really good, and I think I can barely hear the ""Back to the Future,"" when the Delorean pops up. Made need to listen to the score as I bought it off on iTunes and I can't wait to listen to that. Sure it would've been interesting for Spielberg's longtime composer John Williams to do the music, but Silvestri isn't a bad choice. The action in this movie are exciting, and really enjoy hearing some familiar songs that appeared in the movie. Especially hearing the song ""Jump"" by Van Halen, when it was heard in the 2nd trailer. The special effects are terrific, and the mo-cap work here is top notch. I really did enjoy seeing the references in the movie like the Delorean, the bike from ""Akira,"" Batman, and of course and probably the best one is seeing the Iron Giant kicking butt. Before I end my review, I just want to bring up that the movie is very different from the book. I have read it twice, and really love it, but there some portions that the movie strays away from. So if you are expecting to be more like the book,then you'll be disappointed and won't accept any of the changes they made. If you want it to be different from the book, then you will have a great time. The movie is definetly a love letter to pop culture as well as 80s nostalgia. Also, it really does have a nice heart to it, and I am more than happy for Spielberg as he had to accomplish for taking such a challenge on how to adapt this book into a movie that deals with pop culture. What you know it? He nailed it! For the movie, not only is it going to be in my top favorite movies of 2018, but in my top favorite Spielberg movies. And another thing, when Hollywood adapts popular video games into a movie, they pretty much failed on every level, but this movie is probably going to be one of the best if not the best video game movie of all time. In conclusion, ""Ready Player One"" is Roger Rabbit for a new generation, and you are going to have a wonderful time at the movies. I am giving it a 10 out of 10."
"huskyguy-78089","1","1","6","14 April 2018"," how did this got made into a movie
","So I have seen Ready player One movie and most of the way through the book.<br/><br/>I really do not know how in the hell this got made into a movie. It is a boring book that sounds like an ""best of"" list of music, movies, and games of the 1980s. That should not be surprising to anyone who has read it. <br/><br/>The movie it self blows past plot like a bullet and relies heavily on 3D cameos to fill the seats. I can not say in good conscious that I did not get pumped when I saw my favorite IPs in the movie, any fan boy would. That is all it has to offer, cameos.<br/><br/>All in all it was and is a poor set of entertainment, literature, and film."
"nickcr","9","1","6","6 April 2018"," It's not the book....thankfully
","So the book was ok but to read some of the reviews on here you would think it was Shakespeare. Yes, it's different to the book but the book was shallow fluff anyway and lets not kid ourselves otherwise.
The film was a fun, popcorn romp of a movie. It's not Citizen Kane but it's not Ishtar either. Go there with an open mind, plug in and enjoy."
"ollie1939-97-957994","7","1","6","6 April 2018"," Good Spielbergian fun, even if slightly unremarkable
","As with many, Spielberg is one of my idols in filmmaking. I defend him against many of his detractors as he has consistently made some of the great ""popcorn munchers"" and some wonderful historical dramas that have truly stood the test of time. That being said, it has been a while since I loved a Spielberg film (his double whammy of Catch Me if You Can and Minority Report in 2002 being his most recent greats). His films since then have been relegated to ""good"" or simply ""passable"". Even films like Lincoln haven't really stayed with me as much as Spielberg's earlier works. Sadly, Reader Player One has fallen into that category. That's not to say it's a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit. However, it's a flawed film in which many of its elements could've been drastically improved upon. 
As someone who read the source material, the many changes to the book didn't bother me too much. The novel did give me mixed feelings overall anyway. On one hand, the child in me enjoyed reading references to pop culture that I love. On the other, it suffers from an overabundance of ""nostalgia porn"". Those who enjoyed the novel might be disappointed that so much has been changed. Those who didn't might enjoy the film more. For me, I did appreciate the changes as it made it more exciting for someone who has already read the book.
The biggest problem with the film are the characters. None of them are bad but they don't stick with you at all. All the actors do good enough jobs, but we never really feel their plight enough because they're very poorly developed. Without spoiling anything, there's a moment in which the protagonist Wade suffers a terrible loss. Yet, we don't feel anything because we don't care about him enough. The characters are mainly a catalyst to get to the next exciting set piece. Since we don't care about them though, it makes the action less exciting. Halliday is the most interesting character, but Mark Rylance is underused. His relationship with Morrow (Simon Pegg) is one of the most compelling but we don't see enough of it to get invested. The movie suffers from an insane amount of exposition in the first half an hour. Whilst it is nice knowing how the Oasis works, this time could've been better spent developing the characters, especially Wade. On a side note, Simon Pegg also suffers from the same syndrome that Benedict Cumberbatch suffered in Doctor Strange, that of ""Iknowyourebritishsojustbebritishdonttrytobeamerican"" syndrome.
However, the film is an absolute visual treat. I would've liked to have seen the Oasis have a seedier side more akin to Spielberg's A.I but the world does look amazing. All the set pieces are well crafted, with one standing out as Spielberg's finest since Minority Report. Despite my issues with the characters, after the exposition heavy first act, the pace for the film really picks up and its 2hour20 minute runtime speeds by in a flash. Despite my issues with the pop culture heavy centre of the novel, I did enjoy seeing many of the references to past pop culture icons, especially how they were used in the final battle. And even the typical, Spielbergian schmaltzy ending did tug at my heartstrings, delivering a positive message for this technology-based generation.<br/><br/>And finally, a question for Spielberg? Spielberg, or at least his films. He delivered both the highest grossing film and film franchise of that decade in the form of E.T and Indiana Jones. Yet, Spielberg was already a well-established director before this. Is the need to adapt something so based around 80s pop culture a way of Spielberg attempting to revisit and capture what made his previous films so adored by millions? Is this Spielberg's attempt to become relevant again? I am unsure, but it seems as if he is returning to his roots as a ""popcorn"" director rather than the historical, ""Oscar baity"" filmmaker that he has become recently."
"debbie-iancu","8","1","6","6 April 2018"," I hated the book but really enjoyed the movie.
","Sorrry to all the book fans out there. I grew up in the 80's and i get all of the cultural references but i gave up on the book after 30% of the plot because absolutely nothing was happening, the main charachter was lame, the competitions were boring and frankly if the movie had seemed anything at all like the book I wouldn't have gone. 
So I was greatly relieved to see all the high speed chases, cool effects and actually showing us what was going on. 
I was a bt disaapointed that Art3mis wasn't like she was described in the book: ""short and rubenesque'. All curves"". That would actually be a refreshing look for a female lead. Would it have been so difficult to cast a girl who wasn't thin? I thougt we were growing past that? 
Anyway I really liked the way they combined the CGI and real world elements. There were a lot of beautiful visual scenes and i felt the movie wasn't too heavy on the 80's references. Really fun movie in all. I saw it with my husband and teenage kids - who didn't get most of the references but my son who is into Gaming really got and enjoyed a lot of aspects of the gamig world. Fun movie if you aren't there to compare it to the book"

I was amazed by how funny, entertaining, visually spectacular and what a fun ride of a movie. Family or between friends, i highly recommend. 9.5/10 in my book.

You're going to desire this virtual would to exist. You'll have to watch this piece of work several times to see all the references, easter eggs & characters. OST by Alan Silvestri is awesome.

","When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought it would just be another one of those bad faceless CGI movies with an over simplified plot and therefore almost didn't go to see it. I couldn't possibly be more wrong.
The portrayal of what is a very believable future is staggering, the humor comes naturally, and visual effects are impeccable. No character in this movie is 2 dimensional and for better or for worse, everyone has changed at the end of the movie.
This has everything that is lacking in today's cinema and I hope every director and writer sees Ready Player One as the perfect guideline towards success."
"Hellmant","8","1","6","29 March 2018"," Mostly enjoyed it, but I also wasn't overly thrilled.
","'READY PLAYER ONE': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The new sci-fi adventure from director Steven Spielberg, and based on the book (of the same name) by Ernest Cline. The film is set in a future where virtual reality is commonly used to escape the depression of the real world. A very skilled teenager competes to win control over the virtual universe, with the help of his new friends, while an evil businessman desperately tries to win control over it too. The movie was scripted by Cline and Zak Penn (who also co-wrote such other blockbuster sci-fi flicks as 'THE AVENGERS', 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', 'X-MEN 2', 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' and 'LAST ACTION HERO'). It stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also expected to be a hit at the Box Office as well. I mostly enjoyed it, but I also wasn't overly thrilled.<br/><br/>The story is set in the year 2044, when most of the planet's population lives in poverty. They escape depression by doing most of their daily activities in a virtual reality world, called the OASIS. In this world they can be whoever they want to be, but when their avatar dies they lose everything they have, and they have to start over with nothing. The creator of OASIS, the late James Halliday (Rylance), has left behind a game challenge, in which the winner gains complete control over the virtual reality world. A corrupt businessman, named Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn), will do anything to win control. A teenager named Wade Watts (Sheridan), and his new rebel ally friends, will do anything to stop him. <br/><br/>The movie has elements of classic Spielberg adventure films in it, but it also lacks a lot of the heart and magic that made those movies so special. Spielberg tries to recapture those strengths in this film, but he's just not able to ever do it. The effects are pretty cool, but they also make the world and characters of the movie seem very distant. The characters also don't seem very developed or truly relatable. Still, technically speaking, the movie is pretty visually flawless , and it's also a lot of fun to see all of these classic movie and video game characters in one film together (but you get that just from watching the trailer). The third act is also really long and uninvolving for the most part too. I liked the film overall, to an extent, but it definitely doesn't live up to Spielberg's greatest work."

Very very very fun to watch and I will be purchasing the 3d Blu-ray when it's released. And I definitely know who is getting the Oscar for visual effects next year!"

"rolando19552001","8","1","6","29 March 2018"," Ready Player One
","The movie is entertaining cinema, it has visual virtue, if you see the movie in the movie theaters, you must see it in 3D and in the biggest screen possible. All the visual splendor of the movie, it has a big budget of 155 to 170 million dollar, the money is well spent and if you really want to relish the visual grandeur of the movie, see it in 3D, you will be pleased with what you see popping in your glasses and eyes. Now with the visual effects that are great, have been discussed, now let´s discuss the movie, itself. Steven Spielberg still and always have been a great storyteller, he has always have a good for story, Spielberg is one of those directors that always tell a story, Spielberg had always been the best storyteller in the screen. And what a story does Spielberg gives, always Steven always give a story with great heart and Ready Player One has a huge beating heart. The story is about a young man, a coming of age story of Wade Watts, Sheridan first seen in Mud with Matthew MacConaughey, Sheridan is grown now and he shows off empathy and a great inspiring performance about always fighting and never giving up. The movie is a pugilism between the corporate machinery of IOI, the Innovative Online Industries, manned by a corrupt and ruthless Nolan Sorrento played by a good actor in Ben Mendelsohn who had been gaining better and better roles more apt to his great talents, he had appeared in the Dark Knight Rises, where he shows his gravitas, then another great role that is one of his best roles in Rogue One as Director Krennic, Spielberg always having a great eye for talent, gives Mendelsohn a great role in this villain Nolan Sorrento. Against the corporate suit, the High Five, a group led by Sheridan, or in the film Wade Watts, with her paramour and love interest in Samantha, a young woman Art3mis in the virtual game reality named Oasis. The catalyst of the movie is the life of Holliday, the creator of the game that had beguiled the living and waking hours of most people of the world. Holliday began planning his great game in 2025 and in 2027 the game was in effect, and our hero in the movie, Sheridan, Wade Watts was born the same year. The story takes place in 2045 when five years after the death of Holliday, and for five long years there had been no progress in the discovery of the Easter eggs clues that would signal the talented searchers towards three keys that would opened up the way to gain and acquire the half a trillion Oasis virtual reality game. Sheridan, Wade Watts is able to find the first Easter egg with a comeback of Back to The Future clue, and then when Wade Watts moves the needle and the game, Nolan Sorrento has a malicious intent. Nolan Sorrento does not have any morality, he is a murderer and does not have any conscience, he would kill anyone that in the way of his dream of acquiring the Oasis for the IOI and gain even higher amount of stock so that his great company and corporation would have endless growth. A young woman feels the pain in Samantha, that befriends Wade Watts in Oasis, but Wade Watts quickly fell in love with Samantha´s avatar, Art3mis who feels that Wade does not live in reality and that Oasis is a game, not the real life. Nolan Sorrento manages to find the information and whereabouts of Wade Watts and sends the kill order when Wade Watts does not accept the financial offer that is very compelling to Wade Watts as he lives in deep poverty, but after hearing the sad story of Samantha´s father that had been used by IOI and had dies by over work. Wade Watts declines and then Nolan sends his drones to try to silence Wade forever, he fails to do so, but a loved one from Wade Watts is a casualty. Samantha helps Wade Watts to find a place where he can help her and the two of them, now finally in real life continue what they have began in Oasis and Wade Watts is pleased with his infatuation, this a requited love as both have chemistry and their every move in the screen made sparks fly between the two, good chemistry. The two young individuals who began to fell in love in Oasis, finally completely fell for each other in the real world. They managed to find the second Easter egg clue and Kubrick´s the Shining is given several minutes of screen time in the second key that reveals the third clue, about a game. Samantha´s safe haven is found and she is taken saving Wade Watts and the High Five is found in real life as the other friends of Oasis of Wade Watts helped him and they begin their journey to find the third clue and help released and saved Samantha. Wade Watts managed to fool and outplay Nolan Sorrento with the help of H, a great hacker and huge Oasis ally of Wade Watts, whose avatar is Perceval, a character that looks a lot like a character of the game Final Fantasy from 2009, Link. Wade Watts with H manages to release Samantha and she wants to help and from the inside of IOI, she helps Wade Watts and the other members of the High Five. The denouement of the film transpires when Nolan Sorrento tries one last try when he is unable to win the game, he wants for everyone to lose, if he cannot win, the others cannot win, all would lose. Wade Watts had been given an extra life, by a butler who oversees all of Holliday´s memories. Wade Watts manages to get the last Easter egg and the last crystal key and Ben Mendelsohn´s Nolan tries everything in his power to stop Wade Watts from getting the golden egg which is given to Wade Watts by Holliday himself, it is implied that Holliday has somehow outlive his own death, as his conscience may have continued to live in Oasis. After one last scare from Nolan Sorrento who has a gun and may have used it to Samantha´s horror and despair to see her lover in mortal danger if he had come before Wade Watts receiving the golden egg. The Oasis and Gaming lawyers come to give the papers to Wade Watts with an old friend from Holliday, Og, the man who helped Holliday initiate the game in the first place and who had given the extra life to Wade Watts. There is a happy ending when Wade Watts in the name of the High Five who all helped in winning the golden egg, gives all five elite players the same rights to the Oasis and Gaming ownership. Wade Watts and Samantha continue to make one of the greatest fears of Holliday, to kiss a woman, Wade Watts many times shows and says himself that he is not Holliday and kisses Samantha and they live idyllically. Yes, the movie is long, almost 2 hours and a half, but it is an entertaining and good movie that does not bore and always keep you glued to the screen in all the climatic battles in Oasis and in the real life, and the real world and yes like Duran Duran, which is hugely referenced in the movie, sings in their song Ordinary World, the real world, they learned to survive."

"mtowersca","10","1","7","6 April 2018"," Enough ""Not like the book"" Crap!
","It is rare these days for a film to impress me. Being a huge fan of Sci-Fi, pop culture and video games, I knew on surface this movie would appeal to me. After all, it is a scary risk to make a movie containing so many beloved characters and pop culture references. <br/><br/>I am also a fan of the source material. Ernest Cline's love letter to the 70's and 80's mixed in with a futuristic gaming element was fun to read multiple times. An adventure so epic, I even asked myself how they could ever make the movie. Then we got the 2017 SDCC trailer and I was hooked. I already noticed the differences with images from the trailer and the pages of the book and I told myself to deal with it.<br/><br/>I walked in the theater opening night eager to see Parcival and how his adventure in the OASIS was going to change. I was NOT disappointed. I enjoyed how the pop culture was updated to include the 70's and modern age references. It appeals to a wider audience and moved at a different pace needed for movies that don't translate well from the pages.<br/><br/>Blame Hollywood lawyers and contracts for why you favorite chapter of the book or pop culture reference didn't make the big screen. There are legal rights to likeness and terminology that I knew wouldn't translate to the big screen. Don't believe me, look at the Quicksilver legal issues between MCU Avengers vs X-Men films or the legal issues with Spider-man.<br/><br/>Ernest Cline co wrote the screenplay. The author of the source material is still telling his story, with his characters and he stayed true to the theme of the book. The movie itself was fantastic to watch and so much going on it needs to be watched several times to catch all the goodies packed into 2 hours and 20 minutes. Spielberg's take left me wanting more and rejuvenated my spirit of why I like going to the movies."

","At least in the book, as fan ficky List making deus ex machiny middle school writing level as it was, many of the references had reasons for being and worked in the context of the threadbare plot. The film is terrible. Many people seem to be nostalgia-goggled by the whole where's Waldo aspect of it all. But that's all it is: a pricy seek and find. After you've seen all the ""Easter eggs,"" what's left is... well, nothing really. To say the acting is bad is really giving it too much credit. The lead is so devoid of personality and charisma that the viewer might as well watch someone sleep for two hours... if it's not the viewer sleeping that is. The Halliday character is so laughable as there is no way to take it seriously. I won't go into plot points, but so much is not set up, and stuff that seems to be set up, has no payoff. The thing that Ready Player One did, is make me want to go watch the hundred or so (better) movies referenced. It was bad. The lovers of this thing really need to remove the goggles and see it as the reddit article that it (and the book) is."

","As a person that read the book AFTER watching the movie adaptation, I was not that dissapointed with the film.
The book was incredible and in my opinion far better than the movie, but this doesnÂ´t means that the movie wasnÂ´t good just not in the same way that the book.
The film misses lots of details that were in the original READY PLAYER ONE and the main plot that even though I know it isnÂ´t always possible to recreate the book, i think that Spielberg had a lot of resources that he did not use; whith and argument as ashtonishing as the book has with lot of juicy parts that he coud have included.
I read the book because I thought that the movie was really great, when i finished after two days of intense reading i watched the movie again and i couldnÂ´t see more connection with the book than the names of the characters and the main idea. Despite the fact that the movie has a lot to be jelaouse from the book, it is not a bad film is just that after you read the book you donÂ´t see where the movie came from."

","It was an amazing experience. From just deciding to watch something and relax on sunday before a hectic week starts to feeling two of the most amazing feelings one can feel , thrill of being a part of a cause , rooting for something , being in the game and Oh!! the joys of friendship .
The movie has everything all the right twists and turns , all the suspense , very little predictability , eye catching visuals , stunning acting chops of actors and lastly the hero of the movie- its story
from the first minute you know its going to be awesome 2 hours and if you for some reason not convinced just hang in there for first 10 minutes :) and you will see what I mean.<br/><br/>Ahhh!!! the thrill of fighting , going back to it coz that makes this movie such a must watch hits all the right notes for most of us . Many of us go along with our lives feeling we are not making a difference , we are not sure of our significance and these lines from the movie just gives the key(pun intended) (LOL) to this puzzle
""People come to Oasis to find what they cant find in the real world but they stay to become what cant in real life""
We all have a inner desire to be something , and its strong , its time we listen to it intently and the best way to channel us in right direction join the cause which the person we want to be would join.<br/><br/>And another thread which together with the one above completely wraps up the whole movie is ""BEst meals are in reality"" Yeah !! they are .. Point is we may try to escape reality by binge watching , mindlessly eating , drinking , gaming but none of that feels like living , days pass and we just dont feel we are living coz life can only be lived in reality...
We say our life is not good or not as good coz we are not living in reality... no matter how bad the situation is you would not feel the pain when you would feel like living . The movie shows this aspect of human nature by the fact that avatars were not enjoying , they were enduring hardships to earn coins (much like the real world isn't it?) , they were feeling all the emotions , emotion of being friend , emotion of pain and loss ,but still they were crazy to go back to Oasis , why.. coz they were LIVING there .
This movie has so much depth , its a rare gem. Hope you who is reading this also finds a ahha moment in this movie to cherish"
"kermitkid","9","0","1","31 March 2020"," Fantastic Love Letter to the '80s and Geek Culture
","Well done Spielberg! I did not live in the 1980s. (1997), but now I know how those kids felt when they went to go see ""Back to the Future"" or ""E.T."" for the first time. This really captures the feeling of an '80s film, with futuristic technology. If you have the chance, go see this in IMAX or the local equivalent of an IMAX (like I did, because my IMAX is very far, but my closest theater has a screen about the size of one) because it is HUGE. There is one scene in the beginning that was worth the extra $2. My one nitpick that I can give away without spoilers is that while Ben Mendehlson is great as the villain, I really wish they had let him keep his British accent, because his ""American"" accent is distracting. (And let's be honest. Villains are more intimidating when they're British). I've complained about Warner Bros' CGI before and how it seems to me like they always cheap out when it comes to that aspect. (To me it always looks like cutscenes or trailers to a PS2 game from 2003.), but here, it was believable. I am so glad I was the only one at my screening, because I would have been kicked out for fanboying so much otherwise. This is a film where when I buy it on Bluray, I am going to need to pause it and analyze it frame-by-frame to get all the background references. The plot relies heavily on pop culture references but that's what makes it so great. It's a movie for fans (of anything) by fans. If you've ever had an obsession with pop culture (and almost everyone has at some point), this is the film for you. If you grew up in the '80s, this is definitely the film for you. You will weep with nostalgic joy.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
"jamesrupert2014","5","0","1","28 March 2020"," A little bit goes a long way
","Gamers in the future virtually battle for what are, in reality, the 'keys to the (virtual) kingdom'. Based on a book of the same name (that I have not read) the movie is a vast CGI extravaganza supporting a simple 'treasure hunt' plot and endless allusions to 1980's pop culture. As a nostalgic boomer I usually like that sort of thing, but after an interesting first third, the film's incessant bombardment of pop-imagery became tiresome, then almost embarrassing. Typical of director Steven Spielberg's youth-targeted films, the film is full of 2D characters, superficial situations, artificial sounding-dialogue, and saccharine sentiments. I stopped caring about the story during the endless 'Where's Waldo?'-style battle and just waited for the film to wrap up in the inevitable smarmy group-hug ending. Technically, the film is amazing but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being co-opted into someone's cloying, self-indulgent second-childhood dressed up as 'hip' (please substitute current slang equivalent)."
"paulclaassen","5","0","1","10 March 2020"," An acquired taste.
","Few people are aware of the fact Steven Spielberg is also a video game creator. 'Ready Player One' brings us closer to that fact, with the film's premise revolving around a game, and the film's visuals looking like a video game.<br/><br/>People not into gaming - or computers for that matter - might have a difficult time understanding or appreciating the film. This is an acquired taste, and will not appeal to the mainstream audience. The animation is fantastic. I loved the soundtrack. I enjoyed the fact that they used old music for a futuristic movie. And I loved the characters and plot. It literally feels as if you're inside a PlayStation experiencing the game. The reference to 'The Shining' - and the incorporation thereof into the film - was really cool. Being a game, though, much of the film was perceived not to be taken seriously, because ""it's only a game"". It only really became more serious towards the end, when their lives were in danger, but even then did it have that Disney family movie feel to it.<br/><br/>'Ready Player One' is an interesting look at what the future might hold for us - and it's a rather daunting thought!"

","I did not read the book, so unfortunately I cannot compare the source material to the cinematic adaptation.<br/><br/>The CGI sequences were really well made and as a fellow gamer, I have to say that were really immersive and it seemed to be really watching people playing. OASIS is stunning: the art direction is really good, locations are very well made, fights scenes are intense. This is exactly what I was expecting from a movie of this kind. The story is intriguing with interesting plot twists that will mix together the virtual and real words together. Even if the plot is not the most original one, the way it is narrated is different than the average Hollywood action movie. ""Ready Player One"" manages to collect references to pop and gaming culture, starting from the 80s, until today: more or less 40 years in one single movie.<br/><br/>After many attempts from Hollywood to create movies inspired from video games (like Resident Evil), that failed miserably, this one seems to be the real first movie related to games that aims perfectly to the objective: be entertaining, funny and have a good story."

"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","13 November 2019"," High octane blast of pop culture
","Based on a novel of the same name by Ernest Cline and directed by Steven Spielberg. Ready Player One is the story of near future where humanity has escaped into a virtual reality called OASIS. The real world is not much to speak of, why would it be when all of us who should be maintaining it are spending all our days having adventures in a land of pure imagination.<br/><br/>And if that isn't commentary, I don't know what is. And yet the film also acknowledges all the good things about OASIS. It is an awesome place, an alluring idea. The very first establishing shot, where we get explained what OASIS is all about, might be one of the most drool-worthy pieces of advertising I've ever seen. I mean, mountain climbing... with Batman. Sign me up!<br/><br/>As for the story, it follows Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), or Parzival as he is known in OASIS, who's one of many hunting for the final Easter Egg left behind by the creator of OASIS. This egg will give its founder full control over OASIS and its riches. Unfortunately, not all those looking for the Egg have the best of intentions.<br/><br/>Very basic story, but that's the kind of world this is, and it fits in comfortably. I have no complaints. Sure, it's very by the numbers and predictable, but sometimes that isn't a problem. Sometimes you're more interested in having fun with something relaxing and familiar than having a completely new and novel experience.<br/><br/>And familiar this film sure is. Spielberg is probably the only director on the planet that could have done this novel justice. Because the whole point of the story is that OASIS is a haven for all of humanity's pop culture. And I mean our world's pop culture. Not something made up, like a Rodent Man instead of Batman. So, if you want to make a movie about this, you have to get the rights to all these characters. And Spielberg did just that.<br/><br/>That being said, while it is immensely cool to have the Iron Giant doing battle royale or to watch Parzival driving around in the DeLorean, the film is also pretty obnoxious in how it uses all these characters. For example, there's this one scene where our two main characters, Parzival and Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), are supposed to have a moment on the dance floor, but suddenly the film cuts to Tracer from Overwatch giving us a thumbs up. And that's not the only instance where something like that happens. Sure, you got Tracer. Good job. But story first, fan pandering second. Okay?<br/><br/>Still, I really enjoyed this film. It's dumb fun, but there's nothing wrong with that and this is one of the greatest love letters to simple, pure entertainment I've ever seen. Definitely a must see film for all geeks, nerds, weirdos and lovers of genre culture."
"patriciogl10","10","0","1","5 November 2019"," Even more fun than an actual rollercoaster ride.
","I was taken aback by this film. I had low expectations yet a keen attitude to watch it because of Mr. Spielberg. What first strikes you like a boxer's punch is the outstanding visual aesthetic and the incredible blend of animation and reality. This is how CGI should be used and applied; the merge is flawlessly seamless. The amount of easter eggs is astounding, and you actually enjoy yourself while spotting them. When you know you are getting a whole lot of pop culture references you keep an eye on every detail possible, so I believe that enriches the viewing experience.<br/><br/>The direction is impecable; while this is an effort far from Spielberg's usuals it is still very Spielberg-esque in pretty much every aspect you can think of. I'm really glad he is still making great action adventure films like he used to; but now with the added dimension of being modern and even more spectacular in scale, with a strong nostalgic hint, product of what Spielberg's figure represents. The story is remarkably fun, and engaging all the way; Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke prove to be a fairly good pairing that slowly develop a chemistry greatly supplied to the screen. Ben Mendelsohn strikes hard yet again with a fabulous villainous turn as the corporate boss who hunts down players in order to seek the Easter Egg for himself.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is an electrifying rollercoaster ride embedded with a factory of allusions to the entertainment culture which is ten times more exciting than an actual rollercoaster ride, but with a Spielberg signature at the end."

"andrealeonti","8","0","2","29 August 2019"," A going-to-be classic
","Generally I don't like science fiction, but I loved Ready Player One, and here I'll explain why.<br/><br/>Ready Player one is a film that focuses its entire structure on the amazing visual power of the images that recreate a corrupt society, overwhelmed by a crisis of values, alienated and that finds its outlet only in virtual reality, in a parallel world where everyone can be what he wants, have the ambitions he has not in the real world, and pretend to be what is not.<br/><br/>With a visually spectacular and masterfully directed film, Spielberg weaves a clear warning that also shines well in front of the ruthless dynamism of the staging: in a post-apocalyptic future, the human society is totally absorbed by the virtual world: there are no ambitions , social and human relationships are almost non-existent. Every person lives his life entirely on OASIS: the more you play, the more powerful you become, but the more you play, the more you risk destroying yourself and even risk being sentenced to (virtual) forced labor in order to repay the debts you contracted playing .<br/><br/>Spielberg's warning is as actual and clear as ever: the contemporary world dominated by social media and virtual reality will eventually suck all of us into a vicious circle in which everyone will believe they are free, but no one will ever really be free: we will all be slaves of ourselves, slaves of screens and of false relationships that we will virtually undertake, where everyone can be everyone and anyone can pretend to be anyone.<br/><br/>On the narrative aspect, the shameless nostalgic quotationism of the pop culture of the 1980s is very interesting: Back to The Future, New Wave music, Duran Duran, The Shining and many others: an aspect that, in addition to entertain those whose hearts are left to those years, it's also a representation (and a veiled criticism) to modern society that lives on nostalgia and believes that it can perpetually alienate itself in the memory of a past period, apparently better (the eighties) of the social, cultural and human drama that overwhelms today's world.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is a magnificently direct, dynamic, highly entertaining film but also full of an absolutely undeniable moral: what you enjoy in this film can also induce you to think (and be frightened): what if in a close future wewould all end up in a world like Oasis?<br/><br/>Nothing is impossible but, considering our contemporary society, better make use of Hallyday's sentence:<br/><br/>""I know it sounds like a weird move, but people need to spend more time in the real world, because like Halliday said, reality is the only thing that's real."""

Worst of all, Hallidays Contest was lost in this mishmash of a movie, which is where much of the entertainment would have otherwise been..Instead it was a jumbled disaster that rarely if ever gave us the suspense of competition/race.

I like the whole idea of being able to escape the real world for a digital and more enjoyable one (also kind of a cliche). The cliches are pretty strong in this movie. Mother who chooses all the wrong boyfriends, living in a lower class society, a love interest that starts as an opposite of the main character, and a villain who wants to take control and run the show. Seems that it is harder and harder to find original concepts for modern movies, so I try to not punish scores too much.

","I usually don't write movie reviews because I feel that there's no right opinion when it comes to how a person perceives a movie, sure there are technical aspects that somewhat determine the overall quality of the movie itself but sometimes a great movie to one person may not appeal to another person due to the subject matter.<br/><br/>Which brings to this movie, where the subject matter in question is deeply inter-woven into modern pop culture especially video games and other things that most people identify as ""geeky"" stuff, and if you are one of those people who simply are not aligned along that wavelength of pop culture, you simply will not get the vast majority of the movie, however this movie is so well-made for those non-geeky demographics that they'll still be able to enjoy the action and story-telling and the overall theme of the movie which for better or worse is about the human element.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is a movie that does not take itself too seriously, but it's also not goofy enough to put off a hardcore fan of pop culture either, the main characters while a bit stereotypical, are mostly likable and not brain-dead puppets, and to me if the movie has a likable main character, that movie is half way home. The story somewhat reminds me of something else that I may have seen before but it's original enough that I can't simply pinpoint it, but if my arm was twisted and forced me to reference a sample, I would say it reminds me of Sword Art Online a little bit. It's basically an ordinary boy saves the virtual world & the real world and getting the girl he loves scenario, yeah it's a generic story but the execution makes it quite entertaining and fun to watch.<br/><br/>It's ironic that the characters that were referenced included Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because the postal van scenes reminded me of that movie somewhat, however whenever far more iconic characters and mechas graced the silver screen, I can only imagine the hardcore fanboys wetting themselves over it. For me that moment was when Gundam made the appearance, I for one have yearned for Gundam live-action movie for the longest time, and while this was not exactly how I have envisioned seeing it on the big screen, it sure was satisfying to see my imagination coming to life.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes in my opinion is the car race scene, the execution was just breath-taking, the supreme quality and production is where a director like Steven Spielberg makes his paycheck and he delivers in spades. This movie like the subject matter itself was rather bipolar in presentation in that at times it felt like I was watching a great sci-fi masterpiece, but then the other times I felt like I was watching a corny teenybopper comedy, but the former vastly out-classed the latter so it wasn't a distraction per say.<br/><br/>Lastly, I I do not throw around movie titles like Aliens and The 5th Element lightly as I hold them very close to my heart, and if you are totally into the pop culture scene, you may think this is a superior movie than those two. I don't quite feel that strong about it to say that, but it's a very well made sci-fi movie in a while, and because it had more cultural elements that I relate to, I would put it above something like Guardians of the Galaxy. The only concern is that Ready Player One may not age well over time because it's not a classic type of movie, but it'll have a place in the hearts of those fanboys of the pop culture for sure."

But it still makes me interested because it's not in the real world, but in the game. Although the game characters are really ugly, but it's still watchable.<br/><br/>This film reminded me of pokemon game that was so popular around the world a few years ago. We people are looking at the phone and can't give attention to the surroundings. In this film, people are also like this. They are wearing it and walking around. They can't give any attention to the surroundings. If this is the future predictions, well, we are doomed.

","A video gamers dream. As a gamer myself this movie is easily one of my new favorites, it shows creativity, the CGI is amazing, and honestly, I just freaking love the concept. I know that for the viewers who aren't avid gamers may not enjoy the movie (they'd be insane) mainly due to its deep dive into gaming culture.<br/><br/>The clique nature of squads, clans, groups, whatever you want to call them. The deep seeded desire to dig for easter eggs and secrets. The fear of your ""avatar"" dying and losing all of your (XP) or loot. Man, I just felt like every 5 minutes of this movie introduced another wave of gaming culture that I completely thirsted for.<br/><br/>The only real qualm that I have with the film is the timeline of it. The creator of the game grew up playing things like Atari, but does that mean the movie is set in the present day or the very near future? I mean it's set in 2045, but that means that the creator of the world would have grown up playing the games of the early 90's/2000's which would have been the SNES/PS1 era, somewhere in there. However, in the film, they seem to reach into the 80's nostalgia. Maybe he just had really cool parents that wanted to immerse him in the games of olden days? Either way, who cares.<br/><br/>GREAT FILM!"

Great character development and decent action parts that makes the movie great. The movie had a great storyline and all the characters made sense together, The action was pretty great and CGI was decent. The storyline implemented many classic characters from movies and games like Chucky from Childs Play and even Godzilla and King Kong. Many activities and actions scenes are in this movie so if you are looking for action, I think this is the movie for you.

"alexandrarichard","6","0","3","10 May 2019"," A Spielberg comeback
","Ready Player One is one movie that doesn't fall short of recapturing that old school 80's
nostalgia. Bringing back pop-culture references from the 1980's and 1990's. The many story
changes from the book to the big screen doesn't completely ruin this film. Even though this film
is set in the far away future, this film will remind you of today's world. In a society where
technology is used to mirror out the flaws in society. Me personally I wasn't too excited about
the trailer, the most interesting thing about it was the musical choices used in the trailer that was
also used in the film. Combing current music with some of the best songs released in the 90's
and 80's. Luckily the late decades nostalgia doesn't over power the whole film altogether. The
film has really unexpected turns that you wouldn't expect in a film like ready player one.
Considering the Steven Spielberg has had some controversial topics in his past films. All of his
past films have been stories have had a focus around realistic dramas and character stories.
But I'm assuming that most of the hate for this film comes from the fact that the film doesn't
follow the book exactly as expected. But this should be expected considering that the book is
400 pages full of pop culture references, some changes and cuts would've had to happen to
make it on the big screen. Even with the differences it was still a great film to watch and it
seems the film had some improvement from the book. Nevertheless this film is a blast, with the
combination of reality and cgi into an exciting adventure. Only one-third of the movies is shot in
reality. Believe it or not that's a really hard thing to pull off, it seems like the movies didn't even
have trouble pulling this off. If possible this film could be watched in the comfort of your home
with a virtual reality device. hours of unexpected, edge of the seat fun!"
"dakotacollinswriting","7","0","2","10 May 2019"," Perfectly Good Movie
","This movie does a perfect job of taking itself only as seriously as it needs to in order to maintain its status as a movie worth seeing, and I love that. The actors know that the plot and lines are all atrociously cheesy and gimmicky, and they embrace that, and that's why the movie was enjoyable to watch.
The world, too, helps make the film worth seeing; both the ""real world"" and the Oasis are beautifully developed and designed. The fact that the Oasis is in a video game makes all the CGI (which I usually hate) palatable without destroying my suspension of disbelief-especially with the ""real world"" scenes being, for the most part, filmed in our real world, with actual sets and props. That distinction keeps the separation between the ""real world"" and the Oasis clear, and without it the movie would not have been as enjoyable-which, despite its many technical flaws, it was.
Though most of the film is outlandish and ridiculous (not to mention as I said before cheesy as all hell), it works. A perfectly serviceable movie night watch-especially as someone who hasn't read the book and can't seethe over all the things they got wrong. Many people's problems with the movie seem to stem from their love of the book, and I don't doubt that if I had read the book, I'd have enjoyed this movie a lot less. But without that expectation, the movie was-while not brilliant, and not my favorite-perfectly fine. Not even ""bad"" enough to be considered a good bad movie. It's just a movie, no big themes to worry about or introspection to be incited or earth-shattering revelations to be had. It's a dumb movie about the good guys beating the bad guys, with a lot of shiny guns and cringey puns.
I laughed at a lot of the jokes, (even some of the ones they made on purpose); I shuddered with secondhand embarrassment; I smiled obligingly at the onslaught of pop-culture references, and, overall, I had a good time watching this. If that doesn't make a good movie, I'm not sure what does."

","I was first made aware of this movie in my AP English Literature class. We were allowed to vote on a movie to watch as a class which we would then analyze and write a movie review for. Of all the possible films we were allowed to vote on, this was the film that I didn't even think about choosing. Ready Player One didn't seem like a movie I would like at all. I only knew it had something to do with video games which wasn't something I enjoyed enough to watch a 2 hour long movie about it. Regardless of my vote, Ready Player One won the vote, and we watched the movie over the span of 3 classes. I'll be honest, I was pleasantly surprised. Ready Player One truly was a blast. It was good enough where I went and rewatched the movie by myself at home.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the movie for you but I will tell you that it was so fun to watch. It is full of surprises. It's a movie full of nostalgia. It makes references to about every other film, television show, video game, soda and musical fad of the past four decades. Some examples are Back to the Future, Batman, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Duran Duran, Halo, Tab, Star Wars, Van Halen, Akira, Mortal Kombat, The A-Team, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the Bee Gees, The Lord of the Rings, Nightmare on Elm Street, Michael Jackson, Atari... the list goes on and on. Even though I am a Gen-Z kid, I understood most of the references made, and it was so fun and surprising to see. This movie is fun for people of all ages.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 2045 in Columbus, Ohio. Columbus is the world's fastest-growing city/wasteland. It honestly doesn't seem very appealing, literally living on top of each other in slums composed of rusted RVs. The majority of the population have taken the next logical step of video gaming and virtual reality and retreated into their own headsets to escape their sad reality, living out their lives primarily as avatars within the fanciful landscapes of ""The Oasis"". Here in the Oasis you can be anyone and do anything there.<br/><br/>The Oasis was the brainchild of James Halliday and Ogden Morrow. The two had a big falling out leaving Halliday in total control of the Oasis. But he died, and his dying wish was to devise a competition that left a trail of three virtual keys in the Oasis leading to an 'easter egg': which if found would provide the finder with total ownership of the Oasis and the trillions of dollars that it is worth.<br/><br/>But the game is not only played by amateur gunters (egg-hunters) like protagonists Wade Watts and Samantha (they flirt a lot! He loves her!); there are big corporate game-hunters who try to find the keys before anyone else. Throughout the movie, you follow Wade on his amazing journey to capture all the keys before the corporate scum do.<br/><br/>Although the movie is a little long and full of CGI, everything is done incredibly well. The end is very satisfying and I really recommend watching it!"

"CinematicGarbage","5","0","1","2 May 2019"," Best Movie about Video Games!
","Ready Player One (2018) is the latest movie directed by Steven Spielberg, based on Ernest Cline's novel with the same name. It was released by the company Warner Bros. Pictures in United States in 2D, Real D 3D, IMAX and IMAX 3D. This is an another movie about video games since there was already many video game movies like Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Tron, Tomb Raiders, ... But this movie is extraordinary and way different from most of the video game movies.
The story starts with a guy Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) who lived in a place called the stacks with his aunt. It was 2045, the future was messed up. Wade only liked playing video games called the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation): a universe where you can do whatever you want, it had everything you could imagine and you're in this universe to battle with other opponents and collect coins. And one day, the creator of this game, James Halliday (Mark Rylance), who passed away and gave a message to all players: to find the three keys and unlock the Easter Eggs, who found the egg first would be granting ownership of the OASIS. Wade tried to do it, with the help of his friend Aech (Lena Waithe), Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), Daito and Sho. There's a company IOI (Innovative Online Industries), which its CEO, Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), seeked to control the OASIS as well. So the crew had to find the keys, take clues in order to get the Easter Eggs first (also mention that they had to defeat IOI players) and they succeeded and Wade Watts, whose avatar is Parzival, got the ownership and could control the OASIS and Sorrento was sent to prison with his....I dunno, F'Nale (Hannah John-Kamen). The plot was an improvement over the source material
The acting was praised by a lot of critics, especially they praised for Tye Sheridan's performance for being the main protagonist and he embodied his character as Wade Watts/Parzival. The action sequences were totally like a video game in reality, which was much better than making a VR glasses vision (it's really not cool). The CGI for the movie was really good, making it nominated for Oscars' Best Visual Effects. Unfortunately, even thought the movie was good and its effects were jaw-dropping, it wasn't crushing the box office well, only $582,9 million. Everything in here was WILDLY ENTERTAINING, all the adventures they had and Steven Spielberg took us a really joyful and awesome ride to the OASIS and also many references we wanted to see like characters in movie such as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Batman, Chucky, Iron Giant, King Kong, Mecha-Godzilla,... or even characters from other video games. The movie was creative in many ways making the greatest video game in a movie that no one has ever seen. Alan Silvestri was really great with the original score. The 80s soundtrack was really suitable depite being in the future of 2045.
I'm certainly impressive with many things about this movie. I couldn't wait to see its sequel, maybe Steven Spielberg would add more things many audiences were waiting to see in the sequel. It deserved a praise from both audiences and critics. It was really the best video game movies so far.<br/><br/>Points: 8.3/10"
"laineyrenae","7","0","1","30 April 2019"," Nostalgia, Individuality, and Human Appeal at Work
","""Ready Player One,"" directed by Steven Spielberg, is a film consisting of a combination of live action and CGI animation to convey the plot of a virtual reality universe. Main character Wade Watts is on a mission to find an Easter egg hidden by the universe's creator. Using various nostalgic references, such as ""Back to the Future"", ""Jurassic Park"", and ""The Shining"", the film captivates its audience and evokes feelings from an earlier time as the action plays out in the film. Specifically, the scene referencing ""The Shining"" appears as an entirely different movie in it of itself as the setting is identical to that of the original movie. I think the use of 80s pop culture references combined with the virtual reality setting has the potential to captivate multiple groups of audiences, such as those who grew up with these references and those that are growing up with advancements in technology. Set in 2045, the world is in shambles as overpopulation and global warming have stuck the earth. Though the OASIS is the virtual reality universe, the style of this setting is so realistic that is can cause some confusion, only adding to the film. The CGI animation used to create the avatars in the OASIS gives the film a video game aesthetic, allowing the audience to view it as though it were a video game. It is easy to tell that the characters portrayed in this universe are fictional, but the way they appear and travel make it seem as though you are walking in their shoes along this journey. There are various different types of characters, ranging from human-like avatars to alien-like beings and robots, all of which add to the diversity and individuality expressed by each of the characters. Though the plot of the story consists of a group of players on a journey to win the creator's fortunes, it also stimulates recognizable human emotions such as love and friendship as Wade Watts develops a crush on Art3mis. He then becomes more focused on pursuing relationships rather than his own success. This could serve as a moral of the story as he becomes inspired to actually live his life rather than be consumed by a virtual world. This movie also shines a spotlight on the captivating aspects of virtual reality that can essentially consume one's life. Overall, the film appeals to audiences through the use of nostalgia, individuality, and human emotion, connecting to people from different backgrounds and age groups."

","This is definitely a Spielberg film which is probably it's biggest strength. In the 1st act Spielberg shows fantastic understanding of makes an action sequence exiting as well as how how to successfully use the references that are scattered around the film. The 3rd act is ""pure Spielberg magic"" as the poster reads and it does have the unique feeling of watching Spielberg at his best. My problem however is with the 2nd act, this is a long movie and it feels it length due to some very long scenes of characters talking within the real world. These real world scenes are handled well enough but compared to the incredibly action packed and existing scenes within the OASIS they drag and are honestly quite boring at points. Much like the tone, the performances are also uneven. Stand outs would be Olivia Cooke as one of the players within the OASIS her performance being genuinely charismatic and likeable and Ben Mendelsohn as a the corporate bad guy. The weakest performance in my opinion has to be from T.J. Miller whose performance seems based solely on the fact that you are already supposed to like him and for me his whole thing is getting pretty old. Overall this is an entertaining enough popcorn flick. It's not one to think too hard over and there are some genuinely entertaining scenes. The references are pretty fun if you like that kind of thing (some personal favourites involved nods to Child's Play, The Iron Giant and The Shining). It's definitely uneven but it's still fun."

","To save a VR realm from the threat of a corporate villain and his army, underprivileged teenager Wade Watts (Sheridan) must discover three keys hidden somewhere in the computer-generated world.
There's a moment, not long into Ready Player One, where hundreds of cars, including a DeLorean, the A-Team van and the Plymouth Fury from Christine (which happens to be driven by Lara Croft) are all racing each other through New York when, having already outmaneuvered the Jurassic Park T-Rex, King Kong swings into view. And as the giant ape appears, all lingering doubts are dispelled - it's clear the film is going to deliver on its thrill-ride promise, and then some.
Set in Columbus, Ohio (relocated from the Oklahoma City of the book) 27 years from now, the world is overpopulated and, if not quite yet a dystopia, certainly thinking about it. Wade Watts (Sheridan), named to sound like a superhero's alter-ego, lives in the Stacks - a shanty town of campervans piled perilously on top of each other. How the world got like this isn't explicit (although both the ""corn syrup droughts"" and ""bandwidth riots"" are mentioned), but it's not so outlandish you couldn't see it happen. For most, it's an existence worth escaping and to do so, humans plug themselves into the OASIS, a virtual world where anything is possible. For any filmmaker, that toy box is an enticing prospect, and there's no-one better to play in it than Steven Spielberg.
The OASIS that Spielberg puts on screen is a visual marvel - obviously computer-generated as befits the fact it's a fictional video game, but realistic enough that it doesn't just feel as though you're watching a very expensive cartoon. The action has weight and consequence. And it's saturated with pop-culture references, some obvious (the Iron Giant; a squad of Halo Spartans), some so blink-and-you'll-miss-it a Blu-ray and a remote control for freeze-framing will be required to spot them all. There's a strange joy in scanning the screen in search of obscure characters that will make no impact on the vast majority of the audience - Zitz from Battletoads anyone? A less accomplished director could get bogged down in this, causing the film to be a moving riff on a Where's Wally? book, but Spielberg strikes the perfect balance. He knows exactly when to pull back to focus on the characters - especially the central relationship between Wade/Parzival and Samantha/Art3mis (Cooke), which gives the film a necessary and touching grounding in reality - and the story.
That story focuses on a competition announced by James Halliday (Rylance), creator of the OASIS who, on his deathbed, launched a competition to find his successor. Hidden somewhere in the virtual world are three keys - the first to find them all will be granted his billion-dollar fortune and control over the VR realm. Ready Player One picks up five years later with the first key yet to be claimed. Most have given up searching, but Wade, his friends and many more are still on the hunt. Some of those ""many more"" include Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn), the nefarious CEO of rival software company Innovative Online Industries (IOI), who employs a vast squad of players to find the keys for him. This would be a bad thing. His ultimate goal is to make as much money as possible from it, even going so far as to force players who fall into debt to work in (online) labour camps known as Loyalty Centers.
It's a high-risk contest, then, and Spielberg switches the action between the real and virtual worlds with dazzling aplomb, seamlessly melding the peril in both states of reality and upping the stakes as the keys are uncovered and we approach the endgame. The film does occasionally get sidetracked by exposition (this is what an 'Easter egg' is, here's why the Atari 2600 game Adventure is being used), but while it's momentarily frustrating, it is understandable. Warren Robinett is hardly a household name. The other issue is with Mendelsohn, who does little to differentiate Sorrento from Rogue One's Orson Krennic or The Dark Knight Rises' John Daggett. But mostly it's a joy, with Spielberg letting loose for the type of blockbuster moviemaking that made his name, but is increasingly infrequent in his filmography. And shows that when he's on his game, there's no-one else who comes close."

","Wade Watts lives with ant Alice in Columbus, Ohio in the stacks, a vertical pile of trailers, a kind of slum, in the year 2045. Wade's favourite hobby is to immerse in the OASIS, a vast virtual world. As he thinks: people come to the OASIS for all the things they can do but they stay because of all the things they can be. Tall, beautiful, scary, a different sex, a different species, live-action, cartoon. It's all your call. Wade's avatar is a cool white guy with tattoos called Parzival and his best friend is Aech a person he never met in the real world.<br/><br/>The OASIS was developed by the eccentric billionaire video game designer James Halliday. When he dies he leaves behind his huge fortune and the control of the OASIS to someone who will find an Easter egg hidden somewhere in the virtual world. The spectacular hunt for the Easter egg begins and gets really interesting when Wade finds the first clue...<br/><br/>This movie is quoting the 80's pop culture in a fantastic manner. It is really fun to see a Tyrannosaurus rex, King Kong and the DeLorean from Back to the Future in one movie. The flick is also getting more suspenseful till the end. The film is based on the novel by Ernest Cline who says, despite a lot of critism by the fans, about the movie: but the heart of my book is there and the heart of my story and the whole theme and everything that I was trying to touch on is there but in a way that's cinematic and engaging...I tell people, it's like density.

","If I had never read the book I probably would have really liked this movie, but as someone who thought the book was pretty good (not incredible) this is a let-down. It skips past nearly all of the world- and character-building that the book takes great pains to articulate and instead crams a whole bunch of licensed characters, worlds and names in front of you. A solid 9/10 on the audio-visual front because it looks and sounds fantastic, but it just throws the characters into relationships with one another and does virtually zero storytelling."

It doesn't rely on a familiar brand to sell tickets to a movie that has nothing to do with the brand and really, ultimately trashes it.<br/><br/>Rather, it relies on nostalgia to tell a fun, dynamic, and entertaining story that features all the glorious creations that we loved back when, well, back when Hollywood was still making glorious creations.<br/><br/>And, because of that, you walk away totally satisfied."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","0","2","8 March 2019"," A fun and polished love letter to popular culture and the internet.
","Ready Player One (2018) is a rare film for me, mostly because I had read the book well before the movie came out. In fact, I read the book shortly after it was released, and was impressed by the sheer volume of pop culture references. Consequently, I figured such a film could never be made. Just based on the incredible amount of coordination it would take to get rights approvals from so many different places, the legal side of such a film would be a nightmare. If it was made into a film, I imagined it would certainly be a fun and flashy romp through cyberspace. The film version, while not entirely faithful to its source material, certainly lives up to my imagination.<br/><br/>While the book spends paragraphs describing all the pop culture references, the movie does it one better and gives quick, flashing glances of something that fans of pop culture will immediately recognize, or at least be able to pause and scrutinize in the home video release. These subtle nods never distracted from the story since they were mainly visual references. Spielberg, in a return to form that hearkens back to his family films from the 1980's, managed to find the right balance here and allows us to revel in gooey nostalgia while also reminding us that the virtual and real worlds are distinctly different realms-a good reminder for all of us. In fact, some rude internet behavior was my only qualm with the film, even if it is somewhat accurate of the internet culture.<br/><br/>Regarding the plot discrepancies, I feel the movie helped to smooth out some of the rough edges from the book. The novel had a lot of intriguing ideas, but they seemed slightly disjointed. The movie, however, manages to create a more cohesive narrative from some of the basic building blocks of the book. In much the same way that The Shining (1980) was a distinct and artistically significant work separate from-and linked to-the book it used as its source, Ready Player One (2018) uses its source material to create an equally significant work to its origins.<br/><br/>A fun and polished love letter to popular culture and the internet, I give Ready Player One 4.5 stars out of 5."

This was just a waste of time, and younger folks, helk anyone that knows nothing about the subjects foretold long ago, would do better to simply read classic science fiction from the greats, and numerous anime from 20 years ago that already covered these subjects in player one much much better and thoroughly. *Smfh * Terrible film.

When compared to the book, it is STILL a wonderful film. It altered from the story line in so many ways. And now after binge reading the book I understand why. You cant really make a movie, where 99% of the action is taking place inside of someone's thoughts. I'm glad they altered what they did for the film. They made the action scenes more explosive, and Wade, less ""socially awkward"". Overall the film has a 10/10 for me. I keep going back and rewatching. It has become one of my all time favorites."
"myriamlenys","3","0","1","19 February 2019"," problematic with regard to message
","I have never read the novel the movie is based on, so I can't say anything about its value as an adaptation. I'll just try to review what's out there on the screen.<br/><br/>The movie ends on a clear warning : it invites young people to live not in virtual but in actual reality because, well, this is where humankind dwells. A wise and intelligent message, one might think, and a productive one too. However, the movie just spent about an hour and a half lovingly detailing the mental universe of those who live in artificial heavens. Or no, let me rephrase that, of those who are content to live in the artificial heavens others built for them. The movie spent about the same amount of time praising those who immerse themselves in the small details of pop culture, even to the point of obsession. (Many of the characters, including the heroes, are the kind of people - or the equivalent of the kind of people - who spend 800 hours of their precious life discussing whether Captain Kirk's second cousin looked better in scarlet or in teal.)<br/><br/>So the movie is certainly problematic, here.<br/><br/>I wouldn't like to turn this small review into a sermon, but : if I were the parent of adolescent children, I would use the movie as a starting point for a discussion about, say, the rewards and dangers of vicarious living and the sad waste of a life used for silly trivialities. While we're at it, I would also grab my youngsters and take them on a long hike through a large forest, with nary a laptop or smartphone to be seen.<br/><br/>Even apart from these reservations, I found the movie over-long and over-busy, with a relentless ""more is more"" - approach which tended to drown everything ressembling real danger or real emotion.<br/><br/>I'm still throwing the movie some stars because, in certain aspects, it is very well done, from a technical and technological point of view. Every now and then there are moments of great beauty and charm to be enjoyed. For instance, the movie contained a marvellously fluid and inventive dance between a boy and a girl which reminded me somewhat of the animated gem that is the ""Arab veil dance"" from ""Fantasia"", set to Tchaikovsky's music."

","Good mood film. The combination of plot and VR settings is fairly good. Although some of the pictures are too eye-catching and confusing, the effect is good. Unfortunately, it's based on decryption, not rpg, so the actual experience will find that the sense of game is not strong, just a treasure-hunting movie with emotional shell. It can only be said that other people's scripts are good, can well embedding nostalgia and eggs, while Chinese movies will only be stiff with advertising."

In fact, they are small details in the screen, which make you want to watch the movie many times to catch many of them.<br/><br/>Further, the movie show some part of our childhood in the 90s and early 2000s that somehow we've all lost.

","I couldnt believe what I saw and stopped the movie half way through. I loved the book and was really excited for the movie, but Spielberg destroyed everything original and smart about the book and dumbed it down for a 21st century American audience. The story of a bestselling book was rewritten in a way that transformers 3 had a better storyline. The characters were soulless and had no background to them. The challenges had no challenge in them. In the first challenges, which is a car race, the a answer is driving backwards. A 6 year old would have tried that in no time. The story goes on like that for the rest of the movie. The all too realistic dystopian was a unrealistic joke. The movie is exactly what the book is warning about. It's the mentality of just wanting to be entertained with easy, dumb trash instead of getting you to think where society and the world might be heading to of people stop caring. Please start using your brains again, read a good book like the real ready player one and don't watch this atrocity. They added a villain and gave him a mayor role, who is mentioned once in the book and has the classic easy Hollywood dumb jokes role. He is ja ja bings all over again. I am done with Spielberg from now on and should have been from the Indiana Jones crystal skull movie. Just sad how his career ends. Bad movie for a dumb audience with bad characters and worse storyline. What a disappointment."

The positive; this movie was just plain awesome. If you were a kid in the 80's the movie is really going to connect. The basic concept is about ""Easter eggs"" and there is so many references to Atari's 2600, the Iron Giant to Back to the Future, and Excalibur (to name a few) that it will have you laughing & jumping out of your seat.
Spielberg out did himself. As a reviewer and someone who really enjoyed this piece; I truly hope that it can develop new momentum w/apps like ""OnDemand"" &/or Netflix. I have only given 10 stars to a few movies; this one exceeded my standards. Make some popcorn, turn off the phone & enjoy!"

There are dinosaurs, rolling boulders, King Kong, DeLorean, Atari and other innumerable pop culture references that can't be missed by a 90s kid. Features a mix of familiar and otherwise ensemble cast that puts up an apt show without weighing it down by taking themselves too seriously. The simplicity of the script helps the audience to focus and cheer the amateur group from one victory to the other. A clear good vs. evil setup does the same too.<br/><br/>The script, the references, the acting - are all for naught without the spectacular visual effects show that is rich, detailed, not too realistic to clearly differentiate the game vs. reality and plays an integral part of storytelling.

This high tech, futuristic action adventure relies less on psychological crime thrills such as The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and less on the super blockbuster sci fi action adventure of The Matrix (1999) more of a computerized, virtual reality quest version of magical fantasy of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), including the incorporation of one of the first use of a text-based computer game Colossal Cave Adventure (1976) or the adolescent version of virtual reality of Surrogates (2009) or Inception (2010).<br/><br/>This movie attempts to introduce the audience to the visual spectacular and special effects design of the future that Avatar (2009) introduced and boldly surpassed of the original efforts of virtual reality classic Tron (1982).

","Ready Player One: 8 out of 10: Based on the best selling novel Ready Player One tells the tale of a poor kid in future Cleveland who tries to beat an online game to win a great prize.<br/><br/>I really wanted to hate this movie. Damn you, Spielberg. In essence, this is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with a heavy dose of The Lego Movie and Wreck it, Ralph. It is almost all CGI with endless pop culture references, particularly about the eighties. Ugh, seriously how did Spielberg pull this off. It should have been an unbearable cringefest.<br/><br/>On to the questions.<br/><br/>Why do I hate the eighties so much? I don't but good lord it has been done to death. The eighties were a great time and had some really good entertainment. Much of that entertainment was about how the fifties were a great time mind you (Happy Days, Back to the Future). I understand how nostalgia works and you can set your watch by it. Spielberg surprisingly puts in more than just the eighties references that are in the book. This keeps it from being a stale oh I remember this geek fest. He also just lets the screen speak for itself so we don't get that obnoxious hey look at this, don't you remember this, camera work so many films of this type seem to revel in.<br/><br/>What was your favorite pop-culture cameo? I am not saying. Cause its a spoiler. But man my heart grew three times its normal size. I do need to call my cardiologist now that I think about it.<br/><br/>What was your favorite story twist? I like the fact that the bad guy's big plan is to take over this virtual space and put in pop-up ads and microtransactions. I mean who can hate a movie where the bad guy is basically Electronic Arts or Activision or Comcast.<br/><br/>So good social commentary then? There is the same vibe as Sorry to Bother You had in this film. A decent subplot about debt slavery to companies. Though the actual pictures certainly are different otherwise.<br/><br/>The film also makes a very sly commentary on how it is necessary to change an original work to make it work on a film. Considering the changes that were made to the book I have to believe that was deliberate meta-commentary.<br/><br/>Sounds like you had at least a few nitpicks no? Okay while the film was good about not focusing too much on cameos it did spend way to much time explaining certain plot points and trivia. To use an easy no spoiler example the main character decides to dress his avatar as Buckaroo Banzai for a date. Just dress him that way so it gives people in the audience the thrill to recognize the outfit instead of mentioning it in voice over and have every character seem to dwell on it.<br/><br/>The ugly plain girl with the sexy avatar who doesn't want the hero to see her in real life cause he would be repulsed is played by Olivia Cooke. You know the lead in that Vanity Fair miniseries your wife was watching. Yeah, they give her a birthmark or something but seriously? I can think of another cast member that honestly would have been a better match for our hero. But Hollywood has to Hollywood.<br/><br/>Speaking of the film seems to make clear that this online place is the cause of many of the world's problems and for all its good intentions it is bad for society and the people in the same. I like to believe that the movie still shares this opinion at the end which makes the actual plot developments quite curious.<br/><br/>Are you surprised you enjoyed yourself? I shouldn't be. I liked Wreck it Ralph and both Lego movies. I had a hard time getting into Stranger Things but I will give it another try someday. Heck some of the aged remakes, reboots have been okay for example the new Blade Runner and um Friday the 13th maybe..? Okay, that is a work in progress. Point is I am not against nostalgia in practice as much as I seem to be in theory. When they start making films about the old days and it is your youth one quickly realizes I am not the young protagonist who gets the girl I am the old guy who dies after wasting his life playing games and watching movies."

I just watched this movie, knowing nothing about the book, and I liked it. It's enjoyable to watch and very different from usual movies.
And it seems some people also think it's stupid that this actor refers to the '80's a lot since it was waaaaay before he was born and all that. I was born 1990 and I like the '80's music and some of the films. I don't get why this is a problem.<br/><br/>To sum it all up - you probably shouldn't watch this if you have read the book, 'cause it would seem you would be disappointed.
Otherwise go ahead and watch this for what it is -> a movie..<br/><br/>10/10 imo"

not a book guy. I'm a movie guy. There's so much more to a great movie than the plot, characters or a great twist at the end. If you actually just watch this movie and enjoy it for what it is you'll see that it's visually exciting! From the use of futuristic technologies in the real world, to the CGI of the oasis. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen! The adventure that is the hunt for the ""Easter egg"" is extremely entertaining and so much fun to watch unfold. Packed full of nostalgic 80s references and witty one liners. You'll look over to your movie watching partner to make sure they caught that. Depending on your parenting level the dialogue really isn't too bad. Couple curse words and some references that will likely go over their heads. No blood/guts, no nudity. My 7 and 8 year old love it.
Love the movie. This is one of the few Dolby Atmos movies currently on the market. I don't have Atmos however, it sounds amazing on my Bose 5.1 surround sound. Just WATCH the movie and stop comparing it to the book!! You'll really enjoy it!"

"h-c-patel32","8","0","1","22 January 2019"," Nostalgic romp through the 80s set in the future
","I rather enjoyed this film. I have watched it several times on Sky since I first watched it a few weeks ago. Totally in love with the Parzival Avatar. Reminds me a little of Chiana from Farscape.<br/><br/>It's a safe but fun, colourful caper through a version of cyberspace stuck mostly in the 80s. Loads of cultural references and cameos of characters and their machines. Like Star War simultaneously set in the future and past.<br/><br/>Aimed at over 12s as per the rating I think boys young and old will enjoy it. Perhaps a tad too traditional and gamey for broad appeal beyond those who were teenagers in the 80s or had parents who introduced them to 70s and 80s Americana. For me personally, some of the cultural references were pretty dated. The films referenced were old fashioned when I came across them in the 90s. Nearly 25 years on it seems odd that a teenager of the 2040s would have advanced knowledge of 1980s trivia. There's a scene where the villain trying to hoodwink Parzival by trying to be hip quoting Duran Duran. They were barely cool in 80s and the idea that 60 years later the best gamers in the world are into them is really implausible. It would be like my teenage self being into Noel Coward operettas of the 30s.<br/><br/>That being said, as I was I a child of the 80s the references were appreciated, even Duran Duran. I also loved that they chose Birmingham to film some of the real world scened to show a post apocalyptic America. I worked in that area years ago and pretty sure walked down those streets a couple months back. Quite apt considering that those streets are amongst the last of the industrial revolution era building's in the city. But I digress. Also it is a nice touch that Duran Duran formed in Birmingham.<br/><br/>I think some of the real world graphics in the opening sequence were a bit clunky. They really should just used have a real world trailer park in California and saved the expense. The Oasis world CGI though was pretty stunning in parts. But you do end up easter egg hunting yourself concentrating in the myriad of characters within the Oasis and not on the plot or cast.<br/><br/>I think there is enough in the film to engage people long enough, if not visit the world of the Oasis time and time again, then at least once. I fear it won't be one of the films that will stand the test of time as people move further away from the 80s the less and less it will make sense. It is what it is. So just have fun with it."

What's wrong with changing things up a bit from the book? The new 80s references were great! The overall story was the same and is a good one.

","Ok so I have to start by saying that I did not really think this movie would be worth my time. Did not watch it in the movie theaters because the trailers did not make me want to watch it. When I did watch it, I was literally blown away by how it was so good. Seriously one of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>So now I will move on to the part that will upset people. If you go to a movie based off a book expecting it to be exactly like the book, you are A) wasting your money. That is as likely to happen as catching the Pope in poker tournament in Vegas. Your expectations are already too high. B) you are a fool. When they make movies too much like the book it is based off of, it usually ends up being a flop. I know this is hard to understand but they make these movie things to make money. Seriously, that is actually their intent.<br/><br/>Now for those who didn't read the book and/or don't expect it to be a replica of your imagination, this is a really good movie. It totally caught me by surprise. For me, I was entertained throughout the whole movie. I am sure some people will say that I am just an easily entertained idiot. I'll take that but guess what I have that they don't, happiness. Lol"

For those who has not read it, this might be good, but for those of us who expected it to be based on the book it is a disappointment.<br/><br/>For fans of the story: There is almost nothing from the book here.

","The whole point of an escape fantasy is to get away from real life BS like politics, strife, stress, etc. A lot of SJW's don't understand that. This movie was a breathe of fresh air. When the world is so messed up, sometimes you just need to escape from it. Imagine if all escape fantasies focused on just making you escape instead of reminding you of all the garbage you see on real life TV. I loved this movie so much. It reminds me of one of the reasons I support Gamergate, so content creators are always free to make content from their heart & soul to help viewers escape into an alternate reality, and you can just forget about your problems within those 2 hours without having politics shoved down your throat every two seconds. What a fantastic escape movie. It reminded me of all my favorite movies & games growing up, all my favorite music, it just hit home in all the right places. Still, when you think about it, that virtual world they hook into is pretty open ended, so I'm sure you can visit places where there are politics if you chose to. I'm sure SJW's are in that world too which is cool too, but I'd avoid them at all costs or pk them and take all their gold and loot like in good ole Ultima Online."

Although the nostalgia & useless trivia from the past decades had some of my attention, overall I winced every minute this movie went on.
So. Boring.
So. Predictable.
So. Awful.
The CGI was painstakingly bad. The acting worse. I didn't understand how anyone who came up with the screenplay thought having this group of VI friends that met in a world of billions of people all over earth happened to be in the exact 25 mile radius ( bad people too! What are the odds!)
Main female gives this speech about how you don't know what they look like in reality, you're expecting something completely different and she's gorgeous but has a birth mark on her face? OH NO! Tragic.
The best character was the 11 year old, and he barely got any screen time. Also: 5 years after his death and still no one figured out that first race? Mmmkay.

"Mike_Devine","6","0","1","22 December 2018"," Pop culture references abound in this wild arcade ride
","In the nerd-iverse where comic books, arcade games and (apparently) the soundtrack of the 80s resides, there is 'Ready Player One.' Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of Ernest Cline's best-selling futuristic fantasy thriller made a big splash at the box office in 2018, in large part due to a dedicated fanbase. General audiences could identify with the number of pop culture references littered throughout the film - everything from Batman climbing Mt. Everest to Stormtroopers and Freddy Krueger - and the dazzling CGI, of course.<br/><br/>As a movie, 'Ready' is a wild ride. The premise is simple enough: a young, downtrodden Columbus kid finds new life in a VR universe that has taken hold of the world - the Oasis. Played by Tye Sheridan, Wade, or ""Parzival"" as he's known in the Oasis, is your typical protagonist in this kind of story, as he's the perfect candidate to try to take on an ominous corporate conglomerate that's led by the intimidating Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). We also see some noteworthy performances from Olivia Cooke (Art3mis / Samantha) and Lena Waithe (Aech / Helen), not to mention seeing a spaced-out Mark Rylance as the reclusive inventor of the Oasis, Halliday.<br/><br/>To be clear, 'Ready' does a great job with some key scenes, especially one that takes place in the notorious Overlook Hotel and another racing sequence in Manhattan. However, when comparing the film to the book, it's no contest. Of course, when is that ever not the case? Still, 'Ready' does run into the issue of feeling a bit rushed in certain instances - as if the actors are racing against the clock in order to finish the story.<br/><br/>While not perfect, 'Ready Player One' is simultaneously an exciting trip down memory lane...and the path to the future."

Really good acting too It's a movie that has to be watched on the big screen though. I guess there was a lack in something in the development of the plot that's why it didn't make the perfect score.

"info-10449","9","0","2","14 December 2018"," A movie about VR and at least some nerdp0rn
","I loved the book and even the first few chapters contain so much nerdstuff, that my brain began to hurt. Ernie Cline thows out quotes from Ghostbusters, mentions Breakfast Club, talks about Monty Pythons coconut-knights and mentions Gremlins while we do not even know what the OASIS really is. So do not expect a ""movie-based-on-a-book"" but expect a ""movie-based-on-an-idea""<br/><br/>I was so anxious to see ""Anoraks Video"" because just in that scene in the book we see OASIS-Boss Halliday hanging around with Winona Ryder and the others from 80ies movies. In the book we are Matthew Broderick playing wargames and we search for the holy grail, together with Eric Idle and the others from Monty Python.<br/><br/>The first riddle in the book is to play the old Atari-Game ""Joust"" against Hallidays avatar (which is dressed as a half-dead-king). The first riddle in the movie is to win an extremely complicated race.<br/><br/>The movie is different from the book, because it's boring to view two guys playing Joust against each other. It is not possible to insert the whole movie ""Wargames"" in another movie (but Ernest Cline did it in his book) and while you can read about the history of pacman it is boring to place this information in a movie.<br/><br/>So the movie is another approach. Cinemagoers need Action. So, we see old DeLoreans, Bigfoots, Akira-Bikes, Tie-Fighters and StreetHawks racing against each other. We see people ignoring physics and Director Steven Spielberg makes a nod to his Buddy Stanley Kubrick by picking up ""Shining"" for his movie-in-a-movie-take.<br/><br/>Is this movie close to the book? No. Never ever. What I really disliked was the fact, that those nerds look too good in real-life. Wade and Art3mis should have been some obese. They aren't. That's that 1 point making that movie a 9/10.<br/><br/>Is it a good movie? Hell yeah! Spielberg takes us on a ride and directed this movie like he did in his best years (Indy 1,2. E.T., Jaws) and he gave ILM so much freedom that they could put in almost every CGI-Avatar from the years between 1978 to 1990.<br/><br/>Great movie."

","Most of us have watched so many movies, that it is difficult to be facinated. This movie is however something that totally took us out of reality and bring us new future perspective. When you today watch the Truman Show, it is not so facinating, as reality TV has become a part of our live. But when the Truman Show was made, this was not the case. It brought something to us, that nobody else has provided. This is what this movie also has done. It played with futuristic realities that are quite realistic. Such as an social/game based reality where you can make and spend money. Where you can order/buy things and get them delivered in reality. A world that uses drones to survail as well as deliver food etc. But also a world where we waiste our lives in the digital suciety. Long story short.......wauuuu, what a movie."

"saru2020","5","0","1","18 November 2018"," VR based Cartoon movie
","The extremists' idea on how the future would look like, if VR/AR took over the world, that is the simple idea over which a game is build and the whole world gets addicted to it and they start to live more in the virtual world than in their real world, that's the crux. But, almost the whole movie just goes on in the virtual world & very less real world scenes are shown, maybe because the now/2045 real world looks very ugly.
But, for the viewer, it feels like watching the cartoon movie overall on a high level and mostly like the replay of the video game itself, which nobody ever likes, but with few thrills and an imaginable futuristic plot, it somewhat keeps us going but in the end, for the adults who don't play that much games and for those who don't like being addicted to the games will get irritated and simply thrash the movie w/o ever looking at its vast plot, imaginary future world creation, awesomatic VFX shots."

","Ready Player One is an entertaining, fast paced, action filled movie that will you keep you engaged and eager to find out what surprise is around the next corner. The visuals are mesmerizing and spectacular as one minute the characters are racing down a freeway being chased by T-Rex and King Kong, then we see Chucky from ""Child's Play"" is making a cameo inside of the DeLorean in a dramatic and intense final act, with a humorous stop by the Overlook Hotel along the way. If you can't tell, this movie throws 1980s icons at the audience left and right and is shining with that decade's nostalgia. The majority of this movie is shown inside a gaming world, but there is a narrative and action that that takes place in the real world also. This part of the story feels rushed and there isn't much substance to it, the main characters are far less interesting than their gaming avatars, this is a movie to simply enjoy for what it is. The message of this film seems to be, that the more we are immersed in a digital world, the less connected we become in the real one. It is important to slow down, and enjoy the people and the moments that are happening right before your eyes, instead of just flying to the next gaming mission in a hope to level up and accomplish achievements that in reality, mean very little."

A lot of the movie has video game style violence and extremely over the top action and battle scenes. There are horror movie references and an entire scene based off of The Shining. Few characters die in the real world, but things get pretty crazy in the virtual one. There is a scene with a nude woman, but the angles don't reveal much. There is also a lot of swearing.

"sweidman-28016","7","0","1","28 October 2018"," Visually Stunning
","Here's my late review of Ready Player One.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is Steven Spielberg's newest movie he directed. As you've read on my original post, I went into the movie blind so I didn't wait for any of the scenes I've seen in the trailers or pictures. I enjoyed the movie. The characters were good, the music choices were great, loved the references, and the visual effects were amazing. I don't think any other movie for the rest of the year will be able to top it. Spielberg is always great at directing, so naturally this was a good movie. There were a few flaws, however. There were some characters that you were supposed to feel for, but I didn't feel any bond with them, really. The main antagonist was weak in my opinion. He was just a guy that's the head of a business and wants something that everyone else wants and he will stop at nothing to let anyone get it. It was too typical. Some scenes were way too long, dragged on, or unnecessary. The movie was 2hrs 20 min long which could've been shortened down just a little. Although the visuals were amazing, there were only a few times where I felt it took away from the movie. Other than those parts, I thought it was good. Spielberg did a great job taking people to the world of the OASIS, and I look forward to seeing it again.
My Grade: B+"

It's a simple emotional concept and fun to dream about, but the truth is that it would likely have consequences (kind of like social media today).<br/><br/>There are so many movies coming out with some aspects which are good but fail in other areas, but I think Ready Player One did an amazing job all around.

"aleksandarpavicic","10","0","3","11 October 2018"," Nostalgic pure.
","Those who like games and are interested in virtual reality will definitely like this movie. It is loaded with a lot of action and funny moments too. For me it was one of the best movies in 2018 that came out so far and I was fascinated since the beginning of it. <br/><br/>The whole thing happens in the year 2045 at the place Columbus in Ohio. Wade Watts the main character who's living in ""the stacks"", where trailer parks are piled on top of each other. Things don't go well in his world. Everyone escapes to the virtual reality game called Oasis. Everyone worshiped the Founder called James Halliday who created the ""new world"" In the Oasis you can be anyone that you want to be and do things that you want to do, but then he died one day. He left a message behind with his testament in a video. This video was published around the whole world. Those who find all all the Easter Eggs should be awarded with the Oasis itself and the hunt for it began.
The movie is about Wade, who plays the game character Parzival and his friends who try to get the keys before another organisation called IOI. They have to play themselves through the Oasis and try to find the secret of James Halliday.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for someone who likes pop-culture should watch. The animation of many game characters were well designed and added to the action. Overall I liked the movie a lot and there should be more like this one."

Overall it was pretty fun.<br/><br/>The animation of this movie is outstanding. Around 95% of the film is pure CGI eye candy. I loved the character design and the world the film crafted. It really felt like I was trapped in a video game world.<br/><br/>The world the movie made was easily the best part of the film. I honestly want to watch the movie again just to try and catch every pop culture reference. The movie is pure 80s and 90s nostalgia at its finest.<br/><br/>As far as the actual story it's not the most original and pretty predictable. The antagonist is a straightforward bad organization whose goal is to rule the world and all the protagonist are stereotypical good guys.<br/><br/>I would say the characters are the weakest element of the movie. I had fun watching them interact, but they all felt pretty hollow.<br/><br/>Directing wise Stephen Spielberg did a good job, but nothing outstanding. Other than doing something different I'm not sure what attracted him to this project<br/><br/>Overall very similar to the book, the movie was a lot of fun but unfortunately a tad bit shallow. I would have preferred if Steven Spielberg made the movie a bit more of his own, but it was still an enjoyable ride. A 8 out of 10."
"rhino-86852","8","0","2","28 September 2018"," Book, great...... Film very good

"Ingrouille181","7","0","2","28 September 2018"," A good adaptation, but not a great one. More TV show material than film material
","I wanted to take time to read the novel Ready Player One before I reviewed the film, always helps. Needless to say, while the film is more light hearted and action packed, the novel is more believable, and just has a more realistic tone. I enjoy the fact that Spielberg loved the book enough to direct a film about it, but this probably wasn't the right film for him to direct.<br/><br/>The film centred on Wade Watts, who along the millions of others around the world, has spent over 5 years partaking in a competition made by James Halliday, creator of the OASIS, the worlds greatest online virtual reality, where you can be anything, be anyone, and go anywhere. Whoever wins the contest wins untold billions of dollars and complete control of the Oasis, causing a handful of egg hunters, including Wade, to face off against IOI, an organisation intending to win the contest and rule the world.<br/><br/>I did watch the film first, and I loved it enough to watch it twice in cinemas. The first difference with the film and the book is how someone gets through each challenge. The book gives the competition three keys to collect, and three gates to get through for each key. The film only has three keys, and that's probably because of time restraints. The book oozes pop culture, but another thing to note is that Halliday centred the challenges to the keys and the gates around his own personal pop culture obsessions.<br/><br/>I really like the world building. Obviously I saw the film first so envisioning the stacks where Wade in real life lives where visualised perfectly. The book definitely delves into the backstory then Wade does at the beginning. Onto the characters, we have the main character Wade Watts portrayed by Ty Sheridan. I like him as Wade Watts. One thing I liked about Wade in the film is probably only because the challenges in the book were changed. Book Wade is definitely a Gary Stu, Even though book Wade had 5 years to research a LOT of pop culture, every challenge he faces he conveniently already knows how to beat: an example would be (spoiler for the book) after getting the first key, he reaches the first gate, and he has to reenact the entire film WarGames as Matthew Broderick's character, line for line.<br/><br/>Other than him I enjoyed Olivia Cooke as Art3mis, Ben Mendelsohn as Nolan Sorrento and Mark Rylance as James Halliday. As another YouTuber pointed out, it's a little underwhelming how Art3mis is changed in the film into becoming a damsel in distress. Even as a guy it's become a tired trope. She's nothing like that in the books. And as for Simon Pegg as Hallidays friend and business partner Ogdon Morrow, he didn't strike me as that great in the film and after reading the book he became less believable, especially the small plot twist at the end.<br/><br/>Another spoiler I wanna add is the true identity of the character Aech, who's actually a young woman called Hellen, played by Lena Waithe. I like Waithe in the role; she's very charismatic, but as for her avatar Aech, she's portrayed as an 8 foot cyborg orc in the film, while in the book her avatar appeared as a straight white guy, to hide the fact of him in real life being all the opposites. And in the books Sho was also Japanese, like Daito. I think at the end when Sorrento kills Daito's avatar using Mechagodzilla, I think that's meant to be a reference to Daito in the books actually being tracked down in real life and kills by IOI members. Obviously, this movie was PG so they couldn't do that, not in a Spielberg film.<br/><br/>Overall, both the book and the film have they're person strengths and their strengths overall each other. I really think the next Ready Player One adaptation should be a TV series, and there would be plenty of material to work off of. If there's a remake of this film, or at least a sequel to this, I'm calling for Edgar Wright to direct it. This would be just his kind of film."

","I did not know what I would really think about it when I started to watch this movie. I hoped that I would like it but I was not sure what I would actually get. I used to like Steven Spielberg a lot but later in his career he's done movies that either was not my kind of movies or that I was simply not that impressed by. However, as it turned out, this one I liked a lot as you can see from my rating.<br/><br/>As a computer nerd and science fiction geek this movie was of course right up my alley. I have thought other movies would be my kind of movies before but been sorely disappointed by ignorant and incompetent screen writers and directors trying to cash in on subjects that they knew absolutely nothing about. Spielberg did a good job of not screwing this one up.<br/><br/>The core of this movie is of course plenty of action and computer generated special effects with a somewhat apocalyptic story to bind everything together. The story works but it is not really anything special and some of the stuff, like the loyalty centers, was frankly a bit silly. But, as I wrote, it works and does not get in the way so that's good enough for me.<br/><br/>As the previously mentioned nerd and geek I absolutely loved the abundant references to science fiction, fantasy and gaming history and lore. For me those were soo cool. I will probably watch the movie again just to focus on the background and see how much stuff I can spot. Stuff that I missed when watching the movie the first time.<br/><br/>The CGI effects and the action was also pretty awesome. The movie starts off right away with a great and absolutely insanely wild car race and continues to go strong from there. The battle at Doom castle at the end is just epic.<br/><br/>The only thing that made me go WTF was at the end (SPOILER AHEAD) were Mr A$$wipe Sorrento finally catches up with the High Five's van and then he just freezes and looks at Wade with a silly look on his face. What the f... was that? Just stupid for no good reason.<br/><br/>Well, few are the movies where there's nothing to gripe about. On the whole though this movie was great in my book. Also, I cannot say how pleased I am to finally watch a Hollywood movie that is not a remake or a sequel or a prequel or some other lame excuse to rehash a movie that has already been made."
"propatriavigilans2001","7","0","1","22 September 2018"," Has Spielberg lost his Mojo?
","In my estimation, Yes. Some people only have one hit song, design or art piece in them and that is it. it could also be that, once he made it big, Spielberg got rid of and/or stopped listening to the people who were helping him to make great movies. I think it is the latter. Mind you, this is not just from me, I was told by others that this movie would NOT be good Because it was a Spielberg film. I hope that did not bias me. 
 In any case, this film a good watch that had the potential to be of one of the super hero mega blockbusters. If you watch it, you will enjoy it. However it misses on servera key points. For instance, (Spoiler reminder) the hero sees his real life aunt and all his neighbors get killed in real life. The very next scene is a romantic one with him meeting the love of his life, without him missing a beat. I think that they did not want to ""Take the mood of the movie down"" as it were. This is what you do when you over think things and listen to marketing people. A real story needs the downs so that it can have the highs, the audience needs to be invested in what is going on, and they need to know that the main character is invested. Death of family and then love scene does not work. 
 They made some good decisions, as in who not to kill, but that was an easy one. It was a good decision to bring in the real life meet with the love interest earlier. They should have played into the cult of the egg hunters more, that would make it feel more like a club or family. Even more CGI scenes were needed. There were a lot of ""cameo's"" from game characters but they were all boring, I wanted cameo's with awesome things being done. Like I said, potential wasted. All in all, a 7.5 is a fair rating for this film."

","Spielberg at his best;
I really enjoyed this escape from reality and the homage to so many movies and cultural icons Steven Spielberg has managed to cram into this game within a game movie.
A few weeks ago I reviewed another virtual reality movie a (rom com) Game Night , which I really loathed and thought absolute crap so I was a little sceptical about Ready Player One.
Last Sunday we visited our neighbours very switched on and clever Grandson Callum for his 9th birthday celebration and he was engrossed in his new video game with head set in place and I could see it had captured his imagination and I spotted his Avatar or virtual reality identity in full destroyer battle mode.
I wish now I'd taken up his invitation to join in the game as I've never played a video game but there's always next time.
This experience unknowingly prepared me for this movie in which has cleverly combined real actors , who live in a bleak futuristic 2045 in dismal residential towers called ""The Stacks"".
The occupants of this dark and shattered world escape to the Oasis a virtual realty world where fantasy is the aim and adventure is the game.
Some have said this may be Spielberg 's greatest movie I'm not sure about that sweeping statement but it's up there with ET and Close Encounters.
A terrific youthful cast headed by Tye Sheridan as Parzival, our hero and Olivia Cooke as his capable side kick and romantic interest are the young game players but I was also impressed by the villain Australia 's Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento and Mark Rylance as Anorak and the inventor of the Oasis James Halliday.
Also loved the music and the fact that what could seem a bleak future Spielberg has transformed into a spectacular colourful world where the human element is most the important component.
It's more about friendship , loyalty and caring for your fellow humans and reality really wins out in the end.
A High Five ! and I'll add 4 to score this movie a 9."

"mcgrew","4","0","2","31 August 2018"," Disappointing, cookie-cutter treatment
","The novel kind of tired me out; even though I am of an age where I get *every* pop-culture reference, and played *every* video game, I got bored with the never-ending gushiness of it all. But I read it, and generally enjoyed it.<br/><br/>But the movie uses pretty much all of the dazzle of the book, and leaves behind pretty much all of the ""meat"" of it. Yes, the oasis is cool; it's a crossover between ""second life"" and your average PS4 game -- but for all its supposed sophistication, the oasis looks like a game of ""World of Warcraft"". An old one.<br/><br/>But what happened to the characters? Parzival is your average Spielberg hero -- pretty, but empty. He's pretty empty. But he must, no matter what, stop whatever he's doing to... save the girl. (In the book, it is Z who is captured.) And the heroine can thereafter wander around the evil guys lair without let or hinderance because even though they know *exactly* who she is, and exactly what she looks like, she can go anywhere -- even the head naughty-man's sanctum, and nobody notices. There were people who were not me what were saying (out loud), ""oh, c'mon!"" at this.<br/><br/>And the others 'gunters'? They are supposed to be the best of the best -- heck, Artemus is supposed to be *the* best. But she knows practically nothing that matters. Another supposedly 'elite' character announces that he can't help with a puzzle (the endlessly dull ""Shining"" one), because he is scared of the movie. What, he couldn't read the script? But anyway, since this is a Spielberg movie, there must be a 'fish out of water' that the hero explains things to -- to pass on information to the audience. In this case, this involves Z telling Artie things she *must* already know, to be the gunter she supposedly is. In the book, the quest is a matter of figuring out puzzles. In this movie, it's basically Z already knowing all there is to know, slogging his way through it, and dragging the rest of the ""high 5"" along; apparently because he likes to talk to them.<br/><br/>The movie nevertheless has a real problem with the contests for the keys, which are the driving force of the quest. For the book, the puzzles were tough, and led you to a tough contest to 'win' the key. (Also, it left out entirely that each character had to win the key personally. In the movie, once the key was used, everybody could just rush in. It cheapened things.) In the movie, the contest was an afterthought; once a character arrived at the contest arena, the key was essentially handed to them.<br/><br/>So, no, didn't like it. It did what Hollywood often does to complex stories, it dumbs them down (""simplifies them for the audience""), it uses stereotypes shamelessly (""uses archetypes""), and whenever things slow down, throws in explosions (""action sequence."") The only really surprising thing is that the original author at least put himself in as a script-by. They took a cute niche story and turned it into ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of 80's Videogames"", and he, apparently, helped. I'm sure the money was... excellent. The movie was... not."

","Having read the book a couple of times, I was pretty disappointed with this movie. I realize that you have to make decisions about what to include, what to change, etc... but they changed a lot of the story. They made the Oasis feel smaller than it was in the book. Also, the last scene where Og just shows up with a flimsy explanation of how he got there was laughably terrible. Compressing the story down to a few days as opposed to at least a year also messed with some of the more important relationships that take time to develop. It just didn't feel believable to me that V would fall in love with Artemis after just a few days of casual contact. Whereas in the book, they spend a lot of their time together."

The film makers thought to themselves that Ready Player One is a smoothie made out of lobster, wagyu beef, brie cheese and champagne, the finest foods there are, so it MUST taste good. No, it's crap and the simplicity of their thinking that having implicated good properties into this gunge somehow elevates it is embarrassing. <br/><br/>Great if you like playing 'spot that stolen property', not very entertaining and I just found myself infuriated and wanted it to end."
"leonblackwood","7","0","1","23 August 2018"," Worth A Watch! 7/10
","Review:
I actually enjoyed the first half of this movie, and the whole ""3 Keys"" concept was great but it seemed to go a bit crazy in the middle. Spielberg took full advantage of today's technology, in terms of the CGI, and he gave the film a meaning, by paying as much attention to the storyline, as the look of the film. As the movie was adapted from a popular book, written by Ernest Cline, Spielberg had a tough task to stay true to the original concept, which he did to perfection. I wasn't too impressed with the acting but the action made up for it, especially towards the end. Anyway, the movie is set in 2045, where people regularly seek escape from life through the virtual reality entertainment universe OASIS, which was created by James Halliday (Mark Rylance) and Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg), of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death in 2040, a pre-recorded message left by his avatar, Anorak, announces a game granting ownership of Oasis to the first to find the Golden Easter Egg within it, locked behind a gate requiring three keys. The contest has lured a number of egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI), who seeks to control OASIS himself. IOI uses a number of indentured servants and employees called ""Sixers"" to find the egg. Meanwhile, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) is an orphaned teenager living in the slums of Columbus Ohio with his aunt Alice. He is also an OASIS user, whose avatar is called Parzival, and is close friends with another user called Aech, a virtual mechanic. Parzival becomes close friends with another egg hunter called Art3mis, after saving her life while they are looking for one of the keys, and they manage to piece together 2 of the clues, using Halliday's historical files, to gain the keys. With Aech and his friends, Daito and Sho joining forces with Parzival and Art3mis, known as ""High Five"", they immediately become stars in the OASIS community, and they top the scoreboard of egg hunters, which upsets Sorrento's plans to take over. He soon manages to get Parzival's true identity, and he tries to sway Wade into joining IOI, which he refuses. In retaliation, Sorrento has IOI's head of operations, F'Nale Zandor, to bomb Wade's place, which kills Alice. Art3mis player, Samantha Cook, rescues Wade but they too are soon found by IOI, who captures and forces Samantha into their servitude. Wade is extracted by the other High Five members, who discover Samantha's location, and remotely help her to escape. The third challenge requires one to play Halliday's favourite Atari 2600 game, in a castle on Planet Doom, which Sorrento has protected with a force field. Parzival recruits other OASIS players to help the rebels attack the IOI forces around the castle. Art3mis deactivates the force field, allowing Parzival to reach the console but Sorrento activates the Cataclyst, a bomb that kills all the avatars on Planet Doom. As Parzival was given an extra life from the Archives Curator, he's able to proceed to play through the adventure to find the final key. After passing various tests set by Halliday, Parzival is given total control of the OASIS, which he splits with the other members of High Five. Sorrento is then arrested for bombing Planet Doom, and Parzival decides to shut the OASIS 2 days a week, so everyone spends more time in the real world. It's quite a detailed plot, which is original in a lot of ways but it could have been much simpler, so it would have attracted a younger audience. With all of the references to older movies, Spielberg could have made a movie spectacular but he chose to stay a bit safe by not pushing the boundaries. You do have to look hard to see the various movies that are used throughout the movie but some are very blatant, liked the use of the DeLorean from Back To The Future, King Kong and Akira's bike, which is Art3mis vehicle of choice. From an entertainment point of view, this movie works in a lot of ways, and the plot is very well put together but I'm sure that it would have been something special if it was Spielberg's own creation. A sequel hasn't been planned as yet but there is talk about a Ready Player 2 from the original writer. In all, it's a great watch, especially if you watch it in a cinema, or have a spectacular cinema system but it's not mysterious and magical like his previous projects. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
As I've said many times before, this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, who made his first feature film in 1964, called Firelight. After directing a few TV episodes, his next feature film was made in 1974, called The Sugarland Express, and then he returned with the critically acclaimed Jaws in 1975. Next came Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 1977, and 1941 in 1979. After a couple of years away from the camera, he returned with Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, and E.T. in 1982. Then came Twilight Zone in 1988, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, The Color Purple, Empire of the Sun, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Always, Hook, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park 1&2, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan, A.I., Catch Me If You Can, Minority Report, The Terminal, War of the Worlds, Munich, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Tintin, War Horse, Lincoln, Bridge of Spies, BFG, and the Post in 2017. With West Side Story and another Indiana Jones movie in the pipeline, Spielberg still has a lot of work left in him, and he has also produced over 100 movies, which means that he does a lot of work away from the camera as well. He is truly Mr. Hollywood, and after watching over 2 hours of bonus material, his calm demeanour, and pleasant personality really does prove that he is one of the best directors in the world today.<br/><br/>Budget: $175million

","Like so many others when I first saw the trailer for READY PLAYER ONE I sat mesmerized. Images of multiple pop culture characters flew by so fast that I wasn't able to keep up with all of them. There was Freddy Kruger, Chucky, The Iron Giant and so many more. My first thought was I can't wait to see this movie. But I missed it at the theater and waited for it to come out on DVD which it has. The end result? Not bad but not near what I'd hoped for.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 2045 and the world is not much worth noting. People live in hovels constructed of trailer homes stacked on top of one another, at least in the Columbus neighborhood our hero Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) lives in. The only escape people have from the problems in their lives is a virtual game that almost everyone plays called the OASIS. <br/><br/>In the OASIS people can be and appear any way they choose. Gender, looks, stature, even humanoid or alien life forms can be the person you are here. Co-created by James ""Anorak"" Halliday (Mark Rylance) and Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg) the game offers escape for everyone. But something is about to change.<br/><br/>With his death Halliday announces Anorak's game, a chance for anyone to win control of OASIS and the money that would come with it. The game is set up with Easter eggs, hidden items that provide specific clues that must be found to reach the all-important golden Easter egg. Three keys located within OASIS will provide the means necessary to find the final golden egg. <br/><br/>Wade is one of the best players there is using the avatar (chosen character) of Parzival. Along with several friends he sets out to find the eggs before anyone else. Along the way they add an additional member to their crew, a young player named Art3mis that Wade is attracted to. The crew sets out to accomplish their goal but have competition that is less than fair.<br/><br/>Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI), is looking for the clues as well. His goal is to take over the game and control of all online users in doing so, earning him and IOI billions in the process. To achieve this he employs a huge team of ""Gunters"", specialists who can decipher the clues they find combining their knowledge and computers as well as hundreds of ""Sixers"", an army of players who make a combined effort to prevent anyone else from achieving the goal of finding the eggs. <br/><br/>As Parzival/Wade begins finding the keys first, Sorrento and his team focus on taking him and his team out of the playing field. When they discover his real life location they do so there as well as in the online game, destroying his home and those around it in an explosion intended to kill him. Now Parzival/Wade not only has a reason to win to save the game but to avenge the death of his aunt and to stop Sorrento from total domination.<br/><br/>From the sound of things the movie would seem to be a winner and it did well at the box office. But while I enjoyed it well enough it didn't seem like a movie I would want to revisit. To start with while the pop culture icons was an enjoyable feature at first the fact that some images came and went so fast that you couldn't keep up and that they were popping up from the beginning to the end of the movie began to take its toll. The novelty of it wore off quickly and with that it became more of a nuisance rather than a plus. <br/><br/>The next issue I had was the length of the movie. At a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes it felt too long. Scenes that would have had a nice flow to them felt like they took too long to finish and thus felt like padding to me. Eventually I found myself thinking let's get on with it and waiting for the story to move forward. Others I've talked to who read the book felt that it wasn't long enough and that more items should have been included. Had the film done so and lasted 3 hours I don't know if I would have finished it.<br/><br/>The acting is great for all involved, both in their onscreen performances and as the animated character voices inside the game. Then again the fact that so much time was spent in the game with CGI animated characters also felt like a drag for me. I don't think I'm quite ready yet for a mix of CGI and real actors in a movie just yet. One or the other, fine but the combination also wears thin after a while. <br/><br/>In the end it wasn't a bad movie just not one that I enjoyed as much as I had hoped I would. And I doubt that I'll ever sit down and watch it a second time. But for the fans who loved it I'm sure they'll be out buying copies left and right. Me? I think I'd even pass up picking up a used copy of it. Still if you haven't seen it and it looks up your alley it is worth a rental at least."
"lisathomas-41686","3","0","1","19 August 2018"," Disappointing
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I wanted to finish the book first and so I raced through, captivated by the story. I couldn't put it down and was desperate to get to the end so I could watch the big-screen version. What a terrible let down. <br/><br/>The film is nothing like the book at all. I expected some of the scenes and sub-plots to be removed to get it down to roughly two hours, but the plot is virtually unrecognizable. The characters don't match those described in the book, which takes away some of the key developments in the story. The pace is too fast because they are just trying to cram things in and there's not much context given to anything. I don't understand how anyone who hasn't read the book could follow It! Despite being really excited to watch it, I found myself playing with my phone halfway through because I was bored. <br/><br/>I really wanted to love this film but unfortunately I think this is the most disappointed I have ever been with a book-to-film transition :-("

Nothing outside of the Oasis was remotely interesting and had little to no impact of any kind. I lie there was some impact of cringe, especially at the 'relationship' between main guy and main girl (don't remember their names who cares). <br/><br/>The idea of the big game to get ownership was cool in thought but the creator guy didn't seem like the type to have the secret clues be so related to him personally, he ain't Voldemort.

Yeah, this one has a rival company use employees to play the video game, except the employees are debtors like in The Diamond Age --assuming that throwaway idea was still in the book after it was retitled; originally read it as an ARC when it was called A Young Lady's Primer or something like that.

So I gave the book a go and really enjoyed it. While it was a little cringey in places it was a good book. So I then quite looked forward to film. This film takes the overarching theme and throws all that's good out of the window. I was so disappointed to find so many great moments from the book totally abandoned. Such a wasted opportunity. What we end up with is a super generic, weak attempt. The film felt rushed and totally lacking of substance. Every now and then they throw something in that happens in the book totally out of context just so it has something from the book. The end was terrible. It throws in concepts that totally ruin the world and physics of real world/vr interaction. Seems like it's made by someone who has never played a computer game.

Like i said before the References are the Selling Point of the movies which is so Bloated with References that it stops being Fun, cause most of them feel Pointless except to get the Audience to see something they recognize, all it made me wanna do was go watch the Movie there referencing which doesn't really help the Movie if all its doing is making me think of other Movies when you want them to be invested in the one there currently watching, but yeah the References are way too much not even Subtle about it like so many other Movies that handle there References with Care, while Movie just throws as many in to see what works, now Besides the References there isn't much to talk about the Character's were extremely Weak and the most basic run of the mill types of character's where they try to give them Development but it falls flat, you got Normal Teen Lead played by Tye Sheridan who I Love in other Movies but here he's given nothing to work with, along side him is a Normal Teen Love Interest played by Olivia Cook who is another Actress who is not given the right material that could make her character so much more interesting and all the side character's are stale. Besides Mark Rylance who plays the only interesting character you understand why he created this World to Escape from Reality, the Story is the normal Young-Adult Book to Movie Teens go against evil Government lead by Evil people who love to wear White, it brings nothing new to a Genre that is Dead besides adding a bunch of References which we already discussed so the one thing this movie does different than all the other ones it does wrong, I can't say I recommend seeing it in theater's unless you just want a Plethora of Pop Culture References being shoved down your throat along side the most Generic Story I'm pretty sure you've seen before an done better Overall 4/10 Pretty Bland an Forgettable a few entertaining Moments and 1 Good Performance but don't really make up for the Problems sadly, not an unwatchable Movie but i have no urge to revisit it."

"tom-james-brennan","2","0","1","10 August 2018"," A disappointing adaptation
","Yes, I read the book before seeing the movie. Yes, most film adaptations of books are not great representations of the original material. However, I'll counter that thin argument by saying that in the hands of a great director like Spielberg, a book adaptation should be so much more faithful to the plot which makes it great, rather than just good. Take Peter Jackson's Lord of the rings trilogy. He knew there was too much material to squeeze into a 3 hour movie, so he made 3 movies, and ended up with arguably the greatest fantasy adventure movies ever created. Spielberg ends up here with a movie that is entertaining for the masses who didn't read the book, but with something that could and should have been so much greater, deeper, and intelligently done.<br/><br/>The quest for the keys in the book is great entertainment and would translate nicely onto the screen. Instead we get a car race which is so fast and full of reference that it's hard to keep up, a second key hidden inside a movie which was nothing to do with the book, and overall character reveals which don't trigger any emotional response (as they did in the book). <br/><br/>It's difficult to give this movie a fair review, as I can see it from both sides of the coin (my wife who didn't read the book, and my 8 year old son loved it), but I'm aware of what it could have been, and I'm only disappointed. <br/><br/>Please, if you've not read the book, get down to a library and immerse yourself in it. I read it in a day and it was absolutely incredible. I grew up on pretty much all the nostalgic references, and the characters and plot are superbly done. I guarantee you'll love the book way more than you enjoyed the film."

","Detail-wise, it's not the book. It doesn't matter though as it does cover much of the general themes, settings, allusions, etc. Decent job by Spielberg by reinterpreting the book.
That being said, it doesn't really have much to go on. It's fun enough, but somewhat confusing, relying on special effects to handle the inconsistencies in the lack of continuity and abrupt changes in the character relationships unexplained by the script.
Still - it's ok, but nothing great.
The soundtrack, although Alan Silvestri instead of John Williams, is really the most saccharine John Williams it could be. The 80s reference music are totally in line with the book, but that soundtrack other than those notes, is completely distracting, melodramatic and annoying.
Anyhow - a solid 5 overall."

Stellar acting across the board, especially from Mark Rylance. But I have a major gripe with this movie, and that's sadly about an important aspect of every movie. The plot. It's no issue for me if a story seems silly, I can get behind that, but this one just doesn't seem believeable at all. A bunch of ""Gunters"" (short for Egg Hunters) set out to find three keys in order to take control of the Oasis, this virtual world everyone is so addicted to. It is stated that several years have passed since the compitiation began, and a strange portal to a race opened, that upon completition, will grant players with the first key. But it seems that completition is impossible due to King Kong blocking the path to the end. And that's where the Gunters come in, and after a quick look at some archives, the Gunters find out that the only way to complete the race...is to drive backwards... Yes, this movie wants you to believe that it has taken people several years to try out driving backwards. It's dumb things like these that just make you go, ""what?"" And that's why it's so important that you watch this movie on a big screen. Because otherwise, you'll notice how dumb this whole thing is, instead of being sucked in by the visuals."

This is FAMILIAR TERRITORY to explore the jungle of our collective imaginations.<br/><br/>AND IT SUCKS IN THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>It is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but no other kids get eliminated with any moral to it, Slugworth has an army of machine gun toting thugs and no cops in the way to stop him, and Willy Wonka is sitting in the corner chewing on his own clothing quietly like a kid with pica. And throw in a hot girlfriend who is sad because of a contrived backstory and she is not pretty enough in real life.<br/><br/>Oh, you think this film is better than this? Well, if you see any love on the screen it is not in the main plot. The cameos, the in jokes, the references, and all that were given to the post production and special effects teams and were added like bumper stickers to the back of my ugly broken car. It is still an ugly broken car no matter how many stickers I put on it. But unlike my car, you might see my car for 2 minutes in traffic. You are not locked into starring at the back of my car for 2 hours to analyze why Marvin the Martian, Robocop, and Chun Li are standing next to eachother. There is no juxtaposition to give these cameos relevance.<br/><br/>It is not an army of heroes vs an army of villains. It is not an army of souless robots vs fanciful whimsical creatures. It is not werewolves against vampires. There is no difference between the machine gun touting army of soldiers, robots, and wizards and the good guy machine gun touting army of soldiers, robots, and wizards. FAIL. ARTISTIC FAIL. <br/><br/>And one last tangent: in a game world where people can apparently use the Oasis with a keyboard at their desk.............why have full body virtual reality slave phone booths?

Parzival In Virtual Reality (Ty Sheridan) or Wade in real life (also Tye Sheridan) enters the Oasis often, but now there is a new wrinkle: the creator of the Oasis Anorak/James Halliday (Mark Rylance) has died and has left a legacy and has left clues to 3-Keys or as he called them, an Easter Egg, and the one who finds the 3-Keys will inherit all he owned in life and will gain control of the Oasis. Wade decides to find those keys and win.<br/><br/> There is simply too much CGI in here and after a while, it put me into la-la land. The story bounces back and forth between real life and the Oasis with Virtual Reality. And, truth be told someone liked playing with the CGI buttons too much and we find ourselves watching everything in the Oasis for way too long. And all became quite boring for me. Yes, the CGI is fantastic, no doubt about it, but when it goes on for too long I find myself dozing off. The story could have been cut back some, but like I said someone liked playing with the CGI buttons and I dozed off many times. Not good. <br/><br/>
There is a love interest for Wade/Parzival and that is Art3mis in VR (Olivia Cooke) and Samantha (also Olivia Cooke) in real life and she is also into finding those keys. <br/><br/>Am glad I was awake when Parzival and Art3mis danced to the music of ""Staying Alive"" Very nice. <br/><br/>Notables: Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento a bad guy who wants to make sure Parzival doesn't find the keys; Simon Pegg as the Curator who has access to all of Halliday's memories in life; Mark Ryland is also Anorak, an Avatar an all knowing Wizard; Win Morisake as Daito, a friend of Parzival; Philip Zhao as Sho, also a friend of Parzival; Lena Waithe as Aech/Helen, friend of Parzival and he is a very muscular mechanic. (you did say ""he"", right? ) Yes, anyone can be anything in the Oasis. Weren't you paying attention? <br/><br/>If this was shorter and finding the keys was quicker, this may have been okay, but it wasn't. It just went on for too long especially with too much background info between Parzival and Art3mis. <br/><br/>This was a CGI-Fest and there was too much of it. On the whole I would say it's watchable if you don't doze off, but to be fair I would say Gamers may love it for whatever reason. They love this stuff. (5/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes.

I thought maybe seeing the book come alive on the screen would serve the story better but the story was only sort of present in the film. The basic frame is there but the soul is gone. Really though, Ready Player One is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory only with video games, virtual reality, and not nearly as good. Unlike Charlie and the Choclate Factory there is no wicked humor and no Gene Wilder. There were enough 80s and 90s references to be mildly entertaining but after awhile the whole thing becomes a bit of a mess - too much CGI and too much mindless action. I also had hopes that they would fix the rampant sexism, homophobia, and racism in the book when they made the film only to discover that all the things that made Aech, Art3mis, Shoto, and Daito remotely cool in the book are either gone or greatly watered down - what a shock. So... if you want to see mind numbing testosterone fueled action where sexism, homophobia, and racism have survived the ""corn-syrup shortage"" and the "" bandwidth riots"" then this movie is for you!"

I watched this movie when it came out (tbh I don't why I'm releasing a review 5 months later) but I was kinda hyped. The trailers looked good, I haven't read the book so my opinion may change when I read the book, and it was being directed by Steven Spielberg. The movie has good moments like that car chase sequence in the movie was pretty awesome to watch and the first couple of minutes of the last battle was good. But the movie suffers from character development and that has a big toll on movies based of books cause you see your favourite characters from books being brought to life."
"cherold","6","0","5","11 July 2018"," Spielberg tries to do a Spielberg-tribute film and can't quite pull it off
","Like the TV series Stranger Things, Ready Player One is suffused with nostalgia for the sort of movies Steven Spielberg was making in the 80s; big fun movies with spunky kids and cool special effects.<br/><br/>Set in a dystopian world where people escape the grim real world for an exciting virtual one, the movie resolves around a virtual-world search for keys that will grant ownership of the entire enterprise to the finder. The hunt is undertaken by amateurs like protagonist Wade and by a mega-corporation with hundreds of gamer employees. Who will win out win out, the plucky teen or the resource-heavy corporation? (Hint: it's a Spielberg movie.)<br/><br/>The movie is full of 80s music and movie references, but the movie never makes clear why (it wasn't until I read a plot synopsis of the book that I understood it's because the virtual-world's creator was a big 80s geek) nor , with maybe one exception, makes the 80s integral to the plot. <br/><br/>The script is frustratingly lazy. The first brilliant thing Wade does is the sort of thing someone would have done by then anyway. After a major crime, there's no investigation and no one even calls the police, yet the movie never establishes a world where people would react that way. While the competition between Wade and the corporation is portrayed as of great consequence, the reasons it's so important are vague, forcing the movie to rely on the CEO being horribly evil. In a scene that particularly aggravated me, Wade sends out a call for help to a world even though it's never been established that anyone understands the stakes or even that there are stakes. Spielberg is too experienced to make a movie that simply assumes everyone in the film knows everything the audience does.<br/><br/>Yes, there are exciting special effects, and I probably would have enjoyed this more on a big screen where I could fully appreciate the crazy mix of avatars, but a movie has to be more than it's special effects. And outside of an intriguing performance by Mark Rylance, there's not a lot outside of the effects.<br/><br/>Also, there's just a lack of ... something. One of the film's most notable set pieces takes place in a virtual Overlook Hotel, and while it's cute, it feels a bit wan. I think the actual 1980s Spielberg would have done it so much better.<br/><br/>And that's a lot of the problem. Spielberg is an old man whose best recent movies like Bridge of Spies and War Horse are from a mature director. Spielberg is simply the wrong person to make a Spielberg tribute film.<br/><br/>While I hate movie reviews that talk about the different movie that could have been made, I would have been more interested in a movie that considered the way in which escaping to a virtual world would cause people to let their own real world collapse. It's such an obvious take that it feels like the movie is purposely not pursuing it because they want to keep things light.<br/><br/>And yes, they keep things light. This movie is as light as air. It is pure fluff. For all its grand scale, it is a very slight movie. But a perfectly watchable one."
"jg_1977","5","0","2","10 July 2018"," Unfaithful adaptation, middle of the road Spielberg
","Ready Player One is movie that had an unfair amount of expectations riding on it. It's based on a beloved book and directed by one of the most celebrated living directors of all time. With that in mind, it's pretty understandable why most people were underwhelmed by it. Book fans were disappointed by the drastic departures it took from the original story. Spielberg fans felt like they were being pandered to with cheap nostalgial. That said, if you take away these lofty standards, it's a perfectly fine movie. Certainly nowhere near as impressive as some of Spielberg's other films, but I think it was his best work in the past 10 years. Visually, it's absolutely breathtaking with some of the best CGI you'll see. The characters are pretty one-dimensional but likeable nonetheless. The dialogue is mostly good, but there are a few lines that are either just clunkily inserted exposition or a loosely related popculture reference. In terms of story, it works perfectly fine but as I mentioned, it's significantly different from the book. However, almost all the changes I think were necessary to make it a more cinematically pleasing experience since half of the book is just descriptions of people playing videogames. <br/><br/>If you're expecting a faithful adaptation of the book or the second coming of Spielberg, you'll most likely be disappointed, but if you can set that aside, it's an enjoyable film."
"geekscompendium","7","0","1","10 July 2018"," Ready Player One: 4K Review
","Like many who had read the book I was sceptical when the film was first announced, Ernest Clines first Novel ""Ready Player One"" took me on an unforgettable nostalgia trip crammed packed with what seemed like my entire childhood.<br/><br/>With so many franchises, characters and music tracks I didn't think it would get out of the starting blocks, I mean, who could get all these different companies on board? I'll tell you who Steven frickin Spielberg, that's who!<br/><br/>The story is set in 2044-2045 where the world has become a dumping ground, and many of its inhabitants are living in makeshift homes made up of Jenga style stacked trailers called the Stacks.<br/><br/>To escape the misery of the real world, many people turn to the fantasy of Virtual Reality which enables them to become whoever they want, do what they want, when they want in the make-believe universe called ""The Oasis.""
The co-founder James Halliday has just passed away leaving ""The Oasis"" and its fortunes as a prize to whoever can solve the retro driven puzzles he has left behind.<br/><br/>Ready Player One pays tribute to many well-known Film, T.V and Game franchises such as Back To The Future, Nightmare On Elm Street, King Kong, Batman, Robocop, Aliens, Star Wars, Halo, Starcraft and Duke Nukem, Street Fighter, Mass Effect, there is literally too many to mention in this review.<br/><br/>Albeit the film doesn't touch on a lot of the book, it does do well to cram in the main story into the 2 hours 19 minutes of runtime, and as a massive fan of the book, I was not disappointed with what Spielberg has done with Ready Player One and how it translates in to the blockbuster hit it has become.<br/><br/>As mentioned in the title this is the 4k HDR review of this film, and if ever a movie was made 4k and a rip-roaring soundtrack this is it.<br/><br/>Straight from the get-go, visually Ready Player One looks jaw-dropping, the detail is phenomenal especially as for the most part there is so much happening on the screen at once, you can still see everything in its glory. The use of HDR (or Dolby Vision) if your TV supports it, helps significantly in this area by being able to show more of the dynamic range (A higher level of brightness) and much deeper black levels.<br/><br/>For the audio side of things, this disc supports all your standard formats alongside the superior Dolby Atmos Track which blew my mind. I am fortunate enough to able to make use of the latterly mentioned track and own many a film that support it, but by far the Atmos track on this disc is the best I have ever heard on any movie to date, it is just thunderous.<br/><br/>There is a scene in the film referencing Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining,"" and a lot is going on audibly. Axes swing from all angles, blood-filled hallways running like a river smashing up against walls all while characters are shouting and screaming yet everything can be heard clearly and from every direction the director intended, the final scene is just mind blowing and is leaps and bounds ahead of anything I have heard before.<br/><br/>If you own a 4k TV/Projector supporting HDR you are in for a treat if you own the latter and an Atmos setup strap in for the ride as this is reference material at its finest."

The story was butchered so badly that at best it had like 20% of the book. Character arcs were changed, story line was nothing like the original, the essence of characters was completely butchered and changed, new characters were introduced that added absolutely zero to the movie.

This movie is almost perfect.<br/><br/>Almost.<br/><br/>There are a few things that it could have done better. Most of these things has to do with I-R0K.<br/><br/>First of all, T.J. Miller was so miscast. They should have made his voice deeper so he would seem more terrifying. The point of I-R0K is that he's a big, scary guy, and he had everything - except for the voice and the courage. I know he's a free spirit that noone is really sure whether or not to trust, but that made him seem cowardly more that a person with no alliances. The ""battle"" against him was cringeworthy. Wasn't he supposed to be tough and strong? The only reason IOI wanted him was because he knew how to activate the orb - but Art3mis could do the exact same thing, and it was apparently easy to learn. Also, couldn't they have sent a spy to take Parzival out? I-R0K could have been awesome, but instead he ended up being a pointless character. <br/><br/>Otherwise, it's an amazing movie that I definitely recommend watching, whether you like video games or not"

Everything from superheroes, to legendary anime characters, to video games, to famous Hollywood cars and trucks, etc....everything.

It's everything you could imagine and more.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty remarkable. It's one part Wreck-It Ralph meets The Matrix with a bit of Hunger Games sprinkled over it.

","Ready Player One directed by Steven Spielberg is based on Ernest Cline's 'Holy Grail of Pop Culture' of the same name and it rather borrows a large chunk of the concept from the book than adapt it word by word to the big screen. Having read the book it feels taboo to compare the book with the movie. My only regret is, like most book-to-movie adaptation, the movie had to be watered down to be contained into 120 minutes thereby diluting a lot of plot. Spielberg clearly has taken the creative liberty in adapting the book to a more contemporary audience. Of course, he generously pays homage to major pop culture references from the book, but he has added a lot too. Read on to find out if its worth your time, virtual or not.<br/><br/>Set in 2045, when the world is on the brink of chaos, people are resorting to a virtual reality world called the OASIS for both work and leisure. Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), an orphan from the desolate 'stacks', along with the whole world, is off to find an easter egg in the OASIS planted by the game's own brilliant nerd of a creator, James Halliday. Finding the egg grants the player complete ownership of the company. Wade has to figure out all the clues that Halliday has cleverly hidden in the OASIS' vast game worlds. He is also in a race against the evil corporation, IOI, run by Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelson) and is hell-bent on finding the egg making Wade's and his friend's adventure difficult.<br/><br/>Much of the movie takes place in the OASIS and is packed to the brim with awe-inspiring visuals and nerd culture. With the amount of action happening in the OASIS it was almost impossible to track a whos-who of pop culture icons and references. From Batman to Tracer, from Akira to Halo, one thing is sure, this could be one of THE most paused movies of all time when it releases on home video. This movie could have easily been something cashing in on nostalgia and pop culture references: a la 'cameo fest', but with Spielberg at the helm, it was both a boon and a curse. As mentioned early on, Spielberg, Cline, and Penn took their liberty to adapt the movie to be a visual epic than a straightforward adaptation and it does the job rather well. The first set piece, which was a racing sequence with absolutely no musical score had 'Spielberg' written all over it. But at the same time, there were moments so unremarkable and it felt like any other AAA director could have done the same. The real world felt very underwhelming and so were the issues that IOI caused in it which were reduced to one-liner dialogues, hardly exposing any of the dire issues or the repercussions of IOI that plagued the world.<br/><br/>Coming to performances, the lead Wade Watts aka Parzival played by Tye Sheridan was better off as an avatar. Even under Spielberg's direction, Sheridan's Off-OASIS performances were just okay. Olivia Cooke, on the other hand, was oozing charm and the right amount needed for her character as both Samantha and her OASIS avatar Art3mis. Ben Mendelson, as usual, chews the scenery. The guy proves once again why he's the go-to choice for antagonists. Mark Rylance is another actor whom I am fond of seeing on screen. Whether it be Bridge Of Spies, BFG or Dunkirk, Rylance's performance always feels natural and its no different here as both James Halliday and his avatar Anorak. Screen time for Simon Pegg's Ogden Morrow was unforgivably short.<br/><br/>John Willam's absence was really noticeable and Alan Silvestri's score, although not bad, just didn't stick. Fortunately, the soundtrack makes up for it which starts off with the energetic 'Jump by Van Halen' and ends with the equally preppy 'You make my dreams come true by Hall & Oates'.<br/><br/>In the end, Ready Player One is confused who it is for. If you're expecting a visually stunning action movie with a serviceable story to boot then this is definitely up your alley but if you're expecting a Spielberg directed, plot-heavy and character-driven epic, you might be disappointed.<br/><br/>The same goes for the fanservice in the movie. Is it for the 40-year-olds who might get high with most of 80's and 90's pop culture references in the movie or for the newer generation who'd be pleased with the more recent pop culture icons they have sprinkled gratuitously. The age-old question of ""Book or Movie, which one's better?"" still applies here and the answer is 'Yes, it always will be the book"". While reading the book I thought it'd be great to see it on celluloid but it's the other way around. The only thing I was able to appreciate more after watching the movie was the book itself which I found was only mediocre."
"i_love_siobhan_magnus","9","0","1","26 June 2018"," ""Thank You for Playing My Game""
","Many critics say that this movie is just a hodgepodge of old school pop culture icons exploiting the feeling of nostalgia in the 80s and 90s. Spielberg even spent a large portion of this movie - specifically, the journey to find the second key - on the classic Shining as a tribute. But beyond the smoke and screen, if you dig deep into the theme of this movie, you'll see a biblical context in it. No I'm not a religious rightwinger or conspiracy nut, just to clarify. Believe it or not, you can see Jesus in the male lead and a ""jailbreak"" salvation in many dystopian sci fi movies specifically about RATS IN THE MAZE experiment - Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Divergent, Passengers, you name it. The hero is thrown into such a big game in virtual reality. At the beginning he doesn't know why he is there, he may not even know who he really is, but slowly and surely he comes to understand the intention of the game's creator, then he gathers a group of like-minded disciples and fights their way out, and finally he meets the mighty creator and enters in a new life.<br/><br/>This theme couldn't be more obvious in this movie. Not only do you have Halliday, the God of this Oasis game and Wade the Savior worthy of Halliday's legacy, you even have the Holy Scripture in it - the journal archive that has documented the creator's entire life and reveals the genesis of this game. However, what's really brilliant is the depiction of Nolan as Satan. It is so accurate that he bears every character of the Serpent: he used to be an intern working for Halliday with his own ambition to run the game in his way, like what Lucifer to God; he built a huge organization to take control of the game and enslaved people to work for him, just like what Satan does in this world; he tempted Wade to bow down to him after he identified Wade as the lucky one who won the first challenge, as Satan tempted Jesus; finally, with a rallying call to arms, Wade led all the players in the epic battle against Nolan's minions, the battle of Armageddon in which all believers join Jesus, descending from heaven to fight against Satan and his army as it is said in Revelation. And of course, the ""extra life"" resurrection and the final reunion with Halliday, the Creator. Nolan has all the resources in both reality and the virtual world, but at the end he still lost because through this game, he lost his soul whereas Wade regained it. <br/><br/>If you wanna argue about the message - or lack there of - in this movie, I'd say that it explains the spirit of playing game. It's not meant to be a sanctuary to escape realiy, not is it about winning in the competition, but to relate to the game designer through the game and rediscover yourself. The designer created the game to reveal his talents, just as God's creation reveals His glory. The true heir whom the Creator has chosen to inherit His kingdom is the real player who loves the game and admires the designer. That's all a game designer could ask for, to appreciate him and offer his gratitute to the players, just as Halliday's farewell to Wade, ""Thank you for playing my game."" To sum it up, the journey is the reward, and along the way you'll find those hidden Easter Eggs that are the Creator's signature in his masterpiece, just like it is in the Adventure game."

"tetrahex","Null","0","2","22 June 2018"," Interesting but flawed concept now that people have actual experience with the limitations of VR
","Interesting but flawed concept now that people have actual experience with the limitations of vr its just a bit harder to take, because real vr is like a mummy simulation, you cant feel, you can't move, and your hands are useless, this isn't really solved in the film either and you have people running down the street with vr goggles on at some point. So there's a certain amount of cringe factor, with luscious visuals, but in the end people fighting over a video game is kind of ridiculous. Plus whats with the jewish lead casting in every Spielberg film, its becoming a bit on the nose. There was a time in the past when this would have played better, before the big bang theory and cosplayification of culture made hypersuperficial ""geek"" interests mainstream, its gone past cringe at this point<br/><br/>The fundamental problem with this film is that the world building is incomplete, they didn't make the world coherent and so it feels off no matter how much you try to suspend your disbelief. You have characters doing incredible moves in the game world while we are supposed to believe they are just waving their arms around in the real world. The level of immersion we are shown does not match up with the technology of that world. It doesn't matter if your sensory suit can shock you if you can't pick up even a coffee cup and feel its weight in your hand, the disconnect is simply too severe. If they had gone with a matrix style ""plugged"" straight into the brain type experience then yes, all this could have been made plausible, but vr goggles with a bit of spandex simply doesn't cut it. Even if people aren't fully conscious of these problems, its likely noticed by all, and the disconnect simply prevents any real investment in the story. They thought more about the pop culture tie ins than in building the world itself, rendering the film as superficial as the cultural tie ins placed everywhere, almost at random, without meaning."

","Ready Player One might be the best film of 2018 so far. At the very least, it's the most fun you'll have at the movies anytime soon. Yet it's not without flaws. Spielberg and Cline (who co-wrote the script with Zak Penn) could have given us more real-world exposition at the beginning - as the book did - so we could better understand Wade and the circumstances in which he lives. It's also not as narratively crisp as the typical Spielberg film, especially on first viewing, when the frenetic pace and sensory overload are palpable. But Spielberg is a master editor, and expanding or slowing the story might have added unnecessary minutes to the already hefty 140-minute runtime."

","This film is about a boy who lives in a really futuristic and technologic reality where everyone plays a video game where they can have a new life. However, everything turns different when the creator of the game dies and a new mission in the game starts to be crowned the inheritor of the empire.<br/><br/>For me this film is really normal, nothing too much different from the other films. The story is the same: a boy who is a normal player but he gets to know the clue of the game and succeeds both in the game and in love. I would have liked to see something new from the typical love story although the film is interesting and great for having some fun with friends, but I would not pay for watching it at the cinema.<br/><br/>The animation is really good actually and in some scenes, they mixed real filmed images with animated ones and it was interesting. However, at some points the film lacked of story, just explosions and action without any relevant images, but I guess this is a film for entertaining and they did not wanted to create a piece of art. Also the characters were a little bit stereotypical as there were the main boy, the girl (who represents all the women in the world), an asian guy who knows martial arts, a chinese kid who is very smart, and a black girl who seems to represent the LGBT community.

","A cool premise can only take a film so far. At first glance, Ready Player One has all the potential to be a franchise-starting movie with its large-scale world building and plethora of pop culture references. Unfortunately, Steven Spielberg's newest work falls a bit flat due to a multitude of shortcomings in key aspects of the film. The most glaring issues are in a script, which feels like common fanfiction centered around a forgettable protagonist. Meanwhile, the direction, production design & editing of Ready Player One are all satisfactorily executed but with enough inattention that the experience sometimes feels like an afterthought.<br/><br/>The famous Spielberg touch does show up at the tail end of Ready Player One but, at that point, it feels almost jarring. This inconsistent vision is a huge detriment to a movie based around such a stylish premise. Ultimately, there are enough cool moments and adequate techniques that should have most viewers calling Ready Player One passable. However, its unfocused and generic vibe will leave many audience members feeling sneaking disappointment.<br/><br/>Writing: 5/10

"adam-may-bower","7","0","1","2 June 2018"," Enjoyable
","'Ready Player One' is a visually striking adventure film that becomes too saturated with it's pop-culture references. Directed by Stephen Spielberg, one of America's most renowned directors, one would naturally have high expectations. With greats such as 'Jurassic Park', 'Jaws', 'Indiana Jones' and 'Saving Private Ryan' behind his back, a high quality is certainly expected. And after his rather dull film 'The Post', I was certainly hoping to experience the fun side of Spielberg. Thankfully, we got it! Full of spectacular action sequences, breathtaking animations and an engaging storyline, this film is a delight to watch. Tye Sheridan shines in the leading role of Wade, alongside the great supporting actress of Olivia Cooke. Although we saw more of their animated faces, their talent was certainly apparent on the screen and I am certainly invested in their future endeavours. The soundtrack to this film is wonderful as well, with a vast collection of iconic 80's song that immerse the audience into the nostalgic atmosphere. However, this brings me to the main problem of the film; the pop-culture of the film. This movie is crammed with far too many references and easter eggs that becomes exhausting. It was certainly a self-indulgent move by Spielberg to include references to his previous works, essentially showing off to the audience his success of pop-culture status. While it's certainly cool to notice small nods to familiar franchises, it's rather pretentious to load a movie that is over two hours with non-stop excess of everything loved by nerds over the past decades. It would have been more interesting if the films, games and toys referenced in this film were fictional ones, that alluded to real ones through similarity, rather then blatantly shoving nostalgia down the audiences throat. Additionally, the characters in this film felt very cheaply written and underdeveloped. The leading character wasn't entirely likeable and had a few cheesy moments that showed the character's storylines were certainly undermined during the production. However, this film is certainly not a bad film (I quite enjoyed it), but it is far from perfect."
"mitchellgregor","6","0","1","1 June 2018"," Never Read the Book
","Pros: 
I very much enjoyed the nostalgia I experienced in this movie. Quite the concept and executed well. The movie definitely thrives on its pop culture references and assumption of viewers knowledge of video games, but if that applies to you, then it's an easy movie to enjoy. The plot is simple enough and it's easy to follow so you can just have fun watching it. Personally I had a lot of fun watching this movie, probably because I'm easily entertained, but the point still stands that it was a nostalgic thrill ride that made me remember why I loved video games growing up. Perfect for the kid inside everyone. <br/><br/>Cons:
The characters did seem shallow and we were automatically supposed to care about the Asian characters without much of an emotional attachment when they were introduced in the real world. The villains are cut and paste corporate baddies who want the same thing as every other movie, money and power. 
Last thing: Plot is a bit too simple. The clues that Wade and co. figure out are very simple and seem like things that more than one person should've figured out. And for IOI, they have a full team of analysts and scientists and they were only able to figure out one thing and do it too late. The movie makes everyone in the world seem kinda stupid besides one group of 5 people. At one point, one character says he had invested 10 years in his character. It makes no sense that not a single person would figure out Halladay's challenge within that period of time.!<br/><br/>Bottom line: great summer movie to watch with your buds or family to have fun with. Don't take it too seriously if you read the book, or else you'll waste your time from what I've heard. I would definitely watch again just to spot some more Easter eggs as this movie is packed full of them."

"J-bot6","7","0","1","1 June 2018"," Still worth seeing, despite the changes
","Yes, there are a lot of changes from the book. Filmmakers have no choice in that regard, so this shouldn't be a surprise to savvy film-goers. <br/><br/>Over all, I felt that most of the changes were pretty good. Some even handled scenes a bit better than the book did. I felt that the book made too big a deal about Aech being a black girl. Why would that be such a shock to Wade anyway? Thankfully, the film handled that better and just had him acknowledge right away that Helen is Aech, is his friend, they're in danger, and they'd better run -- quick!<br/><br/>Certainly I was sad to see quite a few references disappear, including: Dungeons of Daggorath, all of the music by Rush, the Joust challenge, War Games references, etc.... At the same time, I completely understand the reasons for changing those references since -- lets face it -- how many people in the general public today even know what Dungeons of Daggorath is?<br/><br/>Thankfully, most of the references that were 'removed' still appear here and there in the background for observant people to spot. It was nice to see a functioning ColecoVision in the scene near the end of the film. And there's a Rush poster on the wall in that same scene. <br/><br/>There are people on IMDB whining about how the movie is packed full of pop culture. Well, here's news to those who haven't figured it out yet: The book and the film ARE pop culture. They're cans of pop culture that happen to have a label that reads, ""Ready Player One."" If you're expecting something other than that, then you're too confused to write a review that's relevant to the film.<br/><br/>On a more technical note, this film is shot well, effects are quite good, and the pacing is pretty quick. The tasks that characters take on have changed a bit from the book. When Art3mis was captured, I was afraid that it was going to turn into a 'damsel in distress' cliche. However, her escape was more of an assist, with Samantha having the guts to take the risks required to shut down the shield (although that kind of 'borrows' from Star Wars part IV).<br/><br/>The acting was good, with Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance both doing an exemplary job. And although he doesn't appear in the book, T.J. Miller's I-R0k turned out to be my favorite character. He helps make up for the omission of the Lich.<br/><br/>Another fun addition is the segment from the Shining. I dare say their representation of The Shining is actually better than Kubrick's. They even went as far as to add a scene that Kubrick's film sadly left out. It was nice to see it included here, and was a subtle and clever way to reveal an aspect of Helen's character.<br/><br/>For those who so wanted more of the build-up that the book had, consider that such a long arc would have been plodding and slow cinematically. That's just the way it works in film. I'm sure that would feed the flame of those reviewers that somehow found this film to be boring. How that's possible is beyond me. Perhaps there's a subset of the population that needs to stare at strobe lights 24/7 while listening to three soundtracks at the same time in order to be entertained. If that's the case, perhaps they should consider themselves to be outside the bell curve and keep their comments to their own clique..<br/><br/>Sorrento was a bit of a departure from the character in the book -- to the point where he looked like he actually sympathized with Wade at the end of the film. This is something that I don't buy at all and feel that he should only have hesitated because the police were there and not out of any sense of morality or nostalgia. I also didn't really like the use of his first name so often in the film (since his first name is the same as Nolan Bushnell's and almost sounds like it's trying to frame Nolan as a video game villain whereas the real Nolan of video game pop culture was quite the opposite and someone that we can thank for helping build and shape the video game industry that gamers enjoy so much). So I suppose there's the good Nolan of the real world and the bad Nolan of the film.<br/><br/>In contrast, the use of Ogden Morrow as the Curator was a clever touch and one that worked quite nicely. It still gets the quarter into the main character's possession and -- at the end of the day -- has the same effect as in the book.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is different from the book but still entertaining. It mixes 80s references with those of the 90s and today. In the process, it still caters to geek culture (which is what it's supposed to do). It's well-presented and keeps a decent pace. There are a few depictions of characters (like the head of IOI) that seem a bit off. However, it's close enough."

"susanagascue","6","0","1","28 May 2018"," Dissapointed but not surprised (contains spoilers of the book and movie)
","(this entire review is a fight between book vs movie) <br/><br/>I was really excited to watch this movie, like REALLY excited. <br/><br/>When I saw the movie poster in theaters (like three weeks ago) it actually didn't caught my attention but when I found out it was based in a book, it was game for me. So I read the book in a week and fell in love with everything in it. <br/><br/>Since the beginning of the book I found it so fun, Wade/Parzival character's was funny and witty and you could easily feel connected with him and his way of telling the story. The whole book is filled with 80's references, pop-culture, music, good movies references that I have watched million times and even books. It was everything I have loved and more. An 80's lover dream.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I had big expectations for this film even when the trailer started to ruining it for me. <br/><br/>But the movie.... <br/><br/>It's worth the watch but it's SO different from the book. That's why I gave it 6 stars, because if you haven't read the book, you will enjoy it. <br/><br/>1- Tye Sheridan was born to play Wade. He is exactly how I imagine him in the book. But in here, the script and direction plays a big game. His character did not only lack that witty-funny-charming-nerdy persona, he also was a pretty null actor. That means, bad direction from Spielberg. <br/><br/>2- I understand the change of plot and script because in some way they have to make the audience connected to the story, like making Art3mis meet Parzival in the first half of the movie, but still, I feel like they didn't give them enough time to connect. That first ""I love you"" scene was so forced and out of nowhere when in the book they spend months talking to each other.<br/><br/>3- Thumbs up to the animation of the movie. It really felt like being inside of a game, which gives the movie that geeky touch the book has. <br/><br/>4- The movie lacks drama. Yeah, it's true, this is not a dramatic movie but it needs the drama to build a great connection audience-characters, and the book gives a whole Almanac to chose from: At3mis 'breaking up' with Wade and him going into a depression phase to then work things out with himself. Losing his family and his only friend in the real world, the old lady I don't remember her name. I-Rok being a pain in the a** and selling them to the IOI after supposedly being 'their friend'. None of that was well put in the movie. <br/><br/>5- Thumbs up for the representation of Halliday. <br/><br/>6- OG needed more recognition in the movie, he did a lot for the kiddos. <br/><br/>7- This may not be as important, but I think it could have had more technology or at least a better representation. The only tech we were introduced in the movie was inside the IOI or that suit Wade got. It's sci-fie, it's Spielberg. Give me more.<br/><br/>8- The gates to get the keys. The first one in the movie, even when in the book had a geeky-touch having to play a classic game inside of a game, was fun. It was a race and it showed that Wade was 'the chosen one' to win by figuring out the clue. But the rest of the tests? <br/><br/>The Shining, really? I don't even have words. <br/><br/>I did like the third test, it was what we needed but it was too short. <br/><br/>9- The ending. Ugh. I have to say that I love a cute love-is-all-that-matters ending (like the end of the book) But this was so cheesy. Just two teenagers making out. Really? That was the ending? <br/><br/>It does gives a certain hope for a second movie (Cline is already talking about writing a sequel to the book so I wouldn't doubt there's a sequel to the movie) but come on, that was a lame ending.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was just another movie. 6/10. I expected more. <br/><br/> I apologize if this review was mostly focused on the war book vs movie, but if you haven't read the book, DO IT. It's waaaaay more epic."

","Let's face it, Spielberg is never going to be able to top one of his classic movies (like Jaws) with one of his movies from this century (like War Horse). But that doesn't mean that just because none of his new stuff will ever measure up to his more older stuff, it isn't good. Ready Player One is an example of that. After seeing the movie, I created and stand by, my opinion that it is one of his best movies from this century. Ready Player One's story isn't super deep (in fact, quite the opposite). But it is pretty exciting (an emotion that Spielberg is good at creating, action-packed, and has some decent messages about humanity's dependence on technology, reality, and how technology can be both good and evil. The story also has a great, intertwining mystery throughout about where the Keys are hidden that keeps the audience wanting more- I think. Ready Player One also boasts great direction from Spielberg (who seems to be trying to use a new type of more modern directing which can feel a little odd at times but is still good) and some pretty good performances from both Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke (who play the protagonist characters of Wade/Parzival and Samantha/Art3mis) and Ben Mendelsohn and T.J. Miller (who play the antagonist characters of Noah Sorrento and I-R0k). We also get great performances from a very diverse cast of supporting actors and actresses. Such as: Lena Waithe (who plays Aech/Helen), Simon Pegg (who plays Ogden Morrow), Mark Rylance (who plays Anorak/James Halliday), Phillip Zhao (who plays Sho), Win Morisaki (who plays Daito), and Hannah John-Kamen (who plays F'Nale Zandor). The special effects are, obviously, top-notch. The CGI in The Oasis is so good at some times, it is disorienting, but the movie manages to blend the CGI and real world images effortlessly and so the switch isn't at all confusing. Also, Spielberg actually managed to make the CGI not at all cheesy, which is a very amazing achievement. The action sequences are sort of the standard normal action sequences that you would find in a standard Marvel movie, not really anything to be said about the action sequences. Also, the movie has a crazy amount of of pop-culture references. There is like a reference in every frame. Mostly it is pop culture references from the 70s, 80s, and 90s which were the decades that Spielberg was the most popular (although he doesn't reference any of his own films in the movie, which is kind of a bummer because his films defined those decades). But modern pop culture also gets referenced a lot as well (though there are absolutely zero references to Fortnite sadly). So, the references are a nice edition as well. On a closing note, the movie also has a lot of memorable moments that are worth seeing: Like an Iron Giant fighting against Godzilla and the movie quote, ""IT'S F***ING CHUCKY!!! And remember this, while Ready Player One is definitely not one of the best movies that Spielberg has ever made, it is one of his best movies from this century so far. Which makes it definitely worth seeing."
"Andres-Camara","7","0","1","19 May 2018"," Que gozada de película. That enjoyed movie
","Si bien salgo del cine pensando que algo le falta, si hay que decir, que me lo he pasado muy bien. La película tiene un ritmo estupendo. Está rodada, como lo mejor sabe hacer Spielberg. La música es estupenda. 
Es verdad que echo de menos más planos maravillosos que este hombre sabe hacer, pero toda la película está muy bien rodada.
Es verdad que no tiene la profundidad que debería tener los personajes, por eso se queda un poco atrás la película. 
Es verdad que hay momentos que ha metido mal alguna explicación y se nota que los actores hablan para explicar.
No me gusta nada la voz en off del principio, me sobra casi toda, no aporta nada, no hacía falta.<br/><br/>Es cierto que rompe esa tendencia en el cine de hoy en día, en la que todas las películas van en contra de la tecnología y nos dicen que hay que volver a las cavernas porque nos vamos a cargar el mundo. En esta lo que dice y hace demasiado hincapié Steven, es que hay que coger la tecnología con moderación. <br/><br/>Los actores, me ha hecho mucha gracia, cada uno es justo lo contrario que su avatar. Y por si fuera poco, con la excusa de que internet es mundial, cada personaje es de una raza, así es políticamente correcto. No me gusta nada el protagonista, no tiene la fuerza que debería. Creo que ella esta elegida para ser una chica muy normal y que las chicas se sientan reflejadas. <br/><br/>La iluminación, la verdad es que Janusz Kaminski gustando me mucho como ilumina, cada vez me gusta menos. Cada vez mete más luces por las ventanas. Si bien está muy bien la iluminación. Ayuda a meterte y es bonita.<br/><br/>Que decir de Steven, es el dios del dice. Cuando vi el tráiler, el plano del ojo ya me encanto. La pena es que no tenga más planos espectaculares. Si bien, toda la película tiene una puesta en escena y está rodada, de forma espectacular. Sabe dónde poner la cámara en cada momento. Sabe desde donde va un plano hasta donde tiene que terminar. La cámara nunca va sola, siempre sigue a alguien o algo. El plano del principio, es impresionante. Como presenta todo. La película además es entretenidísima. Tiene un ritmo estupendo y la música y los toques a un montón de películas te hacen sonreír.<br/><br/>La verdad es que es para verla más veces.<br/><br/>
Although I leave the cinema thinking that something is missing, if it is necessary to say, that I have had a great time. The movie has a great rhythm. It is shot, as Spielberg knows best. The music is great.
It is true that I miss more wonderful shots that this man knows how to do, but the whole movie is very well shot.
It's true that it does not have the depth that the characters should have, that's why the film is a little behind.
It is true that there are moments that some explanation has gone wrong and it is clear that the actors speak to explain.
I do not like the voice over at the beginning, I have almost everything left over, it does not contribute anything, it was not necessary.<br/><br/>It is true that it breaks that trend in today's cinema, in which all films go against technology and tell us that we have to go back to the caverns because we are going to carry the world. In this what Steven says and emphasizes too much, is that you have to take technology with moderation.<br/><br/>The actors, it has made me very funny, each one is just the opposite of his avatar. And if that were not enough, with the excuse that the internet is global, each character is of one race, that is politically correct. I do not like the protagonist, he does not have the strength he should. I think she is chosen to be a very normal girl and that the girls feel reflected.<br/><br/>The lighting, the truth is that Janusz Kaminski like me very much as he illuminates, every time I like less. Every time he puts more lights through the windows. While lighting is fine. Help me get in and it's pretty.<br/><br/>What to say about Steven, is the god of the saying. When I saw the trailer, the plane of the eye and I loved it. The pity is that it has no more spectacular plans. Although, the whole film has a staging and is shot, dramatically. He knows where to put the camera at every moment. He knows where a plane goes from to where it has to end. The camera never goes alone, always follows someone or something. The plane of the beginning, is impressive. How it presents everything The film is also entertaining. It has a great rhythm and the music and the touches to a lot of movies make you smile.<br/><br/>The truth is that it is to see it more times."

"coex23","2","0","1","15 May 2018"," very odd mix
","If I didn't know who the director was here, I would have guessed it was someone who was really influenced by Spielberg, but trying really hard to make sense of the current technological world we live in. However, knowing it IS Spielberg, it seems that he's trying depserately to reclaim his 80s glory here by shoving every possible pop culture reference in to this completely silly film. It seems that he's lost his touch and is out of touch with the world as it is today.<br/><br/>One wonders who the audience was intended to be with this film? 98% of the pop culture references are from the 70s/80s/90s, so I can't imagine anyone under 20 enjoying this film or even knowing what is being discussed half the time. I know that my 16 year old son could care less about 80s pop culture (outside of a few films he's seen, he surely didn't know what the hell went on in this film!). So, was Spielberg aiming at his own generation? Himself?<br/><br/>Then there is the plot.. if you cal lit that. It's another simplistic ""find some treasure and save the world along the way"" deal that you would expect from Spielberg. But, watered down a lot. One can really see potential here; say, if Cronenberg directed, or someone younger. Plenty of commentary and opportunity to try to set people on the right track. Instead, Spielberg glosses over the commentary stuff and never really digs too deep. A lot of ""Black Mirror""-like moments are played for light laughs rather than the grim horror they really are.<br/><br/>Yet, even as a ""light"" entertainment piece, it's scattered everywhere. Again, the audience won't ""get"" many of the references and only then be looking for real drama or action to grip onto. Instead, we get faux video game action that is about as exciting as watching Spielberg dressed up as a teen trying to fit in by playing XBOX: you are passive and wish to be interactive, or at least passively watching something you can care about."

That being said, it is too long as happens too many times when unlimited budget meets the dream of a master storyteller. The young star Tye Sheridan has neither the skill or experience to meet the expectations.

The many references to past films and music were fun memories, but the film wastes a talented cast in a CGI world that has little substance to offer in watching it, 5 out of 10 is just about what it is worth, if they made a sequel, it would drop off to nothing.

"timothyalanwilliams","8","0","1","11 May 2018"," Masterful Storyteller Spielberg Saves ""Ready Player One""
","Let me start with a disclaimer. I have never read the best-selling book this film was based on. I'm also not a big video game person. So ""Ready Player One"" was not necessarily on my ""must see"" movie list when it came out last month. But I do love most Steven Spielberg movies and I had heard that there were lots of 1980's pop culture references in the film (and the book) so it began to pique my interest. 
I must admit though, I didn't go in with very high expectations. 
The story is a hodgepodge of familiar tales. There's a ""Willy Wonka"" vibe, a heavy dose of ""Avatar"" feels, and even a few scenes that reminded me of ""The Goonies"" and ""The Breakfast Club"". Some of those I think are obvious while others are perhaps implied. But either way, it's pulling from some great past movies, stories, and pop culture icons, so it keeps you entertained (much like the hit show on Netflix, ""Stranger Things"")
Steven Spielberg continues to prove what a masterful storyteller he is because he took a story that could have been all spectacle but without any heart or emotion to connect us to it. But he was able to balance both parts really well, although he didn't have me fully invested until well into the second act. There are still some plot questions I don't think were answered or explained very well. But ""Ready Player One"", much like the video games of our childhood and the current ""cyber reality"" we all find ourselves in (whether we like it or not), is meant to pull us away from the ""real world"" and enjoy some ""pure imagination"" for a few hours in our day. 
I would recommend seeing it in the theater while you still can, but I expect to do very well on home video because it's really designed for multiple viewings so you can catch all of the pop culture Easter Eggs in the background. I'm looking forward to seeing it again myself."
"Turfseer","6","0","3","11 May 2018"," Master Auteur of Special Effects and Pop Culture also reveals obsession with futuristic virtual reality world too reminiscent of today's unhealthy fixation on video games
","Steven Spielberg is fast becoming a connoisseur of the pyrrhic victory. In his previous missive, The Post, the Supreme Court rules in favor of the editor-in-chief along with the owner of the Washington Post, in their quest to have the Pentagon Papers published in spite of government opposition. Unfortunately, no one is held to account for the very crimes the Papers expose. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Similarly, here in Spielberg's latest, Ready Player One, his adolescent protagonist, Wade Watts (aka ""Parzival""), triumphs over CEO Nolan Sorrento, head of Innovative Online Industries (IOI), who's been trying to gain control of the OASIS, a virtual reality world, created by the now deceased (Steve Jobs-like) James Halliday. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Even Spielberg concedes at film's end that maybe the OASIS is not such a good thing, when he has Watts (after gaining control of the OASIS), declare that the world is off limits on Tuesdays and Thursdays (teenage addiction to video games is indeed a big, big problem in our contemporary society).<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There are some other problems with Ready Player One. Chief among them are the small stakes Watts and his buddies are fighting for. IOI simply wants to place ads for profit in the OASIS as opposed to blocking content which is a chief sticking point in the overall net neutrality debate. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>It's a rather clever conceit that Watts and the vast majority of the denizens of a futuristic 2045 Columbus, Ohio, live in trailer homes stacked on top of one another (The ""STACKS); but the urban area (controlled by IOI) is not as clever-in fact rather derivative as one is reminded of the run-down Detroit in the original Robocop. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>And IOI's power in the real world is rather sketchily defined. The ""Sixers"" are debtors turned indentured servants coupled with researchers who are attempting to solve all the clues Halliday left in the OASIS to gain control of the virtual world. Sorrento and his minions will even go as far as blowing up Watts' aunt's STACKS residence (perhaps the most distasteful and out of place event in the film-designed to demonize the IOI crowd much more than they should be!). <br/><br/> <br/><br/>When IOI does commit murder, where is law enforcement in all this? Presumably IOI controls them. But why is Sorrento so easily taken down by the police at film's end? Yes Wade's pal Aech sends the police the recording of Sorrento ordering the bombing; but again wouldn't the police be in Sorrento's pockets? They apparently have been looking the other way all this time in regards to the ""Sixers,"" who are being used by the corporation for nefarious purposes. So if the police do have an ""independent streak,"" that needs to be better defined.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Spielberg of course is on more solid ground in his mastery of special effects. The plot is divided into three parts, with Watts solving each aspect of Halliday's puzzle, obtaining three special keys that lead to the acquisition of the special Easter egg and ultimately a contract that gives him control of the OASIS.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>In the first sequence, Watts' vehicle is blocked by King Kong who prevents all from encountering the wizard-looking Halliday who holds the first key. Watts finds an important clue in Halliday's archives, a virtual diary which Watts plays repeatedly until he uncovers the clue to finding the first key (the solution involves going ""backward,"" instead of ""forward).<br/><br/> <br/><br/>In the second sequence, Watts becomes more involved with love interest Samantha Cook (the avatar Art3mis in the OASIS) and discovered that Halliday's main regret was that he never kissed Kira, on a movie date to a screening of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining."" Aficionados of that film will dig the references and attendant special effects but the closer parallel is to the Spielberg's executive-produced ""Back to the Future.""<br/><br/> <br/><br/>In addition to actually working in a DeLorean during one of the action sequences, there is the whole idea of the equation of success with heterosexuality. That of course was the theme in Back to the Future where McFly Sr. ""gets the girl."" And Watts makes certain of not making Halliday's mistake, by kissing Samantha in the end. By the way, it's the holographic projection of Kira, who hands Watts the second key.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The third sequence (or Act III), gets a little convoluted especially when a series of plot twists prove rather far-fetched such as Samantha easily getting a hold of Sorrento's password into his station which allows Watts to recruit OASIS players to join in the all-out assault at the big fortress where the key to Halliday's puzzle awaits (Along with Samantha, he's aided by his online buddies, all whom just happen to live in close proximity to Watt's residence, in Columbus, Ohio). <br/><br/> <br/><br/>There is a force field that must be neutralized and finally Watts is clever enough not to sign the contract (which was Halliday's big mistake, having dissolved a partnership with his long-term friend and business partner Morrow who shows up as the curator at Halliday's archives).<br/><br/> <br/><br/>In addition to extracting solid performances from his actors (notably Tye Sheridan as Wade and Mark Rylance as Halliday), Spielberg remains the master of special effects and also of pop culture, as the film is chock full of references to music and film from the era of the auteur's younger days (80s music is particularly prominent here). It's a wild, entertaining ride (if that's your sort of thing) but also predictably inconsequential, given the trivial obsession with the virtual world-too reminiscent of today's unhealthy fixation on video games!"

"jake-young96","8","0","1","10 May 2018"," A nostalgia fuelled, thrilling love letter.
","In this geekgasm of pop culture references and a virtual reality easter egg hunt. We find Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), a young man who spends all his time learning as much as possible about James Halliday (Mark Rylance) and his seminal creation - the virtual world known as the Oasis. Just like the rest of society in the year 2045, James is in a race to find Halliday's easter eggs, for the chance at the keys to the Oasis and mass fortune.<br/><br/>It is difficult to sit through Ready Player One without a sizable grin on your face, as the likes of; King Kong, Transformers, the 60s Batmobile, Lara Croft, Ryu, Halo, Overwatch, Terminator 2, the Iron Giant and numerous other references fill the landscape of the Oasis. But crucially, Ready Player One is not just an empty cameo imposing production.<br/><br/>Technology sits at the figure point in this story but it engages the audience on a deeper, more sentimental level. This powerfully nostalgia-fuelled love letter, from Spielberg to video games and 80s/90s pop culture feels as excessive as those decades and it's an absolute joyride because of it. What is handled best is the references, whether they are subtly in the background or the focal point of an entire sequence, they never beg for the audience's tolerance. Instead, they are a welcoming presence of enjoyment and Spielberg grasps the boisterous nature of this landscape with a firm yet compassionate touch.<br/><br/>Equally, the film never takes itself too seriously. Aside from the fixated smile on your face, it is easy to get caught up in the engaging story and the genuine humour. To which there is plenty of, whether it be quirky character moments or tongue in cheek jabs at the corporate side of the gaming industry - Ready Player One is simply a ton of fun. Behind the cinematic yet innovative camera work that recognises the ability of video game storytelling; sits a rather weak, formulaic and oft-times jerking plot. Spielberg tells this story without any restyling of tired mainstream blockbuster plotting; some moments are told with such a disregard for the audience that revelations seem to just appear as the character and plot needs them. Despite the fairness in its statement, the climax gets slightly unnecessarily preachy, it plays mostly with a dull acceptance. Much of the performances do too, as emotionally the film never engages, characters backstories go in one ear and out the other. They even take a back seat in the grand scheme of the story, which predominately is about the oasis and the easter egg.<br/><br/>While if you do not know most of the references you may be a little left out of the fun. It is undeniable that Ready Player One is a thrill. Spielberg taps into the borderless creativity of animated movies, an aspect of the film that is done with clarity, as CG never falters or hinders. The plot points are largely a predictable trip, characters are somewhat forgettable and easily replaced. But when nostalgia and pop culture references are akin to gold dust, Ready Player One stands tall as the encapsulating jewel, in the crown of today's culture."

As with every book to movie adaptation, it cannot be followed to the dot, it has to be different, so I wasn't expecting a 100% adaptation.<br/><br/>The movie started great, I was blown away by the first Easter egg challenge, which got me really excited, but it was clear that the differences to the book will be greater than I thought. And I was right. Although the movie follows the book, a lot is different. The book is great, so why they changed literally all the key events? It's like going to arcade and putting a coin to play Pacman, but instead getting Dynablaster. You still have fun, but it's not the same. The movie did however a great justice to the 80s pop culture, feels like every scene has at least one Easter egg.

They definitely don't overdo it though and rely on it to sell the film, which is nice. <br/><br/>The film is pretty well paced and will keep your attention. The CGI is also pretty nice to look at for parts in the OASIS, and the film looks nice overall as well. Although the plot doesn't do anything too special from a lot of current dystopian/action films, it's an interesting take on the book.

I just didn't expect such a horrific dismemberment of the book. This will be a great movie to remake in 20 years, and do it properly."
"pinkarray","6","0","1","3 May 2018"," The Iron Giant? Where Hogarth at?
","Yes, I am ready to play this game.<br/><br/>The trailers didn't do the story justice, I thought it was going to be a contrived story but it ended up better than I thought. The story is actually clever, thrilling and has an intense third act that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It will probably make video game fans wish that there was a VR Set or a theme park attraction based on the OASIS. The only problems I have with the story is that the main character is an orphan but I don't know if he is technically an orphan since he's 18, but it's a tiresome cliche to have nowadays. It's time to take a break from it, people. The other problem is that there are random, pointless random scenes in there such as at the beginning, when Wade narrates about the OASIS, the scene suddenly transitions to a 5 second scene of a hardcore little girl screaming on a bed.<br/><br/>I thought that the whole premise of having much of the movie focus on the avatars these people are playing as was a refreshing idea. And I liked the crossovers that were in this movie, something that a lot of movies don't tend to do nowadays but I am a big fan of crossover films.<br/><br/>One thing I am mad at is that there is no Iron Giant sequel. This is about as closest to a sequel as we can get.<br/><br/>There are a few forced acting moments, sappy romance at the end, and the pop culture references can go overboard but problems aside, it was an alright film. I am a fan of video games and nostalgia so this was pretty much up my alley."
"alindsay-al","8","0","1","3 May 2018"," A great film filled with pop culture references
","This film has been on the top of my list to see and I have now had the chance to see Ready Player One and I think this is a great film with a lot of fun laced into it. The premise of the film sees a dystopia future where most people spend their time in a virtual world called the Oasis. It's up to a group of people to find an Easter egg and save this world from total destruction. Tye Sheridan is am up and coming actor gaining larger roles and he does a really good job in this film, whether it be his character in the real world or in the oasis. He displayed great innocence and it allowed the audience to connect with his character as he truly embraced who he is in this world like people do every day playing video games. All the other characters in the oasis are really fun characters and I really liked their interactions and they came across as a likeable team. Ben mehndolson plays the villain in this film and even though his character isn't that unique he delivers a fun great villainous performance. He is just so natural as a villain and you can tell he is having fun in his role in this film. Mark rylance and Simon pegg have smaller roles in this film but they do good jobs with what their characters are given. The story when it comes to the Oasis is really interesting, seeing these different worlds and universes in a virtual reality works really well mixed with the unique visuals. However, I feel like the story in the real world wasn't particularly strong, it was just very bland and by the numbers. It affects this film as especially in the third act it focuses too much on this aspect of the story. The script has some surprisingly good humour in it that allows the characters to feel more real and easily connectable. The drama has decent moments in it, though I do really feel that it can get pretty preachy, especially as the film reaches its climax which affected the fun aspects of the film. The style is absolutely brilliant, the CGI is all really good and feels appropriate for this world. The pop culture references are fantastic and really bought a smile to my face mixed with some pretty decent action scenes. Overall this is a really fun fun to watch with the extra bit of quality added by Steven Spielberg to make it a great film."
"sassonlonner","9","0","1","2 May 2018"," Ready Player One From the Perspective of a VR Geek
","If you want to see this movie because you like virtual reality see it now, you don't even need to go in with any details, you will enjoy it. The same goes if you either are a hardcore 80s kid, or just anyone who loves 80s music, movies, video games, etc. If you don't have interest in any of those areas, you may want to hear someone out before going.
 
 I for one have both always been into 80s music and film (I happen to be 18 by the way), and I call myself a VR enthusiast, so this movie really was a thrill for me. Yeah, it is no Citizen Kane, and Spielberg has done better, but I really loved this movie. From the rise of the Oculus Rift a couple years ago I was so into the idea of virtual reality. I even remember when I was a young chap, I had some totally cheapo Power Rangers ""virtual reality"" where you strapped sensors onto your arms and legs with velcro, and wore this incredibly bulky plastic visor, and you punched and kicked when flashing images of villains appeared in your sight (if you really are curious what I'm talking about, just search for Power Rangers Virtual Reality and you'll find it pretty quickly). But literally, just around the same time I thought that piece of trash was revolutionary, Oculus started up on Kickstarter in 2012, finally going to the consumer market in 2016. I both always saw a future in virtual reality, and really wanted it because it is so damn cool. Unfortunately due to its high price tag, it will be some time until everyone has one of these in their household. The hardest part actually is acquiring a computer which can handle it. For me, I modded my computer to be compatible (in fact it was actually just below Oculus required specs).<br/><br/> One of the things I get whenever I tell someone I am invested in VR is, ""Virtual reality is dying."" I happen to disagree. VR is still in the works, and I'm just wanted to get on that VR train early on. I believe the Oculus Go will actually be a good boost for VR given its semi affordable price (which will probably go down) and its portability.<br/><br/> So to finally talk about VR in the movie, which I haven't even touched upon yet, it seems really far in the future. Yes it is in the future, but not even as far as you may think. Upon my first time watching RPO (I saw it twice), I thought ""Damn, that movie was awesome, but VR like that is really far away."" Well guess what? It actually isn't (for the most part). The hardest part to achieve is getting that full field of view that is projected into your eyes via lasers. That really was the one part that seemed a bit far from us at the moment. Although VR manufacturers are indeed very focused on widening field of view, and upping resolution. The technological elements of the film that really are reasonable to see in the future, are the use of haptics, and the omnidirectional treadmill. The treadmill seems to be them furthest advanced of the technologies we see in the film, being there already are a couple startups that already have produced treadmills that almost exactly match what we see in RPO. Of course the technology isn't perfect, but it is very close to what we see in the movie. Haptics by means of vibrations we already have access to, but what we see in the movie is a bit more advanced, allowing to recreate realistic feelings of touch and resistance. This is still in the early stages, but is out there. Haptx is a VR startup which has created haptic gloves filled with hundreds of sensors and mechanical parts allowing one to feel just about anything one can imagine feeling on their hand, from a tiny fox walking on it, to individual raindrops, to picking small objects up.<br/><br/> Now that I've said quite a bit about the technology in RPO, I'll get more to the content. The movie is so jam packed with detail you'll need to view it frame by frame to catch it all. From avatars from games like Overwatch, to sectors of the Oasis called Minecraft World, the movie really gets everything in there. I also really enjoyed the music choices in the film, being 80s hits. A favorite scene from the movie (which I will not spoil) of mine literally recreates shots and locations from one of my favorite films of all time, an 80s classic (better see it if you want to know what that is).<br/><br/> The one thing I will say, is this film kind of is a love it or hate it scenario. My brothers and I loved the movie, and spent hours discussing it, and how VR can change the future, while someone else I saw it with hated it, and said, ""Oh it's literally just copying Willy Wonka."" To this anonymous person's defense, it does take a lot from Willy Wonka (humble poor kid invests himself into competition where reward is unlimited riches, and his humility allows him to beat those who try to win using money and ignorance), but that doesn't make it a bad film. This still is completely its own concept, focused around the very much new, modern idea of VR.<br/><br/> So if you are a VR geek, see it. If you are an 80s nerd, see it. If you aren't, I still definitely recommend you at least give it a shot, but by no means is it a must see."

"hellraiser7","10","0","2","1 May 2018"," VR Troopers
","The world of reality and imagination can sometimes be a razors edge line we walk on. Everyday as we go out to reality we always find ways to escape reality for mere moments from putting on a VR set or just simply daydreaming. However, in those times as we imagine or experience ourselves doing something else and being someone else, it tends to corollate with our dreams of what we want in our reality and somehow finding the way to one day make our dreams come true. Steven Spielberg another one of my favorite movie directors (no surprise) believe it or not this is my forth favorite film from but also one of my favorite movies in general. Anyway, down to business this film just like the book to me is a dream come true, it is both a love letter to Gamers and fans of pop culture but also a story from all it's visual icing has a heart.<br/><br/>The visual effects are just fantastic, I really love the look of the Oasis it is just a visual feast for the eyes, the whole place is sort of the ultimate open world video game. From the amount of color, character animation, structures, you name it, it really is a place the blurs the line as it looks both real and unreal. It's the kind of place I'd love to one day visit as you can pretty much do, go anywhere, and be anything you want; I could make my own avatar or even use the avatar image of ""Robocop"" or ""Judge Dredd"" and I could go shoot down some evil yoma with Sailor Mars and the Sailor Senchi; well you get the drift of it anything you want to do, do it.<br/><br/>I also like the dystopian futuristic world that is conceived which I feel is plausible, as we see the real world is practically a scrapyard of itself. There is defiantly an overpopulation problem which has caused a spacing issue as we see most people whom have not much money are forced to live in this trailer park called the Stacks which are literally stacks of trailers on top of each other much like with the mega blocks in ""Judge Dredd"" only no one is living in a super-sized condo. But what makes the world even more dreary is how a corporation can literally become a tyrannical force, the corporation in this film is much like ""OCP"" in ""Robocop"" as it literally has a stranglehold over most of the worlds resources and functions, including the technology we possess and livelihood. However, the most disturbing aspect to me of this corporation is how they have this VR cube structures where they imprison people that owe the company some dealt and make them work it out, which they never will because the company keeps increasing it just, so we make less to no money and they make more; it's literally Slavery. It just shows how evil this corporation is as it's flushed all it's sense of morality and humanity down the toilet, just to continue making fast profits while feeding on people's misery.<br/><br/>There are tons of references, this film is just jammed full of them it would take more than one watch just to get them all. For anyone that is expensed in pop culture you will easily spot and get them which is endearing. Though the film is also kind of educational for rookies to pop culture that never heard about films like ""Back to the Future"" or video games like ""Adventure"", seeing those things in this film will cause them to research or simply try them out. <br/><br/>The action and adventure are great, it goes at a good pace. From that race which is cool, where you get to drive any car of your choice or creation. With Percival it was the DeLorean from ""Back to the Future"", me if I was ever in that game it would be the Batmobile from the 1989 film. The final battle sequence is awesome, it's probably my honorable mention of favorite battles of all time. It's literally like a live action ""Where's Waldo"" art illustration as there are so many colorful avatars, some you would easily recognize, even certain weapons like one which got the big cheer, I won't say what it is but if you know your fantasy films from the 80's you know what weapon is referred to.<br/><br/>The scavenger hunt which is thought provoking, each of the challenges are a riddle. The riddles are tricky as they contain hidden meanings in the words and red herrings to throw players off. But like most riddles the solution is simple it just doesn't seem that way at first, and you can solve them yourself if you know your nostalgia history and relics but also listened to most of Halliday's history carefully.<br/><br/>The characters are solid, from the villains Sorrento (Ben Mendelsoln) he's a good villain, he's pretty much a unlikable corporate scumbag that doesn't give a toss about anyone except his own money and power which he has more than enough of. But like all greedy bastards more just isn't enough, this guy wants absolute power and he'll do anything to get it and maintain his stranglehold over the world. <br/><br/>One thing about him is how he tries real hard at passing himself off as cool but isn't. Despite all the luxury he has like that big chair, in a big office space he really is nothing but the suit he puts on everyday. One scene that was interesting was when he was trying to get Perceval/Wade to work for him, as he's doing this he is trying to make references but it's not his own words it's the words of one of his sell out nerds that work for him. It just shows this guy is a real poser he's probably never even seen a John Hughes movie or played the video game ""Robotron"". Let alone intellectually bankrupt as he must have a whole division of nerds and geeks solve the riddles and play the game for him, which isn't fair.<br/><br/>The subordinate villainess F'Nale Zandor is also good. The actress Hannah John-Karmen is hot, she is pretty much is the living embodiment of corporate b.... She is kind of his muscle/go two person as she wants to win at all costs even if it means breaking the law.<br/><br/>And of course, we have the good guys the VR Troopers. The supporting heroes Acha/Helen, Sho, Daito are decent, we get a bit of a good feel for them they have unique personas, a good back and forth but they really help.<br/><br/>But the two characters that really stand out are Perceval/Wade and Artimis/Samantha. Both are cool characters they have good personas from Perceval/Wade whom I can relate to because he's a bit like myself as he's a causal geek that loves gaming and pop culture from the past to present. He's sort of on the shy side as he not one of the popular people not even in the VR world and is attracted to girls that seem unattainable, but despite that fact he does try anyway if not successful at first.<br/><br/>Olivia Cookie as Artimis/Samantha I think is lovely inside and out, as she really has some fire and feistiness. But I really like her sense of maturity and selflessness as she is determined to win the game for a noble cause. But also helps slowly but surely open Wade's eyes to not just reality but herself.
 I really like the chemistry between both as there are sparks flying that is starting to build a small fire. The back and forth between them is fun and touching. I really liked that dance sequence in that hover dance club which was fun, but it was really when both meet up and interact in the real world is where this chemistry really crackles. The Achilles heel both had were that they we both insecure about their looks and what the other would think of once they saw each other in real life. But once both do they aren't disappointed by what they see, sure they may not look oh so perfect the avatars they run but when they see each other it's at least real. Wade sees one physical feature that sort of makes Samantha an outcast and it's the birthmark on her face, but it doesn't bother Wade in fact he doesn't even care about it because he had feelings for her for who she is on the inside, it didn't matter what she looked like to him, she really looks lovely all the same; likewise, for Samantha as she sees Wade looks like any ordinary teen. But also, both along with their supporting characters are all underdogs, all of them have had pretty much been crapped on by the corporation and life. The corporation has had more then they need while all of them bare have much to anything, which more makes me want this team to win because they deserve it and their motives are genuine they want to not just make their own lives better but the existence they inhabit.<br/><br/>The film does have some good messages, from the importance of fandom and pop culture but also not to let video games and technology be your whole life, their ok occasionally, but you also got to know when to unplug and tune into reality. But also, that we really do have the power to make our existence better we just have to believe in ourselves enough to do it and things will get better.<br/><br/>If you're a gamer or even a rookie in it, fan of nostalgia, a person from the 80 or any decade, or even just a fan of sci-fi, like any good game it's worth a try.<br/><br/>Ready Player One scores.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

This is an action adventure movie where the main character has to enter a game as an avatar and complete each level in order to win the game and save the world. Battling other players and an evil corporation along the way. It does offer some interesting observations about the way the world is heading (people living in 'stacks' of containers due to land shortages and overcrowding.) And virtual reality being used as a distraction for the masses to forget the misery of their own reality. So there are some potentially deep themes there. Not as depressingly dark as the themes in the Netflix series Black Mirror. Some similar themes, but delivered more gently than Black Mirror and still worth thinking about."

","Don't go believing all of the over dramatic book fans who are pissed that ""it's not accurate"" or ""that never happened!!"" Movie adaptations need to make changes to make it more appealing and cut time. These are the same people who don't like the Harry Potter movies strictly because they didn't use the book as a script!! Trust me when I say, that this movie is fun to watch, but it does have its flaws.<br/><br/>For one thing, the acting is a bit stale. Ben Mendelsohn is just great at playing the villain I guess and Tye Sheridan is sooooooooo boring as our lead character! Outside of that, the rest of the cast is mostly B movie actors that wanted to be brought into the limelight of a breakthrough film. This is the movie's biggest problem.<br/><br/>The effects are decent, albeit a little cheesy. I don't hate them, but they do seem a bit uncanny. The Oasis is where you spend most of the film, and I get the Video Game-esqu feeling they were going for, but the avatars of our main characters seem to be the most creepy. Seeing as other avatars are based off of real video game characters, (you will see a whole squad of Halo players, Tracer, some WoW characters that all look ok) our main characters have avatars that look weirdly dispropotionate in the face and body structure.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough and fits a Video Game feel. Our main character Wade Watts aka Parzival (his Oasis avatar) starts to look for three keys hidden in The Oasis by its creator to achieve riches and control over The Oasis. Kinda like a big, virtual Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. But of course, the evil corporate big wigs want control of The Oasis to stuff it with ads and turn into 2018 YouTube!!! Seems cookie cutter, but I was ok with it.<br/><br/>The nostalgia references were really cool, and despite being so numerous and somewhat out of place in some scenes, did kinda help me enjoy the movie. Only thing that pissed me off was the Iron Giant didn't go Battle Mode and shoot his giant chest cannon death ray!! That was a let down!!<br/><br/>All-in-all, fun to watch, but watch with caution, as it may not be as amazing as you think. But if go in with average expectations, you will be entertained, I guarantee it!!"

The storyline was simple to follow and was very action packed from start to finish, flicking between the 'real' world and the 'virtual' world, reminded me a little of Avatar as it takes you to a completely different place whilst your watching it. All in all a brilliant film, may get forgotten about due to coming out at a similar time to 'infinity war', but don't let the disappointed book critics put you off, as a film is a 10/10."

","Ready Player One: Spielberg being his usual whimsical self with the book which even the author didn't believe could be made into a movie. The book is described as 'The Matrix meets Willy Wonka' and that describes the movie rather well as well. The year is 2045 and everyone is obsessed with a virtual world known as the Oasis, where you can be anything and anyone. The inventor of this world has passed away and set up a series of challenges and clues in the Oasis and whoever wins all the challenges gets his company. Throw in an infinite amount of cameos and references from everything pop culture related and you have the movie. <br/><br/>Walking into Ready Player One you tell yourself you won't let the nostalgia get you, but... Yeah it's impossible. Just seeing The Iron Giant in the trailer was enough to get my nostalgia feelings going. And one of the challenges in the competition for the Oasis is an extended Shining reference were we go into The Overlook Hotel and all its slightly creepy grandeur, from that point I didn't care I got my tickets worth out of the movie. <br/><br/>Though, nostalgia aside, Ready Player One has some issues outside the three big challenges (all shown in the trailer: the race, the Shining, and the humongous fight), the film is rather dull with a lot of emphasis on explaining. Which is sad because it opened so promising; showing rather than telling. Depicting people in the real world acting out their fantasy with the Oasis headset on. But afterwards Ready Player One felt the need to explain everything and anything.<br/><br/>The movie is everything Spielberg excels at while adding a nostalgia filled thrill ride; and unlike the Lego Batman Movie which went from a fantastic batman story into references vomit on the screen, Ready Player One sprinkled this throughout the whole movie so it wasn't completely surprising seeing a Gundam show up, it just made added tingly awesomeness to it. I give Ready Player One a B-"

","It's worth seeing. Based on the novel by Ernest Cline, is a true tribute to the pop culture of the '80s in relation not only to video games, but to characters and objects that trace us back eg. to ""Back to the future"" among others. A great soundtrack of classics that go from Van Halen, Bruce Springsteen, Joan Jett, Bee Gees, George Michael, Depeche Mode, New Order, Blondie, etc . Respect to the content is a dystopia located in 2045 in Ohio, do not think that is pure nostalgia, because it is a great critical metaphor about how the Internet can affect real life until it loses the clear limits between illusion and reality, extracting from it many messages, in relation to human bonds, identity, power games and corporate slavery over citizens, and the socioeconomic polarization of rich and poor. Undoubtedly, Spielberg and his advisers had a lot of extra work to achieve copyright permits, but they achieved a very good film by merging entertainment and content to be analyzed. It motivates me to go for Cline's novel."

","Ready Player one is the story of Wade Watts and his adventure in a Virtual Reality world called the Oasis. When the creator of the Oasis dies he leaves behind an Easter egg in the Oasis which, when found, will give complete control of the Oasis over to the lucky finder of the egg. This is a film dripping with nostalgia centered around the 1980's pop culture which did entertain me but left me wanting more. LETS GO!!!<br/><br/>The good things... The CGI is very well done (like all Spielberg movies) and the actual basic story was okay and had some interesting morals behind it. The importance of reality being the ultimate and most enjoyable game was one I could get behind and in these times an important one to remember. <br/><br/>For the most part I enjoyed the use of music especially given that it was mostly 80s rock and roll which is really in keeping with the style of the film. The use of science fiction inspired scores is very tasteful and keeps things playful and suspenseful where needed. <br/><br/>For the most part the actors are great at portraying their characters in the Oasis and the voice work is very well done. The cinematography was on point when it cuts to the real world, you do get the sense of a bleak future where everyone is happier in their VR world because outside of it the earth is a poor, overpopulated slum. The film captures that really well and I think should be praised for its use of practical as it could so easily have used CGI for both the VR world and the real world. <br/><br/>Now......The not so good things. The plot is very thin and mainly just a rip off of the goonies or any other treasure finding film. Honestly nothing really original is bought to the table. The characters have very little development and certain things that happen to Wade in the real world are not explained very well. The family turmoil he faces at home is very quickly glossed over and even when tragedy strikes at home Wade bounces back in the very next scene without so much as a tear or glum expression. <br/><br/>All of the other characters play mainly to type and have nothing going on in their backstories besides them helping or hindering Wade in finding the Easter Egg. I did say the actors did a good job at playing the characters but my problem is that when their characters are one dimensional and have so little development it's really hard for me to empathize and fell attached to them. <br/><br/>Like I said without the references this movie is basically a straight forward film with nothing of merit and no significant character development. Hollywood at the moment is relying too much on pop culture references, memes and nostalgia in its latest films. Ready Player One is a prime example of this! I'm sorry but I just can't give a film a glowing review if its main draw is ""oh look it's a Jurassic Park reference"" or ""oh it's that thing I love from ages ago"". <br/><br/>In the cinema I was genuinely asking myself why I shouldn't be watching Back to the Future instead of this film. Honestly I think you would have a better time watching any of the films Ready Player One references.

"disup","5","0","1","23 April 2018"," Spielberg is Lost on Nostalgia.
","It seems most people loved the movie mostly due to the references and nostalgic feel to it, while some others criticized for its ""misogyny"". Now to be fair, it's not boring nor time-consuming, the pacing is decent, is visually interesting (although some people felt dizzy for camera work) some references are kind of clever and the score is moving and 80s.<br/><br/>The concept itself might sound interesting to some, but is filled with overused elements, archetypes and lots of exposition scenes. Particularly on the first fifteen minutes with all the narration. I get that we need to establish the setting but i think there could be a much more visually interesting way to explain for all of this, especially considering this is Spielberg we are talking about. This movie sets us in a place where the world is so awful people have no other option than to live on a virtual reality. The fact that this movie implies that people only play their video game and not other activities like work, play outside, go shopping, we are supposed to get that everything can be done on this game (i guess even getting a medical degree can be got by this method). The way the easter eggs and mysteries are solved get pretty repetitive and sometimes the characters get to discovers things out of nowhere.<br/><br/>But the biggest issue in the film more than the flawed world-building, are the characters, none of them are particularly interesting or compelling. Our main hero is your virgin, shy gamer (even though everyone is like that in this movie ¿?), but of course he is athletic, perfect lips, perfect hair, perfect chin, that makes the whole thing shallow. Similarly the love interest has some sort of problems due to an issue on her body (even though it's no big deal) and of course she´s a Strong and Independent Womyn®. And the rest of the characters, not even worth mentioning. I guess the movie is trying a traditional black & white conflict but i works to movie's disadvantage. The people in this movie act like complete idiots or intellectuals when it's convenient for the plot. As for performances i could only saved Mark Rylance and Ben Mendelsohn ( even if his plays one the stupidest villains) playing of course an evil corporate asshole, you know an executive who doesn't get the importance and art of... pop culture.<br/><br/>And that's another thing, pop culture has been severely criticized not because it's not real art, some have argued that, but more because it turns music, films, video games and comics into vulgar products. It's less an homage of modern arts but more a Funko Pop vomit gallery. And all of this comes from a person who criticizes Disney for not understanding animation.<br/><br/>Ready Player One tries to be escapism and at the same time criticizes it. Well you can't have it both ways (or you can?). Either the movie thinks is way smarter than it actually is or Spielberg just wanted a sub par moral so the average moviegoers can think this movie has a heart. Either way, it's cheap, shallow, cringey and ineffective. It's a silly movie to distract yourself for two hours. I mean, i get it when people say they had fun, it's meant to entertain, you are over analyzing it, etc.<br/><br/>Okay fine, but Spielberg could stop giving his movies supposed dark themes which are never explored and just trick the audience, he is better than. Although due to his recent comments on Indiana Jones I guess I'm going to start questioning his artistic visions for the future."
"yeolit","6","0","1","23 April 2018"," Looks like a rip-off in more than one way, can't believe it's a Spielberg film
","Yes, ""is this really a Spielberg film?"" was the first question I asked my friend after the movie just ended.<br/><br/>It's just that bad, having watched other Spielberg films like the MIB series, Jurassic World and especially Bridge of Spies. In fact, the best part about this show was the angles shown in the first minute of the show when the main character was going down from his apartment.<br/><br/>The storyline is simply too simplistic to make the movie great. There are basically 3 premises to this movie:<br/><br/>1) Cameos and references to other games, which is similar to movies like Pixels and Wreck-it-Ralph (and hey there is even a racing component in here). I guess this is one of the main pulls towards gamers, since the cameos range from retro (Atari 2600 games) to modern (Overwatch).<br/><br/>2) Saving the world through video games. Well this is quite often used to a much better degree of success. Take Star Wars Episode VI: The Force Awakens for example, there were some parts where the cast use virtual reality to ""save the world from the evil clutches of the Empire"". 
But a more apt example clearly could be seen from Sword Art Online instead, there are simply too many similarities. First: the main character don't join clans (guilds), though for Ready Player One it wasn't explained why, at all. Secondly, the guy meets a girl he's in love with. Thirdly, this is VR, though Sword Art Online's version is more immersive and sensible, unlike the one Ready Player One, as they could somehow still be fully aware of their surroundings. Well the list goes on, but towards the end, just think of the ""Seed"" and Kobayashi's final encounter with Kirito in ALO. If this isn't a rip-off I don't know what it is.<br/><br/>3) The villain is over-simplistic and the main character is over-complicated. Wait... this sounds like every action movie, actually scratch that. That sounds like every Marvel movie right? Wrong. Cause in this case, there are too many hints of what is going to happen before a huge revelation or climax. Thus it totally shatters any suspense or expectations in the following scenes.<br/><br/>Take just one scene for example, the villain uses drones to blow up a building but with so many drones capable of surveillance, the villain failed to realise that the main character is not in the building. But ends up motivating him to shut them down instead by killing people he lives with but don't really care. <br/><br/>To be honest, this movie is the opposite of deep. So much plotlines are so shallow, the development of each main concept seems deep at first but less than 20 minutes the direction changed. And moreover, it is so predictable that it goes in the pattern of MC succeeds-> Villain succeeds-> MC succeeds ->infinite loop. <br/><br/>The reason why I can't simply accept this film being under Steven Spielberg's hands is that simple. Yes, this movie is adapted from a book, but the way the race had no background music or the way a lot of scenes were shown and presented simply made the movie so predictable and boring it was unbearable."

","""Ready Player One"" is one of the most surprising films of this year. With astonishing visual effects. I mean this is the most beautiful and detailted world ever put to film. With Steven Spielberg as the director, who is the perfect choise. Not only is he one of the best directors in Hollywood, but also very much into details. ""The Oasis"" as it is called is one of the most realistic places ever put to film. But one of the best things is the refrences to other pop culture stuff. From the 80's to famous video game characters. The music is composed by Alan Silvestri (known for the lBack to the Future"" films and ""Forrest Gump""). It is very fitting for the film. A bit like John Williams. The villian is also very well made. The acting in the film is very decent. So all in all ""Ready Player One"" is a very well made motion picture!"

","Now first off before I went to see this movie and even writing this review I didn´t know that there was a book, so don´t expect me to compare it.
I thought the idea was a little cheesy at first but I forgot about it really fast it was really fun to watch with the characters, the visually stunning... Well EVERYTHING.
Of course it doesn´t change that they kinda forced on the romance between Wade and Samantha and that the so evil Co. is trying to get their hands on the OASIS, But at least the romance was a minor complaint in my opinion. I really enjoyed it especially because of the music, since I really like more Old school Music like in the 80´s. So I would recommend watching it, especially in 3D its really beatiful."

"immortalgambler","5","0","1","22 April 2018"," An uninteresting and unexplored dystopia
","If you are familiar with Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" or Huxley's ""Brave New World"" then you probably know what a dystopia is. You do not have to be familiar with the lives of the authors to understand that these individuals lived in a world where the present perceptions in the political spectrum led to the slaughter of millions and their works were more of a gaze into a possible future rather than a bad dream that will never happen. And this gaze is passed on to Winston Smith and Bernard Marx who view the nightmare future with their own interesting perspectives. But Wade ""Parzival"" Watts fails to do so in an interesting manner. My own personal golden rule is ""If you want to be the main character in a dystopia, then that's it's not a dystopia.""
The main character in a dystopia is not an excellent driver who avoids every obstacle in his path but rather an unsuspecting individual who is just seconds away from crashing his vehicle at full speed in a tree. Tragic, but prevention is an option for the reader and not for the doomed hero. 
Parzival does not explore the complex layers that combine and decay a dystopian society(politics, family, war, relationships, economics, faith, individuality, vocabulary) but just behaves in a teenager way, wanting to play a video game the whole day, while fighting the evil adult corporation who does not understand his ""culture"" and might ruin his online experience. Thus, we are presented to the ""Oasis"" a virtual reality game that is seemingly played by almost every person on the planet(who occasionally pause it to eat and sleep). While their real world is filled with unattended slums and filled with poor conditions, most of them ignore these problems by escaping in a VR experience where they achieve success(wealth, physical beauty, friendship etc.) 
Oddly enough, James Halliday, the designer of the ""Oasis"" is seen as a savior, worshipped by the new generation for allowing them to ignore rather than facing their problems.
The plot is ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" but instead of a factory of sweets, the prize is the ownership of the ""Oasis"" itself. It forms the base for an exterior conflict between the evil corporation ""IOI"" and Parzival, each racing to obtain the three keys and win the challenge. The tension is low because if the characters die in-game, they can just create another one. Interior conflict, an element essential to character development is non-existent. The story itself is black and white, moving fast paced through a nerd's ultimate dream: be the chosen one, find and save the hot chick and become the savior of the world. At least this could have been an interesting monomyth adventure movie but every solution to the conflict was a choice between Deus Ex Machinas(random hadouken) or an entire arsenal of Checkhov's guns(extra life coin). The Main Character had either a special crafted item ready or just pop one up. The romantic part is poorly written. Emotionally drained characters that end up together is an usual bad representation in fiction. For example, if you are chased by dragons while suffering from a disease and hiding while starving in a dark cavern and your loved ones just died(and yes, you have a couple of days to save the world), you will not declare your eternal love to the person aside you. But the death of the main character's loved ones and the danger of the corporation can be easily shrugged off for the hot chick that stands next to you. 
Throughout the movie, the scenery is bombarded with hundreds of references to the 90s music, video games and movies, as if infusing it with foreign Easter eggs will somehow add quality to this piece of fiction. 
I found some of the jokes to be cringy, but there were a couple of fun ones. And the action can get pretty entertaining, accompanied with some nice animation. 
The rest of the characters are as shallow as the MC and are there to just assists the chosen one in fulfilling his quest. As a key advice when you're adding more characters to a piece of fiction, make sure that each and every one of them have their own reasons for doing what they're doing. 
The lack of tension, no exploration of ideas, undeveloped characters who are basically kids that outsmart a multibillionaire company make me believe that ""Ready Player One"" is far from actually being ready. And why build fiction through interesting characters when we can just slowly crawl toward a mirage."

The storyline aimed at young teenagers. Art3mis' character was smokin' and the chemistry with Parzival was hot in the alt world - even though it played as sanitized puppy love lacking any grit whatsoever other than a tad of snarkyness. Wade and Samantha's relationship in the real world bored me and both actors' talent remained untapped.<br/><br/>I really think this one got away from Spielberg, either that or it was some version of passing the torch to a younger generation.

"jakobwerling","8","0","1","21 April 2018"," ""Ready Player One is One of Spielberg's Best Movie's of the Decade! A Great Tribute to the 80s!
","Steven Spielberg has directed and produced so many movies that now it is getting hard to name all of them. He is also probably one of the best directors of all times! And his latest movie, Ready Player One, well not as good as his earlier movies (obviously), is still a very good movie from an amazing director. Please also note that this movie is not amazing or great, but it is good. Definitely one of his best movies of the decade. The story is simple but exciting: Reality bleak so people turn to virtual reality video game to get away from it, scavenger hunt, evil corporation wants to take control of the virtual reality video game, blah blah blah. The story is well, simple; like Spielberg's other movies. The special effects are downright amazing. Almost everything in The O.A.S.I.S. is CGI, though it is not exactly cheesy, The O.A.S.I.S.'s futuristic look just adds to the movie's sense of wonder. You will probably find yourself caring just as much for the main character's digital avatars as you will for their real-world images. The action sequences are also pretty good, like the final battle between the regular O.A.S.I.S. users and IOI Industries. They are also packed with pop-culture references and memorable quotes (such as ""It's f***ing Chucky!""). But they are also CGI overloaded, over-the-top, and usually hard to follow. The acting is okay I would say. The film uses a lot of young stars and I think Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke did good jobs acting in the roles of Wade/Parzival and Samantha/Art3mis. But the thing is, I can't really critique the acting in Ready Player One because it is not good or bad; it is just there. The movie makes use of it's sense of wonder to lure people in, not it's acting (though Mark Rylance does a good job acting in the flashback scenes). Another good thing about Ready Player One is all it's pop culture references. The film references pretty much every popular entertainment icon from the 70, 80s, and 90s though it still makes room for pop culture references from 00s and 10's so young adults will still be able to get some of the references (though their are sadly no Fortnite references). But the bad thing is, almost none of Spielberg's movies are referenced, which is sort of annoying because he pretty much defined those decades with his movies. I know he was trying to not make the movie about himself, but it is still pretty annoying. The movie itself also conveys a sense of wonder and nostalgia and fun that only Spielberg could bring to a movie, so it even feels like it really is an 80s movie. It also has some pretty good messages about reality and the real world that makes it as affecting as it is fun. Ready Player One is definitely not Steven Spielberg's best movie, though it is probably one of his best movies of the current decade. A great ode to the 80s without a doubt!"

","Ready Player One is one of the most experimental films when it comes to crossing film, video games, anime, and music genres. This is a great popcorn movie.

I will have to say there is one fighting sequence that might scare younger kids hint is Kubrick and it is the best scene of the film. The standout casting in this film was Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Lena Waithe, Simon Pegg, and Mark Rylance.<br/><br/> I do believe that Steven Spielberg did the best that he could, it could have been better if Robert Zemeckis, Joss Whedon or Richard Donner would have been better to direct it.

"sirwillisiv","8","0","1","19 April 2018"," An action-packed, funny, and visually striking ode to geekdom...
","Based on the Ernest Cline novel, Ready Player One is set in the year 2045. People use a vast, limitless virtual world called ""The Oasis"" to escape their slum-ridden reality. After the Oasis' creator James Halliday dies, he issues a three-step easter egg hunt to all Oasis users that will grant the winner his fortune and control over the Oasis. When 18-year-old Wade Watts is the first user to uncover Halliday's first clue, the corrupt video game conglomerate Innovative Online Industries (IOI), led by Nolan Sorrento, resorts to hostile means in order to acquire control over The Oasis. Wade joins a rebellion led by famous Oasis user Art3mis to find Halliday's easter egg before IOI does. The film is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Spielberg and stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance.<br/><br/>This film adaptation deviates from the novel quite a lot, but in some ways for the better. The story in the novel is very complex and often drifts into slow, overstuffed territory here and there, but the film takes a much more briskly-paced, focused and easy-to-understand approach, ignoring filler and driving the story forward with each simple occurrence. This is mostly due to the more practical challenges the characters endure in order to solve Halliday's easter egg clues. In the book, the challenges are very unorthodox and require loads of exposition because chances are the reader won't know a thing about the specific game or movie from the 1980s that's heavily involved in the challenge. In the movie, one of the challenges is a race. Everyone knows what a race is. Done. Explanation redundant. Carry on with the story. It's that straight-forward and a massive improvement over the novel.<br/><br/>The film is a constant surge of nostalgic fun. It features a plethora of cameos from movies, video games and even music, with some breathtaking CGI to back them all up. Examples include Back to the Future, The Shining, Overwatch, The Iron Giant, King Kong, and even Battletoads. Think of it as the Who Framed Roger Rabbit of 70s, 80s, and 90s pop culture. Like in the novel, a clear appreciation for geek culture is displayed, and it really had me grinning and chuckling for a majority of the runtime. Thankfully, the film doesn't go overboard with these cameos to the point where it distracts from the story. In fact, they help deliver quite a thrilling final battle, the visual highlight overall.<br/><br/>The performances were adequate, mostly hoaky coming from the younger cast members, but I must single out Mark Rylance as James Halliday. Halliday is the film's emotional highlight. Rylance's performance appears to be a homage to the late Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. In fact, before Wilder's death I believe Spielberg attempted to have Wilder come out of retirement for a final film role. Could've been this one? Anyways, Halliday is just an eccentric, old man in search for a worthy successor. He has an affective personal history that strongly supports the story, and his final monologue is quite absorbing, especially coming from a doddery old soul lost in his own world. Alan Silvestri's score is a whimsical nod to Back to the Future, which he also composed. The music also includes some thematic touches similar to the work of John Williams', Spielberg's frequent collaborator who was originally set to score Ready Player One.<br/><br/>On the unfortunate side, the character chemistries are pretty weak, which is too bad because the film at first takes a more interesting route with Wade and Art3mis' connection. Rather than meeting in person at the very end of the story, Wade and Art3mis meet personally very early on in the film and even spend a lot of screentime outside of the Oasis. Their in-person interactions should've established a more genuine chemistry and romance because they're seeing their non-avatar bodies for the first time and they lived up to their expectations, but in the end it's just another formulaic, hasty Disney channel-esque love story. They barely have anything in common, yet they become a couple just to please a demographic. Boring!<br/><br/>Some characters pivotal to the story are kind of downplayed, namely Ogden Morrow, Halliday's friend, former colleague and the co-founder of the Oasis. Morrow was very important in the book and personally assisted the main characters when danger escalated. In a kind of a predictable twist, Morrow does still help the protagonists uncover Halliday's egg before IOI, but it's one of the few creative liberties against the novel that I think didn't work right and didn't serve much justice for Simon Pegg's minimal involvement. The film needed more upfront interaction with Morrow. Some sequences in the novel featuring Morrow were very dark and exciting; they would've made for some dazzling set-pieces. Some scenes that left massive impacts in the novel felt rushed, such as Wade meeting his friend Aech in reality, which ignores a rather humorous revelation, and especially the ending, which seemed very abrupt in the wake of a riveting, near hour-long climax. <br/><br/>Despite my gripes, I think Ready Player One is a fun ride. It's an action-packed, funny, and visually striking ode to geekdom everywhere and every era. The cameos ranged from familiar to extremely unconventional, and they deliver quite a wild climax. However, it's difficult to NOT compare/contrast with Ernest Cline's novel. Some liberties felt justified, but the character chemistries were pretty weak, and some moments felt rushed and complicated the story a bit. Also some characters that were pivotal in the book were sadly downplayed. But as a movie, it's mighty fine popcorn entertainment. Spielberg really knows how to tackle every genre."

","Wow, what a ride, Ready Player One was everything I wanted and more this movie has lots of references to our favourite movies and video games of the past and does not insult the source material. The one problem I had with the film was the villain, he was a bit generic and never really cared for his character any scene that's just him and anyone else that works for the company were very boring compared to the rest of the film. I'm happy to see another great film from Steven."

Just like Spielbergs movie ""Tintin"" he shows us how perfect and real an animated movie can be. It felt original, it had some funny bits and it was exiting. Spielberg did not disapoint. I deffinently recomend it. The reason i rate 9 instead of 10, is because Spielberg (and other directors of course) have made even better movies. My fears of Spielberg letting me down are all gone and i can now sleep again, nowing it'll probably never happen. <br/><br/>Now please stop reading this review, and go watch Ready Player One."

","This has been the second book to film adaptation I've seen in he past 12 months in which I've read the book and like the first one, this also held up very well.<br/><br/>Changing enough things to adapt it well for the big screen, if falling a bit short in some areas that didn't get the emphasis they deserved. Such as how dystopian the work really is now & how important that means the OASIS really is to most people. Or how much Art3mis really meant to Z, that seemed a bit rushed in the film.<br/><br/>The action sequences were good & the characters were done well. My only real problem with the film, which would have mad me give it a 9, was the sound effects. The Delorean time machine didn't have the classic BTTF engine sound, the Aliens pulse rifle didn't have its signature burst noise, Mechagodzilla didn't shriek as it was meant to. And I feel that just having the Gundam make the classic power up sound as the eyes flashed would have been a great touch.<br/><br/>Other than that a pretty solid film. There were some questions about how movements would actually be made in the OASIS vs real life, but it's all just little things which could have a few answers so no point in griping about that."

"bankofmarquis","7","0","1","17 April 2018"," Entertaining film - the book was better
","I loved the book.<br/><br/>When that phrase is uttered, it doesn't necessarily mean that the film has a strike going against it. For every film that ""the book was better"" (MISS PEREGRINE and THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, for instance), I can also point to films where they ""did justice to the book"" (like THE MARTIAN and the recent version of IT).<br/><br/>So...it was with some trepidation - and some excitement - that I checked into the virtual world of the Oasis and caught READY PLAYER ONE. Most of my excitement was because I was going see this Steven Spielberg opus on the big screen in 70mm. I was ready for an immersive, stunningly visual film experience.<br/><br/>And...I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Set in a not-too-distant-future, dystopian world (is there any other?), READY PLAYER ONE is part WILLIE WONKA and part THE MATRIX. A brilliant game designer has died and has littered his virtual world - a world where most of the people on planet Earth go to escape the poverty and depravity of the ""real world"" - with clues and an ""Easter Egg"" (literally). The first one to find the hidden Easter Egg gains ownership of the Oasis. 5 years later, no one has found anything and it has turned into a battle between the evil Corporate conglomerate IOI that wants to commercialize the Oasis and the ""gunters"" (Grail hunters) that want to keep the Oasis ""pure"".<br/><br/>So, into this world, Spielberg brings us - and succeeds for the most part. The most stunning part of this film - and the reason I wanted to see this on the big screen and in 70mm - is that 80% of it takes place in the Oasis, the virtual reality world. The scenery, imagery and detail of this world are a marvel to behold. Since it is a virtual world, you can throw away the laws of physics - and that is a fun aspect of things (especially when you forget that your are in a virtual, and not a real, world). <br/><br/>The real fun of this story (both in the book and in the movie) is that most of the Oasis is filled with homages to 1980's Pop Culture (with some 60's, 70's and 90's thrown in), so you are treated to many fun ""cameo"" images on the screen (like the DeLorean from BACK TO THE FUTURE) - even if they are in the background. I won't give much away, but in one scene I spotted the ""open the pod bay doors, HAL"" pod from 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY, just hanging out in the background without anyone referring to it. If you are any kind of pop culture ""nerd"" you will be in hog heaven with this aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>And that's a good thing because we spend, as I said, 80% of our time in this film in this virtual world - and it is well worth the trip. The other 20% is spent in the ""real world"" and the visuals, the imagery and, sadly, the characters are just not as exciting or interesting.<br/><br/>Take, for example, our 5 heroes - the ""High Five"" gunters. In the Oasis, their avatars are interesting to look at and to spend time with. Outside of the Oasis, the 5 actors who inhabit these characters are - to be honest - somewhat boring and lacking in screen presence and charisma.<br/><br/>I blame most of the lack of charisma on Spielberg, who - obviously - spent most of his attention (rightfully so) on the special effects and creating the world of the Oasis. He left the actors to ""do their thing"" and these 5 kids (or maybe I should say ""young adults"") just don't have the chops to pull it off. Someone who does - Ben Mendehlson as the Corporation's head and the main villain of this piece - eats scenery like it is snack chips. The only thing he didn't do in this film is twirl his mustache and tie the female lead to the train tracks. Add to that performance the usually obnoxious TJ Miller, as the main henchman who is up to his usual, obnoxious self here. I could have used a lot less of both of these characters.<br/><br/>What I could have used a lot more of is the brilliant Mark Rylance - superbly underplaying his role as the game's chief designer, who pops up in virtual flashbacks and commands the screen whenever he is on. His partner is played by the usually reliable Simon Pegg, who was ""fine"", but - if I'm being honest - I think is miscast in this film.<br/><br/>Is it a good film? I'd have to say yes - I enjoyed myself very much - and you will too. I did, though, walk out thinking about what a missed opportunity it was. The film could have been better.<br/><br/>The book, certainly, was better.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"pasanjayasinghe","9","0","1","17 April 2018"," Eggs. Eggs everywhere.
","Want to feel nostalgic? Well Spielberg and Cline will hit you in the face with a plate full of it. Permeated with a salad of popular culture references and 80's nostalgia, this movie represents a sum of the 21st century. Despite the lack of character depth later on in the movie and the somewhat unnecessary narrative parts in the beginning, the story is brilliantly presented. Both Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke drops the mic on their performance and Mark Rylance's also unsurprisingly nails his. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie is a satirical representation of how a teenager in this time and age interacts with the digital world and reality. How an individual thinks that things in the virtual world would affect his/her life in a greater scale than actual reality and ironically, how they actually want it to be. Because the reality is rotten enough. Though ultimately, it makes us realize that no matter how stained the reality is, that's the only place where a person can actually ""live"" a life. But also leaves us with the question, 'can we really?'<br/><br/>Gem of a movie! Highly recommend to watch it. Especially if you're a fan of the 80's. You'll find yourself in A LOT of occasions where you'd say to yourself, ""Ah! I understood that reference!"""

"view_and_review","7","0","1","16 April 2018"," I was ready
","Ready Player One was a brilliant movie about the impending digital future. The main setting was The Stacks in Columbus, Ohio 2045. Scratch that. The main setting was a virtual world called the Oasis; Columbus, Ohio was nothing more than the derelict real world that the main character, Wade, lived in. <br/><br/>In this not-too-distant future there is gross overcrowding and real life sucks for just about everyone. No worries because just about everyone escapes this reality to a virtual reality called the Oasis. The Oasis is a virtually limitless digital world in which you can do just about anything and be just about anyone. It is the great escape. <br/><br/>The founder and creator of this world died and left behind an Easter egg that--if found--makes the finder the sole owner and operator of the Oasis. Oh yeah, and they inherit the company worth $500B. No biggie. Of course everyone wants to find this Easter egg but the race for this Easter egg has real world consequences when a rival company will stop at nothing to win.<br/><br/>One thing that made the movie fun and cool was the fact that they were in a virtual world. That's not new or unique but it made the CGI less obtrusive. Because they were in this virtual world you fully expect everyone and everything to look digitally generated which allows you to rate the graphics from a video game perspective as opposed to a movie perspective.<br/><br/>Looking into the overall theme of the movie it was a bit sad though the movie never emitted a somber tone. People were happier spending their time in a virtual world being different people, different beings, different objects as opposed to being themselves doing things in the real world. There is very little that is sadder. The movie Surrogates with Bruce Willis explore this same theme in a different manner.<br/><br/>But going back to RPO (that's Ready Player One, not the football term run-pass-option), I couldn't help but feel sorry for everyone in the movie as they frolicked around their digital paradise. They're lives were so inextricably linked to their avatar and the Oasis that virtual losses made them react demonstrably in real life. That is quite scary!<br/><br/>The truth is we may not be too far from that as a reality. As it is we spend a lot of time in a digital world. Whether it's video games, social media, or other entertainment we are dominated by the digital world. So how big of a leap is it to have an ubiquitous virtual universe where everyone co-mingles? Your brother is in China, husband in Afghanistan, kids in college... no worry, strap on your VR glasses, put on your VR suit and meet with them on the moon, or middle earth or wherever. It could happen. But for now we'll settle for an exciting movie about it."

"robkengar","5","0","1","16 April 2018"," Fun movie with many flaws
","RP1 is a visual treat loaded with fun 80's pop culture references that suffers from so serious flaws. The biggest is the creator of Oasis. It's easy to see why people are entranced by the Oasis but Halliday himself is hardly a compelling figure. Though brilliant and creative, he's uninteresting at best with his blank-faced, stoner affect--and a self-absorbed vindictive person at worst. <br/><br/>His story is that of Ebeneezer Scrooge without the ghostly redemption at the end. In the flashback scenes of him interacting with the more sympathetic Ogden Morrow he's a absent-minded professor type child who clearly isn't listening to his friend. And that scene is the recreation of Halliday's bedroom is horrifying. Halliday's emotionally a 10 year old who never formed anything approaching a healthy human relationship. And he's trapped in perpetual childishness (shown symbolically when Old and Young Halliday walk into the other room and close the door). Not exactly the stuff of rip-roaring blockbuster movies. <br/><br/>Also think of his story with Kira. He meets her. Asks her on a date. Takes her to Kubrick's psycho-sexual freakout ""The Shining"" on a first date. He's so clueless about women (no sin in and of itself) that he doesn't know he's clueless about women (the true sin). There could have been a quick scene of him asking advice or seeming nervous. And surprise surprise no relationship happens.<br/><br/>And think about it from Kira's perspective: What exactly is Halliday's appeal? Goofy looking. Poor conversationalist. Obssessed in a very specific niche within a niche--80's gaming, pop culture. Socially awkward. <br/><br/>Kira later meets Halliday's partner, falls in love, marries him, and for all the movie tells us lives a reasonably happy life with him. Halliday's response to his only friend Morrow finding love: forcing him to sell him his shares in the company. Oh yeah, and he weirdly ""punishes"" Kira by trapping an avatar of her in a series of eternal dances with zombies inside a remake of ""The Shining"" ballroom. Again, Halliday not at all attractive physically, emotionally, personally"

","I read this book by Ernest Cline a while ago and really did enjoy it because I'm a big nerd and a sucker for nostalgia; it was the ultimate story for me. When I found out it was being made into a film directed by Steven Spielberg but questioned how some moments in the book could possibly be depicted on screen. With already high expectations, I was blown away.<br/><br/>This was a completely different film experience I had. Spielberg proves he can still make captivating stories come to life on screen. I've seen reviews trashing this because of technicalities, but what this was, was a popcorn movie. When I say that, I mean it's not going to win any creative awards, but it sure as hell will entertain you. The film is much different from the book, but you had to have expected that and I think it made it much better.<br/><br/>The Shining scene was the most fun I ever had watching a movie in theatres. Everyone was surprised and enjoying watching Aech walk through a film where we already knew what was going to happen, but she didn't. It has me impatiently waiting for the Blu Ray in hopes they have a featurette on how that scene came to be.<br/><br/>It may be new, but I already think this would be on one of my all-time favourite films list."

The movie evokes strong emotions while we watched the events unfold. The connecting the real world to the virtual was seamless due to the excellent use of graphics.

","It would have been better not to have read the book because I was SO EXCITED to see this amazing book in movie form. But aside from the genera plot line - OASIS inventor dies, search for 3 keys, Theo wins - absolutely nothing is like the book. I was disappointed, but my friends who hadn't read the book loved it. There are a handful of 80s references but they're not the same nor nearly integral as they are in the book. The book has some brilliant insights and ideas about how VR can benefit the world (ie using it for schools to enhance teaching and provide better education to kids everywhere without regard to income or other factors, and eliminate bullying and other obstacles in school) balanced with how VR can be exploited and hurt society, but this movie shows only high octane use of VR and negative influence. I can't believe Ernest Cline wrote and approved this screenplay. SHAME!"

","Ready Player One is a far better video game movie, movie about gamers than either a love letter to the 80s or movie about its lead character Wade. So if your enjoyment of RP1 needs to lean on identifying with Wades life or being treated to a never ending stream of 80s references, and only 80s references, you may be disappointed. <br/><br/>But the movie worked as a love letter to gamers, and friendship, and as a cautionary tale warning of the perils of immersive on-line gaming and the toll it could take on humanity and society (why am I so serious? The movie's fun). <br/><br/>First the good: It was visually beautiful, the action sequences inspired. As a child of the 80s I thought all of the decade specific references were well done and enjoyable. I loved the movies sights and sounds, its nostalgia, and its video gamishness (Okay that's not an actual word ;))<br/><br/>The directing was good, especially the action which was never muddled despite being frenetic and cluttered with characters, Easter eggs, and everything else. The script was decent... I mean the material is pretty unwieldy, as anyone who's read the book would know, so I'm not gonna complain too much about it. The plot was comprehensible and pretty satisfying. The main characters were underdeveloped, and the books 80s atmosphere was somewhat compromised, both of which I touch on below:<br/><br/>While the acting was good, Rylance and Mendelsohn were especially inspired, I wasn't able to get emotionally invested in the kids as the world they lived in and their struggle was under explored in order to focus on gamers, friendship, and fan-boy culture (not that this was totally a bad thing given the appeal of the property).<br/><br/>The other area where the movie fell short of greatness for me was the efforts of the studio and filmmakers to broaden the appeal of RP1 beyond the books primary fans: Dudes over the age of 30 who are obsessed with the 80s... And I get that. A movie that's this expensive has to appeal to women and younger people, not just my old behind. But the Iron Giant, as lovely as he was, stuck out like a sore thumb. And don't even get me started on that 'one the nose' 70s dance number... barf!<br/><br/>I'd recommend watching Ready Player One, ideally on the biggest screen possible, Imax even, as it has a few action sequences which really need to be experienced on the biggest screen possible to be fully enjoyed. It was definitely worth the price of admission."

","Ready Player One is the Mecca of Visual Effects. If you're a fan of pop culture, this is IT, this is where you get your ultimate fangasm.
Steven Spielberg, the man has nothing more to prove and the iconic aura of his craftsmanship etched in the world of cinema is nothing short of legendary.<br/><br/>RPO is his extreme attempt in blending reality and animation with some of the greatest pop culture references. The film happens majorly in Oasis, a virtual world created by James Halliday where possibilities are limitless. 
The action choreography and CG shots are poetry in motion!!
There is the real world and there is the virtual world. So the wisdom of the film exists in the merge of these two realities which gives you a spellbinding vicinity.<br/><br/>My excitement won't stop talking. The Shining sisters scene is my favorite. The DeLorean appeared on the screen and the inner me cried, 'Back to the future!!!.' 
Same went for almost all the 80s references shown in the movie.
Akira Anime, Freddy Krueger, Star Trek (though I'm not a fan, I noticed it without hesitation), T-Rex, James Cameron's Alien, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, Star Wars reference, Cocktail reference, Mission: Impossible mask off scene, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Godzilla, Terminator 2, Superman...Chucky...
there are more because the movie is literally built on the artifacts of these classics.<br/><br/>Tye Sheridan is brilliant, Olivia Cooke is cute and I loved the Simon Pegg's cameo. So this is a movie for Me and you if you're a geek."

","Let me start by saying that I didn't read the book. As such, I'm not going to compare it to the book and evaluate the film based on loyalty to the book, as I think it's unrealistic to expect a 2 hour movie to ever match the depth of content of a book. If anything, the story is more of a wrapper around the action scenes and CGI.<br/><br/>So anyway, RPO is is a movie that looks to entertain. And quite frankly, if the Manhattan race track with the T-rex didn't entertain you, you have no soul. There were multiple times where I was just in awe over the technical brilliance of the CGI, and just enjoying the hell out of the visuals. <br/><br/>I didn't get the impression that the movie tried to be a serious plot about alternative realities or anything. There are an increasing number of stories being written about that kind of stuff. This one isn't all that different, and it doesn't take itself seriously. That's okay. Actually, it's a good thing. There's nothing lamer than a terrible movie trying too hard to have some sort of deep story by being gritty and dark.<br/><br/>So it's quite simple. If you want to see some really good CGI, and if you like geek culture, go see this. Just don't go expecting some sort of deep philosophical debate about anything."

","For Ernest Cline, the prospect of The Steven Spielberg even acknowledging Ready Player One, let alone directing its cinematic adaptation, must have felt as head-explodingly awesome but utterly impossible as a high-five from Indiana Jones. And yet, in the words of a certain Doctor Malcolm: life found a way. And, to those (not unfairly) worrying that the iconic Spielberg would lack the ironic distance to do justice to Cline's hyperactive, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink mashup of 80s/90s pop culture nerd nostalgia: hold onto your butts.* It's been seven long years since Tintin, after which Fun Spielberg buried his head into the muted realm of historical biopics. But, like the Terminator, boy is he back, baby, and making up for lost time like nobody's business. In the thick of an entertainment industry currently ruled by the iron first of nerd chic, Spielberg's Ready Player One feels like a Donkey Kong-sized warm hug (with accompanying a-Ha soundtrack, natch) - an unironic love letter to loving things, told with consummate affection and plenty of gusto by a master storyteller. It's a visually dazzling, uninhibitedly indulgent kaleidoscope of nostalgia, old-fashioned in the best possible sense (mostly), and rambunctiously fun from Van Halen to Hall & Oates. <br/><br/>But, for those poor audiences who have never picked up a video game controller, fear not: there is more to Ready Player One than a 'Where's Waldo' of pop culture cameos (though it's hard to imagine a film that will ever benefit more from revisitation with freeze-frame capacity). It's a jubilantly jaunty grand ol' adventure romp - an action remix of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? meets Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory if you will, and easily as fun, albeit less groundbreaking, than both. The plot is a furious pinball of episodic adventures, which, necessarily, boils down and speeds up Cline's more expansive odyssey without losing its zippiness or stakes. Spielberg, to his credit, plays it straight with adorable old-school earnestness, even if some of the script's more overly convenient contrivances and antiquated gender roles that come along for the ride don't play nearly as well now as they would've in their heyday (Cline's novel unpacks toxic gamer masculinity a bit more deftly than Wade's more rudimentary heroism here). <br/><br/>Still, it's hard to nit-pick a transparently superfluous plot in the face of such a thrillingly dense virtual world. The film's visual effects are jaw-dropping, bringing each digital planet and avatar in engrossing game-world 'the Oasis' to life with such painstaking attention that we bypass the claustrophobic artifice exhaustion that would customarily come with such CGI overload. Even more laudable: anchoring the film with two plasticine-y Final Fantasy-esq avatars without them grating. Spielberg cleverly starts with a splashy racetrack blowout (far more exhilarating than the stale trailer footage would suggest), then ramps up the spectacle slowly, before letting it rip with a bonkers kitchen sink climax, almost deliriously fun in its crowd-pleasing excesses (The Iron Giant vs. Mechagodzilla? YES PLEASE). Alan Silvestri's joyfully thundering musical score (and a bevy of perfectly timed '80s tunes) triumphantly rounds out the fun, replete with its own collection of musical cameos. Great Scott, but there is fun to be had. <br/><br/> It helps immensely to see Spielberg reigniting his Minority Report flair for deliciously weird comedy beats. He finds such perverse glee in a room full of corporate stooges running menacingly on treadmills with VR headsets, like a call centre of gaming hamsters, or in tormenting audiences expecting a nonstop bubblegum fun-fest with a transparently indulgent second act foray into Kubrick's The Shining - a tonal shift so jarringly terrifying you can practically hear Spielberg cackling in the background. Still, even scarier is Spielberg turning his pop culture icon eye inwards, ever so lightly rapping the knuckles of those who deep dive a little too much into fantasy worlds, and gently reminding them to live in, and appreciate, the real world as well. It's a commentary that might rankle some of the film's key demographic, but essential to Ready Player One being more than blatant fan service: love what you love uninhibitedly, Spielberg and Cline urge us, but remember that pop culture is meant to accentuate the real world, not run away entirely from it. It's as profound as the film ever gets, but it resonates. No one wants to turn into a suited hamster-ball drone... right? <br/><br/>Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, and Lena Waithe are all perfectly pleasant as the lead gamers-turned-world saviours, appropriately fun and charismatic without ever rocking the boat of their cardboard cutout archetypes. Ben Mendelsohn adds an endearingly safe-effacing comedic undercurrent to what is otherwise a complete retread of his Rogue One sinister bureaucrat schtick, while T.J. Miller provides reliable comic relief as his caustically cantankerous muscle. Still, it's Mark Rylance who easily steals the show as Wonka-esq gaming maverick James Haliday. Adorably convincing as a ferociously antisocial tech geek, while conveying volumes of mischievous playfulness or voluminous regret with the slightly movement of his eyes or mouth, Rylance is as larger-than-life as he is profoundly human, and he elevates Spielberg's material immensely. Finally, though tragically restricted to an underserved cameo, Simon Pegg still blusters adorably like the best of them in his fleeting screentime. <br/><br/>Ready Player One is a distinctly niche film - enormously fun, but not always more than the sum of its parts, and those who can't tell their Space Invaders from their Galaga are, admittably ,likely to lose out on the full effect. But, if Lara Croft, Beetlejuice, Marvin the Martian, some Halo Spartans and World of Warcraft orcs racing down a freeway in a Delorean, 1960s Batmobile, A-Team battle van, Akira bike and more, dodging King Kong and a t-rex gets your blood pumping as much as mine is from writing that sentence, chances are you'll devour the film with a befitting bombastic, escapist gluttony. And that's a guilty pleasure worth dropping a quarter or two into. <br/><br/> -8.5/10 <br/><br/>*Yep - two Jurassic Park nods in two sentences. Deal with it, n00bz."
"cguldal","7","0","1","13 April 2018"," Different, but better than the book
","So, a lot of people loved the book. These are not discerning readers, I am assuming. The book is a good adventure, but the voice is super annoying (whiny, teenage boy), though successful (at being whiny and teenage-y). What really sucks about the book is the ""telling."" Sentence after sentence we are TOLD how he feels, how he sees things, etc, and very rarely are we ""shown"" how he feels, etc. It is a long-standing, somewhat stale writing trope, this ""show, don't tell"" and one only really appreciates it when it is so frequently and obviously violated in a book that it just gets in the way of a good story. Beyond that, the writing is just not very tight or impressive, meandering into strangely constructed sentences, ineffective prose, and downright bad wording in some cases. So the book, in my humble opinion, is not very good. Those who loved it loved it because of the geekery and the nostalgia, not because it was a good piece of literature. Perhaps for a genre book, that's OK. (But really, readers, you need to hold the bar higher, to demand better writing...)<br/><br/>The movie is different. The plot is different. The road to the keys, in some cases, is even different. But I thought the differences from the book were good choices. They certainly did not detract from a good movie experience. A lot of the geekery was toned down, though I am sure if I were to watch at home with the ability to stop and rewind, I'd find tons of geekery stuffed in each shot in the film, too. Some of the special effects looked good (I'm no expert). The CGI was good as well. The dialog, reminiscent of the book, was awkward at times, and not just because it is supposed to be awkward teenagers talking. The evil corporation was underwhelming, more so than in the book. <br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest difference from the book was how the main character infiltrates the evil corporation. This happens in the book, and I had found it one of the more interesting events in the plot, but it does not happen in the film. I'm not sure why not.<br/><br/>Overall, if you didn't like the book, you might like the film. I thought the film was much better. If you loved the book because of all the geekery and fantastic trivia, and you're married to the books fantastic (uhm, cough cough) plot line, then you may hate the film. If you have not read the book (you aren't missing much, if you're a literature buff, but you should read it if you only enjoy genre fiction and are OK with plot-driven bad writing), then you'll probably find the film enjoyable."

The Shining was different from the book, and the movie was great, Jaws was different from the book, and yet again, great movie... This is another fine example that proper screenwriting can make a great movie from an equally great book, even though they have differences.

It asks obvious societal questions, offers a satisfying ending, has likable characters, despicable characters, fun characters, and characters you feel for, and is tons of fun.

"Metal_Robots","6","0","1","13 April 2018"," The most lightweight Speilberg film so far.
","I fell asleep and missed the middle half, can't really be bothered to re-watch it, it's not very good and probably Spielberg's weakest film (that I'm aware of - bearing in mind I haven't see A.I. for ages). Wasn't really expecting much though as I tried reading the book a while ago and couldn't finish that either, it was so badly written, but i'd hoped they had fixed that with the screenplay. It was slightly better than the book in that it didn't just resort to lists of lazy context-less 80s references, barely held together by a story seemingly written buy a junior school kid.<br/><br/>Films that are 50% CGI, you have to ask how much 'directing' was involved anyway. It's hard to work out who it is aimed at, as it's probably OK for kids and young teenagers as a pretty standard lightweight fantasy film like The Hunger Games / Maze Runner etc, but the 80s references that are in there are not going to mean much to them (I presume)"
"rustonreviews","8","0","1","13 April 2018"," Geeks assemble.
","In the years since its release, Steven Spielberg has famously gone on record for, on several occasions, saying that Jaws (1975) was the most difficult film of his career, closely followed by his WWII epic Saving Private Ryan (1998). Just recently, in an interview on the Kermode and Mayo podcast, he revealed that Ready Player One, based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline, ranked third on his list of films he found particularly difficult to craft. As the trailers dropped for the film, eager eyed geeks everywhere were drawn in by the pop culture references sprinkled throughout, from the Iron Giant to Freddy Kruger, to the time travelling DeLorean racing through the streets to King Kong clinging to the top of a skyscraper. Of course, this was just the tip of the ice berg, as Ready Player One is a treasure trove of pop culture. Specifically, 80's pop culture. In 2045, the world has become a desolate, depressing place to live, with the virtual reality world of the OASIS becoming the ultimate escapism. Whilst inhabiting the OASIS, people can be anything they want to be, and go anywhere they want to go, taking on the form of their own unique avatar. When James Halliday (Mark Rylance), creator of the OASIS, dies, he leaves behind an Easter Egg in his creation. Whoever finds this Easter Egg becomes the rightful owner of the OASIS, thus sparking a quest among thousands to locate it. <br/><br/>Spielberg has confessed to geeking out multiple times during production of the film, and its clear to see why. Ready Player One is thriving with geek references, from easily recognisable mainstream characters like Batman, to more obscure references like Buckaroo Banzai. Geeks will have a blast trying to spot them all, but the film packs so much into it that its practically impossible to find every single one on first viewing. Though a good 80% of the film is set in these massive, epic CGI landscapes, it doesn't at all detract from central storyline of escapism and friendship. Wade Watts (Sheridan) and Samantha Cook (Cooke) first meet in the OASIS as their respective avatars, Parzival and Art3mis, but soon develop a real-life romance that keeps the films heart beating. The two share great chemistry and are exceptional as the films leads. Ben Mendleson as the films big bad corporate businessman Nolan Sorrento is a menacing antagonist, and channels elements from his performance as Orson Krennic from 2016's Star Wars spin off Rogue One. Visually, the film is a true spectacle. Spielberg crafts such spellbinding action sequences that demand to be witnessed on the big screen, and, in this rare instance, 3D actually works miles better. As mentioned before, so much is packed on screen that at times its near impossible to keep up. Some may feel that the films CGI overload is too much, but with a source novel bursting to the brim with such action and 80's nostalgia at every turn, it seems as though CGI was the only possible route to bring the story to life. <br/><br/>Ready Player One is the ultimate geek movie. Bursting with action, heart, and stunning visuals, it is a film that is totally unapologetic of its endless nostalgia fest. Following the films success, I read that Cline has announced he is working on a second book in the series. Consider me ready."

","Ready player one (2018)
Plot: It takes place in future in Ohio Columbus where the entire society is living in virtual reality called ""OASIS"" created by genius Halliday and he left 3 keys in the game which will lead to the ultimate Easter egg and ownership of Oasis.
Cons: Even though aspiring visuals fail to register the characters among us, Protagonist Parzival's real world home life is typical orphan with abusive step family we have seen thousand times on screen and it given brief to time grasp, rebellion against corporate and debt workers also similar to fascist government antagonists (duh... star wars) in numerous movies. Another speed breaker for progress of the plot is relationship between Parzivel and Artimis which was predictable and tension of romance wasn't presented between the couple, but later their predictable choices lead to interesting sequences in the third act. Since the opening to exposition of this future world was more of telling rather than showing felt frustrating for the standard of Spielberg. Major disappointment was movie fail to show the reasons why the world choose to live in this virtual world and loose all their money and time on that fiction? Why they had to hide their real identity to express themselves? If these segments of events leading up to the current catharsis of mud we witness. Length of the movie is felt at the end of the movie when it drags for a happily ever after wrap up was unnecessary. 
Pros: Steven Spielberg is the master of scene blocking, chase scenes, tracking shots and framing particular setup to move around his character to create illusion of depth and elements of gradual accumulation for an ultimate revealing, after the less enthusiastic BFG and Post Spielberg dashes through his masterful direction. Technical mastery of the visual effects will leave you in an awe and massive hoards of characters from 80s movies/TV shows and music videos moves in and out of frames without creating any distraction to the audience and teasing their inner child with correct amount of nostalgia feel. Gratefully movie does not rely on the nostalgia feel it carries and arguably this is most nerdiest movie ever made and this success is to be thanked by Deadpool, stranger things and IT. In a particular scene we are shown kid who kick boxing and fat lady pole dancing while Parzivel walking to his trailer to play Oasis, this tracking scene left a feeling of need more of this clever cinematography on more scenes, thank fully under the command of Spielberg he was able to pull off balanced popcorn movie and exquisite action/chase blocks.
Conclusion: Visual spectacle of virtual reality OASIS one must be experienced in 3D. 
Verdict: A solid B+ (7.5/10)"

","What is Ready Player One about? It is about a young man who lives in a world of virtual reality called the Oasis.

It is like watching one big action video game. I could not wait for this film to end. I think Spielberg forgot that today's generation cares less about culture and history than ever before. This is only my opinion. <br/><br/>The reason for 2 stars is a moral example I would like to share: Let's say that I stay at home and meet all my friends and my girlfriend in online forums. We have lots of fun and adventure. You, the viewer, know this. Then I decide to lecture you about how you should not be in online forums because you should go outside more, take risks, talk to females(or males) in person, and live your life. Would this example keep you off the computer more often?<br/><br/>I think most of the gamers who watch this film are going to go home after the movie and play some more video games."

"ThomasDrufke","8","0","1","13 April 2018"," A Nerd's Nerd Film
","Ready Player One is quite possibly the biggest ""nerd's nerd film"". What I mean by that is that sure the film can be appreciated by the general public, but there's no question that the large part of the population that goes to see it won't be able to truly appreciate the ins and outs of this Easter egg filled movie. Dozens and probably even closer to hundreds of hidden gems fill this Sci-fi feature helmed by one of the all-time greatest directors, Steven Spielberg. If there's ever a film you wish you could pause, zoom-in, and rewind while in the theater, it's Ready Player One.<br/><br/>There is of course, the disappointing element of the film you have to get over, which is that a good chunk of the film (maybe 75%) is in CGI. Once you get passed the fact that the characters you're supposed to grapple onto, and the environments they inhabit, are entirely fake, then there's not much stopping you from having a blast. I thought the performances by Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, and Ben Mendelsohn were all very good, and in Cooke's case, great. The effects and cinematography were about as good as you're going to get without going over budget. And the script was above average.<br/><br/>However, the real journey you go to the theater for is the mystery, easter eggs, and the surprises. Boy were there a ton of them here. There's one particular scene, which was somehow not spoiled by any marketing or journalist, that is one of the coolest film sequences I have seen in quite some time. And Spielberg really does a nice job of appealing to the older generations as well as the newer generations. What a ride this film was.<br/><br/>8.8/10"

","Felt like I was a kid again watching all those characters on the big screen. Brought back a lot of childhood memories."
"inyz","7","0","1","12 April 2018"," An overall enjoying entertainment unfortunately tarnished by significant weaknesses
","Ready Player One's runtime is a quite long 140 minutes, and not a single one of them is boring; the film passes in the blink of the eye. Not only it's a good entertainment containing very spectacular action sequences (and you don't want to blink during them if you don't want to miss one of the gazillions pop culture references), but its thematic is dealt with a certain intelligence that makes it not a dumb fireworks show, but rather a clever, familial show. That is the least you could expect from Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>That base being covered, I couldn't help myself from finding a list of oddities, disappointments and other narrative weaknesses. First of all, I didn't quite like the appearance of the characters' avatar in the ""OASIS"". Most of the movie takes place inside this video game, and we therefore watch the characters evolve mostly through their avatar, which is a CGI, fanciful, version of themselves. I found the avatars very childish and lacking elegance. I can understand why they preferred making the official poster with the real-life characters and included none of the avatars, because that would have made it look like a very silly movie, like ""Arthur and the Invisibles"". To make it worse, one of the theme in the movie is that the main female character doesn't want to be met in real life because she's insecure about her appearance, which she thinks would be disappointing in comparison to her (supposed to be) attractive avatar. This whole subject was a bit ridiculous, because in real-life she's a very cute woman, and absolutely more attractive than her odd alien-looking avatar. I can imagine women playing video games and not having a standard beautiful physical appearance (unlike Olivia Cooke, the actress in Ready Player One) being frustrated with the hypocritical way this thematic is dealt with in the movie.<br/><br/>The sentimental story that is developed between her and the main character is very awkward. It feels like the film was originally 4 hours long and they decided to cut on the love story to make it fit inside a more reasonable runtime. Some scenes are just really, really wrong. In one of them, the main character explains that he's in love with her because they ""finish each other's sentences"" (the old romcom cliché), but they have just met each other and interacted with each other's in a few scenes, discussing game strategy and logistics! This makes no sense. Later, when they meet each other in real life, and he notices that she hides a birthmark on her face with a strand of hair (which explains the insecurity about her appearance), he proceeds to put the strand of hair aside and stroke her face in an affective gesture. This is such an out-of-place thing to do with a woman he just met, and she seems fine with it, it's all so awkward and weird!<br/><br/>This weak sentimental story is rooted in the fact that the personality of the main character in real life is inconsistent with his personality in the video game. In real life, he's portrayed by a serious-looking Tye Sheridan, whose eyeglasses only add to the apparent maturity. In the game, his avatar is all excited, shy, and at times borderline childish. Now, this looks like this is actually an assumed theme from the movie, the fact that when you play an avatar you don't display your actual self and can communicate emotions you don't want to communicate in real life. It is, in any case, supported by the directing: in the scenes where the character expresses his teenager's emotion-fueled love for the girl, we only see it from inside the video game; but in the scenes where he, with assertiveness and no innocence, confronts the CEO of the evil corporation about his evilness, we see him in real life in his van with the VR goggles on. So this could actually have been a great treatment of the theme, if only it hadn't lead to this contradiction where a character is in a quantum state, both too shy to dare kiss a girl and also visibly too mature to pull out this kind of crap."
"jcruz-42957","7","0","1","12 April 2018"," Ready Player One: 8.1
","Ready Player One starts off being unimpressive. Partly due to a generically worded monologue by the main character, but over the course of the movie your attention exponentially grows and entwines into the story. The first time seeing the Oasis is a little underwhelming, and the visual effects are jarring, but it grows on you. Seeing Wade's friends inside the Oasis ultimately becomes really fun to watch. The most of the references in this movies are brisk and don't overstay their welcome, but the same cannot be said for other ones. There comes a point in the story where Wade and his gang venture into the Overlook hotel, and it is phenomenal. Definitely the high point in the movie. The final battle is one of surprises and grandness. With interesting new concepts for a battle given that the story to this movie is somewhat unique. The ending as a whole is one of heart touching sights and events that ground the people back to the roots of video games for a moment. Near the end everybody on the Oasis isn't going on these giant complicated adventures. They're just watching Wade play a simple 80's video game. When Ben Mendelsohn opens the door to the van at the end to kill Wade, the kids yell ""Stop! Please!"". It's a moment of self reflection for Ben's character. He turns off his businessman mentality to just look at Wade holding the Easter egg, crying. It's an amazing moment. The cast and their avatars for the most part work. I'd say Mark Rylance had the best performance. He was a unique character and fascinating character, and I appreciated that the world was crying when he died. Ben Mendo did a great job playing an evil businessman, and I loved his avatar. H was funny, and I liked the little twist that he was a girl. Olivia Cooke suited her role well also. Although I didn't like her avatar very much. Lastly Tye Sheridan was fine, but his avatar easily could've been better. One of the things I didn't like about his character Wade in particular was how he fell into that cliché of playing video games with the girl for about 3 days, and allegedly fell in love with her. Which didn't work at any level. Again some of Wade's dialogue is just generically written that underwhelms, and at times exclusive to the first 30 minutes there was times when I felt that I was just watching a cutscene from a video game. Overall, Ready Player One is a fun adventure that easily could've been a train wreck, but with it brings a lot of heart and emotion at the center of the story making it very memorable. Even if some of the attempts at heart didn't work. So I give it an 8.1"

"rannynm","10","0","1","12 April 2018"," An epic, nostalgic film filled to the brim with pop culture
","Ready Player One is an epic, nostalgic film filled to the brim with pop culture references. It has characters you can really connect to and a digital world we all dream about. It has all sorts of exiting scenes such as races, puzzles, battles and so many others. This film is based on the book Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. They adapted the book very smoothly into film.<br/><br/>Ready Player One takes place in the year 2045. James Halliday creates the OASIS, a completely virtual world that everyone uses to escape their reality. After his death, a competition begins to find the Easter egg in the OASIS. Whoever finds the egg will have complete control over the OASIS. Wade and his friends try to win this competition and stop IOI from beating them for total control of the OASIS. It is filled with twists that make it hard to predict what will happen next even after reading the book.<br/><br/>I loved all the references in this film. Just to note some there was the Iron Giant, King Kong, Batman, The DeLorean and Martin the Martian. The special effects were also incredible. I really enjoyed the effect whenever someone changed their skin in the OASIS. I also enjoyed the mix between animated and live action characters. This is impressive because it's hard to make these two styles be near each other without one being out of place. I really liked how the world seemed like a fantasy people have today yet is also a dystopia at the same time.<br/><br/>My favorite part was the introduction to the OASIS. This scene was really impressive and had so much squeezed in. I also liked the scene were the common people attacked IOI. These scenes both showed a huge variety of different characters all from different parts of pop culture.
I enjoyed Mark Rylance's acting in this film. He filled the role of James Halliday brilliantly. He was very erratic yet sincere and made the character relatable even in extreme circumstances. <br/><br/>The song choices in this film were great. I particularly enjoyed the use of the original King Kong theme.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and strongly recommend it to anyone ages 7 through 18 because people under 7 wouldn't be entertained by all the references if they haven't experienced the things being referred to. I also believe adults will strongly enjoy it.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Rohan F., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org."

","Speilberg unleashed the mother of all easter eggs in a film about the hunt... for an easter egg!<br/><br/>Overall, Speilberg crafts a narrative that would make even James Halliday proud. It is incredibly clever, action packed and a brilliant thrill ride that constantly quizzes the audience, we're you watching carefully? The film starts off at a brilliant pace and my only nag would be that as the finale plays out it does begin to seem a bit drawn out.<br/><br/>Critics began moaning saying that 'Ready Player One' is by far one of Speilberg's worst films. Personally I think they couldn't be more wrong. This is Speilberg's playground, where the limits of the story, are the limits of your imagination. So much is packed into one film that it left my inner nerd giggling like a little school-girl.<br/><br/>There are so many cool moments and visual spectacles that certainly prove satisfying. Whether its the Delorean from Back to the Future, Freddy Kruger on the battlefield or... Hello Kitty? Everything has its own fun little impact on the story in what I can only imagine was a licensing nightmare!<br/><br/>Overall, with its 80's to current day nostalgia, a Guardians of the Galaxy style soundtrack and its fun, original and straightforward narrative Ready player One lets the inner child within go wild! A brilliant film that has things that appeal to nearly all ages and is well worth the time. Just try not to get distracted by all the characters in the background! High tier acting and incredibly satisfying characters help to round of a story that makes you somewhat envious modern day doesn't have its own OASIS."

","Considering it's expected for an adaptation to include a series of changes to better incorporate itself to the new medium, we can say that the movie is pretty faithful to the source material - In the sense that it took a book that had good ideas, but amauterish execution filled with tiresome exposition, and made it into a movie that ALSO has good ideas, but amauterish execution filled with exposition. But they forgot that the book had at least some emotional investment.<br/><br/>If you want that much to see an action movie with young protagonists, nerd references and pretty visual effects, watch Scott Pilgrim. It has the same theme of video games immersed in the daily life, with 10 times more personality. But if you're actually interested to see a bastardized adaptation with pooly written characters, I suggest Death Note (2017). Both are available on Netflix and will save you the ticket money."

","I took my girlfriend to the cinema. I didn't tell her what the movie was. Only mentioned that it's a Spielberg movie. For the first 10 minutes I was scared she would kill me but then realised she was absolutely delighted. 
The movie has a very simple silly plot that I loved in 80s and 90s and remind me of what the movies used to be. 
Despite being silly it delivers tons of fun and ""oh my god look at this"" moments. 
These days most movies focus on serious issues and shows superheroes as people who have feelings. Ready Player One lets you forget all that crap and plunge into old good new adventure cinema where sky is the limit and you do not care about everyday problems. 
Go and see. And definitely try 3D. I watched it in 2d and I will go again just to see the 3rd dimension.

","This movie clearly did not live up to the hype. It probably mark the downfall of Spielberg after his nearly flawless directing career.
The idea is quite good. I have never read the book but I heard it's fantastic. But it doesn't mean the good can transfer to this adaptation. 'Ready Player One' lacks of plot cohesion. In other word, the way its story goes is such a mess! A dystopian future (which was poorly portrayed) where billion dollars entertainment cooperation takes control of literally everything seems to be very cliche, and the way Spielberg put power into their hands are just very illogical. Moreover, the main message of the movie is also very unclear. Did he try to criticized the generation of people wearing VR and forget the real world, or just ones who couldn't catch up to the pop-culture of the 80's but try to earn from it? Til the very end of the movie, this question is still not answered. 
The line of this film is... terrible. It's super cliche and predictable. 
The overall graphic is quite fine. But the sketch of 'avatar' is bizarre, reminding me of 'Mars need Mom', tbh.
But it does bring up the fan-boy inside of you, if you could understand all the references in it. But honestly, none of them are really bold or memorable."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","11 April 2018"," Ready audience go
","""Ready Player One"" is the newest work by famous director Steven Spielberg. This 2018 movie is pretty long at 2 hours and 20 minutes, but it never drags and that means quite something. It plays a bit in the future when the world is dominated by a virtual reality video game that is basically another world named Oasis. We follow the main character Wade in there as he tries to find three priceless keys that would make him the ruler of Oasis. On the path to that, he meets many other characters, makes friends and enemies and eventually ends up on a path where he has to make some of the most difficult decisions of his life. The film is a mix of live action and animation and that is nothing new for Spielberg, even if this film takes of course a completely different approach compared to Tintin and Milou a few years ago. The story is really good at times, but the best thing for me is certainly the grand number of film and video game references and I probably only got half of them. My personal favorite was perhaps the Shining reference, also because the character was so funny with not knowing what was gonna happen next as he has never seen the movie. The very brief Ryu Street Fighter reference was gold too of course. And there is so much more. It almost feels like a cyber version of The Goonies or other traditional kids/teenager movies with slightly older characters. Sadly there were also some things I did not like as much. One would be that the love story felt a bit forced and that I felt the two did not have great chemistry. The parallel between the two and the genius and his love interest was a bit cringeworthy at times too. But that should not take away from how stunning Olivia Cooke is or from how memorable her digital self is in here. I have a feeling people 20 years from now will still talk about that character if they talk about anything from the animated parts. And maybe there were a bit too many action sequences at the end (in the last quarter) and a bit more subtlety instead of explosions could have helped. But it wasn't too bad and that is just my subjective opinion. It still takes only very little away from the film's quality and finally one criticism could be that in my opinion there really was not one single moment that really had me hold my breath I must admit.<br/><br/>I am writing this review as somebody who has not read the book by Ernest Cline, but I heard that it is pretty amazing, so I am not too sure if I can be a judge here in terms of how well it was adapted, but it's always nice for me to see the writer of the book also being the one who wrote the screenplay or at least one of several who did. The cast here did a pretty fine job overall, there is not one that made a negative impact, but I think that Oscar winner Mark Rylance really won me over here once again with his excellent performance. He sure made the most of what he was given and is a joy to watch in every scene he is in. What a chameleon. I also spent a great deal of time here wondering about who the other virtual reality characters would be in real life and what they would be like compared to their virtual selves. But as they solved this issue quickly, they made sure that it would not get in the way of the key story here of good vs evil with the bad guy being a bit too much on his own at times and he reminded me of the one in Matrix, only that he may not have been as competent. In general, that huge company was pretty foolish and incompetent really for making it to number 2 in the world. So yeah, the film may have its flaws, but I still think it is closer to a ****/***** than to a **/*****. There is some great charm, many great video game and film references and all this makes it a really enjoyable watch. Maybe it is more the attention to detail and all these references than the core plot that eventually define it, but it doesn't matter anyway, because there is no way I won't give this a thumbs-down and I am genuinely curious where it can make an impact come next awards season. A must-see for all nerds who also enjoyed the likes of Scott Pilgrim etc. I very much recommend checking out Ready Player One and if Spielberg decides one day to make a sequel, then I will probably watch it too hoping it can keep the quality from this one here. I think it's possible as Spielberg is really prolific right now, even if admittedly it felt a bit different to see him make a film like this with how much he focused on politics films recently. That's all now. Why are you still reading? Go watch the film."

Not only does The Shining NOT have anything to do with 80's culture, and is NOT featured prominently in the book like ""War Games"" and other 80's movies, it also has NOTHING to do with Gaming.
 
And content from an old R-Rated horror movie about mentally ill murderers has NO place in a PG-13 rated movie about video games which is attracting as many kids as adults.<br/><br/>EPIC FAIL Spielberg.

This movie is definitely one of those that defines the beginning of a new era in combining CG with human cast. 
This movie exemplifies SS still has the ""Midas touch""!"

","Well, here's the first ever Steven Spielberg movie i didnt like. Actually its also the first one I pretty much hated. Besides some interesting futuristic concepts and visuals, this movie makes no real effort to be believable whatsoever. It also feels like the writers didnt have a good understanding of videogames or virtual reality. I honestly would've thought this movie was written by a 14 year old. If you're willing to suspend your disbelief the the absolute max, wait till this goes on netflix. Otherwise save your money, it's just not worth it."

","When I saw the promo material for this, I immediately thought it was going to be a nerdfest with all of these Spielberg things thrown in my face the whole movie; thankfully, I was very wrong. While it does have tons of pop culture and video game references, they're more to the point that they're just there and you have to find them yourself, outside of the bigger ones like Kong, the DeLorean, Chucky, and The Shining. It's visually stunning, the CGI was done perfectly. It was surprisingly pretty funny, there were a couple of moments where the entire theater just busted out laughing. I didn't think the character buildup was equal between the main characters though. While Sam/Artemis got a ton of buildup, Parzival/Wade really didn't get much buildup, and neither did the antagonist, Nolan Sorrento. However, that could've been by choice to let the viewers determine why Wade and Sorrento really wanted to control the Oasis. I really didn't like the ending that much, the entire film is built on this idea of experiencing life through VR/AR, but after Wade, who spent days upon days in the Oasis, wins the challenge, he shuts the Oasis down on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I found that to be kinda hypocritical. Another thing I wasn't too fond of was how The Shining and race challenges were so much better than the final videogame challenge. If these challenges were going to be this awesome, I would've preferred maybe a whole film dedicated to each challenge; if not, then at least make the final challenge better like a boss fight or something. All in all though, the good outweighed the bad by a lot. I'll definitely be getting this one on blue ray so I can go through and see all the little easter eggs throughout the film because there's tons of them throughout."

The film gives a great insight into how the human world will change as technology develops based on the book of the same name. I feel like ready player one is a memorable film which deserves more praise then it is given because it does not fall into the common movie tropes of all other films which 'have' to have a moral question behind it, where ready player one is more about escapism which I feel is the most important aspect in this film.

"noahlenzi","7","0","1","9 April 2018"," A fun time with very little under the surface.
","Very minor spoilers.
 I saw the pop-culture riddled nostalgic pornographic commercial film, Ready Player One and... it was fine. Had this not been directed by Steven Speilberg I think a lot of the magic that makes it enjoyable wouldn't be there.
 Yes, there are many times where I sighed at a poorly placed reference, some were even cringy. However, it's the more subtle references to style and nostalgic methods of storytelling that make Ready Player One decent. The only problem is that the story itself feels a bit undercooked. There is a vast world to be explored in the Oasis and the poverty-stricken, corporate-run real world. Unfortunately, we mostly get the Oasis. This subtracts from the story's heart and human connection making a few emotional moments near the end miss the mark. The world building is mediocre at best and we never get a sense of how things truly work, what we do get does suffice but it's surface level stuff.
 The final shot of this film is also a huge middle finger to the audience as it goes for the more typical boy ""gets the girl"" douche bag routine rather than focusing on their love. A scene of them dancing together in the real world for the first time (because they danced together in the game) would have been far better and it's a shame it wasn't the final shot.
 Despite the last minute and world building problems, Ready Player One is a blast and managed to make me laugh more than a few times, not at references, but at good lines the best of which are from Ben Mendelsohn as the villain. The chase scenes are also fun and the score is actually charming. It's not amazing but it's a 7/10 at best, I wouldn't watch it again all the way through because it's also a predictable movie but I'm glad I saw it."

"harmpkramer","7","0","2","8 April 2018"," Idyllic, biased towards the '80s, but still a worthy concept
","I think it is fair to say many went to see this movie because of the director. And they were not disappointed. Ready Player One is a Spielberg movie, with all that it entails. The first shot shows a landscape of piles of trailers held up by rusty scaffolding, and Wade climbing over them, peeking through windows revealing people addicted to VR. It never really presents it as dystopian. The music is upbeat pop. Not upbeat enough to seem ironic, just plainly wholesome.<br/><br/>This film plays a lot of its tropes straight. The evil drones are red, companies are bad, the Willie Wonka-like figure at the centre of it all is good. Consequences of mistakes are tame or tamely presented.<br/><br/>What this movie does surprisingly right is celebrate gamer culture. For a director born during WWII, that is a feat we should not take for granted. It is not simply a pile of references; it uses online elements like clans, avatars, combat, culture, the way they are supposed to be used in a Spielberg film.<br/><br/>Ready Player One does not go for depth everywhere it could, and the cultural references (geek trivia plays a big role in the story) have a bias towards a certain decade.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it deserves a sequel more than anything. One that explores more modern cultural elements, one that goes for a bit more depth, one that does not need to make every part of it wholesome. This is a well-constructed world; a good concept, but I think it needs more than Spielberg."

"eparazak","8","0","1","8 April 2018"," This movie speaks to the nerd in me despite the flaws that it has.
","Ready Player One is Spielberg's latest movie and (technically) his second movie of the year with his first being The Post. I've already reviewed the former, so let's tackle it.<br/><br/>This movie takes place in a dystopian future where humanity has lost all hope in restoring the world. Most of the world's population has escaped to the OASIS, a virtual world where literally anything is possible. The creator of the virtual game had died years prior and has sent out a challenge to obtain three keys in order to be crowned the successor of him.<br/><br/>As soon as the movie began to show off the OASIS, I immediately became invested. The visuals presented in the virtual world are simply stunning to look at. They play around with them quite often here, whether be with the integration of The Shining hotel or the race in the beginning. The movie delivers some very engaging action sequences. These include the racing sequence in the beginning and the large battle. As I've said, the visuals in the OASIS look very convincing and look like they actually belong in their own world. On the other hand, the dystopian future looks dystopian at first with Wade's hometown, but I feel like the movie lets go of that viewpoint once he leaves the city. Admittedly, the visuals in the real world feel bland, generally speaking. Wade's hometown looks nice, but everything outside it looks entirely generic.<br/><br/>So Parzival, Wade's username, and his best friend Aech team up with some fellow gamers such as a Twitch streamer named Art3mis and two Japanese gunters who are willing to find the three keys on their own. Along the way, they find out about an organization known as IOI. One aspect of the movie I find intriguing and substantial is the commentary of online relationships. The five of them may establish a nice connection, but they haven't seen each other in the real world. They wouldn't know if they were really predators or just innocent people. The organization IOI is, I think, supposed to symbolize strangers on the internet who act as predators, and I find this both clever and relevant in this day and age.<br/><br/>A problem that many people have with the movie is the pop culture references. The movie opens with Minecraft, there are several references to The Shining, there are classic song references and one of the characters works on an Iron Giant, and that's not scratching the surface for how many references there are. Some may see this as a bad thing because it may end up dating the movie. While this is most likely true, it really didn't bother me, since I am a bit of a movie nerd myself.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie happens to be the characters. While I find Wade/Parzival and Samantha/Art3mis to be the most developed characters, with their relationship growing overtime, all of the other characters are undeveloped, bland and plain forgettable. Even the villain feels forgettable with his reasoning for wanting the keys being generic.<br/><br/>Ready Player One may have its flaws, but it's also a movie that really speaks to the nerd in me. If you're a video game or an 80s and 90s movie nerd, you'll most likely have a fun time watching it.<br/><br/>8/10"

I really despise these movies for how boring they were.<br/><br/>Anyway, the effects and sound design in the movie were great. The actors also did a decent job portaying their characters. You could really see how the creator of the OASIS was an extremely socially awkward guy. <br/><br/>In terms of story there seem to a few elements missing regarding the background of the companies that makes it a bit hard to understand. It's never really clear who exactly runs the OASIS and what IOI actually does as a company except for these centers.<br/><br/>A bit more focus there would've helped the movie. In addition some aspects with the login and how players die and revive are a bit nonsensical.<br/><br/>Anyway I enjoyed it and had a good time. So objectively I'd give it a 6-7.

","The story is pretty easy to follow, it's noisy, it's fast, the kind of action film I like to watch. The characters are interesting and well made. Anyway, the story is not pretty straightforward, sometimes it feels like it is favoring the references it makes and not the story, but well, that kind of stuff comes directly from the original book that has the very same mistake. I like the fact that the movie keeps making fun of some of the fears that people tend to have over the internet in its early days and still today. Its comedy is easy to understand and it doesn't abuse of it.
When the film beggings, we get that the pop culture will be a common motive of this movie, starting with Van Halen's 80's hit, Jump. This motive continues over and over through the entirety of the movie, making us remember the T-Rex of Jurassic Park or the entirety of Roberts Zemeckis's ""Back to the future""
The 3D world created by the amazing VFX artist from different studios it's pretty stunning, making every frame something pretty beautiful and filled with secrets. I wonder if someday someone would go frame by frame just to get every easter egg hidden in this.
Spielberg can make us feel like we were part of this world from the very beginning, it begins with a long explanation, but we eventually feel welcomed in this world where imagination is the limit. We feel like we completely understand it, and maybe we do."

","As a movie, this is just good. The beginning captivated me instantly, being introduced to this near future depiction. About 2/3 through the movie I started to succumb to the old ""typical action movie boredom"", followed by a very Spielberg ending that had me seeing visions of Goonies. I bit corny but satisfying. <br/><br/>As a fan service and sheer visual spectacle, this movie delivers. If you grew up on video games in the last few decades you will feel right at home here. The movie actually ""gets"" the culture it serves, where so many movies either insult or just miss the mark. The fact is we have not had a mainstream movie like this just chock full of reference that shout ""this is for you, friends"". It's not shakespeare, but very satisfying nonetheless if you are among those that get it. This movie also uses many of the references effectively as comic relief.<br/><br/>Verdict: If you have ever changed out a GPU or wondered if Samus will look different on the next playthrough, go see it. If you have never turned on a PC you were not forced to, you probably will be rolling your eyes by the second hour."

","First off let me start by saying i never read the books but i intend to so you should view this review from the aspect of a movie and not judge it because i didnt read the book and i will talk more about what the movie meant rather than the movie itself. When we start the movie we are introduced with the main character and the OASIS a brainchild of so called James Halliday and his partner Ogden Morrow . Furthemore we get an explanation of what OASIS actually is and what are all the possibilites that come with it . Later on we see that the main character explains why he actually likes the OASIS more than the real world and that is because he was dealt the ""shitty cards in life"" and i think we can all actually agree on that. Gaming has never been viewed positively in the real world , where people who liked to play games all day rather than going outside were ostracized and they still are to this day , called cave trolls or other such derogative names but they failed to understand what gaming means to people or just games in general and i would like to explain what the movie actually wanted to potray . As James Halliday says in the movie that he never understood real life , that he was always better connecting with people within the online world which in a way i think we all understand . Real life is hard to live in which why often we retreat into our own world of video games. Many people fail to understand that and just say that u like playing videogames and avoiding real life responsibilities which believe me is not true. Many of us myself included function better in the online world where we feel like home , where we can express ourself and not fear being shunned upon . Who cares what people think? If you are only happy when you are online and you are gaming with your squad then i say more power to you ; that is what this movie is trying to portray. The movie is littered with easter eggs that will make any gamer happy and an easter egg from our childhood which will probably make you cry again. Those other people who think they are cool by getting drunk , getting high and going to clubs will never understand what it feels like to be part of a community bigger than yourself where each person is willing to help one another even if they get nothing from it but just a simple thank you. Do not let them take that away , do not let yourself get thinking that you are lesser just because you like playing video games more than going out or as i said previously getting drunk. You may not be popular or good looking but here in the online world you are one of us . This movie accurately describes how it feels in an online world. Definitely one to watch which will appeal more to gamers than any other group out there . 11/10.
 First to the key. First to the egg!"
"Nolg101","7","0","1","7 April 2018"," As Ohio goes, so goes the nation..
","Https://reelpopcorn.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>As Ohio goes, so goes the nation? A quotation with political implications that 
typically accompanies primary election season, but in the realm of Ready Player One, it's all about the players involved. Notably, Steven Spielberg, 3-time Oscar winner and global box office behemoth, who's movies have grossed upwards of $9.4 billion, and Ernest Cline, the first time novelist, who's book started a bidding war back in 2010. Spielberg, the movie's director is from Cincinnati, Ohio, and Cline hails from Ashland, Ohio. But, maybe more importantly the film's setting is Columbus, Ohio in the year 2045, which perhaps provide a backdrop that isn't overtly familiar to the average American, insofar as it represents a place in people's minds of Middle American tastes and cultures that differ from those of locales closer in proximity to places like New York, Los Angeles, or Boston. <br/><br/>I say all that to say that video games and video game culture create worlds on television sets and in our minds that provide a respite where many of us can and have spent hours of our lives, collecting coins, upgrading armor, slaying bosses, and whatever else that simply cannot be done in the real world. Much appreciation goes to Cline for his uncanny ability to pen a novel that touches on so many poignant moments in 1980's American culture that also connects to the modern world in what companies like Oculus are trying to do with virtual reality, to allow us to live in our video games. See Ready Player One, for its ability to bring out a lot of that nostalgia, while giving a wishful template for what modern VR headsets hope to achieve and for just being 2 hours of action, entertainment, and some laughs. <br/><br/>Criticism has been lauded on this movie, which Spielberg was keen to refer to it as at a presser at Comic Con before its release, so as not to confuse it with his more high-brow fare like The Post, Lincoln, or Bridge of Spies, for its frenetic pace and its inability to create deeper connections with the incessant pop culture references and items of nostalgia that litter the movie like confetti on stadium turf after a world champion is crowned. But, for those having read Cline's book, they understand that the best apart about the novel was the hunt... Sure there was time during the novel to sort of sit back and reminisce as to why spending hours in a local arcade playing Pac-Man or some other 80's game was formative and provided life lessons that could be reflected back on thirty years later, but the coolest thing about the book was connecting the dots of an epic scavenger hunt where the stakes were so high, especially where being successful at the hunt required having knowledge of off beat stuff from popular movies to more obscure ones. It essentially gave self-proclaimed video game nerds and fan girls an opportunity to read about it what it would be like to excel at something that the whole world saw considerable value in. <br/><br/>I was very impressed with how Spielberg and company were able to visualize this movie and bring it to life. My guess is that soooo much more than I'd expect in this movie is CGI, but it's not poorly done where it looks ""too fake"", it accompanies the actors especially well in the action scenes, particularly the opening race scene through NYC. The cast selected to play the roles was very on point with only Olivia Cooke seeming to me, to be not the most ideal pick to play Art3mis/Samantha, but they made up for this by playing up the role of Hannah John-Kamen's character, F'Nale Zandor, who pairs well with Nolan Sorrento's sinister tendencies and actions in trying to control the OASIS. Lena Waithe as Aech/Helen was a role that I was really looking forward to after I discovered that she had earned the spot, and she didn't disappoint. Although, it was disappointing that a particular story line involving her was left out of the movie. T.J. Miller as I-Rok provides a lot of high quality humor throughout the film, its a shame that they didn't give him a bit more screen time."

","Visually very attractive, with a good rythm and a well-balanced humor: classic and efficient recipe for a successful entertainment movie! Add to that a crazy load of references to videogames and SF culture, and you end with a big smile on your lips and a lighter mind.
However, this movie also follows the - too - classic rules of easy-going blockbusters: poor dialogues, clichÃ©s characters, shallow scenario. And a small abuse of the modern absurd humor which has been made so popular by The Guardians of the Galaxy. This doesn't prevent the fun of the concept, but is a strong limitation to the movie.
The idea of a world where everyone escapes to a virtual reality is quite interesting, after all why choose to live a harsh depressing real life when you can live in an intense epic virtual reality? Still, this pitch could surely have been exploited to a higher degree if the movie had any serious pretentions other than that of being fun and entertaining.
Overall a very pleasing and refreshing movie, which is better watched with a brain turned off!"

","Logan's Run by way of Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, the latest Spielberg romp takes us to 2045. Following economic hardships, the world retreats into the Oasis, a virtual world were anything is possible. The Oasis' creator, long since passed, has left behind three keys that, if found, would give the winner control of his fortune and the Oasis. So it's up to a ragtag groups of geeks to solve the puzzles before an evil corporation does.<br/><br/>Despite a 2 hour plus runtime, RPO is a lean, tight and fun ride in Spielberg's own masterful tradition. Indeed, it feels like an evolution from 2011's Tintin: Spielberg gets to play in a virtual world and do all sorts of fun thing relating to composition, take length, scene transition and the action itself. Unbound by practical limits, this means we get some dyanmic setpieces, such as a crazy race through New York, complete with Kong, a floating dance room fight and an epic siege that rivals anything from LOTR.<br/><br/>Author Cline and screenwriter Zak Penn provide a decent foundation for all the excitement, hard reverence for tradition being the name of the game here. Of course, all the references were a big selling point (and are thankfully, never as intrusive as might've been the risk), and have a rather wide gamut beyond 80sgasm, but the structure and the characters themselves are archetypical by design. Broad enough to be quickly recognisable, just detailed enough so you have some investment and thus, feel genuine tension during the action and mystery. Predictable but the context justifies it.<br/><br/>The cast work well within these archetypes, with Tye Sheridan acquiting himself well as, basically, a summation of Spielberg archetypes: a poor dreamer kid who's also a bit of wiz with tech and, despite his awkwardness, has a good heart. Ben Mendehlson is having a ball as the ultimate corporate dick, while the always reliable Mark Rylance turns in a very tender performance as the creator. In fact, his backstory ends up being the most touching stuff in the whole film.<br/><br/>While I think the term is overused, 'hella fun' is the apt descriptor. The Struzan poster should've clued you in as to how retro the film aimed to be, and how much throwback, earnest as it is, you can stomach will dictate how you take in RPO. It's not deep and doesn't offer much meaningful commentary about geek culture (though points for trying to discuss the improtance of not using escapism to live your life), but like an Atari, it just works. B-grade Spielberg for sure, but frankly, that's better than most filmmakers' A."

","Making RPO in to a movie was never an easy task. Taking over 15 hours (audiobook) of dense storyline, details and loads of 80s culture and make it a 2h movie is an impossible task. So again I applaud how Spielberg made it work.<br/><br/>The movie is more a complement to the book than an adoption, and I think that decision was really great. The overall storyline is the same with the competition, characters and main narrative. But all details on the adventures, puzzles, challenges and interaction are basicly totally different from the book.<br/><br/>So instead of saying ""oh he got that right"", or ""he got that so wrong"" or ""why wasnt THAT in"", it now stand on its own fully.<br/><br/>Looking forward to RP2 in both book, audio, movie and VR game!"

"virek213","10","0","2","6 April 2018"," Spielberg + Virtual Reality = READY PLAYER ONE
","After the huge artistic and commercial success of his 1993 Holocaust epic SCHINDLER'S LIST, director Steven Spielberg may not have totally abandoned the style of action/adventure films he had initiated back in 1981 with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, but he was determined to balance both commercial properties with riskier artistic projects, a trend that has been quite successful for him, right into the 21st century. Films like AMISTAD, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, MUNICH, BRIDGE OF SPIES, and THE POST have balanced themselves alongside more crowd-pleasing fare as THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and THE BFG. And then in 2018, he came up with his most audacious project to date, the futuristic virtual reality action/adventure opus READY PLAYER ONE.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline (he also co-wrote the screenplay, with Zach Penn), and set in the year 2045, the film stars Tye Sheridan as something of a techno-geek whose only solace from his bleak ""real world"" existence is in the futuristic virtual reality world known as The Oasis; and he is by no means alone. The Oasis is a place created by an eccentric video genius named James Halliday (Mark Rylance, who won a Best Supporting Actor in 2015 for BRIDGE OF SPIES) and another man named Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg); and just before Rylance passes away, he offers ownership of the Oasis and a mammoth sum of ""coin"" ($250 billion, to be exact) if the right contestant can find the ""Easter egg"" hidden inside the world of the Oasis. Sheridan takes up the challenge, along with Olivia Cooke, and three other players he calls the ""Hi Five"" to get the three keys that will unlock the clues that eventually lead to Rylance's quarter-trillion dollar Easter egg. But in the meantime, they must battle an underhanded corporate tycoon (Ben Mendelsohn) who is equally anxious to get his hands on that Easter egg. In between the cross-cutting from the ""real"" reality to the ""virtual"" reality, Sheridan, Cooke, and company go on a huge, visually mind-busting sequence of adventures in the Oasis relating to examples of American pop culture from the late 1970s into the 21st century, including references to KING KONG, GODZILLA, the first two BACK TO THE FUTURE films (both of which Spielberg was executive producer on), A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and, even more shockingly (not to mention amusingly), THE SHINING.<br/><br/>It has to be said that a film of this sort, being helmed even by a director known for frequent sensory impacts (including the ""Indiana Jones"" films and the first two JURASSIC PARK projects), can seem a bit much; and indeed, READY PLAYER ONE is a bit like the ultimate in sensory overload. Sound-wise, READY PLAYER ONE may very well be the loudest film Spielberg has directed since the 1979 World War II comedy ""1941"", whose loud explosions, raucous dogfights, and insane mugging by the actors totally drowned out whatever comedy Spielberg might have indeed for that film. The earlier film was also the first instance of Spielberg playing homage to himself (references to DUEL and JAWS were there in ""1941""); and apart from the occasional JURASSIC PARK and BACK TO THE FUTURE references, Spielberg stays away from those here (though Cline was known to be a huge Spielberg admirer). Instead, he chooses to highlight other aspects of 1980s culture (along with the Alan Silvestri score that sounds a fair amount like what he did for the BACK TO THE FUTURE series). The most prominent 1980s homage is to THE SHINING, notably its virtual reality recreation of that film's sinister Overlook Hotel and scenes like the horrific hag in Room 237 and the tsunami of blood.<br/><br/>Spielberg actually had READY PLAYER ONE finished in the spring of 2017, intending it for a Christmas 2017 release; but once STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI was set for release, he held off until the Easter weekend of 2018, and instead polished off (with seemingly little haste) THE POST. The re-juggling clearly didn't affect the quality of this film (or THE POST, for that matter); and while READY PLAYER ONE can be faulted at times for its emphasis on sound and spectacle (a rare thing for Spielberg, but an all-too-frequent thing for a lot of other 21st century Hollywood blockbusters), it has to be said that Sheridan and Cooke make an appealing young couple; and Rylance turns in another fine performance as the eccentric video game genius. In the end, READY PLAYER ONE is a rarity in Hollywood, in that it's a blockbuster that requires a lot of concentration. But Spielberg, it seems, wouldn't have had it any other way."

","First of all, why is there so many reviews here only complaining about the movie being very different from the book? I don't think there has ever been a movie adaptation of a book that doesn't change the source material. Even though this movie is, admittedly, one of the more different adaptations I have seen, did you guys really expect it to be exactly like the book? Anyways, Ready Player One is an experience I enjoyed immensely. It's not perfectly written, but the action, editing, and special effects make up for it's flaws. The large amount of references and in this movie work even better on the big screen than they do in a book, in my opinion. I honestly feel that most of the changes from the book were necessary to help the story translate better into a movie. Overall, this is an extremely fun movie that I definitely recommend, especially to kids at heart and fans of the book. (Well, ones that are fine with the movie being way different.)

","*This review is coming from a viewer who has not read the original book, this review is based solely on the film adaptation.*<br/><br/>At first sight, Ready Player One (RP1) might resolve as ""classic Spielberg magic"", and in many ways you'd be right. The entertainment value is undeniable. With nostalgia in full flight, RP1 is an enormous, bombastically fun pop culture extravaganza. But underneath the beauty lies a beast, a beast of often sloppy storytelling, alarming plot holes and more, leaving Ready Player One more as a one-night stand of fun than as a serious long-term lover.<br/><br/>Again, I cannot deny the simple fact that RP1 is down right fun. As long as you haven't been living under a rock for the last 40 years, there will be some sort of movie, game or musical reference to tickle your fancy even a little. Centered around the Oasis, a virtual reality video game of the future, inhabitants can imagine whatever they want inside the game, leading to an endless stream of glorious cameos from fictional characters from every facet of entertainment you could think of. The in-game setting of the film is fantastical, it's loaded with nostalgia, Easter eggs, pop culture references, etc. The atmosphere of the Oasis itself is engrossing, from the unique locations to the vastly populated worlds, it made me feel as if I was part of this massive virtual universe along with everyone else in the game. The CGI is so dynamic, I, like the characters in the film, was hooked on always being in the Oasis, it gave me a level of connection to the movie that was vital to draw me in, and the heavy, yet brilliantly creative use of the CGI did just that.<br/><br/>Where RP1 thrives most is when the story focuses itself inside the Oasis. The simple yet wondrous quest at the forefront of the Oasis makes for the best storytelling, because it's just that, simple and wondrous, like a video game of early days. It's magical, charming and ridiculously fun. Meeting new characters inside the Oasis, exploring the virtual world, it made me feel like the game and everything inside was real.<br/><br/>Now on the flip side, when the film strays away from the virtual world and cuts to the real one, things can get real ugly. Of course, I knew the entire film wasn't going to be set in the Oasis (not that I would've been opposed), as there had to be real-world implications to make the story feel more tangible. There are some interesting subliminal messages regarding the future of video gaming and social media to be thought upon, but largely the narrative direction in the real world is borderline horrible. The plot outside of the game can become so slow and boring, in contrast to the Oasis, it's like watching paint dry compared to attending a Bruce Springsteen concert. The pacing is often painful, with the second act just begging to get itself over with to get to the ""final boss"" third act (which is exhilaratingly fun). <br/><br/>The plot holes are prominent, several characters in the real world are not half as exciting as they are in-game, and it leads to distorted imbalance that distracts from RP1's true storytelling strengths. When RP1 moves away from the imaginative, simplistic narrative structure of the journey inside the Oasis, it's like an entirely different, much less original or engaging film. The story is really like 'Beauty and the Beast', the Oasis and the real world. Except here, there's no redeeming value inside the beast, it's just bland, shallow and uninteresting.<br/><br/>RP1's set of characters are much like its story, either incredibly unique and fun, or, well, not so much. On one hand, you have some great characters both inside and out of the Oasis. Lead character Wade Watts, aka Parzival, is the stand out by miles, even though his development is rushed and sometimes lackluster. Wade is the beaten down, underdog hero you can't help but root for. His out-of-game story might not be too gripping, but he's still the David versus the goliath that is ultimately heartwarming, and actor Tye Sheridan fits and plays the role splendidly. Other than, at times, Wade's main love interest Samantha, aka Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), and occasionally main antagonist Nolan Sorrento (nicely played by Ben Mendelsohn), the characters in the real world don't hold a candle to their Oasis counterparts. The virtual reality presents such a richer connection to the characters from their design to their in-game accomplishments, the supporting cast is simply 1000% cooler in the Oasis. Wade's best friend Aech, Simon Pegg's portrayal of Ogden Morrow, even the creator of the Oasis himself, James Halliday, are all more interesting, more aesthetically pleasing virtually than in real life. <br/><br/>When RP1 tries to be a character driven film, its characters ultimately suffer. Trying to give backstory to some of the supporting cast outside the Oasis seemed like a waste of time. It was necessary for the primary characters, Wade, Samantha and Halliday, but for smaller characters, it hurts the pacing and the wonder, leaving some characters much less enjoyable than others.<br/><br/>The acting itself was all around decent. I mentioned Tye Sheridan's fantastic lead performance, as well as Ben Mendelsohn's solid antagonist acting job. Veteran Mark Rylance gets a special shout out for his portrayal as Halliday and his Oasis-equal, Anorak. Rylance is charmingly awkward and lovable in the role, and uses the awkwardness to deliver funny dry humor as well. T.J. Miller is funny enough in comedic relief as I-ROk, the super awesome-looking secondary antagonist, but his character often felt miswritten to fit Miller's comedic style. Simon Pegg does well as Odgen, Halliday's partner, and Olivia Cooke is okay as Samantha. Here's an unofficial approval of acting prowess to the CGI team for bringing the likes of The Iron Giant among numerous others to life on screen, the movie wouldn't have been the same without them.<br/><br/>This is the ultimate celebration of pop culture. Yes, I can nitpick all day about structural flaws that plague good movies from being great movies, but I know at the end of the day, RP1 is supposed to be fun, and for the most part, it really is. Yes, there are major inconsistencies with engaging storytelling, proper pacing and character writing, but that's all outside of the joy that is the Oasis. Just like the game itself, it's a whole new world in there; the virtual world is bursting at the seams with ludicrously entertaining pop culture cameos and Easter eggs, vivid CGI that draws you in, and a sense of simple storytelling wonder and adventure that reminded me of my first movies and video games. Steven Spielberg might not have crafted a masterpiece that will be re-watched over and over by everyone who sees it, it's not that type of film. But at its core, Ready Player One entertained enough to put a big, nerdy, nostalgic smile on my face.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Steven Spielberg has released yet another blockbuster, Ready Player One, only a year after the Oscar-Nominated The Post. Despite the disappointing, almost repelling trailer, Ready Player One is an enjoyable, entertaining blockbuster filled with amazing action sequences, but lowly nuanced characters. The film plays on the nostalgia of the 80s generation (many Easter Eggs; Alien, Back to the Future, Akira, etc.) much like the E.T. inspired Stranger Things adding that blockbuster, superhero-virtual-reality twist to draw the younger generations. Basically, it's a film that can be enjoyed by anyone. The film is also successful in not resorting to a classic Hollywood move: recruiting pretty and handsome teenagers to fill the role, which is refreshing and pleasing to see in this generation of film. The film strays from recruiting a line-up of an all-star cast, with great performances from the leading actors. The ""star"" actors amount to only two or three: Ben Mendelsohn (who is abruptly and quickly established as the antagonist), Mark Rylance (who previously starred in Spielberg classic Bridge of Spies) and Simon Pegg. The acting is overall, pretty good, but, due to some underdeveloped (sometimes poorly developed) and stereotypical characters, the ledge to fantastic is too steep for the film to climb. The film manages to retain a level of intrigue (despite glaring similarities to The Matrix) with an incredible realism surrounding animated and CGI features, which is basically three-quarters of the film. A great follow-up to the near-classic The Post, Spielberg completely switches genres and target audiences to create another great production"

"Alexander_Blanchett","9","0","2","5 April 2018"," Blast from the Past
","Steven Spielberg is back. With a nostalgic overdose that covers pretty much everything pop culture has to offer. Especially a movie geek has his blast with it. From famous video games to classic movies, primarily from the 80s, the film is a 2,5 hour long Easter egg. I am not the biggest fan of animation/real life hybrids, especially not if it has a video game look but here it worked, mostly thanks to the many references. Especially the ""Shining"" scene was an absolute classic. I really got many shivers down my spine. A great homage from Spielberg to his late friend Stanley Kubrick. The actors were wisely chosen. Tye Sheridan was perfectly cast. He really embodied the nerd character. Olivia Cooke was also wonderful. Her shyness was extremely cute and likable. I think this was the final breakthrough for her for an interesting career. Ben Mendelsohn was all right but he can do better. He was sometimes a bit bit stereotype. A performance that positively surprised me was by Mark Rylance. Of course a fantastic actor, but the role seemed pretty mediocre but it was a great character in the end. He gave a fantastic and touching performance, despite his hair cut. Simon Pegg was also fine. The soundtrack was excellent. I missed John Wiliams but Alan Silvestri's score was also okay but had potential for improvement. A great cyber adventure with many great action scenes and choreography."

","Ready Player One knows who it's audience is from the get go. It thrives on the 80's nostalgia while using newer IP to pull in the gamers of the modern day.<br/><br/>The premise is that in the future, everyone escapes to a VR universe instead of dealing with the issues of modern life. At some point the designer of this universe (The Oasis) passes away, but not before he leaves a secret within this world. Collect 3 keys from 3 challenges and you own the Oasis and it's future.<br/><br/>The movie switches between the real world and the Oasis. The Oasis is visually stunning and filled to the brim with characters you may or may not recognize. Despite having a simple plot, the Oasis brings twists and turns. Every challenge within the Oasis are the highlights.<br/><br/>The real world scenes are significantly weaker than the Oasis. They aren't terrible, but some glaring issues knock the score down. Character deaths happen and then feel forgotten straight after, the romance subplot isn't developed and really doesn't flow. <br/><br/>The issues are minor with this movie, it's a blast. It's a great movie with a killer soundtrack that knows how to balance almost all of the players has it within."

","Ready Player One.<br/><br/>The trailers for this movie did just enough to tantalise without giving too much away.
Ready Player One is a visual feast that is chock full of pop culture references. 70's 80's and 90's nostalgia is rife through out.
Director Steven Spielberg had huge success during these times and his love and affection for the 80's in particular is all too apparent.
Ready Player One is based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline and tells the story of Wade. An ordinary kid living in desperate times where the only solace is to escape to the Oasis.
The Oasis is a virtual world where with the help of a VR headset anymore can become anybody.
This magical world is up for grabs as the deceased creator Halliday (played with relish by Mark Rylance) has hidden a special Easter egg that will grant the finder ownership and control over the whole virtual universe.
Just as software and technology companies battle for superiority in our real world, they do also here.
As corporate baddy Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn)will stop at nothing to get the easter egg first. <br/><br/>There's much joy to be had in seeing fond childhood heroes and villains all blended together with famous vehicles and nostalgic scenes of movies gone by.
The opening chase sequence is jaw droppingly good, done to perfection like only Steven Spielberg can.
I constantly found myself with mouth agape transported back to my childhood.
The worlds greatest movie director has done it again.
It would be criminal of me to give anything away. Just go observe on the biggest IMAX 3D screen you can find and be prepared to lose your sh*t!
Anyone who grew up in the 80's will be blown away by this and the many references and revisits to beloved movies and characters of the past.<br/><br/>Performances by all are superb.
Tye Sheridan is typical Spielberg movie youth hero.
Ben Mendelsohn is proving to be the go to man if you want the best villain in the business.
I didn't think he could top his turn as nasty Imperial leader Orson Krennic from Rogue One but he does here.<br/><br/>Special effects are mind bending.
Sound is mind blowing and
the musical score hits all the right emotions.
This movie is a cinematic masterpiece but I feel just like many a true legend it may not get the recognition it deserves.
For those born and raised during the eras this film reflects on you're all going to have a blast.
For those who were to young or simply not around at the time many references will be wasted.
A good example is with The Shining, one of the worlds most famous horror movies. If you haven't seen it a large portion of this movie will be lost on you.
As for the rest of you, you're in for a real treat.
A treat that may bring back childhood nightmares, but a treat nonetheless.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is a return to form for Steven Spielberg. Not that he lost any form in the first place. More of the fact that this movie sees him doing the sort of awe inspiring cinema that made him famous throughout the 70's and 80's."
"rayhuang-34082","10","0","3","5 April 2018"," best movie I had ever seen in my life so far
","Let's face it: you come to a movie to get entertained. You don't come to try and make sure there is ""proper"" character development, or that there is a ""proper"" romance-- you simply want to have a great time. And when I came to watch this movie, I left feeling like I had just spent two hours on an amazing roller coaster; this was the first movie I felt like was worth every penny I spent on the movie ticket.<br/><br/>Because when you watch this on the big screen, it just absolutely blows your mind, with all the thrilling CGI, the characters and games from your childhood, the badass villains, the ingenius humor, the amazing lesson it teaches at the end, everything (except the subpar acting-- it could be a little bit better, but hey, most of the movie is spent in an alternate reality anyways).<br/><br/>I am going to admit-- I am usually someone with pretty high movie standards, but this was the first movie I actually spent the money to go watch at the movie theater more than once. It is absolutely amazing when you watch this on the big screen, and I still even find myself wanting to watch the movie again while writing this review because the characters and the plot are just so addictive.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that I had never read the book, I came to the movie expecting a drag (my family had to pull me in to watch this), and to be honest, I thought the trailers sucked. So the movie went way way beyond my expectations. <br/><br/>Let me parse a little bit about why this movie was so good (without spoiling too much). <br/><br/>First off, the premise of the movie of getting the three keys already pulled me in right from the start-- I mean, in a world where almost anything can happen, the possibilities of the challenges are endless. And, surprisingly, at a time where so many movies often start out great but fail to sustain the thrill later, Spielberg absolutely nailed it. The plot for the first challenge both visually and mentally amazed me (I was smiling and laughing the entire time while watching it). The second challenge was some of the most irresistible humor I had ever seen in a movie in a long time. And the third challenge-- let's just say it was a face-off between awesome characters that brought a wave of nostalgia and chills in my back. <br/><br/>Second off, the characters, especially the villains, were just so plain awesome that sometimes I'd find myself wanting to watch the movie again just so I can see their scenes. There are two main villains in this movie-- one who is some maniacal CEO, and the other who is some online gun-for-hire. The CEO was awesome-- he had the perfect avatar that represented his power, greed, and reputation. But the bounty hunter, my gosh, he was spot-on-perfect, stealing every scene he was in hands down. I am just going to say he was a combination of total badass and subservient humor-- the perfect villain. <br/><br/>Third off, the lesson in this movie can be absolutely touching, especially if you are someone who is very ambitious and working-your-ass-off toward goals all the time. I am not going to spoil it, but let's just say that I left the movie with a changed perspective and attitude on life (assuming you interpret it the same way I did)."
"hudoleyalexxx","10","0","2","5 April 2018"," Real or virtual that is the question

","I for one hadn´t read the book before watching the film a few days ago. Heck, I didn´t even know there was a book that the film is based on. And as all the infuriated folks here state it´s just based on a book, the basic idea is the same but it´s not even trying to be accurate, they are not even trying to advertise it as something related to a book. That said I´m glad I didn´t have any former knowledge of the plot and universe before entering the cinema; it seemed like a cool videogame-film and that it certainly was.<br/><br/>I was surprised that it happened mostly in the virtual world but I´m glad it did and that I saw it in 3D, a format that I usually despise a bit because the studios force it on every film. Visually it was really pleasing and an immersive experience. Sure the plot has minor gaps and the characters don´t develop that much during the story but I feel like it´s not that much about individuals rather than how different people come together in an online community. As a gamer and a citizen of the interwebs I can relate to the characters well and the whole story is an interesting ironic perspective to where the society may be heading to.<br/><br/>There´s a lot of pop-culture references that work well in the video format, some they could explain but I think that would work better in the book. Now that I´ve seen it I feel like I should read it as well, but still think of them as two different works of art as they are different medias."

","I was a little disappointed by the simplicity of the story. I wasn't exactly expecting a very complicated plot, but I was hoping for a less Hollywood-like story and more originality, as the concept of the movie itself is pretty refreshing. And why does there always need to be a cliché love story?
There were also a few attempts at humour, but in my opinion they fell flat and felt forced. Didn't get a giggle out of me once.<br/><br/>However, the movie does looks fantastic. The racing scene and the zombies in the part from The Shining are probably my favourite bits. 
The music is pretty cool, I enjoyed the 80s retro vibe in the futuristic dystopia.
The acting is decent but not noteworthy, especially seeing as a large part of the movie is computer-generated.
Of course, as a huge fan of video game culture, I appreciated the many references. You can spend a long time attempting to spot all of them!<br/><br/>Though I was kind of hoping for more, overall this movie is worth the watch. The pretty action scenes (almost) make you forget about the predictable story."
"michaeledward1212","5","0","1","5 April 2018"," A Love Letter To Pop Culture Best Left Unread
","Pop culture, like fashion tends to move in cycles. There are many cycles operating concurrently, but the thirty year cycle is one of the most well known. With the John Hughes inspired Love, Simon to the popularity of Stranger Things, current pop culture is harkening back to everything 80s. So to enlist Spielberg's help in bringing to life this movie makes sense, but Ready Player One seems more interested in dredging up nostalgia and pop culture trivia than actually telling a compelling story.<br/><br/>While reading through other reviews I spotted even more pop culture references that they caught that I happened to miss. The movie is so chock full of references and mentions of pop culture that if you were to remove even half of them the movie would probably be the equivalent of a short film. 80s nostalgia was ever present, but Ready Player One was ready to throw everything and the kitchen sink at you to try and pander to every possible demographic. From gamers to movie lovers to music aficionados.<br/><br/>Speaking of music, Ready Player One falls into the modern trap of using popular and well placed music to try and make up for a complete lack of character depth. It's quite like Suicide Squad in that way. I think Hollywood has recently been able to find ways to trick audiences into thinking a movie was actually worth it by using the soundtrack and visuals to make up for a lacking of everything else. Not only were musicians and songs mentioned, but so many obvious and outdated song choices were used. <br/><br/>I find it hard to believe that people living in the near future will have encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture that is already considered dated by many. If most 18 year olds now don't recognize 80s nostalgia, why would a gaggle of 18 year olds thirty years from now be so tuned in? Ever since Juno came out, filmmakers have really tried to turn teenagers into mini-adults who are inexplicably wise beyond their years, and it's become one of my biggest pet peeves. Stop. Just stop. <br/><br/>Not only were pop culture references and obvious song choices crammed in at every opportunity, but the movie itself feels bloated, never choosing an aesthetic of its own and just taking elements of superior films, like The Shining to mimic well. If the best part of your movie is a recreation of another movie, it's probably a bad sign. Not only was the plot underdeveloped, but it was ironically and simultaneously too busy. There were too many characters to focus on, and as a consequence they are caricatures. Everything, even down to the frames of the film itself are busy as can be. <br/><br/>In her series on YouTube discussing the Transformers series, Lindsay Ellis talks about why it's so hard to remember what happens in these Michael Bay movies, and it boils down to poor editing and emphasizing everything in the films to the point where the viewer is expected to pay attention to every scene as if it's super important. Ready Player One suffers from this, so many scenes are demanding your attention that by the time you get to the climax of the movie you're spent and unable to pay attention to what's going on, having just spent the last hour and a half noticing every inane detail. <br/><br/>Some details are amusing at first, but it felt insulting after the 277292723rd pop culture reference was thrown into the already jumbled mix. Ready Player One isn't a joyless movie, but it is an exhausting one. Fans of pop culture might appreciate this movie, but it's better to steer clear and just stick to the original incarnations, as Ready Player One will probably only be liked for its association to better things. After halfway through, I felt as though I'd been stuck on a rollercoaster that was at first fun, but I wanted to get off."

I wish they showed more of Halliday's partner in the movie (I forgot his name) and his impact to the story. But they cleared it up as best as they could in the end. The only major difference I noticed from the books were the challenges were different for each key besides the last one. They were all still entertaining and I think it was good they changed it because the ones in the book were short if I remember correctly. <br/><br/>This is the best movie I have seen in a while, since The Shape of Water and it you have any kids or are a slight video game/ 80s nerd, go see it."

Acting, characters and story are forgettable - overall, they lack that characteristic Steven Spielberg charm. I didn't get drawn into the movie, didn't feel as the part of the adventure. <br/><br/>Of course, there is some romance, but it's been done rather superficially, not surprisingly since there lacks the character development. It seems to me that story writers couldn't figure out which characters to put emphasis on and develop more fully since OASIS and real world are on screen alternately.

"bowmanblue","8","0","2","4 April 2018"," A future family favourite
","Growing up in the eighties, there were plenty of movies which I watched with my friends and an assortment of parents. These began at the cinema and gradually found their way to the small screen where we continued to enjoy them on those lazy Sunday afternoons we all had during our childhoods. Now, several years later we look back on those films with a sense of nostalgia. Now we can see they're not perfect, but we love them anyway.<br/><br/>'Ready Player One' is like that and, perhaps more importantly, will be like that. As an adult, I can say that it's far from a perfect film, but there are undoubtedly millions of youngsters all over the world who would disagree with me and tell you that it's the best film ever made. And it probably is to them. To me, it's a fun little outing that I enjoyed, despite its flaws.<br/><br/>Stephen Spielberg is possibly also enjoying this resurgence of nostalgia, as he seems to have gone back to his hey-day and given us a family-friendly adventure-romp with a more modern day spin. It's set in a broken world where the population practically lives in a virtual reality-style world called 'The Oasis.' It's basically like the internet meets VR. However, one large corporation wants total dominance over this cyber world and will stop at nothing to achieve this. Lucky we have some plucky youngsters on hand to thwart these terrible 'suits.'<br/><br/>The VR world naturally lends itself to some fantastic visuals and, for once, it's impossible to complain about the overuse of computer-effects because 75% of the movie is set inside a computer simulation. The youth of today will enjoy watching their peers 'stick it to the man,' but there's also plenty of things to enjoy for us 'oldies.' This film possibly contains the most 'pop culture' references from yesteryear since that episode of South Park called 'Imaginationland.' You can't go more than thirty seconds without spotting a reference to things you loved from the seventies, eighties and nineties. <br/><br/>The young cast do well. Sometimes, when a film rests heavily on inexperienced actors' shoulders, it can sometimes fail, but I didn't find any of them annoying. The only flaw I really saw was that it's a bit drawn out in some places. I would have cut about ten minutes out of the middle section and then massively edited the ending by about fifteen minutes (it's one of those films that has - what you think is - an ending, only for it to start up again. And again).<br/><br/>But that's a minor gripe. I will be buying it on DVD and doing my best to spot yet even more references to my childhood (watch various YouTube videos to find out the full list of everything in there), but I may skip the odd chapter here and there - especially towards the end!)"
"zdfranz","6","0","2","4 April 2018"," Lacks the magic of Spielberg's past blockbusters.
","""I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread."" Those words come courtesy of Bilbo (Ian Holm) in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. But they also illustrate perfectly why Ready Player One, while fun in parts and an overall success, doesn't quite capture the magic of its director's past blockbusters.<br/><br/>That director is Stephen Spielberg, an ideal choice to spearhead a film celebrating every dimension and detail of late-twentieth-century pop culture. Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Back to the Future, Jurassic Park-these are just a few of the properties he has brought to the big screen. If each of them could look in from the past to see this newest creation, what would they say? <br/><br/>One thing is undeniable: Ready Player One, whether the movie or Ernest Cline's bestselling novel on which it is based, stands as one of the most original entertainment entities of the new millennium. Its story occurs in the year 2045, with society having taken a less-than-utopian turn. Consequently, nearly everyone spends their time plugged into a virtual world known as the OASIS. Money, friends, fame, love-anything worth experiencing happens in there. Reality is for losers.<br/><br/>Especially considering that the game's original designer, James Halliday (a brilliant Mark Rylance), planted a special egg deep within its digital walls. The first 'player' to find the egg gets half a trillion dollars and total control of the OASIS (which, essentially, amounts to world domination). The catch? The path to the egg consists exclusively of contests, quizzes and other tricky breadcrumbs based on Halliday's love for 80's movies, music and video games. Know the founder and you'll find the finish line.<br/><br/>This is exactly what teenager Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) intends to do. Thanks to his obsessive knowledge of Halliday, he (and thus, his OASIS avatar Parzival) have a great chance to succeed. He's also got a best friend (Aech), a new girl (Art3mis) and an arch nemesis (Nolan Sorrento, head of IOI, the sinister real-world corporation that also wants control of the OASIS).<br/><br/>This is the short version, and still a lot to unpack. I don't want to be 'that guy,' but I did read the book before I saw the movie. For anyone else in the same boat, it should be noted that the movie departs from its source material on several fronts.<br/><br/>Many adjustments are necessary and simply based on the medium. An early scene from the book involving a video game competition becomes a massive, exhilarating car race in the movie. The latter, of course, is much more suited to a visual experience, and the production's willingness to adapt should be applauded. Nor are the changes pure sacrilege, as Cline co-wrote the script. Each alteration echoes the author.<br/><br/>But it also takes us back to Bilbo. For it's not just that a novel contains so much more information than a movie; it's that this particular novel is all about the information, the details. Ready Player One has characters, and a story, but cares more than anything about minutiae-the tidbits of cultural knowledge that only geeks and fanboys would know.<br/><br/>The movie's intentions to highlight this are valiant, but misguided. Yes, we see the Iron Giant battle Mechagodzilla; we feel the eeriness of the Overlook Hotel; we hear the retro beats of Jump and We're Not Gonna Take It. But we don't fully experience any of them. There are just too many. The movie spends all its time simply reaching these coveted niches, there's none left to actually enjoy the visit.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean, of course, that the journey can't be fun. For starters, Ready Player One might feature the most impressive use of CGI since Avatar. This is a movie that literally could not have been made twenty years ago. The story itself is well-paced, with likeable characters speeding through a fresh world of surprise and discovery.<br/><br/>If you view the film as a series of nostalgic moments-Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Atari, The Millennium Falcon-it's hard to be disappointed. But if you're looking for those moments to add up to something-to become more than the sum of vintage parts-then you may have to resort to reading.<br/><br/>There's a scene near the end of the film between two characters in a bedroom. It's simple, quiet; it breathes, it takes its time. Through the silence, and a touch of wonder, it leads us to emotion. Almost without knowing it, we feel like a kid again.<br/><br/>I think this is the movie Spielberg really wanted to make. Sometimes the flash and bang and noise detract from the real entertainment. Here, it's the wonder of new worlds, and new friends. More than anything, that is the soul of Ready Player One."
"belleabu","9","0","1","4 April 2018"," It's not the book, but it's great none the less
","Only read about half of the book, it was great for 80's nostalgia, but couldn't finish. I was excited to see the movie since the premise was interesting and the trailer had me interested. 
The book to movie may not satisfy those who loved the book, but that aside, it was a great movie. Lots of action, humor and the 80's. If you are to compare to the book, then yeah, it's missing things. That doesn't take away from the movie though 
This kind of reminded me of Willy Wonka. Especially the end. The main character and his depressing Home life, wanting better things. What better way then to pursue the possibility of owning a trillion dollar business ?<br/><br/>Bottom line.....Great visuals, likeable characters, thrills, laughs and a great film on the big screen."

"scottfairbairn-77501","7","0","1","3 April 2018"," Generally enjoyable, but not if you are a hardcore book fan
","I found the movie to be a mixed bag. I went to see it with five people. Two, including myself, are big fans of the book, and three others who had not read the book. The movie deviates substantially from the book, reminiscent of ""I, Robot"" with Will Smith and it's lack of connection to Isaac Asimov's books. In other words, they kept the broad brush strokes the same but changed everything else. To be fair, a book to movie conversion is tough at any time, but the two of us that had read the book thought the movie was a bit juvenile and silly. One of our five liked it, and the other two weren't impressed. I feel I'm being generous giving it a seven out of ten.
The movie was very ""Speilberg-ish"" in feel, lots of bad guys chasing innocent kids, some comic relief, over the top chases and so on. Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento didn't work for me. As a bad guy, he seemed to much like the bumbling bad guy from a kids movie that we've seen so much of before. The romance seemed rushed and unrealistic. 
The Oasis didn't work for me, and the overall impression is of an attempt to check off as many familiar boxes from the book as possible, but in the process, messing up the flow of the story.
It would make a decent movie to watch on Netflix, but that's it."
"letsjet-08266","10","0","2","3 April 2018"," Watch it. In IMAX 3D if possible
","At SXSW, Spielberg quoted, ""It's not a film, it's a movie.""
Yep. He's right. 
These are movies: Jaws, Raiders, E.T., Jurassic Park, Star Wars, Kill Bill, Black Panther
These are films: The Bicycle Theif, Sand and Fog, Shindler's List and Moonlight are films. Does that example help you at all?
It's light, it's refreshing, it's heroic, you learn about who the characters are and you root for them. It's a great popcorn movie. Heck, this is a fantastic movie. 
Also, IMAX 3D is integrated into this movie almost as much as it was in Gravity. It should still be eye popping amazing on a 3D 75"" QLED 4KHDR home theater, but probably non so visually amazing just good streaming on your phone. Would Jurassic Park have been visually amazing seeing it for the first time on your phone?
Also, it should hold up bc the cg is by no means supposed to be photorealistic.

"mt-95256","8","0","2","3 April 2018"," Ready Player One - everything you could ever want from Spielberg and more!
","TL;DR<br/><br/><ul><li>A different sort of videogame movie - about videogames and not based on a specific one</li><li>Fun MacGuffins</li><li>Tons of videogame and film pop culture references, making it so much fun to watch</li><li>Brilliantly original and immersive world</li><li>Beautiful and stunning CGI</li><li>Electric and adrenaline-fuelled action - improved with references</li><li>Characters unlikely to become iconic, but still very likeable</li></ul><br/><br/>There's no way around it - Ready Player One is definitely a videogame movie; a dedicated one at that... but not in the way you might think. While most 'videogame movies' are merely adaptations of existing videogames (eg. Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Doom) and mostly totally rubbish (the recent Tomb Raider aside). However, there's a smaller, less appreciated genre of videogame movies that are wildly different, in that they are instead about videogames, not based on any ones in particular, allowing for a lot more freedom; incredibly these films are often well-received and liked (something that can't be said for the Mario film). There aren't many but the few that are around have seen packed audiences and positive reviews from critics - there's Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Disney's brilliant Wreck-It Ralph and even Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, which certainly got more favourable reviews than any Resident Evil film. Now there's a new one, and Ready Player One might be the best yet. Steven Spielberg returns to fine form with an immediate classic - a more traditional story that's still utterly modern, a fun rollercoaster ride from start to finish and an absolute joyful masterpiece with references that will make repeat viewings a delight.<br/><br/>The story isn't too dissimilar to other Spielberg adventure flick Indiana Jones, a shameless MacGuffin-led adventure, with clues and hidden meanings to the next piece of the puzzle with fights peppered throughout. As I've said before, this is my personal favourite genre and it fits very well within this film. All the trials/ games to find the keys are distinct and unique, each as exciting and action-packed as the other, crammed with film and videogame references.<br/><br/>In fact it's these references to film and videogame pop culture over the past 40 years or so peppered throughout the film left, right and centre that make up its personality and makes it so much fun to watch. There are almost an endless number of references, though you can't fail to wish maybe there were a few more nods to other popular games - Pokemon, Zelda, even Skyrim. Regardless of how legally challenging it would be to allow these in the film, there are so many references in general that you don't really need any more, otherwise it would veer close to being too saturated and gimmicky. Instead the film is brimming with enjoyable references (Back to the Future, Overwatch, Terminator, Iron Giant, Mario, Goldeneye, Halo to name but a few off the top of my head), enough to be fun, funny and to seem real - because let's face it, if the OASIS existed we would cram it full of references to everything under the sun. It's all blended beautifully and seamlessly with the orignal world Spielberg has created with Ernest Cline, author of the novel.<br/><br/>More than just being a load of fun, the references enrich the otherwise incredible and electric action scenes, making them varied, fun and terrifically unique. Take the final battle: in no other film could you have the protagonist firing laser blasters from a Back to the Future-styled Delorean, throwing a bloodthirsty Chucky doll into a battlefield, one side being an army led by those Halo guys and Tracer from Overwatch while Iron Giant is battling it out with mecha-Godzilla. That's just a drop in the ocean for a film like this, with such glorious action filmed only in the way a master filmmaker like Spielberg can. Even the backdrop to the action is incredible, with so much detail and still being well animated. In fact, the work that has gone into the CGI has to be applauded as it's omnipresent and is used very well, completely immersing us into an incredible world.<br/><br/>On the other hand, though, there are no characters as iconic as, say, Indiana Jones. Whilst the designs of each avatar are brilliant, well-animated and varied, they're no match for a man with a hat and trusty whip. Still, these aren't dull characters; there's an eclectic group of great characters that are a blast to spend the runtime with. Ben Mendelsohn plays the traditional Spielberg-esque antagonist Nolan Sorrento, in a great performance oozing with villainy and malevolence. At first Mark Rylance seems rather bored with his part as OASIS creator Halliday, but when we get to know the character we can see that it was an understated, well-played part, perfectly showing us a man with limitless imagination who struggled to connect with the real world. The central duo, Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke, are strong and consistently likable, able to engage the audience both as themselves and as their avatars, with Lena Waithe being an easily amiable side-kick. Simon Pegg was underused though and it's a shame that not enough characterisation and screentime was given to the rest of the High-Five, namely Sho and Daito who remain rather unimportant characters that seem to be there just to bulk up the group.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg gives us an electric, exicting and visually stunning glimpse into the near future, breathing fresh life into videogame movies and Macguffin movies. This is Spielberg going back to doing the type of films we love him for - old-school Spielberg doing a modern film, with non-stop action, fun and an exhaustive list of pop culture references that means we can watch it several times and always see something new. Ready Player One is a fantastic blockbuster that's sure to blow you away. Ready Player One? More like Ready Player FIVE (stars)!"
"zarl-15496","8","0","2","3 April 2018"," Not the best Spielberg movie, but certainly worth your money.
","Like any movie based on a book, it leaves a few things out from it's source material. But that is to be expected as some things that are pictured in a book are not able to be portrayed in a movie. The story is a bit lacking with the cliche bad guy who wants everything for himself, but I could easily ignore it because, DAMN, The visuals are absolutely stunning! This is definitely one of the best looking movies of this year. I'd hate to say that this movie is nothing but eye-candy but it is. I was so distracted with the visuals that it took my attention away from the story. The movie is a treasure trove of pop-culture references which I found (for the most part) to be very charming. If I was still a teenager I would eat this movie up, but i'm not. Most people will notice the lack-luster story, but the visuals provide the movie with a charm that you wont find anywhere else. Overall, this is worth your money and a watch, definitely watching this again."

The acting was average and agree with the cast as there was not too many well known actors. The cgi was great and the plot was quite strong as well. A lot of comedy that isn't thrown down your throat like most films in cinemas you see today."
"jtindahouse","8","0","2","3 April 2018"," The Da Vinci Code using pop-culture
","I love pop-culture references. One of my favourite television shows 'Family Guy' is riddled with them and I love each and every one. I didn't have a lot of buzz or excitement going into 'Ready Player One' (I wasn't even intending to see it in theatres but found myself with an opportunity to do so and decided to take it). I'm not a massive sci-fi fan and the nearly 2 and half hour run time had put me off. I have to say though I ended up having a pretty bloody good time.<br/><br/>I would describe the film as a futuristic 'The Da Vinci Code' only using pop-culture instead of ancient history for the clues. Sound fun? Yeah, it does to me too when I put it like that. The film is certainly at its strongest when it's trying to be a puzzle, and at its weakest when its trying to be an action movie. That was the only real downside of the movie for me was that the third quarter fell into a bit of a trap of forgetting to be fun and became a little tedious. <br/><br/>It's a great looking film though from start to finish. There are some really fun scenes too, where if you've seen the film in question you'll likely have the time of your life. It's a pretty damn fun ride for the most part and a film I can see most people thoroughly enjoying."

","Where do I even start with this visually stunning film? Spielberg once again proves his worth as one of the true heavyweights of film making.<br/><br/>Set in the future, a virtual world known as OASIS has a fierce competition running to see who can find the easter egg hidden which was left behind by the worlds creator, James Halliday. Anyone interested in taking on this challenge first needs to find three keys which themselves are hidden and can only be found by uncovering the riddles left by Halliday.<br/><br/>The main enemies are a company called I.o.I which I'm guessing is a reference to Laugh out Loud? This company has thousands of people employed in the quest to try and figure out the riddles and get the Easter egg for their greedy CEO.<br/><br/>It's a relatively straight forward plot that's done up like a dogs dinner with a plethora of truly amazing visuals, references to just about anything pop culture/video game themed and fast paced action scenes (the car race towards the beginning of the film is PURE EPIC!).<br/><br/>I can't comment at all on the book as I haven't read it, but from what I've heard it's fairly different to the movie, which doesn't at all surprise me considering how different Spielberg made Jurassic Park to it's respective novel.<br/><br/>Without rambling too much, Ready Player One is visually a treat for the eyeballs and anyone who's a gamer will enjoy this movie. It's a film that really throws a tribute out to the gaming industry giving a thanks for helping us escape reality when we need it the most.

","A year ago, a work colleague suggested a book to me that he had been reading, saying I would love it. As a fan of gaming and movies, he said he know that I would be a big fan of the book. And I was. Ernest Cline's pop culture reference compendium is a phenomenal read, touching on many historical moments from my childhood and being a real nostagia trip.<br/><br/>Around the time of reading it, the movie was announced. This spurred me on even more. As news began to break that Spielberg was attached, a director whose work was referenced in the book so much, it was clear that this was going to be a movie I was fully looking forward to experiencing.<br/><br/>I call it ""experiencing"" based on the fact that it is exactly how you go into a film like Ready Player One. You engulf yourself in the world, much like the characters do when they step into the Oasis themselves.<br/><br/>Quick plot overview...in the future, literally everyone plays in The Oasis, an online world where you can be whatever and whoever you want to be. You can do things you cannot do in the normal world and everyone plays. Its not a fad, it's basically a second life that everyone leads. When the creator of the Oasis, James Halliday, dies, and announces that he has hidden an easter egg in the game and the first person to find it inherits his wealth and control of the Oasis, there's a mad scramble to find it. But no-one has....for years. The leaderboard has remained blank. Then comes Wade Watts, a guy who lives in the Stacks (basically a trailer park) who has dedicated his life to finding the first key. Naturally he does and the adventure begins.<br/><br/>The film is a sensory and nostalgia overload. It's epic and it's not ashamed to drop references to literally anything and everything. So much money must've been ploughed into the cost of buying licenses for showing things in the film.<br/><br/>The CG within the Oasis is quite literally the best CG that has ever been produced. Spielberg has really gone to town and created an amazing world.<br/><br/>There's camoes galore. You will literally sit there pointing out everything you spot and know. ""Oh look, it's King Kong...Hello Kitty....Sonic....THE DELOREAN!""<br/><br/>The adventure is fun and engaging. It's not the most amazing script in the world, but the film is truly phenomenal. There has been a lot of changes from the book, mainly how the keys are obtained, but they needed to upgrade some of the things to make them more exciting in a movie, and for that I completely forgive the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Go see it in the Cinema....it's the only way to fully appreciate this film...IMAX if possible<br/><br/>Rating 10/10"

","I have not read the book and came into this movie with minimal expectations, except that i usually love Spielberg movies (i love Jaws, Close Encounters, the 1st 3 indiana jones films, Hook, and ET). This movies falls into the category of entertaining Spielberg films such as Crystal Skull, War of the Worlds, and A.I. but still not one I would bother watching again. Visually fantastic but the story leaves something to be desired. I felt no connection with any of the characters."
"homdeb1058","5","0","2","2 April 2018"," I Was Warned
","Yes, I read the reviews saying, if you read the book don't go see the movie. But I've been waiting for this movie for 6 years--I had to go see it. And yes I found it disappointing. They changed the story a lot. They left out a lot of the actual challenges that it took to find and win a key. They eliminated a good bit of the clever maneuvering it took to outwit the evil corporate bullies. They ignored most of the nostalgia that made the book so charming. (Yes I owned an Atari 2600, a Commodore computer, and played the arcade games and pinball machines). The question that always bothers me is: if someone wrote a book that, out of thousands published, had just the right ingredients to be a best seller--why would you take the risk of changing it? What difference will it make to the people who haven't read it? None. what difference will it make to the millions of people who read and fell in love with the book, a lot. Where I would have probably gone back and seen the movie 2 or 3 times in the theater in both standard and 3D, I won't waste my time and money now. Where I would have bought the movie on DVD or Bluray to have and to keep, I won't do that either. (I may rent it eventually just to confirm it really was as disappointing as it felt in the theater). Where I would have given it a high rating and written a positive review and urged people to go see it--I won't. If millions of book fans feel the same way that's potentially a lot of lost revenue. Of course if the movie makes a decent amount of money, it will still be a win for the director and the studio regardless of what it could have been. The book fans are the people who promoted this story to level of being movie worthy. Too bad we got crapped on."
"DeBBss","9","0","2","2 April 2018"," Steven Spielberg Never Fails To Surprise...
","Ready Player One is based off the book the book, Ready Player One (2011), which I have never read (So pretty much that means I liked the movie, and I did). I was so glad that Steven Spielberg directed Ready Player One, because he has a reputation of turning books into movies (Jurassic Park). I instantly knew it was going to have the same style that Steven Spielberg is known for, just from the opening scene. For me, the best part of the movie was the references and the OASIS itself. You could spend hours trying to find all the references and Easter Eggs in Ready Player One. In my opinion, the OASIS was felt like a real video game world, like a sandbox/open world. Ready Player One gets a lot of things right, but the main issues I have is the villain and the comedy. The villain is pretty much every stereotype put all into one character and the jokes weren't that funny, but everything else was good.<br/><br/>Story: 10/10<br/><br/>I was surprised that I don't have any issues with the story. I was expecting some pacing issues, due to how long the movie is. The idea that there are three keys and whoever collects all the keys first, wins the contest and gets to control the OASIS. Everyone is looking for the three keys, even major companies, such as IOI. At first I thought it was silly that companies would go so far as kidnapping and murdering people just to win a contest in a video game, but then I released that it's a company, and companies will do anything for more money. The theme that the players have to fight back the companies from ruining good games is actually very realistic, and it's happening even now. The plot was entertaining, and I never lost focus on the story, I was always interested on how the players would find the next key. There was a few subplots that felt boring, but it never affected the overall story. I also liked how if IOI won the contest, not only the players would be affected, but the future of humanity, because of how much the OASIS impacts peoples' lives. Overall, the story was entertaining and it kept me interested the whole way through.<br/><br/>Characters: 8/10<br/><br/>Although Wade Watts is a relatable and overall a good protagonist, there's still some issues, like the antagonist (Sorrento) and supporting cast. The supporting cast had little to offer in the beginning, only in the climax they played a role. The supporting cast also had way too little screen time, even for supporting characters. The antagonist is very bland, and he fits all the stereotypes. The antagonists' motives are believable, but that's the only good part about that character. The love story between Wade (Parzival) and Samantha (Art3mis) felt a bit rushed, like when Wade said he loved her so early in the movie, it was cringeworthy, but it did show how bad he was with woman. Some comedic characters, like I-R0k (T.J. Miller) was unfunny, he maybe got two laughs from ten jokes. The main characters were good though, they were interesting and relatable. Overall, the main characters were good, but the antagonist and the supporting cast were bland.<br/><br/>Action: 10/10<br/><br/>Some people complained that there was too much CGI, but I think it was necessary, because it is a video game, and most of the time the movie is in the OASIS. There was so much action especially at the beginning and at the climax. The climax had to be the most epic part about the movie, there was so action and pop culture references. The climax reminded me of the final battle in Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, with so much mayhem going on. One of my favorite scenes is when the players go into The Shining, and they pretty much remake the most iconic scenes in horror. One thing I want to point out is how they used Chucky as a weapon in the climax, I think it was creative. The comedy was on the weaker side, with only a few jokes landing. Overall, the action was entertaining and creative, but the comedy felt awkward.<br/><br/>Overall, Ready Player One was a superb movie, with only the characters and the comedy be on the weaker side. I've always appreciated Steven Spielberg's work, and now I appreciate it even more, because of how much hard work and dedication it took to make this movie. I know Ready Player One is going to get hated on because it wasn't exactly like the book, but even if I did read the book, it still wouldn't change my mind. I think I've spent my money perfectly on watching this movie, and I think everyone should get a chance to watch Ready Player One, because of how much this movie relates to every different type of audience."

I couldn't have loved the movie more. To my point of where I said I refused to leave my seat, i meant that, for I had to use the restroom a 1/4 way through the movie. I held it through the end because I didn't want to miss a single second of it.<br/><br/>The movie it self is so filled with Easter eggs from games now and past as well as pop culture, that i found it ironic that I saw the film on Easter Sunday.<br/><br/>The visuals were beyond words, the music and sound track were spectacular and the actors fit their rolls perfectly. I was amazed by the well mixture of Action, Adventure and slight Romance of the characters. <br/><br/>I high recommend this movie to every one, except for those who don't like video games. So with that I say GAME ON!"
"danieldickson-13217","7","0","1","2 April 2018"," Visually stunning. Fun Story. Lacks emotion
","First off, I read the book, so I was highly anticipating this to be an amazing movie. And with high expectations it's always easier to become a bit more critical. But rather than just complain that the book was better, I have a few suggestions of what could have bumped my rating up from a 7 to an 8 or 9.<br/><br/>Suggestion #1: Turn the music volume up!<br/><br/>The music in this movie was too quiet. They included some great 80s Hits, but I felt like they were drowned out by the random sounds that accompanied the CGI throughout the movie. I wish they would have blasted that music louder so you can actually get a little more pumped up during that final battle.<br/><br/>Suggestion #2: Sloooow it down just a bit<br/><br/>I felt like parts of the movie were rushed too much. Aside from the music, I think movie watchers want to soak in all the various characters from pop culture and video games that are referenced and used as avatars in the Oasis. But they pan over them so quickly that you can miss them if you so much as blink. And I recognize they were trying to fit a whole (alternate) story in a 2 hour time frame, but scenes that could've built up a bit more emotion felt rushed and forced. <br/><br/>Suggestion #3: Better explanation of the Oasis octants<br/><br/>One thing I will specifically say the book does a much better job at is explaining the universe of the Oasis. I recognize a movie always has less explanations than any book. But I wish they would've explained the whole octants system a little more in depth. Like how some places your avatar would be in danger of ""zero-ing out"" while others you were safe from any kind of attack. Again, I know that takes some of the precious 2-hour time, but making a universe more understandable in a movie also makes it more believable and appreciated.<br/><br/>Okay, now putting my 3 critiques aside, there were plenty of things I still loved about this movie. The different take with I-R0k was one of my favorite changes they made in the movie. He was a very much needed comic relief. The CGI was incredible and I'm so glad they didn't jump back and forth too much between the VR world and the real world (like they did in Assassin's Creed with the animus.. don't even get me started on that movie...). Even though they changed the story almost completely I thought it was mostly necessary since time is precious. I liked the new role Og took as the curator. And I'm glad they kept the message of the movie the same, encouraging people to enjoy technologies such as VR in a good fun way, but to above all else value real life and the relationships with those around us. All in all, I enjoyed the movie and will see it again."
"RforFilm","8","0","1","2 April 2018"," Ready Player One is a high score. A fun video game adventure that will satisfy gamers, movie fanatics, and those looking for an escape
","Why do we love video games? They have gone from an electronic novelty to multi-million dollar industries that practically have the same clout as major movie studios. And yet, what are we really doing? Some might say were sitting in front of screens doing nothing but playing with meaningless games. People who make that analogy are probably not the target audience for video games. Guys like myself who do play, play for a variety of reasons; to relax, to be entertained, but more importantly, to feel like we can escape. Whether your gunning down aliens in Halo, jumping pipes in Super Mario Bros. or eating pellets in Pac-Man, video games have given people the ability to feel like their taken to another world.<br/><br/>As technology has gotten better, virtual reality or VR gaming has gained popularity. I haven't had much experience with it, but I'm blown away with how much more it can transport those people into the games. Today's movie is all about VR technology at it's grandest. It's also about capable it is at creating anything they want for people to experience. So I guess if you wanted to be a Ghostbuster or play 8 bit golf, you could. It's all possible in Ready Player One. <br/><br/>In 2045, society is at an economic low as many people are forced to live in slum-living spaces, like the Stacks, an area where many RVs are stacked on top of each other. To curb life's disappointments, many people log into the Oasis, a giant VR experience created by James Halliday (played by Mark Rylance) where they can engage to play games, educate themselves, and even work. Because of what's offered to gamers, Halliday's death is seen as a loss to the tech industry. Regardless, the Oasis is seen as an amazing thing. <br/><br/>For the past five years, players of the Oasis have been a part of a quest that Halliday had set up after his death, in which whoever can find three hidden keys in the Oasis will acquire a golden egg, plus total control of the Oasis. Young Wade Watts (played by Tye Sheridan) has been playing, studying all the potential clues, hoping his avatar Parzival can be the one to win. He manages to get the first key, making him an instant celebrity. While he's working with Art3mis (played by Olivia Cooke) and Aech, he's also being followed by Nolan Sorrento (played by Ben Mendelsohn), the CEO of another company, IOI, who also wants to win to acquire the Oasis.<br/><br/>The big concern that most people had with Ready Player One was that it was going to rely too much on references to eighties nostalgia. Thanks to the direction by Steven Spielberg, he balances out the heavy references with fun adventure. Based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline (who also wrote the script), the movie keeps it's reference-heavy scenario, but tries it's hardest to be sure it never overshadows the overall character development. <br/><br/>The good news is that despite having mostly unknowns, the casting works out good. Both Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke make for likable leads. Though I put a lot of question of whether they really resemble gamers, their personalities made them work just enough. Honestly, the real stars were the side characters. Ben Mendelsohn makes for a fun villain as a corporate suit who is only interested in the money with little care about gamers. Mark Rylance gives the best performance as the quiet VR founder who carries a lot of pressure for a guy who dislikes his own creation and even what it's brought to the world. <br/><br/>Now for the overall story and plot, there were things improved on from the book and elements I think could have used more thought. While I won't say how he wins the race for the first key, I find it hard to believe that it would have taken gamers five years to try it. But there is a film recreation done for the second key that makes for a fascinating visual effect that I'm still trying to figure out if it was real or digitally recreated. While every part of the journey doesn't make a ton of sense (half the time when they were chased by IOI, I kept wondering why they didn't just remove the VR goggles and respawn elsewhere), the overall journey makes this for a fun movie just to be entertained by.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight eight-bit keys out of ten. I can definitely say I had fun seeing a lot of characters from Street Fighter, Iron Giant, Batman, The Shining, Mobile Suit Gundum, Sonic the Hedgehog, Back to the Future, King Kong, and much more all being thrown into a VR experience that I'm honestly glad doesn't exist in the real world. This is Steven Spielberg giving us an adventure film that will probably entertain most people (he had already done his Oscar bait movie The Post last year). If the references in the previews bothered you, you'll probably not like this. But for everyone else, this is one of the nerdiest movies made...and I mean that in a good way. Log in and see this this Easter Egg hunt is worth following."

The special effects are fantastic for the most part, and I would by this film just to look for the Easter eggs.<br/><br/>But, if I had to nitpick the writing can be a bit off sometimes.

"theriverspirit","7","0","1","2 April 2018"," A Fun Spectacle
","Let me get this out of the way first: the movie truly is nothing like the book. If you are looking for a scene-for-scene adaptation, you will not get it. HOWEVER, that does not immediately mean this movie is bad. <br/><br/>I loved the book. I found it incredibly enjoyable, smart, and a combination of all the things I love in fiction. But I knew, the moment I saw this movie announced, that there was no way they were going to make a faithful adaptation. I decided then that my expectation would be: please be a fun movie, don't get too serious, just make it entertaining. The book will always exist and it will always have those emotional moments I love, so if a movie exists too, all I want is a fun spectacle that translates the visuals of the oasis and the idea of this incredible VR system. <br/><br/>That is exactly what I got. Is it a perfect movie? Hell no. <br/><br/>There are many plotholes, the characters are not 3 dimensional, there are conveniences that drive the plot and some will definitely find the references to be pandering instead of entertaining.<br/><br/>Despite all of these flaws, I immensely enjoyed the movie. It was light hearted in the characters interactions and its tone was goofy enough that I knew we weren't meant to take it seriously. It knew that it could not involve a lot of the drama and details from the book, and so it focused on entertaining it's audience with visuals, action and references. I thought the look of the oasis the and real world was perfect. There were a few shots where the action made me think of a video game trailer, and considering most of the movie is set in a video game, I thought that was quite clever.<br/><br/>All in all, not a perfect movie, lacking in some important aspects, but if you want a fun visual feast with some clever moments and entertaining references, you will get it here. <br/><br/><br/><br/>P.S. To those who were devastated that it was not like the book, I'm not really sure what you expected. Much of the book is them playing the games and figuring out the puzzles...how entertaining would a movie be if it showed characters standing and playing Joust?<br/><br/>The aspects I can agree disappointed me were the change of the characters locations for convenience, some dumbing down for Hollywood, and yes, not seeing some of my favorite scenes on screen. What we all need to realize is that this is a big budget Hollywood movie directed by Steven Spielberg...it isn't going to be a deep film about the impact of technology on the lives of people or how a death affects and drives a character... when you have a book like this, Hollywood is going to want to dumb it down a bit and focus on making the audience happy with action. That's just how it works. I'm sorry if you were disappointed...but movie adaptations very rarely capture what the book is about. Let's just hope some people end up reading the book as a result of this movie."

","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Ready Player One. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of video games most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Parzival's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from the video game series Final Fantasy, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Ready Player One truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Parzival's existencial catchphrase ""You're full of shit"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Activision's video game epic Call Of Duty. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Steven Spielberg's genius unfolds itself on their theater screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Ready Player One tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

","Ready Player One takes place in a world where everyone is so absorbed in technology that they pay no attention to the real world. In other words, it takes place in 2018. Steven Spielberg brings the novel of the same title by Ernest Cline to the big screen, and, from the looks of the trailers, I didn't know exactly how this could be adapted effectively. I never read the book, but the trailers looked so wild and zany that it seemed almost impossible for anyone to pull it off. The only thing that made me think Ready Player One could work was that it was being directed by Spielberg, arguably the greatest director working today. But still, I was apprehensive. I have since learned never to doubt the holy master Steven Spielberg. He turns in a magnificent film, one that balances the style perfectly with the substance. Sure, it's big and flashy with tons of CGI, but it also has a lot to say about where we are heading as a species and how we are losing our ability to connect with each other. It's a profound film that puts to rest any doubts anyone may have had that Spielberg no longer has it; he most certainly does..."

There is a rebel faction, but we will never know anything about it, except the girl is part of it. Members? Goals? Anything? We did not even know what they are up against.

The hunt for the EASTER EGG started like 7 years ago and not even a single key has found. Now all of them found within a week. The conditions did not change for this period.
And what do you think what is the first thought of main character when his last relative killed? ""Maybe i should kiss a girl i never met before, only her avatar.
SPOILER section end:<br/><br/>This film is perfect for one time movie event, but 5 years later nobody will talk about it. This film is far what we call ""classic""."
"WiseMMO","10","0","1","1 April 2018"," A landmark
","I could feel a sweet taste in my mouth coming out from the cinema after Ready Player One knowing I'd be coming straight back here, my very own ""Oasis"", to write this very review about a movie that I hope will be a landmark for all the other people, who like me live in a world where ""pop culture"" isn't just a part of history, but it's a part of real life... or simply IS real life.<br/><br/>Ready Player One isn't a movie for everyone. It's a gem that is only to be understood by the people who it is made for. A hymn bellowing aloud to every single person who struggles in life. <br/><br/>The misunderstood, the shunned... people who don't know what place they have on this earth, people who don't know how to start living, people who hide and those who create an invisible shell around themselves separating them from everyone else... people like me... the internet people.<br/><br/>Those of us that live in a world where comic books aren't just ""books with figures for kids"", where videogames aren't just brainwashing violence, where movies matter and they have to be talked about, where the line between fantasy and what is real and tangible is so thin, that it enables us to expand our minds and so deeply changing every single one of us: the way we talk, the way we look, the way we think, how we interact, how we live!<br/><br/>Those are the people Ready Player One was made for. Me and you reading this.
This is for US.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for those who cannot possibly feel the relevance this movie has. Who did not understand any of the references, the little things this movie was brought up upon, the lingo the characters use, the way they are portraited the way in which it takes them a blink of an eye to feel like family, to trust one another completely and depend on each other, the need they have to feel included and not eclipsed by society.<br/><br/>There is only sadness in that, at least for me writing this, I could not live a life without this, it would be colorless.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is an amalgamation of pop culture concentrated in 2 hours and 20 minutes in the form of a videogame where everything your imagination wants is right in front of you.<br/><br/>The characters will fight against an ""EvilCorp"" to take control of ""Oasis"" the virtual reality that is the pinnacle of society's future by racing to find the ultimate ""Easter egg"" and ensure the community is safe from exploitation by greedy goblins that do not want you to install ""AdBlock"" as a mod.<br/><br/>The movie struggles to have a very clear line between real and virtual because of the consistent switches between CGI and ""regular"" film, this up until the very end where it finds balance and leaves the viewer, who understands what is going on, with a message that to me is most important in all that happens: take a break from the internet.<br/><br/>I shouldn't need to say this - but render unto Caesar the quality of CGI is out the roof, everything is super-detailed and the animations are PHENOMENAL, which is on-par with the few real-life choreographies that are featured in some of the switches between real and virtual that I mentioned earlier. The colors are so vivid and perfectly placed some of the scenes are dreamy and give a sense of everlasting life to what is happening which further thins the line between you - the viewer and it - the picture.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a master at giving life to what could very well look bland and lifeless and for that, I shall thank him till the day I die.
It's always a pleasure to see Easter eggs and references inside movies, like we're used to with the MCU, but I daresay this one is an entire different level. <br/><br/>Let me explain to you why: Everything you see, from the WIRED magazine, to the ""Twitch"" streaming mention, to the DeLorean to the Iron Giant, Tracer, Halo, Gears of War and also all the Back to the Future tingling sounds that warm my heart, these aren't just references or Easter eggs, and this is why this movie it SO GOOD, they ARE the movie!<br/><br/>It's just a facet of our life that is there to remind ourselves that, however sci-fi the movie might look like, if you think deep enough it's actually a mirror of everyday life (if you're a nerd, like me).<br/><br/>The story itself isn't too shallow or a Denis Villeneuve mindfuck, it's a simple low and high climax with a big reveal and a moral story, so it's a textbook good story... but it is the way it was shaped to enclose everything that just shoots at your brain so seamlessly that makes it even better.<br/><br/>Besides my personal opinion, I think the cast overall was just spot on. I don't think I can contribute objectively on this subject, for this particular work.<br/><br/>I rarely enjoy Ben Mendelsohn, especially as a bad guy.<br/><br/>What I can say is that I loved the perpetuating and profusing synergy between Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke. I LOVED how bad-ass Lena Waithe looked OOC and how massive her character looked in-game which also showed some soft spots which gave it more depth. <br/><br/>Win Morisaki did one thing near the end of the movie that I won't spoil but I screamed the name of that thing in the room and everybody was both pissed and annoyed by me (Don't regret it)<br/><br/>In general, I just loved the crew altogether, bit of a weak villain but honestly, it's not that bad, it's really hard giving dignity to someone who you know is going to lose anyway, unless you are Andrew Kevin Walker and like messing up everyone's mind.<br/><br/>To end this review I would like to say I almost cried in 10 scenes purely by nerd-gasm, I definitely cried when Win Morisaki did that thing that I cannot speak of without spoiling, with the big purple sword and that bang-bang-bang-bang and those tin-tin-tin from Back to the Future and also all the brum-brum-brum, also cried on the dance swooshy-swoosh scene where they - and so I kept crying and I had to hold my breath when she did that thing with the bike that they mentioned and that was my big ""whoa"" and then the movie ended and they said that thing and I was like ""fuck that I don't take days off I gotta learn RS6 Siege"".<br/><br/>Peace."

"Ricki101","8","0","1","1 April 2018"," Fun, Fast and Exceeds expectations
","A solid movie with great paced storytelling. The visual effects are brilliant, as is the soundtrack. <br/><br/>There are reviews that will give you an idea of the plot a lot better then I can so I wont go there. <br/><br/>If you are hoping the movie will be an exact retelling of the book you will be disappointed. While the movie takes its idea from the book it changes just about everything else about it. This however doesn't detract from the story itself and gives fans of the book a quest with different challenges to go on with Wade and his friends.<br/><br/>I loved geeking out with all the nostalgic references and cannot wait to get this on home release so I can go frame by frame to pick up all the hidden ""easter eggs"". 
No spoilers but i was so excited watching the Shining scene, <br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is that there are references to the book that are never set up but just seem to come out of nowhere. An example is at the end where they out of nowhere start referring to them as the high 5 yet not once up until this point had that name ever been applied to them in fact the leaderboard is hardly ever even shown let alone focusing on who the top 5 ranked players are. As well a throw away reference to Ludo which played a major role in the book.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have been against this being a 2 or even 3 movie series so that the Oasis and the egg hunt could have been expanded upon further as well as building up the friendships between the main group rather then having them already know each other. <br/><br/>Overall this movie is a must watch and if you can get over the differences to the book i'm sure this will end up holding a place in your heart like so many of the pop culture items it nods to."
"Alanjackd","8","0","3","1 April 2018"," WOW
","Reading many reviews some say it's not as good as the book... the book is a completely different form of a story and the two should never be put up against each other.
it's actually a masterpiece of film making for 3 reasons.
1. It's filmed perfectly and uses every single use of a camera and CGI you could imagine. Saw this at the O2 Superscreen in London and it is a visually perfect experience.<br/><br/>2. Direction..Spielberg suspends belief and throws common sense out of the window and wants us all to go along with the flow. Look at his past movies...Sharks...Poltergeists..Dinosaurs..Russian Spies..Aliens...Nazis...he likes to tell stories..and there is nobody better at it.
3. It reaches all ages..,.something for everybody..<br/><br/>Stop reading silly comments and get your popcorn and drink and just enjoy a stunning two odd hours of pure joy in a modern day classic.<br/><br/>Also ..for all the people who prefer the book..I would say this...if you don't like what he's done....get a couple of million dollars and do better...or stop whingeing!!!"
"QuentinBurnham","9","0","2","1 April 2018"," Best Videogame Movie That's Not Based On Videogame
","I would have never thought, Spielberg would be able to bring us something like this. A movie brought to us by one of the biggest movie geeks there's ever existed and if that wasn't enough, it's a movie based on a book literally drowning in 80s Popculture. Simply put, Heaven for geeks. All that aside, even people with no interest in 80s Popculture whatsoever, will enjoy this movie. I can assure you of that.<br/><br/>As a person who read the book, I was more than skeptical about the story and it's flow, but Spielberg showed me, I was worried over nothing. When you start listening to songs like Blue Monday '88 by New Order or We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister, you know there is something done right. And a soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is on a whole new level. All those classical tunes reminding you of times when films like Goonies, E.T. and Star Wars were booming.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna compare the book with the movie, because that would take me whole centuries, but i will say one thing. It's totally different from the book which is great. Some aspects of a storyline were kept for the sake of a structure of this movie, but a lot of things changed, so in a way, Steven kept me wondering, what's gonna happen next. In other words, if you read the book and you keep wondering whether you will or will not see this movie, then go see it. You might not be overwhelmed by its quality, but you will apreciate the different take on the story.<br/><br/>Film is 140 minutes long, but the pacing was great. It's not dragging, just keeping it's pace and because of that, Ready Player One doesn't have any boring parts. Action scenes are simply amazing and a big impact on that, have the unbelievable visuals with tons and tons of easter eggs. Those kept you focused all the time and you just don't want to miss any of your favourite character fighting in the background or simply chilling by the bar.<br/><br/>Of course, Ready Player One contains some negative aspects as well. And the biggest one of them all is shallow characters(including Big Bad, in this case - Nolan Sorrento played by Ben Mendelsohn). You might find this quite vital for the escalation of film, but at the same time i have to say that Steven has done everything he could've done when it comes to characters. They might be shallow, but one thing that connects them all, is 80s popculture. And whole movie is based on that, so that's why i don't think of it as such a big negative aspect. Otherwise, movie has some minor negative aspects.<br/><br/>Maybe this film deserves only 7 or 8 out of 10, but if you liked everything i just wrote, then you can't rate it lower then 9. If there will be one movie for which Spielberg will be remembered even by new generations, then it will be definitely Ready Player One."

","I'm not going to spoil anything here, because this film needs to be seen to be enjoyed. This harkens back to the days where a Spielberg film was full of magic and could move you and your inner child, instead of bore you for three hours with a dark period piece where there isn't a happy ending in sight. Sure, it's pure pop escapism, much like The Oasis of the film is, but people need that kind of escape these days from the gruesome reality of the world we live in. So, for two hours and 20 minutes, go escape into a beautifully crafted dream alive on the silver screen, preferably in IMAX 3D if you really want to lose yourself."
"Tkbn3812","9","0","2","1 April 2018"," Spielberg does it again; Great Story, Great Characters, AMAZING visuals!
","Ready Player One is one of those movies you just HAVE to see in cinemas. Seriously, you will honestly regret not seeing it on the big screen when you watch it on your TV or computer at home. It is just such a VISUAL masterpiece!<br/><br/>That's not to mention how much fun it is. I mean it, Ready Player One is just such a fun ride with a great story. It's not the most original movie ever made, sure; actually, it's kinda similar to Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. But still, even if for some reason you think this movie isn't that original that doesn't undermine it. Do remember that it's made by Spielberg, one of the BEST directors in history. <br/><br/>The story is pretty simple. Wade Watts, known as Parzival in the Virtual Reality platform known as Oasis, is competing against the rest of the world for three keys that will guarantee him or the winner ownership of the entirety of the Oasis. It's a mad dash for those keys, and an endless amount of wealth for whoever makes it there first.<br/><br/>This movie actually has a simple yet great, wholesome story and message. As always Spielberg has given us a really fun movie while still giving us a meaningful plot with meaningful characters. It even has some pretty decent twists here and there (just wait till you learn the identity of all of Parzival's friends in the Oasis!). I found a bit of the middle to be a little messy, but that's not too big a deal. And, fine, I think the characters could have been developed just a touch more...but that's forgivable.<br/><br/>I've heard one person say this movie looks really cliched...well, I guess maybe it is, but not anymore than any other action movie; they're all predictable to some extent these days. That doesn't change how much fun they are. And, unlike many action movies, this one has a pretty well-crafted story and AMAZING VISUALS.<br/><br/>Seriously, as I already said, you will REGRET not watching this in cinemas. It is actually such an amazing movie visually. I honestly spent the entire movie wondering how Spielberg and the crew actually managed to make the movie look so beautiful. How did they film this beast? There's this one huge battle scene in the movie that made me just want to smile, it was just so epic.<br/><br/>That's the thing, Ready Player One was just one of those movies that made me wanna smile, all the way till I left the theatre. Okay, it's not the best movie I've ever watched, not even close, but I still really enjoyed it and I think watching it in cinemas helped with that (definitely wouldn't have felt like smiling if I'd been at home). It has so many epic moments that give you a rush, it's just such a great movie that Spielberg can add to his still-growing collections of classics.<br/><br/>Okay firstly, I'm kinda young so I don't get most of the 80s references in the movie, so that element of the film is completely lost on me. Secondly, I've read that this movie isn't quite like the book; whether that's a good thing or bad thing I don't know, because I haven't actually read it...usually amongst the book fans, it's bad. I will say this though; I've only watched one movie that I feel accurately reflects the book- The Fault In Our Stars - and even that wasn't perfect. If you watch Ready Player One having read the book and get annoyed that it's not like the book or what you wanted, just don't be surprised.<br/><br/>Basically, all I'm trying to say is that Ready Player One is a visually amazing and fun movie. We don't get action movies that are this visually amazing too often, and it's not going to be in cinemas forever, so don't miss it! Spielberg gives us, as always, a really wholesome plot with great characters, on top of some of the best visuals I've seen in a movie in a long time. Do yourself a favour this week and go watch this in cinemas. You. Will. Not. Regret. It."
"neilpaul","7","0","1","1 April 2018"," RPO is a love letter to pop culture
","Having grown up in the 80's/90's my brother and I really enjoyed the pop culture references in this film. They were funny, cool and well used. They made the film fun.<br/><br/>The thing that didn't quite work for me is that you had all these young kids referencing 80's stuff. The film is set in the 2040's and it seems weird that the young people would know about The Breakfast Club or Back to the Future. It suggests they've had no pop culture of their own to look back on which is unbelievable.<br/><br/>If the film had centred around older characters, the 80's references would have made more sense. I know Halliday was old enough to have lived and played in the 80's and it's not out the question that kids in 2044 would want to enjoy the same things he did to a point. It's just hard to accept that so many young people would be living in a past that didn't belong to them.<br/><br/>With that being said, RPO is still an enjoyable movie with interesting, if not fully developed characters with a great sense of adventure. It's no Tron by any means and does not have the same magic of that world. The special effects are good and the soundtrack is ok but not memorable.<br/><br/>RPO does not feel like a Spielberg film. He's done a good job with adapting the story for the big screen. I can't help but feel another director such as Joseph Kosinski would have done a lot more with the material.<br/><br/>I watched the film in IMAX 3D and compared to Tron Legacy, the 3D conversion was a great disappointment and a missed opportunity. The Oasis would have looked great in stunning 3D.<br/><br/>Overall RPO is a good film with great nostalgia but it won't be regarded as classic Spielberg in the future."

","Ready Player One was simply a fun time. The story held enough weight to give the movie some substance, but wasn't too complicated and didn't seem overly ambitious.<br/><br/>The visuals were stunning! Spielberg didn't get carried away with the special effects but rather used them with ingenuity and finesse. This combined with the close up, twist-and-turn camera work made the movie fun and exciting visual experience.<br/><br/>The movie started loosing its way for me towards the third act. The moral of the story could've been used in a clever way to twist the ending, but instead it was a cliché climax and just as cliché of a wrap up. I also think that the runtime of 2 hours and 20 minutes could be shortened. <br/><br/>Despite the complaints just mentioned and some minor annoyance with the unnecessary exposition, this was my most enjoyable trip to the cinema in a while!"

"Donatien3","9","0","3","1 April 2018"," Nostalgic fun
","""Ready Player One"" is probably the most derivative movie of 2018...and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Echoing director Steven Spielberg's 1980s peak, RPO piles on the nostalgia, with the sci-fi flim chock full of video game, movie, music (an exclusively 80s soundtrack) and general pop culture references, from Atari and John Hughes to Halo and modern-day MMORPGs.<br/><br/>The story is relatively simple: in the 2040s, America is a wasteland, with its citizens spending most of their time escaping to the virtual reality world OASIS. There's an amusing difference between the action of OASIS and watching players - in the real world - pretending to fight while wearing virtual reality headsets. The avatar of creator James Halliday starts a competition - collect three keys to earn the OASIS Easter Egg, with the IOI (Innovative Online Industries) corporation the main villains.<br/><br/>The genius of RPO is the relatively no-name cast (aside from Ben Mendelson, Simon Pegg and ""Deadpool's"" T.J. Miller) meaning the action takes precedence without the distraction of a big name actor, Spielberg's name alone does enough to generate interest. The references range from fleeting to important (the old Atari games have a vital role in the film's final act) without reaching ""Family Guy"" levels of self-indulgence. The highlight is a sequence based on ""The Shining"" movie, with a replica of the film's Overlook Hotel.<br/><br/>Fans of pop culture, Spielberg and fun actions films will love ""Ready Player One""."

"cruise01","8","0","2","1 April 2018"," A great visually exciting ride that will connect audiences with some nostalgia feeling from a classic pop culture.
","Ready Player One (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Ready Player One is a visually stunning science fiction film that pays homage to the 1980s classic games and media and has plenty of easter eggs that fans will pick up on. It is an exciting thrill ride from beginning to end. I never read the novel but know it's a story concept that reference a lot of classic games and movies. <br/><br/>The plot takes place in 2045, were every one escapes the real world to go into a virtual reality known as Oasis. They can do endless possibilities, play for money, meet people, and explore a bigger world. Wade (Tye Sheridan) is trying to find three keys that are hidden in the Oasis. That is left behind from James Halliday (Mark Rylance) the creator of Oasis. And his passing, he decides to hide three keys. And the player that finds all three keys can find the hidden easter egg that will be worth trillions and inherit on being in charge of Oasis. Wade discovers a clue by learning from Halliday's past. And will need the help from his friends Artemis (Olivia Cooke) and Aech (Lena Waithe). Before an evil organization led by Nolan (Ben Mendelsohn) and his army of players try to find the egg first. <br/><br/>The pros about the film?<br/><br/>There is a lot to love about the movie. First, the visual effects are amazing. When Wade enters Oasis and seeing an ever-changing landscape. Lots of characters and colorful costume design. There are a lot of characters that you may notice from other movies and games. And it was a fun surprise to see them show up. Like the already shown in the trailer with the iron giant. The movie spends ¾ of its time in the Oasis. So there is endless entertainment that will keep your eyes engaged to the screen. From the exciting race sequence that had cars being smashed by a dino or Kong. To a stunning club setting were characters can leap into an air dance battle. And a fun sequence involving a classic Stephen king movie which is best to see for yourself when characters are placed in that setting. Also, the climatic battle was epic and fun when two giant characters battle it out. <br/><br/>The concept and story was fun. Sure, Ernest Cline must have been a fan of the old school games, music, and movies. And wanted to bring it back to revive those era. Especially, when Wade wishes he was back in the 1980s were the pop culture was more noticed then. <br/><br/>Tye Sheridan was great. Olivia Cooke was good as well. Ben Mendelsohn plays the cliché villain who is a businessman that makes his agenda so obvious about ruining the pop culture for his own profit. T.J. Miller plays the villains soldier for hire in the Oasis which he throws in a humor to lighten the mood. Mark Rylance was fantastic playing the awkward James Halliday. <br/><br/>This is one of Steven Spielbergs better movies. It is overbearing with beautiful visual effects but it did not let the story fall in the shadows. The music soundtrack was also good too from Van Halen, Tears for Fears, Blondie, ect. So much more.<br/><br/>The cons of the film?<br/><br/>Every thing was so fun and great about the movie. I feel like Steven Spielberg played it too safe from going all out. I was hoping for more of an exciting intro like Tron Legacy. And a better music score. Alan Silvestri score seemed a little similar to his other movies like The Avengers, Beowulf, ect. I feel like it would be better fit with a electronic techno score like Junkie XL, Daft Punk, M83. Otherwise, the soundtrack was a fun playlist that worked with the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Ready Player One is a good film. Plot was fun and neat with a good theme. The visual effects and action was plenty throughout. The cast was good. Steven Spielberg did good with delivering a visually exciting ride with many references that audience can try to pick up from. <br/><br/>I recommend seeing this film in the biggest screen in theatres. Definitely worth the price of admission. If you are a fan of the book or enjoy the 1980s pop culture. There is plenty to enjoy from it."
"gamecocky324","7","0","2","1 April 2018"," Spielberg at his finest, what could've been though.
","This movie is a visual and soundtrack masterpiece, that I thought was beautifully written for screen. The changes from the book to the film had to take place, I get it, but this could've been a cult classic. Why on earth was this not stretched out? Parzival finding the first key, boom movie 1. Parzival finds 2nd key, boom movie 2. Parzival then finds 3rd key and Halladay's egg, bam movie 3. What could've been the new age type Trilogy was just left there, flapping in the wind."
"fanpuck33","9","0","2","1 April 2018"," A Fun Ride
","If you are expecting this movie to be exactly like the book, then you haven't been paying attention to the trailers. The very existence of the car racing scene should have been enough to prepare you for major changes. In order to follow the novel completely, they would have needed a trilogy or maybe even a mini-series. In addition, much of the novel takes place inside Wade's own thoughts, which was never going to translate into a good movie. <br/><br/>So if you go into it knowing to expect a whole new adventure, then it is hard to not enjoy this movie. It is full of fun references, both obvious and fleeting that will require many re-watches to catch (and the ability to pause once it is released for home viewing!). The same summary can be used for the novel and this movie, but we are given a whole new adventure to enjoy. I found this refreshing, as it gave us a whole new set of challenges for the High Five to overcome.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie does not have as much depth as the novel, but what adaptation does? The important thing is that they did not lose the fun nor the heart of the novel. So many adaptations don't feel anything like the source material, but this movie certainly does."

However, after having seen the movie, I'll admit to my wrong skepticism. Ready Player One is an extremely well-made film that entertains from start to finish.
The film follows Wade Watts in the year 2045, when the world has gone to hell and everyone is glued to a virtual reality system called The Oasis. When the founder of The Oasis dies, Wade goes on an adventure to find a hidden easter egg that would give him control over the system and half a trillion dollars.
Ready Player One is a technical masterpiece. The special effects can only be compared to those of Avatar (2009), where nearly the entire film is made up of CGI. Ready Player One embraces the future, setting the bar for what cinema can do and where it might go in the future. It is refreshing to see a film such as this that continues to take risks and come through successful. Spielberg perfectly combines his old-school filmmaking techniques with breathtaking new technology, producing such an enjoyable watching experience.
The characters, for the most part, are all very well written and done. The romance between Wade and a girl inside The Oasis was very rushed and given no time, but that was my only main complaint with them. All the actors did a fantastic job, especially Ben Mendelsohn, who portrays the corporate baddie looking for ultimate Oasis control. Mendelsohn relishes his role as the bad guy, taking inspiration from his previous evil persona in Rogue One (2016) and delivering something truly memorable.
My only flaws with the film were story related, as the script seemed to move super fast towards the beginning without much structure, relying heavily on expositional narration for nearly 15 minutes. The third act, while containing much nostalgia and being visually spectacular, dragged on far too long and ended up feeling kind of bloated. It is a longer movie, clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes, and I began feeling the runtime towards the last few sequences. 
Despite it's few flaws, Ready Player One is an amazing cinematic experience and one that should be felt inside a theater. The technical mastery on display should be marveled at, whether its the special effects or sound design. Ready Player One is extremely fun, and will keep you entertained from start to finish."
"mmcericstrandberg","10","0","2","1 April 2018"," Children of the 80s rejoice, book fans quit whining
","I am not going to go into the film, other than the fact that if you are a child of the 80s like me (I would be 72 in the year this film takes place), the pop culture references alone made this an awesome movie with a LOT of enjoyable moments. The sound tracks, the images and sounds (IRON GIANT, Doc's DeLorean, video game cabinets and sound effects, Tom Sawyer, Jump, a-ha) were a trip into my childhood and the nights in video arcades. That was worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>For the book whiners GET OVER YOURSELVES! EVERY BOOK is hard to bring to the screen. Get it through your heads that NO book survives first contact with filming. Don't believe me, look at Star Wars (The original) Jaws, 2001:A Space Odyssey, Harry Potter, Ender's Game, LOTR, The Hobbit, or any of a thousand other books brought to screen. YOU CAN'T TRANSLATE A BOOK ALL THE WAY TO THE SCREEN. There is internal dialogue that you cant see or hear in a movie that is written in a book. There is a simple TIME FACTOR of a movie. In this day of 5 sec sound byte attention spans, frankly, I thought the movie as it was, did a GREAT JOB of keeping audience attention. I have never read the book, and I am going to so that I can learn about what they book purists are whining about, but I would be willing to bet that short of making this a 4 to 5 hour movie, you cant do it, and even then, it would be difficult, and probably boring to a lot of people who did not write the book. SO be a hater. Make the camper move and give a poor rating to this movie. That just shows that you have not got a clue about reality, and are only interested in your little fantasy view of the movie. Or better, do us all a favor, and zero out and stop playing."
"orlando-somera","8","0","4","31 March 2018"," I haven't much stomach for Spielberg's racial taunts
","Normally I wouldn't stay for a movie featuring two Asians, two Anglos, and a Black (I would have made at least the Sho character a young Latino) but this movie has a lot going for it despite its desire to create certain racial icons. The ideas in play here are worth seeing expressed and what live action there is is done well. I particularly enjoyed Ben Mendelsohn's bad guy though the rest of the cast does an admirable job too.<br/><br/>There's a kind of overblown land of inequality envisioned; the hero lives in a trailer park where space is so dear, the homes are stacked one on another, at least five high. Gaming is everyone's distraction because life is hard for those who aren't rich. Most of the action takes place in a virtual world called OASIS that is everyone's favorite hangout because you can be and do whatever you like. The hero fights a soulless corporation there for control of it, and it's a clever and moderately attractive world to visit, but difficult to believe any adult would want to live there for any length of time.<br/><br/>Spielberg seems to want to describe a world where race is no longer important, and yet there isn't a single Latino that I could find. That's a consistent shortcoming across many artistic forms and it's difficult to dismiss it."
"capaldimark","8","0","2","1 April 2018"," A fun, exciting, and relentless thrill ride
","In a month full of disappointing movie releases that either didn't quite live up to expectations or were colossal failures, it's nice to see one that actually lives up to its high expectations. This comes in the form of ""Ready Player One"", a quintessential pop-culture movie based on the 2011 novel of the same name and directed by Steven Spielberg. The end product is an exciting, fun thrill ride that is easily the best movie this month. <br/><br/>""Ready Player One"" is set in the year 2045 in a dystopian-like setting, where many major cities have become slums due to various issues, such as climate change and overpopulation. To escape from these issues, many people engage in the virtual reality world known as OASIS, which was developed by a man known as James Halliday (Mark Rylance), who passed away five years prior to the events of the film. Soon after his death, people discovered ""Anorak's Quest"", a game designed by Halliday in which a person must collect three keys to find an ""Easter Egg"", and the first person to obtain these three keys and find the hidden ""Easter Egg"" will be rewarded with fortune and other gifts. For the past five years, many people have tried to find the keys, but to no avail. So the story follows Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), an 18 year old boy who is obsessed with trying to find the secret to obtaining these keys to find the Easter Egg. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to complete the first challenge to obtain the first key, Wade turns to the OASIS virtual library in an attempt to find hints and clues to help him obtain these three keys. In doing so, he must also face the threat of the Innovative Online Industries company, who are also searching for the three keys to claim the prize. It's a completely unique and interesting story that is interesting enough to keep you engaged throughout the film, in large part due to it's solid pacing. After some exposition early on, the film jumps right into the action and never looks back. As a result, this is a movie with not much down time in it, which is a good thing for a popcorn movie like this in which its main objective is to keep you entertained, and it does just that far more often than it does not. The movie, for the most part, is constant action, especially in the second half. It's important to note that the film has a runtime of 2 hours and 20 minutes, which is on the longer side, and, because of its length, the constant action does get a bit tiring and monotonous after a while. It can be a bit too much at times. <br/><br/>Another flaw in the movie is its unfortunate lack of character depth. We're introduced to the characters briefly but there's no expansion on their backstory or anything like that. The only real exception to this is James Halliday, as we get an extensive backstory on him and his past. There's also not much character development, so it was hard to really get attached to these characters. The movie seems to be a lot more focused on action and keeping the plot moving, which is a shame because but it would have been even better if we had some more character depth. The human side of things that is usually present in Spielberg's films is mostly not here, unfortunately.<br/><br/>To compliment the action scenes, the visual effects and cinematography are outstanding. Every scene and animation in the OASIS looks beautiful to the point that it will often wow you. Any pop-culture geek will have a great time watching and taking note of the several different visual pop-culture references that are present in the OASIS. Even the scenes in the real world represent a realistic look of a futuristic and dystopian world. This is a movie that will surely be remembered come award season for any kind of visual effect and cinematography category. <br/><br/>All in all, despite a few flaws, Steven Spielberg's ""Ready Player One"" is a good adaptation of the 2011 novel that accomplishes what it set out to do, and that is to provide a fun thrill ride of epic scale. Spielberg adds yet another epic adventure to his resume, one that ranks as the best movie of March and one of the best of the year so far."

","Yes, I've said it!<br/><br/>I actually wrote a longer intro for this... but then just decided to drop it.

A strong EIGHT. And a sign that mr. Spielberg doesn't need my support.<br/><br/>For those who disagree - and there seems to be a lot of them - I have a question: WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?
All the adds said ""based on a novel of a holy grail of pop culture"". Did you all just happen to miss the fact that we're talkin FANTASY fiction instead f sci-fi, with major basis on 80s nostalgia. For you hardcore sci/fi- fans, there's movie you might want to check out. It's called ""2049"". you should check it out.
But t
I could give ""Taxi driver"" a 1/10 and that despite it's name it doesn't tell about commuting.<br/><br/>My two cents are, that the screenplay (by Zan Penn and Ernest Cline) is a vast improvement in the source material, and that Spielberg's knowing/experienced (do I need to even explain?) direction lifts this movie... well, beyond its fan-based roots.

"justinwfirestone","8","0","1","31 March 2018"," Thanks for making fun movies again, Mr. Spielberg
","It's nice to see Spielberg making movies that are fun again. Call me callous, but if you binge-watch his last directorial sub-oeuvres, you will have to spend a day of your life watching The Post, Bridge of Spies, Lincoln, and Munich. You can decide for yourself whether you want to throw in War Horse or Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, but the point is made: I miss the fun adventures of Raiders of the Lost Ark or E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is as others have suggested, it is The Goonies meets Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It is an adolescent adventure, kids winning the day because adults have become too caught up in their menial, meaningless lives, both virtually in silico and actually in vivo. Mark Rylance offers his regular touch of class as the inept dreamer, the kid who never grew up because he did not want to, feeling pain in all the typical places, never being able to relate to other people so he created his own universe.<br/><br/>What is the message buried within the 1980s? Were things better? How can you teach people that physical interactions are more important now than ever by paying homage to video game culture? If nothing is as it seems online, how can we trust our senses in The Real World?<br/><br/>I remember finding an invisible dot once, a few pixels able to move another through electronic attraction.

"leegato","8","0","3","31 March 2018"," An Entertaining Ode to All Things Pop Culture (With Its Imperfections)
","I'm not familiar with the book, nor have I been a fan of Steven Spielberg's latest stuff; to me, he has become either an Oscar-bait or blockbuster-bait director, depending on which Steven Spielberg you get (This year's ""The Post""?), so there was no reason for me to be excited about Ready Player One, especially with the almost cringe-worthy amounts of CGI and enough action to give me fatigue. And yet, here I am, giving this film a good 7.5-8/10. Ready Player One is a the film for fulfilling any fanboy/fangirl's dreams, riddled with tasteful pop culture references on the backdrop of an otherwise familiar, formulaic plot.<br/><br/>With nearly 80-90% of the film taking place in the Oasis, a majority of the film is CGI and takes place literally in a video game; despite this, Spielberg manages to seamlessly blend between reality and virtual, adding character development and depth to its characters and their virtual counterparts. This film could have easily been a CGI mess, and yet it isn't; Spielberg is able to let audiences distinguish between physical and virtual realities, and adds equal amount of heart to each.<br/><br/>As a nerd myself who is nearly obsessed with all things pop culture, I was blown away by Ready Player One's precise attention to detail in its pop culture references. From subtle musical cues from Back to the Future (by the franchise's same composer, Alan Silvestri) to deliberate plot devices taking place within an iconic 70s film, audiences will be simultaneously nostalgic and thrilled as they understand the pop culture references and comprehend how they tie into the plot of the storyline. It creates a joyous type of anticipation that doesn't lend the film predictability.<br/><br/>By no means is Ready Player One perfect; the script has some of the most cliche lines that sometimes made me cringe. The line that was also used in the trailer about Wade being named by his parents because it sounded like a superhero alter ego still irritates me every time I hear it. The plot is formulaic and even has some plot holes left unexplained; the only thing fortunate about this is that these plot holes aren't anything that the story relies on to maintain its integrity, but still deserve to be questioned.<br/><br/>I came in expecting Ready Player One to be all things wrong with Hollywood; banking on CGI, unoriginal references, and relentless and unnecessary action from a director who only seems to embrace Oscar/blockbuster-bait projects. Instead, I came out feeling a joyous nostalgia for a film released that night. Ready Player One is a formulaic movie, yes, but maybe it's formulaic and predictable because it's much like the movies that we've seen growing up, with the same amount of heart and soul."

Also, the Sound effects and visual effects are just stunning. Making these references so alive that even if you don't know all of the references you could still have fun watching this.

Better than so many other gaming movies in the past, Ready Player One really does take you on a trip through your childhood into games popular today. It doesn't try to add something digital that really doesn't work, it just tells a story and lets you enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>The plot isn't anything spectacularly new but is decent for what fun Spielberg was aiming for.

As I'm preparing for the movie to start with one hand in my nachos and the other on my Icee, I'm already thinking, ""I can't wait till this is over."" Harsh, I know. But here's where it gets interesting. Ready Player One takes you on this fantastic journey of courage in the face of hardship. The movie really focuses on the theme of friendship and that even though reality is a little too real most times, escaping isn't always the answer. The graphics, dialogue, action, actors, and references to other famous works was put together thoughtfully and creatively.

","A lot of young people will miss the references, like Mayor Goldie Wilson campaign poster. But this film had to have been a joy to make...
Not sure how he was able to outdo the nostalgia he created, but much like the lame-wad t.v. series that try to ape the era, Spielberg not only created it, he showed them how it's done...again.<br/><br/>There is a fomula brewing in his head somewhere that must be tapped at some point. Though, he is up there in age, it is baffling how he was able to reach into that memory banks of emotion and re-boot for this generation using their own weapons. This film is THAT good. And yes, it treads very familar territory, but what lingers is the innocence our society once had. The fact that the society depicted had imploded and relies on some phony universe to provide our happiness. The lesson is deep, in terms of what we expect out of the ""real world."" So we distract ourselves constantly. The land, in this case is the OASIS, a virtual world to escape the drudgery of life. And EVERYONE is sucked in (cough, the internet...cough). The creator embedded a contest, ala Willy Wonka style to win the control of this virtual open world sandbox. And a gazillion dollars to boot. Enter Wade...a nerd who lives in stacked trailer home. He's been orphaned (ahem...Disney) so he lives with a, well, redneck aunt. Miserable, he spends a great deal in the OASIS. There is a competing firm, headed by Sorrento who wants control over everything. Apple vs. Windows...I mean, your choice.<br/><br/>Of course our hero runs into a female gamer named Art3mis (played by Olivia Cooke). She is that tomboyish nerd who guys like me have crushes over. In the OASIS she is a badass biker chick most likely influenced by ""Akira."" Her big anime eyes and skin-tight outfits suggest she has some self-esteem issues, similar to the rest of the world living in virtuosity. But there is something else about her that is revealed later.<br/><br/>Anyway, for my 40+ year old fringe nerd ass, this was a return to the ol' days of Spielberg. A little sweet and carefree, without the biting cynicism of our world today. Yes, there are really dark moments, but it's a Spielberg film man. And it was just a joy to hear Alan Silverstri with that marching orchestration I loved from ""Back To The Future"" or ""Predator"" It's a mix tape that I listen to with a massive smile on my face."

","I went into 'Ready Player One' knowing nothing about it. I haven't read the book it's based on and the only thing I knew about the story was what the trailer showed. In a way, I think, that was advantageous. The entire experience felt fresh and unexpected. The trailer piqued my interest and I was curious to see Steven Spielberg's vision come alive on the big screen. I wasn't disappointed!
The story is set in a dystopian Columbus, Ohio in the year 2045 where cities look like slums and people rely on a virtual reality world, the OASIS, to escape their everyday lives. On his deathbed James Halliday, the slightly mad and brilliant creator of the OASIS, unveils a contest within the game that will give the winner control of the OASIS and his entire fortune. Naturally, lives and time are wasted (I mean spent) in this pursuit. Teenager Wade Watts is one such hopeful player who spends all of his time learning everything he can about Halliday's life in order to solve the mysterious puzzle. I haven't said much more than what the previews showed and I'll stop here since the movie is worth experiencing for yourself.
The movie is a slam-dunk visually- a grand treat for the senses. You're immersed in the OASIS along with the players and feel a strange loss in their 'real world.' It took me a few minutes to get into the narrative but once it clicked I enjoyed the journey thoroughly. There are endless references to other classic movies and pop culture. It's a never-ending joyride for fans of sci-fi and video games. I'm sure I missed hidden gems that I heard some audience members chuckle at...but that's all part of the cheekiness.<br/><br/>The movie isn't really about performances but the actors manage to play their roles just fine. Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, and Lena Waithe bring enough charm to their characters to be relevant. They seem to be having a good time which works well for this film. The plot itself isn't unexpected and the film is a tad too long but its treatment is the real treat here. You can predict the ending but it's a ton of fun along the way.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has managed to bring together animation, childhood dreams, and virtual reality to create a movie for the fans that satisfies their wildest fantasies. A man of many talents, he isn't short of ideas or talent at the age of 71. Honestly I don't know how this movie will rank in Mr. Spielberg's career graph. It's not my favorite but it's a dream come true for many. It's an easy movie to lose yourself in for a couple of hours so mission accomplished."

","Thank you Steven for another classic, this is a great movie,
i have not experienced, a clapping audience in a long long time.
An escapism Masterpiece!
I was hooked from start to finish, and always going somewhere i did not expect to go, even more so after reading the book!
Yes i am a big fan of the book, and i i understand, some obscure 80s knowledge got lost in translation,but not for better or worse!, i like honest emotion that wrenches the gut, and makes some people uncomfortable, because we all hide.
But you Dr. Spielberg yet again Gave us the medicine we all needed!
you held on to you're inner child, and did not give in!
and we thank you for this, that is why we love you Steven!
Thanks again for reminding us all!"

","A nostalgic journey through the pop culture from twentieth century. The best Steven Spielberg movie since ""Lincoln"" (2012). Could've been even better if the villain wasn't so caricature and dumby. The scenes inside the game are incredible. Better than James Cameron made in ""Avatar"", for example. <br/><br/>It's curious that Spielberg like to return to the past even when he wants to talk about the future. Many movies from his filmography are about the past. But ""Ready player 1"" is the one that he talk about a good past, with the old videogames, cartoons, films and TVs. <br/><br/>An enjoyable movie, a good adventure, like a good ""Indiana Jones"" movie passing in the future and with good characters. Except, as I said, the villain Sorrento."
"tmpsvita","8","0","1","30 March 2018"," A fun, entertaining and great tribute to the pop culture
","Finally it arrived in the theaters ""Ready Player One"", the movie I was expecting most of this 2018, even more than ""Avengers: Infinity War"", not because I thought it was the best movie of the year but simply because from the extraordinary trailer it seemed to be, and so it was, an extremely entertaining film that embodies many of the things I love both in the cinematic world and in the entertainment world in general: many special effects well realized and contextualized, a lot of quotes, innumerable tributes of pop culture that ranges from videogames, movies, books, comics, music of the last 50 years, especially that of the '80s, a decade that has now become a real phenomenon so much to generate a mania in the name of nostalgia for what has represented for generations; and then what fascinates me most of the last years, that is the easter eggs that here play a fundamental role so much that they practically assume the form of subject on which the whole film is based, based on the novel of the same name.
And who could best direct a film of this type if not the great Steven Spielberg, one of the directors who most influenced the aforementioned culture, an exponent of entertainment, blockbusters in the cinema and who directed films that played a very important role in the childhood of many people?
For this and many other reasons, ""Ready Player One"" has absolutely not disappointed my expectations, it is pure entertainment proud of being such and, almost, nothing else, which entertains and excites even without a particularly high depth in the screenplay that, for as it does not arouse strong emotions and is not perfect in writing, awakens in the spectator a childish spirit but not infantile that remains open-mouthed every time that Spielberg, with his masterly technique and strategy, realizes extremely fluid sequences full of unbridled action and lots but lots of nostalgia, using an extraordinary technical sector.
Of course there are, being a film for all ages but directed more towards a young audience, morals, however, these are never too intrusive but, on the contrary, are adequately contextualized and inserted in a conscious way.
For the rest the plot works, involves at the right point, the characters are well written and interpreted, notable interpretation of the talented Mark Rylance that after ""Bridge of Spies"" seems to have become a fetish actor for Spielberg, coming with this to his third collaboration with the director with a fourth already in preparation.
Missing a soundtrack quite incisive but still manages to keep up with the fast and well calibrated rhythm.
In short, a film to see and see again, even just to be able to discover all the easter egg (almost impossible)."

","""Ready Player One"" is a science fiction action-adventure directed and produced by Oscar winner Steven Spielberg and written by Zak Penn (""The Avengers""), Eric Eason (""A Better Life"") and Ernest Cline, based on Cline's own 2011 debut novel of the same name. The movie is heralded as the ""E.T."" director's return to his sci-fi and youth-centered movie roots after a series of historically-based projects. The plot and its various other elements, make ""Ready Player One"" feel like a frenetic, 1980s-inspired, youth-obsessed combination of ""Tron"", ""Avatar"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" & ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". <br/><br/>The main character is Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), an orphaned teen who lives in ""the stacks"", towers of mobile homes on stilts in Columbus, Ohio, the most populous city in the severely over-populated country. Like Wade, it seems that everyone escapes the depressing and dilapidated world around them by spending most of their days in a virtual reality world known as the OASIS. The OASIS was created by tech genius James Halliday (Oscar winner Mark Rylance) as an escape from his own crippling shyness.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, Halliday is deceased, but before he died, he created a game within the OASIS, which offers any user the opportunity to unravel a complex set of clues and accumulate three keys which would give that person complete control of the OASIS and control of Halliday's company - and its assets. Of course, winning this game is the goal of everyone - individuals and corporations. Innovative Online Industries (IOI), headquartered in Columbus and led by the obsessive CEO Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), has hired a virtual army of tech experts & online gamers to ensure IOI comes out on top. <br/><br/>Wade is as obsessed with Halliday as Sorrento is with gaining control of the OASIS, but like Sorrento, Wade won't be able to win this high-stakes game alone. In the game, Wade is known as Parzival, an avatar which, like that of most other people, is better-looking, more confident, more able and more powerful than Wade is in real life. Early in his quest, Parzival meets and becomes attracted to Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), who likes him too, but has even more personal reasons for wanting to win the contest.<br/><br/>The two end up becoming part of the ""High Five"", which also includes Sho (Philip Zhao), Daito (Win Morisaki) and Wade's best friend in the game, Aech (Lena Waithe). While simultaneously competing against each other and working together, this scrappy group must navigate a maze of clues based on Halliday's personal life, including his former partnership with Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg) - and a seemingly infinite stream of 1980s pop culture references (music, fictional characters and movies like ""Back to the Future"" - to beat Sorrento and his main henchman, i-R0k (T.J. Miller) to the ultimate prize. <br/><br/>""Ready Player One"" is fun, exciting, creative... and mind-numbing. The CGI's impressive... in a sensory overload way. The plot's good but can be hard to follow for non-gamers. Too much of a good thing. ""B-"""
"maybe_ed_should_drive","8","0","1","30 March 2018"," Mile-a-minute nostalgia sometimes caries the Film, but a fun ride overall.
","If you've read the book, go in knowing that many, many, things have changed. The core of the story is still there, but the journey is different.<br/><br/>That being said, as an avid consumer of book>film movies Spielberg's choices make sense for once. Fan's of the book have to agree that watching Wade play pixel games like Joust and Tempest as major plot points would be difficult to make exciting. So why not have mile-a-minute nostalgia in a car race instead? Wait was that Akira's bike? A light cycle? Was that Duke Nukeum driving the Batmobile???<br/><br/>Other changes probably have to do with getting rights; It may have been hard to get the rights to replay Monty Python's Holy Grail frame by frame, but there's still a nice nod to it in the film.<br/><br/>If you're at all into video games, 80-90's pop culture, or that certain magic you get from Spielberg's ""Hook"" or ""E.T"" you'll have fun spotting the Easter eggs in the film.

"msbreviews","8","0","2","30 March 2018"," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg hasn't directed a science-fiction film since 2005's War of the Worlds so obviously, my expectations were high for this adaptation of the famous novel written by Ernest Cline, who also co-writes the screenplay for this movie. Well, I am going straight to the topic that everyone is going to talk about for weeks: the pop culture references and Easter Eggs spread throughout the film.<br/><br/>Even before the movie started, I was already focused like a hawk. I knew that a ton of references would show up, so my eyes were constantly looking at the background for hidden hints and my ears were listening to every single word, in order to catch any reference to a film, game, music or even an anime ... However, this is one of the reasons some people will hate this movie.<br/><br/>I think I have never watched a film with so many Easter Eggs. I mean, the whole premise and concept of the movie are based on that, so I was prepared to be overwhelmed with pop culture references from every side. A lot of critics will think that they don't make sense or that the film has no structure whatsoever. The general audience will probably be ""ok"", even though they will never appreciate the hundreds of references that they don't understand.<br/><br/>Truthfully, I love it. The nerd in me will never get tired of catching Easter Eggs and I felt extremely entertained during the whole runtime. There are characters from other movies, vehicles and weapons from other games and even some nods to specific animes. The score is incredible and very nostalgic which tremendously elevated every action scene. I agree that the story might be filled with too many references, but honestly, I don't care. Let them come!<br/><br/>In another film, it would probably bother me but when the whole story is based on the concept of ""egg hunting"", there isn't a single Easter Egg that takes me out of the movie or that doesn't make sense. The virtual world Spielberg created is visually stunning and it feels realistic, awkward as that might sound. The OASIS is something that I can actually imagine existing in real life, 30 years from now. The world-building skills of Spielberg are intact and there is no one better than him to adapt Cline's book.<br/><br/>The action is music to my ears. No one handles a chasing scene better than this director. Animated or not, he is flawless. An amazing race scene at the beginning compensates the lack of interest in the first expositional 15 minutes, where voice narration takes over. The explanation of how the OASIS works is not really necessary since everything is pretty easy to understand by showing it to the viewers.<br/><br/>Until the end, the fast pacing never opens space for a dull moment. The 2h20 minutes run smoothly and the third act has a climax battle worthy of jaw-dropping moments. Inside the virtual world, there are very few flaws to point out. The Easter Eggs which the players have to find are not that hard to decipher, but it is still captivating to watch them trying to figure them out.<br/><br/>My main issue with the movie is when it comes back to the real world. Besides Wade/Parzival and Samantha/Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), no other character has any development whatsoever. Even assuming their avatars are an extension of their personalities, the supporting characters lack some growth. In the real world, the danger and the sense of urgency never feel authentic and some plot points can't escape the genre's cliches.<br/><br/>The story also tries to force out a romance that never has a ground to start off from. I believe the way love grows between these characters outside the OASIS, but the way it starts is as far as realistic as possible. On the other hand, the cast is awesome. Sheridan and Cooke have unbelievable chemistry and they carry most of the film on their shoulders. Ben Mendelsohn portrays a cliche and over-the-top ""villain"" (Sorrento), while T.J. Miller (I-R0k) is super funny as his sort of sidekick.<br/><br/>Tonally, Spielberg should have done better when the action is going on in the real world. I wanted to be in the OASIS all the time, so the movie kind of drops its entertainment levels a tiny bit when we come back ""outside"". Still, I haven't felt this entertained by a sci-fi film in years! Every shot has some sort of reference and I just love those kinds of stuff, no matter how many there are. I understand if it is overwhelming for some people, but for the nerd that I am, I couldn't love it more.<br/><br/>All in all, Ready Player One is a movie created for nerds, whether you want to admit it or not. Yes, the story has a lot of cliches. Yes, some characters lack development and the real world stakes don't feel anywhere near realistic. Yes, there is a stupid romance. But damn, I was entertained! Spielberg's world-building skills are outstanding and the OASIS is a virtual place where pop culture references ""pop out"" on every shot. Overwhelming? Definitely, but I love it! Sheridan and Cooke carry the film and their characters are formidable. The action scenes are jaw-dropping, the visuals are gorgeous and the score is incredibly nostalgic. I can't wait to see it again and catch some more Easter Eggs! Go watch it and happy ""gunting""!"

"velvoofell","8","0","2","30 March 2018"," South Park did it!
","In 2009 'South Park', the animated tv show (and best current affairs programme on any US TV channel) showcases a three-part arc called 'Imaginationland'. Satirising the American paranoia of terrorist threats and access to too much violent pop culture, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone conjured a fantasy land, accessible via the Stargate portal, containing every pop cultural hero and villain from Zeus to the Terminator and beyond. 
 'Imaginationland' has since become a genre where books, games, films and TV shows use a panoply of pop culture franchises to populate its roster of settings and characters. The first of its kind was arguably Zach Snyder's 2009 'Sucker Punch' wherein the abused denizens of a strip club escaped into a fantasy land of anime warriors and robots, zombie invasions and superhero worlds in order to thwart an aggressor. 'The Cabin in the Woods' pitted college kids in a log cabin against a veritable vending machine of successive horror archetypes. 
'The Lego Movie' arguably copied the 'Imaginationland' plot more, utilising the many franchises licensed to Lego to people it's Universe. 
The novel 'Ready Player One' was published in 2011 and continues in the 'Imaginationland' trope. This time a poor but good kid (in his mid twenties!) enters the Oasis a virtual reality world to escape his slum life and combat and compete with avatars of every pop cultural character from Beetlejuce to the Iron Giant. He falls for Artemis, a female rebel highly reminiscent of the Lego Movie's ""Wildstyle"". His band of suitably diverse (think the Lost Boys of Spielberg's 'Hook') friends are racing for the golden ticket style keys to Mark Rylance's autistic Wonka ""Halliday""'s kingdom. Control of the Oasis itself. 
 Add Ben Mendelssohn's effective but off the peg corporate bad guy Nolan and the film is set for showdown twixt good and evil. 
 
 Spielberg has his name on the marquee but as the effects are labelled on, by myriad effects houses, the impact is lessened. It's thrilling initially to see Tron like soldiers chase the Delorean into the arms of King Kong. However the wonder lessens to the same surprise one might have for a pinball feature from a pinball's eye view. 
 The hero, Wade, may drive the Delorean but at least audiences cared about Marty Mcfly."

","Grade: A-<br/><br/>In a Nutshell: The creator of the largest virtual reality world ever, called the OASIS, dies and leaves a challenge to anyone who can find three invisible keys that lead to a hidden Easter egg to win a fortune and ownership over the OASIS. Directed by Steven Spielberg, it is full of imagination, fun, action, romance, humor, and a moral lesson. Game on!<br/><br/>If you're not into video games, this movie is probably not for you. I don't really play video games, but I still enjoyed it. I have four sons who played video games for many years growing up, so I was exposed enough to most of the characters that make an appearance in this movie that I got a kick out of it all. One of my sons is now living his dream as a 3D character artist for the hugely successful video game company Blizzard.<br/><br/> 
Tips for parents: 
· Ready Player One is rated PG-13 for tons of violence, bloody images, partial nudity, profanity, and some suggestive material. 
 * I was worried that the movie would glorify video games and encourage kids to plug into technology even more, but the message in the end is that we all need each other and real life. I thought the ending was actually very sweet.
· Some profanity and other crude language.
· A character flips the bird.
· It shows real people losing touch with reality as they play video games.
· Several people have face and body tattoos.
· The leading lady's avatar (Art3mis) has a super skimpy outfit on.
· You see the partial naked back side of a virtual reality woman. 
* There is an important reference to ""Rosebud"" in the 1941 movie Citizen Kane that very few kids or even adults will catch.<br/><br/>· 
Uplifting theme: 
· ""People need to spend more time in the real world."" - Wade/Parzival
· ""It's not about winning, but playing."" - Wade/Parzival
· ""As painful and terrifying as the real world can be, it's the only place you can get a decent meal...because reality is real."" - Halliday
· ""No man is alone who has a friend."" - I-R0k
· Illusion vs. reality
Real world consequences
 <br/><br/>Things I liked:
The movie itself is classic Spielberg with absolutely fantastic action sequences and imagination. 
The special effects are really well done and blend easily from virtual reality environments into scenes with people in reality. 
The movie is overflowing with references that span several decades of movies, music, and pop culture, focusing mostly on the 1980's. While the main character (Wade Owen Watts) is looking for the grand prize, there are TONS of fun Easter eggs for the audience to look for and enjoy during the entire film. At one point, there is a scene with a famous Anime motorcycle that Spielberg is notorious for having rejected 30 years ago, dismissing it as ""unsalable"" for film. It's fun to see how he now embraces and celebrates it on the big screen. 
There is some humor and heart in the film with most of the comic relief provided by a scary-looking, yet hilarious character named I-R0k, voiced by T. J. Miller. 
Alvin Silvestri offered an energizing and fun musical score. Originally, Steven Spielberg's favorite composer, John Williams, was going to tackle the project, but he had to step away to finish his work on another Spielberg film, The Post
If you can, try to see the movie in 3D, but it's still fun without the glasses and extra fee. 
Climb Mt. Everest with Batman. Ha ha
I love Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance in anything.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Things I didn't like:
· Older folks will probably claim the movie is on sensory overload (they're right), but the younger crowd will feel like they're right in the middle of playing a video game. A really old guy sitting near me in the theater got up and walked out.
There are a LOT of exposition scenes that tell us what's happening and the movie drags a little bit in the Third Act. 
It's a very long 2 hours 20 minutes flick, so Grandpa or Junior may fall asleep.
 Sit farther back in the theater; otherwise, you won't be able to focus on everything going on. There is a LOT happening on the screen.<br/><br/>Funny lines:
""There are only 3 things I hate in the world: Steam Punk, pirates, and Tabouli."" - I-R0k (T.J. Miller)
""Am I being punked?"" - Aech/Helen (Lea Waithe)
""She wanted to go dancing, so we went to a movie."" - Halliday (Mark Rylance)
""She could be a dude, a 300 pound dude who lives in his mother's basement...and his name is Chuck. Think about that!"" - Aech/Helen
""Voila....which is French for...."" - I-R0k
""Do you want it or not?"" - Anorak (Mark Rylance)<br/><br/>Interesting lines:
""People go to the Oasis for all the things they can do, but they stay because of all the things they can be."" - Wade
""A fanboy knows a hater."" - Parzival
""Things move forward whether you like it or not."" - Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg)<br/><br/>If you loved it and want more, check out the book that it's based on, Ready Player One ,written by Ernest Cline. The movie adds to and deletes from the source material, frustrating true fanboys, but they both have something to offer. Cline actually mentioned Steven Spielberg in the original novel."

","The whole time while I was walking home from the cinema, I was grinning like an idiot.<br/><br/>Now, if it was not obvious, the movie is really really heavy in pop-culture references. if you are not with an above-average level of pop-culture knowledge, just don't go. You will sit there, looking at pretty animations, wondering what is going on.<br/><br/>For those that do have the knowledge... Gundam vs Godzilla. That happened. And it is glorious.
On to other things:
The story is exactly what it is revealed in the trailers, no hidden catch. The movie shows a good compromise/struggle between real-life and in-game as the fight is fought on both fronts. All of the acting is good. The pop-culture references were good, but there was a slight lack of the big names. Besides Blizzard's Overwatch, the only other major, MAJOR (and currently trending, not to offend anyone) thing was the millennium falcon been mentioned (just mentioned, not actually shown). No Marvel, no Star Wars proper. Still, there was Halo, Street fighter, back to the future, Battlestar Galactica, star-trek and so on and overall, it was all good.
My only gripe with the movie is that the romance felt abit rushed.
Other than that, an instant nerd classing."
"connorgoron","8","0","3","30 March 2018"," Lacks in some Aspects but a Fun Movie overall.
","Ready Player One is an all ways a textbook Spielberg Film, the fast paced action sequences he's so widely known for take another strong stand in this film. Despite this, the Movie adaptation lacks a strong setup to characters and fails to create a heavy emotional bond between the protagonist and the others around him. This film is enjoyable to anyone in touch with pop culture and will surely trigger some nostalgia along the way, but it is in no way a spectacular movie."

","The movie was fun, fast and action driven, it told at its core more or less the same story but nearly everything was changed to a more action driven movie format.

Because if the film is watchable, then the book is fantastic. must read.<br/><br/>And I did enjoy the movie if you are wondering, I'm just a little disappointed over some of the changes in the story and how the key are found. It could have been done better, but then the movie might not have been as mind blowing fun to watch."
"minhamoled","9","0","3","30 March 2018"," An amazing, meaningful and entertaining blockbuster
","Wow! Wow! Wow! That was an amazing cinematic experience. If you have the chance, go see it in IMAX, especially IMAX 3D.<br/><br/>Ready Player One is based on Ernest Cline's best-selling novel of the same name. At the time of its release, the work was impressed by the intriguing storyline along with a great deal of pop cultures from the 70s, 80s.<br/><br/>The main story:
In 2045, the distinction between the rich and the poor became extreme. Everyone is immersed in the virtual world of OASIS to forget the reality. Until the founder died, he left a fortune and said that anyone who found the three hidden keys in that world would take control of the game and have half of trillion dollarss. The main body finds a key, and from there realizes that he is in a fight with a corporation named IOI that want to control the world.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I have not read the novel so I will judge it as a moviegoer. This is a very Spielberg movie, one can see his imprint in it. Steven Spielberg has said that this is a movie that has caused him a great deal of pressure since Saving Private Ryan, I must say that his efforts were not wasted.<br/><br/>Screenplay is good. Funny jokes and messages are incorporated into the film very naturally, without the feeling of being pressured. Cheers for Ernest Cline and Zak Penn.<br/><br/>Acting is not much to say as the main focus of the film is in the OASIS.
(Only one thing: I have a crush on Olivia Cooke <3)
The cinematic and sound effects of the film are extremely satisfying, entertaining for your eyes and ears. 
Alan Silvestri has produced a very classic, very modern music.<br/><br/>The only exception I see is probably the third act is a bit long, although it is quite emotional for me.<br/><br/>General: A film that brings a deep message of friendship, about the difference between virtual world and real world. At the same time extremely entertaining, easy to see."

","Entertaining 2 hours and 18 minutes worth of what it is like to fantasize to the extreme and do it quite well. The cyber world is depicted very well as is the real world in this movie that dazzles and manages to hold your attention from start to finish. Its like the Matrix only modern and the game world is a place where anything goes and it does. What holds everyone in it from going all out is you lose points, perks and bonus items if you boo-boo so it pays to keep it cool unless you go all out making one have to start from the beginning. Anyone who has played a fantasy role game especially when they came out and either didn't save their game or make it to a save point and has to start all over can readily identify what it is like when watching this movie and seeing others get frustrated from this starting over dynamic. I was able to relate. In this movie, it makes one a more cautious player so they can last longer and perhaps discover more. However, there is always the temptation and if you are good enough or just plain lucky, you pedal down, go for it and you just may go on. If not you start over. Interesting how this movie portrays the use of drones correctly, how much time is spent playing virtual reality games and how boring real life can get or be compared to cyber-fun. It reminds me of all the people I see today who never go anywhere without a cellphone in their hands. They are either talking on it, playing on it, texting or watching a video but at all times they are interacting with it and not with their surroundings. Consequently you have car wrecks, people bumping into things and each other and quite a bit of real life going unnoticed. Seeing it in a movie and it being taken into an extreme made it fun to watch. This movie has something for everyone as old games, movies and other things are revisited and used for different reasons and fun. My attention was held from start to finish. Treat yourself and go see this new type of relevant entertainment that mirrors quite nicely what is going on today. Remember...."

"pinokiyo","7","0","1","29 March 2018"," GUNDAM!!!!!! Fun times at the movies - Willy Wonka Meets Wreck-it-Ralph
","I saw an early screening of this last week. I've never heard of the book before, but I am a fan of movies, 80's, retro games and this being directed by Spielberg finally got me interested in a movie I would actually watch these days. <br/><br/>The movie runs 2 hours and 20 minutes (almost 3 hours) but it doesn't feel long at all as it doesn't drag much (maybe around the 3rd part it slows down) <br/><br/>This movie basically reminds me of Willy Wonka meets Wreck-it-Ralph. Instead of a candy factory, the competition deals with a virtual reality 'gaming' world where the first one to find all 3 secret ""easter egg"" keys would become ownership of the world. It is actually perfect timing today and not too far fetched with all the VR technology and avatar/gaming society going on. <br/><br/>I wouldn't say the movie is powerful or intense on the level of Spielberg's Minority Report, but the movie definitely does have its moments, especially the beginning racing scene. <br/><br/>The movie is definitely a must-experience in theater, especially with the thunderous Dolby Atmos pounding the chairs when the T-Rex from Jurassic Park and King Kong is smashing everything. <br/><br/>The most exciting, interesting, fun parts of the movie is when you see all these nostalgic iconic things appearing on the screen at the same time; I wish the whole film could just be that.<br/><br/>The movie will be more enjoyable if you've seen or know anything about Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror film The Shining. <br/><br/>The best parts for me was definitely the beginning racing scene (the Delorean, but I wish it would have actually flown too instead of just being grounded most of the time driving), with Jurassic Park and King Kong; The Shining; and last battle where Gundam shows up did give me slight chills. <br/><br/>I saw Chun Li, street fighter characters but they were so brief, like it would have been cooler to see more of those iconic characters fighting. The final battle, there's too many characters on screen at once, it's too hard to spot what they are. <br/><br/>Goro from Mortal Kombat is in it. <br/><br/>There's a lot well known soundtrack in this movie, even the original Japanese Godzilla theme song was a nice touch. <br/><br/>One thing I found odd was how it seemed like this IOI company was the mafia and running all these drones around the public and suddenly at the end the movie, we find actual police officers existed in the movie... like where the hell were they this whole damn time??? <br/><br/>I wish we could see more of these nostalgic infused character types of movies. I wish they would have had Johnny Five from Short Circuit or Robocop.... come on that's 80's!! Maybe they couldn't get the rights I guess.<br/><br/>While the movie is enjoyable, it is typical Spielberg campy family-Disney ending with a pretty goofy villain. There's a cute ""twist"" but not really any major shock when it comes to the plot. Overall though, it's a movie worth checking it out in theaters, IMAX, 3D, Atmos, the best you possibly could."
"jwwalrath-227-85487","10","0","3","29 March 2018"," A lot better than I expected
","To be honest, if I didn't have Moviepass, I probably wouldn't have seen this in the theater, but I'm so glad I did.<br/><br/>Spielberg has recaptured the old magic he had with films like Jurassic Park and Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie is straight-up fun. The entire virtual world in this film looks great, is inventive, and feels fully realized. (Heck the real-world dystopian future also looks pretty nice.) It's also a lot funnier than I expected too.<br/><br/>Yes, a few parts are rushed, some parts of the future world leave you asking questions, and a coupld of supporting characters are introduced too quickly and weakly, but ultimately these are minor issues compared to the strength of the film.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this."

"emmatyler-62576","8","0","1","29 March 2018"," Lovable, fast-paced hilarity
","I read the book like, a week before the screening. To be honest, when I saw it would be made into a movie, the first question was: how in the universe are they going to do that? Basically 75% of the book is Perzival/Wade talking about pop-culture references!
I must say though, the movie did the original source justice, despite massive, and I repeat, massive plot changes. Then again, most of the book would actually look terrible on screen - stale, boring, and not at all movie-worthy.
I admit, the character development was hurt somewhat in comparison to the book. I think I like Wade better in the movie, but lament the fact Aech, Art3mis, Daito and Sho got so little screen time - then again, if they did, the movie would probably be around four hours long.
Visuals were absolutely stunning, the music perfectly fitting in, and of course, Stanley Kubrick tribute was the best thing in the entire movie! (The close second one being ""Oh God, it's f***ing Chucky!"" line :D)
What I found issue with, though, are flimsy dialogue in some parts, cliched villain-esque behavior in others, and mild message it sent - or should I say, the message that was not driven home properly. To avoid spoilers, I'll just say that the fact only about a third of a movie happening in reality really hurt the delivery of that message.
Overall, though, this is one hell of movie, best to be watched with a fellow gaming ethusiast so you can comment of every single detail you spot in there - enjoyable from the start to the finish."
"Lewis_Heather787","7","0","3","29 March 2018"," Probably won't appeal to everyone, but still really good!
","Lets start off by stating that I have never read the book for this film and actually had never heard of it until the trailer for this film was released. So due to this my knowledge of the source material is well zero. There is a huge amount of stuff to process about this film so here are some of the main takeaways.<br/><br/>Firstly the strongest part of the film is the directing...........I know its shocking that Steven Spielberg made a good film. Actually joking aside I do think that this is one of the better directed films he has put out in a while. Some of Spielberg's more recent films have been a little lack-luster which made me question whether he still had the directing bug. I clearly look like a fool for thinking like that because this film is directed immaculately. <br/><br/>Another positive is the cast who are all extremely strong in there given roles, firstly the two standouts Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke are both really good in the film. Even though there ""real world"" relationship is extremely forced, the actors chemistry is really good and they bounce of each other well. Is Ben Mendelsohn ever going to get to play a ""good guy""......well probably not because his performance once again is menacing and cunning , he is just so good as a villain even though a bit type cast. Shoutouts should also go to Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg who were both very good in there respective roles.<br/><br/>The last positive for me is the visual effects which are very good and even spectacular in parts. This is a complete contrast from the trailers which didn't look good at all. Before going in to see the film I was worried that the ""VR"" world avatars would be jarring to watch, put you definitely get use to it very quickly, this is helped by the good effects. There are some definite holding your breath moments in this film that are just plain cool to see from a visual stand point. <br/><br/>Quickly before moving onto the negatives, the very last positive is the two words in quotations.............""The Shining""...............perfect.<br/><br/>Now the negatives, I have slightly pointed out one of them already and that is the forced relationship between Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke. I understand they were going to meet in the real world at some point, but as soon as they do like a flick of a switch instantly in love............really. Its just lazy writing and skipping over an important foundation of the film to move onto more action scenes. Would have liked just a bit more time to flesh out there ""real world"" relationship, the actors performances deserved it.<br/><br/>The other negative is who this film is targeted towards, does this audience/demographic actually exist. Now this comes from someone born in the mid 90's so take this with a pinch of salt, but I fear that the perfect audience member for this film is a complete combination of a childhood from the 80's and the modern day together. I know there was a lot of 80's nostalgia that went straight over my head because I wasn't alive then and am not familiar to it. Similarly is someone born then gonna really know what VR actually is??? What I'm trying to say is that is this film trying to please too many demographics at once???<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the film 75% out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10 its almost very good, however this film will not appeal to everyone, you've either got to be modern day gamer or someone who grew up/lived through the 80's to really appreciate and like the film. This what I fear is isolating a lot of people from watching this film, especially looking at the box office predictions for this film.....ouch. Final thought, Is Steven Spielberg being beaten at the very game he create............the blockbuster????"
"piraltaf","7","0","3","29 March 2018"," Both for adrenaline junkies and aloof thinkers
","This film adaptation of Ernest Cline's novel by Spielberg was a breeze of fresh air in the recent barrage of colorless and monotonous releases coming out of Hollywood. In the age where filmmaking has changed from storytelling to merely an audiovisual experience and filmakers are selling the same pizza with slightly different toppings, Speilberg is no more an exception. But atleast he was able add a flavour of nostalgia not only of 80s video game era but also of 90s The Matrix. Surley Spielberg's experience of Avatar comes in handy. 
The production caters to both the adrenaline junkie generation as well as aloof thinkers. It not only contain keys to some forgotten philosophical principles of stoicism that one does not need to win to be happy in life. But it also warns the viewer of dangers of the virtual worlds of social media in any form and shape. Perhaps the path to happiness is in accepting the moments as they presents to us. Highly recommended in IMAX 3D."

","I don't have any problem with movie being different from the book. I would say this movie is based on the book and Ernest Cline who authored the book is the co-screenwriter for the movie. But the movie lacks to capture the drama and the bond between characters.<br/><br/>Plus
Visually this one is a spielberg masterpiece. The race sequence was fantastic with great cinematography. The animation is flawless; the way the animated characters also blend in the real world is mindblowing. (or that's what $175 million could get you) <br/><br/>Cons
The romance between the lead characters seemed forceful. Despite the actors doing a great job, I think it's some chopped up reel on the production house floor that may make us feel it is forced. Also, the movie does not even capture the emotion between our rebel team at least half as the book. It never explains how all the characters team up. It seemed rushed. <br/><br/>Overall, while visually stunning, bad editing and poor character building fail to connect us with the emotions that our characters feel at certain points of the movie.<br/><br/>It's a definite big screen watch."

","This review of Ready Player One only has minor spoilers<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>THERE'S A T-REX in Ready Player One, there's a DeLorean (that doesn't go back in time) and there's a giant King Kong wrecking havoc. Over the years Steven Spielberg has been called many names; auteur, master filmmaker, highly imaginative and cinematic master, yet if there's one name applies to more it's 'Big Kid' and with his latest nerd-fest that title is fairly apt. His latest, based entirely on Ernest Cline's best selling novel of the same name, the film comes chock full of special effects, blistering colour and finally it comes clogged with pop culture references aplenty, think you know them? Well, Spielberg will challenge your knowledge in his geekiest, his most fun, most exciting and his most explosive film in recent years.<br/><br/>We open with Wade (Sheridan), an 18-year-old lad who lives in a slum of Columbus, Ohio a place called The Stacks, a place where trailers are stacked high sat on metal stilts, to get away from this life he spends most of his time in the OASIS, a world where you can be literally anyone, change your facial features, your gender and even your lifestyle, and it's here when Spielberg's film finds it's full breathing room. It's a world filled with vibrant colour, incredible avatars of different sizes, and the real game changer they make up the shape of gaming and movie references. Here Spielberg unlocks his true nerd, and some of his most exciting directing in recent years. For example, there's a moment, not too long into the film where hundreds of cars, the DeLorean, the A-Team van and the Plymouth Fury (which happens to be driven by Lara Croft) are all racing each other through the streets of New York, having already outmaneuvered the Jurassic Park T-Rex, King Kong swings into view and as the angry giant ape appears. It's clear that all your lingering are dispelled - clearly Spielberg is going to deliver on his action-packed ride as promised. <br/><br/>And he's right; this is by far his most exciting, his most spellbinding and his most explosive film in recent years. What follows after is a high-octane, action-packed thrill-ride that is sure to unlock your inner nerd, so get ready, player one. Meanwhile on the outside world, there's the human players, Wade and his gaming partner Samantha (Cooke) have to outrun a big corporate gaming company IOI (who's logo looks a lot like binary from a distance) and their head boss, the ruthless Nolan Sorento (Mendelsohn) who tries to find the Easter Eggs before everybody else, thus leaving OASIS under threat from being taken over. <br/><br/>It's a high-risk contest, then, chasing the Easter Eggs announced by the recently deceased James Halliday (Rylance), the curator of the world. And Spielberg seamlessly melds the fast-paced action between the virtual world, and the real world with dazzling aplomb, melding the peril in both states and upping the stakes once we quickly approach the endgame. However Ready Player One isn't perfect as the film occasionally gets sidetracked by exposition (this is what an 'Easter Egg' is, here's why the Atari 2600 game Adventure is being used) which is only momentarily frustrating, but the real problem is with Mendelsohn, who again does too little to make any differences between Sorento, as he's also a lot like Rogue One's Orson Krennic and The Dark Knight's John Daggett. But, thankfully Spielberg's latest is mostly a joy, for Spielberg letting loose his kind of blockbuster techniques that gave him his name in the first place. And it happily shows that he can still do action-packed sequences like nobody else, clearly, he's back on top of his game. <br/><br/>VERDICT Spielberg has done the impossible; making a virtual world feel real, in his geekiest, his most exciting and his most enchanting film in recent years; it's a pure cinematic pleasure. So get ready, player one."

"kaylashumake2010","7","0","1","29 March 2018"," Good Movie Based on a Great Book
","*******SPOILERS*******
So let me start by saying me and my husband both read the book and have the same opinion. The movie is a really good movie: the acting is good, the visuals and cgi are amazing, and the soundtrack is good; however, if you are going into the movie after reading the book prepare to be a little disappointed. The key elements from the novel are there, but they changed the location of every key and took out the fact that the gates themselves are tests. As soon as the high five get a key, they immediately get another clue. 
I feel like the amount of work it took to win the contest in the book was just glazed over in the movie.
The movie also started with an established relationship with everyone in the group instead of building it within the movie. In the book the high five have to learn they can trust each other, and it even takes Daito's death in real life to bring them together against Sorrento. They completely removed his death from the movie. 
And speaking of Sorrento, the movie version is a complete pussy compared to the novel. He hides behind his assistant and has her do his dirty work. In the book, he is truly evil and tries his best to kill all of the kids in the real world. 
The movie is really really good, but I was a biased party and that's why I couldn't give it more than a 7. 
 I believe everyone should give this movie a try, and that you will enjoy the movie whether you've read the book or not."
"kjproulx","8","0","5","29 March 2018"," The Definition of Escapism
","With all of the sequels and reboots as of late, it's hard to imagine a time when an audience wouldn't be sick of a movie based on pop culture. When watching the trailers for Ready Player One, it almost seems like a story that exists to put people in the theatre, solely based on the references alone. While that's definitely not an arguable statement upon leaving the theatre one the credits begin to roll, it's almost impossible to say that Ready Player One isn't at least a little bit of fun. In fact, if you're someone who has seen a lot of films, played some video games, or can appreciate a reference that's done in a fun and tasteful way, then this movie may just be the most fun you'll have at the movies this year. Here's why (even with its flaws) this is a movie worth seeing on the big screen.<br/><br/>Set in the year 2045, Ready Player One follows Wade Watts, as he attempts to beat missions in a game called the Oasis. It's a virtual reality that people use to escape from the horrors that Earth has become. Filled with a wide variety of people and characters, this film represents what online gaming would be like if it took over the world. It's a scary thought to think that we may make it there one day, but nevertheless, the idea itself makes for quite the adventure of a movie. From pop-culture references to romance, to music that will have you tapping your feet and cheering for each and every hero, Ready Player One has it all.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, whose many works are sprinkled throughout this movie, Ready Player One benefits from the care and meticulous effort put in, in order to make the most adventurous and fun film made out of blatant references. Spielberg is one of the best in the business and will always be. It's nice to see him breaking free of his string of dramas that he's been on lately, in order to go back to his roots of good old fashion adventure and magic. It's definitely a lot to take in and I can't see everyone seeing every reference or story point (which could be a big issue for some), but as someone who has seen, played, or could at least understand everything throughout the course of my first viewing experience, I had an absolute blast from start to finish.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with this movie is that it tells you everything, leaving no room for you to figure things out on your own. While the first act has some terrific narration and I was into everything that Tye Sheridan was bringing to the character of Wade, Ready Player One continuously makes you feel like you're reading a novel or playing a video game, solely due to the narration or scenes where characters feel the need to explain everything. It's this aspect that makes this movie feel slightly long at times, due to the fact that you're left experiencing everything, instead of sharing that experience with a bit of mystery.<br/><br/>In the end, my complaints about Ready Player One are far outweighed by my overall experience. From the fun nods to classic movies and blatant set pieces that come directly from classic film sets, I found myself in awe at times. The virtual world takes a while to get used to and the contrast from real to fake can be jarring at times, but its unique look quite frankly had me amazed. With a terrific score, solid performances, a fun premise with enjoyable side stories, and conclusion that feels earned and satisfying, Ready Player One is everything you could want from a blockbuster by Steven Spielberg. Yes, it has its issues, but I challenge you to explain a world where a movie like this could be perfect. For everything that it sets out to achieve, Ready Player One is a great ride to take at the cinema."

"KingKongKyle","8","0","1","29 March 2018"," Escape to the Oasis
","Ready Player One is a tough movie to critique. For one thing, it is far from perfect and if one really wanted to I could sit here and just tear the narrative apart. But when a movie is based on a book, especially one as popular as Ernest Cline's novel, you have to wonder how much of the story's flaws rest with the filmmakers and how much rest with the source material.<br/><br/>RP1 takes place in the near future where social media and online interactive gaming have taken the next leap. Most people spend massive chunks of their time plugged into a virtual reality world where they can be and do whatever they want; real human interaction quickly becoming a thing of the past. The good thing about this concept is that it is relatable. Cline's future doesn't seem that far off given where we are currently. This virtual world known as the ""Oasis"" is jam-packed with pop-culture references from the last thirty years, thanks to its creator's obsession with popular movies and videogames. When the creator, Halliday, dies, he leaves a treasure hunt of sorts in his virtual world with instructions that whomever can solve the puzzles and clues and find his hidden ""easter egg"" will inherit his massive fortune and control of the Oasis (think Willy Wonka but more complicated). Our protagonist, a young man from ""the stacks"" (think futuristic trailer park) is close to finding it with the help of his friends, but a greedy and ruthless business man will stop at nothing to find it first, hoping to use control of the Oasis to force more advertising on its users and bleed them dry, be it financially or with information.<br/><br/>That is all I will spoil about the film's plot. Just know that you will be faced with an onslaught of pop culture references and figures that for the most part are an absolute joy. The main issue with RP1 is that while what takes place in the Oasis is a a blast to watch, the scenes that take place in the real world are a bit of a bore. Now you would expect the virtual reality to be more exciting than reality, it's supposed to be. But the events that occur in reality involve actual life and death situations and I just never felt really invested in them. The peril that was there was rushed and the characters weren't really developed enough to feel emotionally connected to them. There is also a flawed villain on display here. Ben Mendelsohn can be so good at vile and menace. But here his character is so uneven. One minute he's determined and diobolical and the next he's a bumbling idiot. There is also a scene where TJ Miller's avatar, I-R0k, sits down next to some young women in a club and makes them uncomfortable and frightened. The scene isn't really necessary to the movie and given the recent accusations against Miller in real life, it makes you wonder why it wasn't cut. Anyway, not a big deal, I just thought it was odd and I'll be surprised if no one else notices it.<br/><br/>Now the good stuff. This movie is a visual and audio feast. The race scene near the beginning is so fun and intense and loud (in a good way). The majority of the movie is packed with color and style; it manages to be fun and trippy at the same time. (I don't get high, but I would wager the people that do will have a blast watching this in such a state; not that I'm condoning such an activity.) And there's so many references flying at you the whole movie. Batman, Willy Wonka, Halo, Terminator 2, King Kong, Chucky, Iron Giant, Back to the Future, Ninja Turtles, and that's just some that I thought were neat; not even scratching the surface of what fanboys will be obsessing over when talking about this movie. There is an entire sequence devoted to one of Stanley Kubrick's classic films here (I won't spoil it), and it is genius. However, I will warn parents that I felt this scene was a bit scary for younger viewers, particulary since most of them won't understand what is being referenced.<br/><br/>And therein exists a problem with RP1's appeal. It didn't really occur to me until I was having a conversation about the movie with the son of a friend of mine. He's usually super-excited about all the big superhero and sci-fi movies. I asked him a couple weeks ago if he was looking forward to RP1, and his response was ""Neh, not really. Maybe I'll watch it when it comes out at home."" And thinking about his response, and now that I've seen the movie, it really does have a narrow demographic. The movie's narrative isn't always strong enough to appeal to moviegoers just looking for a good adventure film. The real appeal of the movie is seeing all these great references to past entertainment. The references are too old or obscure for young audiences. And the movie is too frantic and uneven for senior audiences. The real demographic for this film are nerds between 25 and 55. It's a big movie-going demographic, so it should do well financially. But it does speak to limitiation inherent in the film, that due to its source materal, really couldn't be avoided. On the other side of that coin, it could be seen as a good opportunity for parents to introduce their kids to the entertainment icons they grew up with. Then they could say, ""Remember that cool car he was driving? How about we watch Back to the Future at home so you can see where that came from?""<br/><br/>Technically everything looks sounds good from top to bottom. I could pick on a couple of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's odd choices, but shooting a movie of this scale isn't easy and it can't all look perfect. Another thing I didn't care for is it seemed that every time another pop culture icon appeared, one of our ""original"" characters had to point it out. ""There's Kong"", ""Ahh its Chucky"", ""Hey look, Batman"", that type of thing. Part of the enjoyment of a pop culture reference in a movie is knowing that you ""got it"" and perhaps not everyone else in the audience did. It just feels a little insulting that the filmmakers felt we needed so many of the references pointed out to us.<br/><br/>I know a lot of this review sounds negative. But that's only because it is easy to describe the things I didn't care for without spoiling important plot points or fun scenes. If I were to dive deeply into the things that had me grinning from ear to ear throughout much of the film, I'd have to get into major spoiler territory, which I refuse to do. Just know that Spielberg's latest is a wildly entertaining movie that is meant to be seen on the largest screen possible, and in 3D! I know there is a lot of debate about 3D in cinemas today, but believe me when I say that RP1 was designed to be seen in 3D. In said format, on a proper screen, it is a truly immersive experience.<br/><br/>Some movies are just meant to be entertaining. They're not meant to be picked apart and over-analyzed. Just go to the movies and have a good time. I can't imagine anyone, particularly in the age demographic I described earlier, not at least enjoying themselves at this movie. 8/10."

"liamkenny91","8","0","4","29 March 2018"," Dues Ex Machina - The God definitely is in this Machine.
","Spielberg doesn't make bad movies. I had lots of reservations going into this film; I thought the Nostalgia overload would be too much and that it would be pandering. <br/><br/>Firstly, Ready player one looks beautiful - the CGI is brilliant, while it does sit in the ""uncanny valley"", it fits the world. The story works, from what I understand, does differ from the book in minor aspects, and while there are moments of eyerolling, for the most part, it does exactly what it needs to show the off the world and character's within. Speaking of Characters, I did notice something which may be highlighted elsewhere and of course the characters are more than just their avatars, but in a world full of mysteries and opportunities to be anything, why are the two Asian characters Samurais, and even the worse, the only African American character seemingly in the entire world is portrayed as a troll? <br/><br/>As I said, Spieldberg doesn't make bad movies - the soundtrack is brilliant, the references and call-backs are subtle enough in some areas to work only if you REALLY know specific movies or games, but also obviously enough that even millennials will get enough from it. It does, however, sometimes border insulting to ""Gamers"" - ""Noob"" and ""camper"" are terms thrown about, slightly off to their real world meaning. <br/><br/>I did leave the film with TONS of questions, specifically about the Logistics of the real world / Oasis crossover, it sorts of picks and chooses what to address. In some scenes they flip and twirl in the oasis but you don't see their real life bodys moving, but in others, where they're running and shooting, you see exactly how their movements are mirrored in the real world. Its all slightly confusing. There are also moments of absolute perfect luck and timing, which of course happen in films such as these... people showing up JUST at the right time etc - Dues Ex Machina indeed. It feels the world is built around the main characters of this film, not that they're part of something bigger.<br/><br/>I think if you look for problems with this film, you'll probably find them, but if you sit back and enjoy the ride, Ready Player One has a lot of fun to be had."

"TheFearmakers","7","0","4","29 March 2018"," Spielberg's Back to the Far Off Dystopic Future 1980's
","Most films begin slowly, and then open up into an adventurous middle with pockets of character-developing downtime leading to the kind of crescendo that READY PLAYER ONE ignites from the get-go.<br/><br/>Taking place about fifty years from now in the usual raggedy dystopic future, this particular urban wasteland's known as The Stacks, which the living quarters are, one atop the other. But a virtual reality game-world, Oasis, has become a sparkling haven amidst the squalor, and as people play into the games wearing helmets, walking on treadmills, etc., their avatars fight to stay alive while... and here's the plot... trying to find three keys that Oasis's dead founder left - for then the winner takes over the half-a-trillion dollar company...<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg seems almost too perfect as director since this otherworld is loaded with not only an abundance of 80's references but earlier gems like CITIZEN KANE (he owns one of the Rosebud sleds), SILENT RUNNING and even the STAR WARS prequels...<br/><br/>One ""Easter egg"" in particular was extremely joyful to catch: the name of a makeshift bar/garage with a sign that reads, COCKTAILS & DREAMS, Bryan Brown's cheesy name for he and Tom Cruises's future bar in... COCKTAIL, with the same font and vapid neon colors. Other stuff includes music such as Van Halen's popular electrogasm, Jump, and the mention of just about every Atari Game Gen-X grew up playing. But what's most important about our director is, while not getting too deep into fleshing out the characters (sayeth mostly fans of the source novel), there's a nice balance between the real world and the virtual one so that each player means a little more than their endless bouts of action in that other place...<br/><br/>Which includes a trip inside THE SHINING's Overlook Hotel (and snow maze), the Stanley Kubrick horror classic that his good friend Spielberg compared to Kabuki theater. This is probably the best scene in the rollercoaster ride of a mind trip adventure, and the small band of characters are, here and in other locations, able to open up comically without seeming too Marvel- although PLAYER ONE is really a two man... or rather, one man and a girl... show...<br/><br/>That's where the pop culture science-fiction yarn turns into your basic HUNGER GAMES type of poor underdog rebels vs Fascist corporate monsters (literally in some cases), and this melodramatic aspect prolongs an otherwise entertaining and jovially lightweight experience into a motion picture that doesn't quite know when to end. Then again, Spielberg's most important film (though JAWS is still his best!), SCHINDLER'S LIST, had the same problem. In that it was historical retribution, and here's it's the gobs of future-world exposition, which provides another slight roadblock. Making a sequel would be pretty logical since, having suffered through the many rules of the game, it'd be time to simply play along with those playing within the... by that time... familiar enough territory. Continuously Lean While We Go can be a genre nowadays. (cultfilmfreaks.com)"

","The best movie I've seen so far this year!! full of references from the most popular and the most beloved franchises of all time, Ready Player One offers something audiences have never seen before from the previous movies that makes nerds all around the world screaming in joy: a world where your favorite monsters, giant robots, video game martial artists, fighters, and MMORPG characters all exist in the same universe people called ""The Oasis"". <br/><br/>""The Oasis"" acts as some kind of a way for people to escape their miserable and horrible lifes since they can become anyone or anything they want without judgment or harassment that some people in the real world still have to deal with (Much like a kind of relieve and happiness you got when you find a water deposit in the middle of a vast desert after wandering around for days, hence the name ""The Oasis""). <br/><br/>The visual effect is so over the top that you can't get your sight on something else than the screen, the music fits really well, especially when they play the godzilla theme song when Mechagodzilla appeared, the racing scene is one hell of a heart-pumping experience that makes you feel like you are riding one of the ride till the end of the finish line.<br/><br/>one thing I notice that actually doesn't make sense is the fact that The Oasis is seemingly created by just one person since no one besides this person knows how to find the ""Easter Egg"" that contains half a trillion dollars and full access to the total control of the Oasis. I mean, even ""God of War"" needs a team of programmers to make, let alone a universe as vast as the Oasis.<br/><br/>So far, the audiences around me were having a good time laughing and cheering when their favorite childhood characters got mentioned or even appeared (like The Iron Giant, Gundam, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Harley Quinn, The Joker, Chun-Li, some characters from ""Overwatch"", etc).

"MrDHWong","9","0","4","29 March 2018"," A thrilling and fast-paced experience that only a director like Spielberg could handle so well
","Ready Player One is an action adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. Based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline, it is a thrilling and fast-paced experience that only a director like Spielberg could handle so well.<br/><br/>In a dystopian 2045, the world has become hugely overpopulated and derelict. As a form of distraction from the real world, many use an online virtual reality software known as the OASIS where they can live out their fantasies using an anonymous avatar to interact with other ""players"". One particular player, teenager Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), uses the OASIS to escape his boring life in the slums of Columbus, Ohio. After Jim Halliday (Mark Rylance), the creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind one final challenge for players to find three cryptically hidden keys which will grant them his entire fortune and full ownership of the OASIS itself. Wade enlists the help of some of his friends to find the keys before an evil conglomerate corporation can do so for themselves.<br/><br/>In the hands of a lesser director, Ready Player One could have easily been a mindless mess of pop culture references and nostalgic gaming imagery, but thankfully with Steven Spielberg at the helm, the film manages to work remarkably well in its own right. Rather than revel in its own self-referential nature, the film for the most part keeps its nostalgic allusions to a minimum, though admittedly it is still fun to pick out anything recognisable at times. Multiple viewings may be required to spot everything. The fast-paced action and narrative allow the film to feel much shorter than its actual running time of 140 minutes and the story never drags. The film itself serves a commentary on humanity's over-reliance on using technology to escape reality from both a positive and a negative perspective. The one major problem I felt was that some of the important supporting cast were underdeveloped and during the third act, this becomes annoyingly obvious. Within a few years, I am almost certain that Ready Player One will achieve cult status among gamers and film fans alike.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

","A film that reaches all audiences, that hits on a subject that everyone has to deal with, and that is told in the perfect way! Spielberg does it again! (Something he has probably heard more times than he can count...) From the beginning to the end, our attention is focused and held right where he wants it. Without a moment of lost interest, but filled with moments of relaxation to catch our breath. A masterpiece.
With moments in the film that reminded me of Indiana Jones and others of the Goonies, Spielberg found another classic. With his recent history of films not being the most memorable, he has found another classic. A film that will allow us to reminisce of his past brilliance, just like Ready Player One reminisces of the history of video games.
Now moving past the genius, the greatness continues as well. The acting was perfect for their roles. Were they all the next Daniel Day-Lewis? No. However, they were casted perfectly for the role they had to complete. Tye Sheridan played off the genius video game nerd that we expected. He fit the role, wasn't the best acting job, but because of the script and the directing he will soon get many more calls for work. He is placed in a position to succeed.
For a movie that hits close to many in the world today, they handled the subject with care, and also shined a light on both the positives and negatives of the new approaching medium. The ability for VR to consume an entire planet day in and day out was paired with the ability for a fake, online world to bring together people from all over the world. The film showed that the future is just like the past. Under the right control and management, anything can thrive. 
Ready Player One won't win Oscars, because popular family movies don't win Oscars. It didn't push any film boundaries. But it was a film that from the start you knew how it was going to end, but you never knew how you were going to get there. It made you doubt that you would even get the end we were all expecting. It kept us entertained, invested, and connected us to avatars and people that we wouldn't connect to outside the theater. 
Ready Player One, though it is only March, will be my favorite movie of the year."
"jeannefrancoise","9","0","4","29 March 2018"," Full entertainment and enjoyment of a beautiful movie-game
","Dear movie freaks, Steven Spielberg is still active to amaze us on movies. The newest one of his directed-movie title is Ready Player One. As titled, the movie is destined as movie for gamers, but also for all Spielberg and sci-fi lovers. We are getting to the point of the best cinematography, fast-developing characters, and adventure in this movie. For the cinematography, we could see the very high -rate of special effects and special features that only can be made by great movie producer companies. Well, Amblin Entertainment is behind this movie so we can expect all sci-fi effects in highest expectation. The main idea of scenario is quite different from other game-movies, because it includes the adventure, action, drama, and complex plots, based on only one genius head. In the ending of the movie, the audience will flow it up and a little bit forget about real life and maybe somehow we do not want this movie ends quickly because we can enjoy each scene and each scene is connected each other to lead us to the end. Here, Spielberg also combines the futuristic machines, technology, science, iconic figures, pop culture, and best selling-novel-cinema to its core of the story, so that we are getting into the amazing scenes of history of the human's culture of the technology itself.
The highlight point of the movie is that when the main characters are in war to complete the quest, yes it looks like Jumanji, but in some ways it fulls of comedy and also classic romance. In conclusion of this review, I love this movie, because it gives us the full entertainment and enjoyment of a beautiful movie-game."
