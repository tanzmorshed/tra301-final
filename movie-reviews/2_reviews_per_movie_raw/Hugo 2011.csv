","Since its release, I've been confused why Martin Scorsese made this film. I knew very little about it of course, only that it was an adventure movie about an orphan boy living in the walls of a Paris train station. It certainly doesn't sound very Scorsese-like.<br/><br/>However that is merely the framing for what is an ode to the earliest days of cinema, and in particular one of its true pioneers, Georges Melies. With references to ""Arrival of a Train"" – one of the world's first films by the Lumiere brothers, Melies's ""A Trip to the Moon"" and many others, this really is a treat for movie fans. Yes on a very basic level it is a children's movie, but really there's far more here for adults. Scorsese wonderfully juxtaposes his most technologically advanced film yet to demonstrate the genius and inventiveness of cinema in its earliest days. <br/><br/>There are fine performances from the two children, as well as Ben Kingsley as Melies and Sasha Baron Cohen as a determined and love struck station inspector. I actually thought that Helen McCrory stole the show as Melies' wife Mama Jeanne. <br/><br/>I never got to see Hugo in 3D, but the blu ray version looks truly sumptuous, with some breath taking imagery of early 20th century Paris. The film does tailor off significantly towards the end, with Scorsese seemingly unsure of what to do with the final act once the children had solved their mystery. What comes before is truly magical though and this film gets a big thumbs up from me."

","Martin Scorsese's HUGO is a family movie that will probably only cater to a niche crowd: people who appreciate movies as art (e.g. cinema snobs, though I use the term endearingly). I'm not saying it won't appeal to the general masses. It's still an interesting story, wonderfully acted, and packed with talent both in front of and behind the camera. But let's face it: this isn't your average movie, it's a love letter. Scorsese has been a vocal supporter of restoring old movies in hopes they'll be saved from oblivion (rightfully so) and this movie, based on a children's book by Brian Selznick, is his method of beautifully pleading his case before millions of people who've probably refuse to watch black and white movies on the basis that they're, you know, black and white (yes, I know those sorts of people). HUGO is a film meant to bring out attention to the movies long-forgotten and remind us of the magic behind them, told through the adventure of a young boy named Hugo Cabret. Hugo is an orphan whose father died in a museum fire, and he lives behind the walls of a Parisian train station. When he's not busy with his job of keeping the station clocks ticking, Hugo spends his time repairing an old automaton his father rescued from museum storage. An encounter with a curmudgeonly toy store owner and his granddaughter Isabelle will send Hugo on a journey to repair the automaton and discover its long-hidden secrets.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, this movie will only really appeal to certain people. Scorsese fans might be put off by the fact that this film is a family-friendly adventure; it doesn't exactly fall in line with Scorsese's usual subject matter. The family crowds will probably enjoy it, but younger children will likely be put off by it's slow pacing and lack of excitement. It's not so much an adventure as a journey of discovery, and little kids might not find themselves too involved in the story. My own daughter (4, going on 5) gave it an honest try when we sat down to watch it and made it 40 minutes or so before she fell asleep. Unfortunately, HUGO will probably be one of those films that fades into the background (if it hasn't already) and find most of it's loving coming from the film school crowds. The movie incorporates a loose interpretation of the life of Georges Méliès, a stage magician and an early innovator in world of cinema who realized the potential for the new medium of storytelling. At a time when most ""movies"" were just real-world situations recorded to celluloid (such as the famous train pulling into the station), Méliès created fantastic stories and mythical tales to entertain, filling his films with special effects and dramatic costuming. The movie focuses on the fact that so many of Méliès' films were lost over time and the tragedy of these classics from one of the earliest, most important filmmakers, ceasing to exist.<br/><br/>Scorsese makes his message perfectly clear in the final half of the movie, which happened to be my favorite part of the film. Ben Kingsley is Papa Georges (Méliès) and, in the film, he is a defeated man who mourns the death of his legacy following World War I. Kingsley is perfect here and the highlight of the movie. The children in the film, Asa Butterfield and Chloë Moretz, do a serviceable job but, as is usually the case with younger actors, their performances come off as forced and wooden most times. Even Moretz, who's performances I freakin' loved in KICK-ASS, doesn't feel real here. Maybe it's just that Scorsese isn't accustomed to working with younger talent and wasn't able to bring out the best in them, but it's a shame because the two of them are the key players in the movie. There's a handful of other minor roles filling out the film with talent: Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone, Jude Law, etc. My favorite would probably be Sascha Baron Cohen (yes, Borat) as the station inspector. With his Doberman patrolling by his side and the frame providing support for his bum leg, he was almost cartoonish. I loved him, and he was more than capable of toning down his usual eccentricity. HUGO is a movie with a lot to love, even more if you're a cinema snob. I really enjoyed it, but a slow first act and weak performances from the kids mean it's far from perfect. HUGO has my full recommendation for anyone who might want a glimpse into world of a true film-lover."
"eline-hoskens","7","23","28","2 August 2013"," Enjoyable and visually beautiful
","I watched this movie without any expectations and with an open mind. I thought it started off kind of slow but once you realise what the story is about, you really enjoy it. Having been a film student, I particularly liked where the story was going. I watched a great number of Georges Méliès movies during my studies. <br/><br/>Hugo has great cinematography and I loved the themes of insecurity and doubt and the idea that creative people sometimes need a push in the back from someone else in order to realise what they're worth. Hugo is a very original story, although it does not always feel very coherent. I remember being left with a feeling that some questions were left unanswered and some details didn't quite add up if you really thought about them. <br/><br/>Hugo had a Frenglish steam-punk feel to it that generally doesn't really appeal to me but that often surprises me in a good way (a bit like the professor Layton games). I would certainly recommend this movie."

","In the late 20's, in Paris, the orphan Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a lonely boy that lives hidden from the cruel Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) behind the walls of the train station, keeping the clocks working. He survives stealing breads, milk and other nourishment from the station stores. Hugo's father (Jude Law) was a watchmaker that had taught Hugo how to fix clocks and gadgets and died in a fire in his workshop. Then his alcoholic Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), who is the responsible for keeping the station clocks working but vanished months ago, brings Hugo to work with him. <br/><br/>Hugo is trying to fix an automaton, the only memorabilia he has from his father, stealing parts from the bitter and cranky owner of a toy store, Papa George (Ben Kingsley). However it is missing a heart-shaped key to make it work. Hugo believes that the robot possesses a last message from his father. When George holds Hugo, he takes a notebook from the boy with the notes that he is using to repair the automaton. <br/><br/>Hugo follows George and meets his granddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), who is raised by her grandparents after the death of her parents. Isabelle befriends Hugo seeking to live the adventure of her life. When Hugo sees that the girl has the key that he needs, he brings her to his hideout and the automaton works and draws a poster from 1902 George Méliès' film ""Le voyage dans la lune"". Hugo and Isabelle continue to research about the filmmaker and they find a hidden secret about George Méliès.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" is a wonder for any cinema lover, with a great tribute to George Méliès. Martin Scorcese delivers his best film after many years, with a wonderful story of a boy that fixes machinery and ends fixing the heart of an old man.<br/><br/>It is unbelievable that users without any cinema culture give low rating to a film that is a great homage to the silent movies, with many references along the story. The boy Asa Butterfield, from ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"", gives another excellent performance and the girl Chloë Grace Moretz, who has a lovely smile, shows a fantastic chemistry with Asa Butterfield.<br/><br/>It is intriguing that at least three movies nominated to the Oscar 2012 have points in common: ""The Artist"" is a film about the transition from the silent movie to the spoken films; ""Hugo"" is set in Paris in the late 20's and has references to actors, actresses and directors of the silent movies; and ""Midnight in Paris"" is also set in Paris in the 20's. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Invenção de Hugo Cabret"" (""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"")"
"Will_Malone","8","31","41","23 July 2012"," A simply glorious ode to early cinema
","It has taken me a long time to get round to watching Hugo, but I am so glad that I did. This is a wonderful and simply glorious ode to early cinema told through the eyes of Hugo (Asa Butterfield), an orphan who after the death of his clockmaker father (Jude Law) ends up living in the walls of a Parisian train station charged with winding the station's numerous clocks.<br/><br/>Hugo's only link back to his late father is through a majestic mechanical automaton, a sort of tin man which his father had been restoring in his spare time. As appears to be the way with all tin men this one is also missing a heart, but this time it is a heart shaped key which Hugo is convinced if he can find will unlock the secrets inside. This leads young Hugo on a dangerous but adventurous search which often lands him in the clutches of either the local shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley) or the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). Help is at hand though from the shopkeeper's god daughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) and as the two join forces they soon discover they have more in common than they thought.<br/><br/>In Hugo, Scorsese has produced a truly magical tale which sucks the viewer into the screen via the innovative use of 3D so immersing us within the dynamics of Parisian life and the wonders that take place within the walls of the station. Butterfield is perfectly cast as young Hugo, a curious young boy determined to survive in a hard and cold world which constantly seems to deal him a bad hand; you simply can't help but love him. Moretz after a slightly shaky start soon finds her feet (and her accent), Kingsley is excellent, especially as the story develops and there is strength in depth from a top notch supporting cast including Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone and Christopher Lee to name but a few.<br/><br/>Hugo's strength however is in its story, which effortlessly unfolds in front of you with real grace and elegance. Scorsese's love for the history of his craft and his desire to share this tale of early cinema is evident in every frame. Whilst it may not be the most historically accurate portrayal of cinematic history it has a true and good heart which beautifully captures the essence of what is cinema.<br/><br/>Some people have criticised Scorsese for creating a children's movie that is inaccessible for most children. I strongly disagree on this point. To me Hugo is a classic children's movie which works across all age spectrums, much in a similar vain to Spielberg's ET. In a world of Woody, Buzz, Jessie and meatballs that fall from the sky (which don't get me wrong are all fabulous in their own right), it is refreshing to see a children's movie of old. It feels like a magical Christmas movie to me, perfectly accessible and enjoyed by all.<br/><br/>Hugo is fully deserving of the many accolades that it picked up during the awards season. It is a wonderful and engaging film which I will show my children when they are a little older and I am certain they will fall in love with cinema in the same way their father need did so many years ago.<br/><br/>Review by Will Malone www.maloneonmovies.com"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","28","37","20 March 2012"," A Treat For Movie Buffs
","Like many, I suspect, I went into this film ready to be dazzled by the cinematography and a rare, nice clean story by Director Martin Scorcese. I wasn't disappointed although I found the story lagging in a few brief spots. Cutting the film another 10 minutes might have solved that. Having said that, though, a month later I'm all ready to view it again! <br/><br/>To me, the most interesting and amazing scenes were not involving the two young main characters and the railroad station, but the ones in the last 30-or-so minutes which dealt with very early films and how they made them. It was incredibly colorful and an education to film buffs everywhere. Anyone who loves movies and appreciates the history of the art should love the last part of this story.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the bulk of the story still offers many great sights and sounds and I have no quibbles with any of the actors. Youngsters Asa Butterfield (""Hugo"") and Cholë Grace Moretz (""Isabelle"") were both about 13 when they made this and seem to have good careers ahead of them. I didn't recognize Sacha Baron Cohen as the station inspector. He was great in that role. As for Ben Kingsley, when is he ever bland?<br/><br/>This is one of those ""family films"" that can be enjoyed just as much - and probably more - by adults. I wish Scorcese would make more of this kind of material."
"tomgillespie2002","7","23","30","26 February 2012"," Beautiful, accomplished and fun
","There must be something unifying in our globes collective consciousness, as 2011 saw two films that looked back at the cinematic past. Strangely, it took a French film maker, Michel Hazanavicius, to release a movie that pays homage to early, silent American cinema (The Artist). Conversely, Martin Scorsese, a well-known cinephile, delights with his love of early European silent cinema, in his often beautiful 'children's' film, Hugo.<br/><br/>Set in 1930's Paris, the main focus of this cinematic love is the work of the first movie magician, Georges Melies. We are introduced to Hugo (Asa Butterfield), a young man whose father left him a automaton after his death. It was a project that they worked on together, but never finished it. Hugo's main mission is to get the object working. As an orphan, Hugo hides in the rafters of a train station, maintaining the clocks that his drunken uncle used to do. After befriending a young girl, Isabelle (Chloe Moretz), he finally gets the automaton working, and it opens up a mystery that leads to the forgotten cinema of Melies (Ben Kingsley), now working on a store in the station.<br/><br/>The film shows love for silent cinema, and particularly the magic of Melies. Sacha Baron Cohen's station inspector is occasionally funny, and his character seems to be filtered through both Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau, and Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot, but he just doesn't seem to really progress at all, and feels almost like a filler character. Scorsese, like Robert Zemekis and Bob Gale before, reference that iconic Harold Lloyd moment in Safety Last! (1923), as Hugo hangs from a clock face.<br/><br/>Like so many others who speculate about the choices of Oscar nominations, Hugo, I feel, is not a contender for the best picture Oscar. There were some far better films produced in 2011. That said, the film is beautiful, accomplished , and often fun. Also, the resurgence of interest in a forgotten father of cinema, is completely touching, and leaves a warm feeling in the heart. Unfortunately, I did not see this in 3D; as far as I am aware, Scorsese uses it to brilliant degrees, so perhaps this would have made the experience perfect (despite the fact that I care not for the dimensions of 3.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Saw it today in a sneak preview today at the Director's Guild in LA. James Cameron who was there professed it's a masterpiece and the best 3D to date. And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of Scorsese's films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody. Sasha Baron Cohen is a brilliant and hilarious standout as the twitchy constable. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone."

","""If you've ever wondered where your dreams come from, just look around. This is where they're made.""<br/><br/>Hugo Cabret's story was told so well that it felt like you were right there with him on his stunning adventure.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar, this is the story about a young boy named Hugo. He lives inside the walls of a train station in Paris in the 1930's. His father dies, leaving behind a mysterious automaton that, when fixed, can write. Hugo makes it his mission to fix it, believing that it will reveal a message from his father. With the help of an eccentric girl named Isabelle, he tries to uncover a magical mystery about the old man at the toy booth (Isabelle's godfather) and enchanting early films.<br/><br/>I had been looking forward to this film for a very long time, and I was not disappointed at all. I was a bit unsure about the 3D at first, but it turned out to be superb. Every single object became part of the story, and the audience became immersed in this beautiful world created by Martin Scorsese and Brian Selznick. While every member of the cast was brilliant, there are two in particular I'd like to point out. <br/><br/>First, Asa Butterfield as Hugo. He carried the film with perfection and gave a truly incredible performance. His acting was very natural--you could hardly tell he was acting! He did an amazing job of bringing life to a complex, lost, sad character. Asa is one of the most talented young actors I've ever seen; a very likely Oscar nomination in his future. <br/><br/>Last (but certainly not least) is Chloe Grace Moretz. She is another young performer that never fails to amaze me. Chloe nailed the British accent and brilliantly portrayed a bright, energetic Isabelle. <br/><br/>This movie has it all: beautiful visuals, super-talented cast, magic, love, heart, feeling, emotion. Best Picture Nomination for sure, and quite possibly others. Overall, this movie is a must-see. It was the most enjoyable theater experience that I've ever had. The entire theater broke into applause once it ended. This film has something for all ages, and it's really something special. <br/><br/>Especially if you love adventure, mystery, wonder, and have a bright imagination, you will fall in love with this film just like I did.<br/><br/>""Come and dream with me."""

","Martin Scorcese's new film, Hugo is one of the best cinematic experience, I've had in years. The 3D is just simply astounding and the best I have ever seen in a movie. The visual effects, cinematography, art direction, just technically superb. Finally a smart, awe-aspiring family film, which are really rare nowadays. A definite surprise coming from legendary director, Martin Scorcese, who's known for movies with a lot of swears, violence, drugs and other adult-themed subjects.<br/><br/>The acting was really good and completely convincing. Asa Butterfield delivers a very committed performance as Hugo Cabret, and he shows a lot of promise in his future career. Chloë Grace Moretz, also gives a fine and respectable performance. Sacha Baron Cohen is surprisingly very effective as Station Inspector. Ben Kingsley gives the best performance in the whole movie, he is just superb and deserves some recognition. Overall, the whole cast was top notch.<br/><br/>Eyes may be the window to the soul, but movies are the projection of our dreams, according to ""Hugo"" that is. Martin Scorsese's first attempt at a children's film might be over most of their adolescent heads, but this founding member of the ""Movie Brats"" might've just concocted a delectable cinematic treat that speaks to most film lovers' surrealist commitment to the big screen. In retrospect, it works, and this enchanting flick is one of the best of the year."
"achsaphillippi8","3","373","625","29 November 2011"," A Visual Masterpiece, but Lacking in Everything Else
","Martin Scorsese's first kid's movie falls short of its expectations. After seeing the trailers, my family and I had very high expectations for this movie, and we eagerly went out and saw it in the theaters. We walked out extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>First of all, the trailers were completely misleading. My first impression was that the movie was about a boy trying to uncover a great mystery left behind in the wake of his father's death. I thought the movie was going to open up into an enchanting adventure, complete with suspense, action, and magic. I didn't get any of those things. This movie starts out will a long build-up, with the audience waiting for this magical adventure to get underway, only to keep them waiting for another hour or so, where nothing interesting or magical happens.<br/><br/>The pacing in the movie is terrible. The movie opens with some stunning visuals, the camera panning over the Paris cityscape and eventually showing us around the train station where the protagonist, Hugo, lives. We get the story of his father's death, and are left with a sense of wonder. We want to know what the automaton is for, why Ben Kingsely's character is so bitter, and what this adventure Hugo promises his little gal-friend is and when it's going to happen. The movie starts and stops, then drags for a bit, then starts, and drags for a long time before grinding to an unsatisfying halt. The adventure doesn't happen. All that waiting around... for nothing.<br/><br/>I don't really know what to say about the acting in this movie. Most of the actors had good moments and bad moments. The dialog was lacking. The characters spent more time staring at each other than actually talking. Some of the facial expressions and emotional reactions were a little on the melodramatic side. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Ben Kingsley gets pissy because the two kids find out that he used to make movies? Hugo throws a fit because the automaton didn't work as he expected to? I don't think these were appropriate responses to their situations.<br/><br/>The one good thing I have to say about this movie is that the visuals were absolutely gorgeous. From the cold blue lighting in the snowy outdoor scenes, to the orange-y warmth of the train station, to the powerful metallic essence of the gears and clockwork in the tower, this movie has some of the best 3D effects that I've seen since that awful, shallow Avatar. The problem is, the magical visuals cannot make up for the drab and very UN-magical story.<br/><br/>Overall, the magical, engaging adventure the trailers promised does not exist. The movie's pace is very slow. Some of the acting is questionable. The visuals were good, but they didn't save the movie. Do not go to this movie expecting something with substance. And definitely do not bring your kids to this movie; they will be bored to tears."
"SheerLight","9","99","157","25 November 2011"," Beautiful film for cinema fans
","Someone compared this movie to a Hans Christian Andersen tale and I think this is about as good a comparison as it gets. Some people find it boring and painful, others are mesmerized and inspired by the story it tells and the way it does so. In short, if you prefer Disney's version of the little mermaid story, you will likely be disappointed by Hugo.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you like the attention to detail and the not entirely happy endings of Andersen's classic short stories, you will probably find that Hugo is a captivating film that is hard to describe in a few words. It really lives in a lot more than three dimensions.<br/><br/>If you also happen to be a cinema fan, you will love it even more. What is a cinema fan? It's person that appreciates films for more than just their entertainment value. The way movies are made, the different layers of audio, visuals, emotions, symbols, the photography, the standout supporting casts, the way you can predict the cliché moves sometimes, but love it anyway. We love the good movies, like the bad ones, and films like Hugo make our hearts sing.<br/><br/>One last note on the use of 3D. I usually avoid 3D versions of movies because that feature has not yet proved itself to be more than just a gimmick. In Hugo's case, it is still partially true. I watched it in 3D and the opening sequence in the train station as well as a couple other select shots were exceptionally staged for 3D. Aside from that though, you get used to the effect and thankfully, it's the story that stays in the center of attention, followed by beautiful cinematography, characters, and 3D is trailing humbly behind. If you have the opportunity, watch the 3D version, but you will not really love it in 2D any less."
"PhillipMichaelH","10","221","367","23 November 2011"," Beautiful!!
","I just returned home after seeing Hugo on opening day and if I can describe this film in one word, it would be beautiful. This film has inspired me in ways that I can't even begin to explain. It's been a while since I've seen a film that spoke to me as personally as this film did. I'm a fan of Martin Scorsese and he's crafted a beautiful ode to not only cinema but also imagination and in a way, it celebrates all the things that help us escape. The world is a scary place and everyone goes through pain and suffering but if you just try and learn to dream, find your voice and not be afraid then you would be surprised what could happen.<br/><br/>I love how this film tells the amazing story of pioneer filmmaker Georges Melies who many of today's directors such as Steven Spielberg and James Cameron owe everything to. I love his films and I own a box set of his work, it's wonderful to see more people be introduced to him and the magic he created that continues to capture the imagination of many.<br/><br/>So if you love the cinema and magic then I highly recommend this masterpiece. Hugo is really something special I think."

This is the same man who gave us ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" Every detail enriches our experience. Dante Ferreti's production design is, monumental, costumes, photography and Howard Shore's score are, quite simply, breath taking.

","There's no denying that 3D has almost never looked this sharp, but there are plenty of films out there where it doesn't call this much attention to itself; it enhances the cosmetic aspect of the film; it hardly does much for the weak adaptation of the novel. In ""Hugo"", as it is the case in many of the of Scorcese's films, technological improvements throw his film out of balance, and this is the beginning of the many flaws in this project.<br/><br/>The art direction and costumes are breathtaking, immersing the audience in the right period, though it has barely any of the charm and magic that made another film set Paris this year so successful. In that other film, all the scenes in the various periods are evocative and involving. Here the experience is as cold as a disorganized display in the best museum. It doesn't have much impact on its audience. Some of the scenery could be an exact imitation of the original inspiration. There were a couple of times when the visuals blend perfectly with a few of the clips that are integrated in the film.<br/><br/>The problem is the almost absolute lack of warmth in the various relationships between many of the main characters and the way they are directed in this movie. The young man at the heart of the film feels at time as another piece of furniture in the set. When I walked into the theater, many of the people weren't sure if we were watching an animated film or a live action production because they said the actors looked funny. The feel feels so cold in its adaptation of a very interesting literary piece, a book so charming with its integration of words and its simple black and white adaptation. To be fair it is hard to look away because it is so gorgeous, but at the same time, the disappointment hits hard because this is a film that should relies heavily in the sense of wonder usually associated with children's films and/or young performers. Earlier this year ""Super 8"" and ""Real Steel"" benefited immensely from the outstanding work and charisma of their young performers. The Elle Fanning scene in ""Super 8"" puts everything in this film to shame. Where both of those films project warmth, innocence,and a great variety of emotions, ""Hugo"" never becomes multidimensional, a big irony, considering its best quality is the nearly perfect 3-D visuals. To make things worse, two other projects involving literacy and story telling, made by Cuaron (""A Little Princess"") and Petersen (""The Never Ending Story"") have shown that its is possible to blend reality and magic, with the help of the right approach and the appropriate performances.<br/><br/>In addition to the lack of emotional magic on the screen, the pacing in ""Hugo"" is so slow it borders on catatonic, dragging for most of its two hours. We finally arrive to the last third of the film, a place where the film finally comes alive; suddenly, Scorcese pours his heart in the film, using original film clips and beautiful recreations of the original sources from various classic films of early French cinema. These are breathtaking, as they play, one after another, showing us the sense of wonder original audiences must have experienced. Finally, one is almost overpowered as Toto was in several scenes of ""Cinema Paradiso"" as the director viewed the treasured collage in the final scene of that movie, or as the young protagonist of ""A Little Princess"" told her magic stories set in exotic India, infused with her own imagination and simple stop motion work. Petersen went even further with the seamless blend of the young man, as he becomes a part of the literary experience, and one realized how powerful the magic in the written word can be. Very little of that exists in ""Hugo"", a shiny package, with a rock for a heart.<br/><br/>Scorcese has done much for the preservation of cinema, and the original source of this film lent itself to a cinematic production to support his cause, but just like Spielberg chooses other people to direct some of his projects, much more could have been achieved by handing this property to a more suited director, a person who understands innocence, wonder, how important it is to get inside the hearts of people, opposed to working with projects where the main characters are notorious for not having one. Rarely Scorcese has shown in his movies any sort of affection for or between his characters, ""Alice doesn't live here anymore"" is a rare exception, and children in it are a bit on the precocious side. Come to think about it, Law showed much more emotion in ""A.I."" as he interacted with the marvelous Osment, and both of them were playing automatons.<br/><br/>A big disappointment."

Yet with the misleading advertising, the story that goes nowhere, and with over 2 hour runtime it is one hell of a boring movie.<br/><br/>Please do not believe 8.3 IMDb and 94% RT ratings, this movie one of the most overrated movies in the history of the film, the word 'history' is the key one here. When everything is said and done Hugo reveals itself as nothing but a cleverly disguised homage to one of the French pioneering movie directors, a subject interesting primarily for the movie history buffs.<br/><br/>As I said Hugo is hugely misrepresented in advertising. Every poster tells you that some Narnia type adventure is awaiting you. All the trailers were masterfully crafted to leave you with expectation of magical miracle. The words like 'quest' and 'mystery' are a part of Hugo's brief description on each and every site, just read what it says on IMDb. Furthermore the word ""adventure"" is lavishly sprinkled throughout the Hugo's first part. And yes, great Martin Scorsese is behind all of it, so what should you expect but a magical adventure on a grandeur scale ? <br/><br/>Sorry, you will get none of that. Yes, Hugo is like a charming 3D French postcard, but its not worth looking at for over 2 hours. 3D effects are well done, yet absolutely not required for this story that never leaves the setting of Paris train station.<br/><br/>While plot has some holes, the elephant in the room is that pretty much nothing happens in the movie with all these mechanical dolls, golden keys, and the visually rich Dickensian atmosphere. And be sure, there is absolutely no magic, or any type of adventure hidden here.<br/><br/>I am giving Hugo just one star to counter misleading ads and all those hypists that ether work for the studio, or easily hypnotized by big director's name. Please have few good games on your smartphone and bring a thermos with coffee if you decide to go see this snoozefest, you will need it."
"shoolaroon","1","275","486","4 December 2011"," A HUGO Disappointment - Melies made better movies than this
","I was frankly stunned at how BAD this movie is. The 3D is very well done, but like all the clockwork and machines the movie revels in, ""Hugo"" is technically brilliant, moves like an elegant automaton, and has NO heart or soul. It is dead and hollow within.<br/><br/>The ""plot"" is confusing, the script seems to be more dictated over a cell phone than written, the lead character looks like an animated corpse, and it is DULL, DULL, DULL, DULL, DULL. My boyfriend actually fell asleep. It is terrible that a technique such as 3D seems to have totally eliminated the need for a decent plot, script, characters, motivation and some essence of believability. Scorsese also has to re-learn the use of editing as the movie is too long by at least a half hour, and the pace limps slower than the villainous station cop's leg.<br/><br/>The acting was competent except for Sacha Baron Cohen who is nearly unwatchable as the aforementioned gendarme - if he would only get a wooden leg it would match the rest of his performance.<br/><br/>The ""plot"" manipulates emotions rather than inspires them, and is unbelievably pedantic. It's like watching Scorsese lecture a Film 101 class. ***SPOILER?*** I could not believe the scene in the library where the children actually PULL OUT A BOOK and start lecturing the audience about the history of movies up to that point. Stunningly awful.<br/><br/>The great irony is that George Melies made FAR FAR FAR greater movies, even with his limited technology than this putrid piece of dreck. ""Hugo"" is a shameful waste of $170 million dollars. The Melies clips are the ONLY part of this debacle that have life, art, wit, color, and are actually entertaining.<br/><br/>PULEEEZZZZZ....Marty....put down the camera for GOOD, and stay in the lecture hall. You have lost the ability to make captivating, interesting movies that speak to normal, living people. If you want to make a movie about Melies, or educate the audience....make a documentary."
"dslowen","1","274","488","8 January 2012"," who's reviewing this??
","A movie about the silent film industry with an automaton set in a train  station? Sounds good doesn't it. This was a movie with potential, but  it fell short so much so that I'm not going to waste my time giving it  a detailed, complete critique. So here's the bullet points: The  transitions were horrendous. The scenes jumped so much that half the  time i didn't know where the characters were or where they were going.  The boy who played Hugo was terrible. He was hired for his blue-sad eye  stare. That was it, no range of emotion past the stare.  The Station Inspector was a strange character. When you make an injured  war veteran the comic relief (not in a heartwarming way, but a feels  awkward to laugh at his injury sort of way) there's something wrong.  Pitiable and sad to hear others in the theater laugh at him.  The dialog was vapid and moronic. ""Everything has a purpose in life...  even machines"". Well ya, machines have a purpose otherwise we wouldn't  bother having them!! I could bury myself with all the plot holes in  this movie. Nuf said.  Overall no heart to the story. I can't waste anymore time reviewing  this disappointing movie. Bottom line: Don't bother."
"simply-232-561758","3","99","168","6 December 2011"," Disappointing
","It's hard to see who this film is aimed at. It isn't a children's film as they would be bored rigid within 20 minutes let alone over 2 hours.<br/><br/>It hardly appeals to adults as the storyline is childish. The humour is predictable and poorly delivered.<br/><br/>The action is slow and dreary for most of the film and the acting by most of the cast is amateur. Sasha Baron Cohen in particular lends nothing to his character and is poorly cast in the role.<br/><br/>There are serious gaffs in the film, particularly the one where Hugo is on the railway line and the speeding train is headed towards him. The question is why would a speeding train be on the line as the railway line is a dead end anyway and there are buffers there On the plus side the cinematography is excellent but this is the films only plus point and can't save it from being very disappointing."
"judyandjoanie55","10","149","261","23 November 2011"," Brilliance, wonder, magic, heart, a bit of everything.
","So I saw this film today, and I was blown away. I'll admit that the trailer didn't impress me much, and if you do come out of it thinking that Hugo is just for kids, it's not. It's so much more than that. I had heard of Martin Scorsese directing a 3-D picture, but I didn't realize it was this very adaptation. The book was a wonderful experience (go read it - the pictures within are like a film by itself!), and I can't believe I didn't think the 3-D medium would work for it.<br/><br/>Absolutely brilliant. From the very first scene, you get a sense of how Scorsese is able to tap into the charm of 3-D - the essence of it - which is so easily lost amidst the abundance of films that get slapped with the 3-D label, but in a less cash-greedy industry need not warrant the extra surcharge. Scorsese takes his time to immerse the audience in Paris, in the train station, in Hugo's everyday surroundings that may seem almost ordinary to him by this point but for us, it's a whole different world. At times I forgot I was watching a live-action film because some of it was just so vibrant (yes, even with the automatic dimming of your 3-D glasses).<br/><br/>The cast was wonderful - Asa Butterfield as the main lead, has got such expressive eyes that you feel the hurt when he thinks of his father (played by Jude Law), which is very often. Chloe Moretz partners him very well as a fellow adventurer, and of course, you've also got: Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helen McCrory, etc. to round out the characters.<br/><br/>It's such a fantastical but genuine story that you can't help but fall in love with it, I think. Scorsese has brought a boy's dream to life but also written a love letter to film-making. I won't spoil anything outside of the trailer for fear of diminishing the magic, but I needed to write a somewhat coherent review to get my thoughts down, and hopefully persuade more people to watch the film! There's heart, there's magic, there's wonder, there's enjoyment, there's a little bit of everything for everyone to love in this. Some parts had me misty-eyed with the wonderful score and the ode to the joy of film.<br/><br/>And I know the mandatory 3-D will deter people but this film is one of those rare ones (and at the moment the only film so far this year that I can think of) that extols the virtue of 3-D. I WEAR GLASSES SO I HAVE TO PUT 3-D GLASSES OVER MY OWN PAIR AND I WASN'T ANNOYED AT ALL - IT WAS WELL WORTH IT. So I'm speaking for that crowd right now. I know there are plenty of us out there! The genius of Scorsese strikes here, so pop in and have an adventure. :)"
"E Canuck","8","97","170","22 November 2011"," The D in 3D stands for dimensions
","What Martin Scorcese has managed to do is add story dimensionality to a family film that has 3D technology. Some of the dimensions he's included which don't always make into Hollywood blockbusters are an imaginative and original concept, thematic unity and resonance and deft homage to film itself, in the story of Georges Méliès, French film pioneer.<br/><br/>Saw the film in an advance screening and we were among the many there who were obviously not standard family film consumers. This being a Scorcese film is likely to bring lots of adults to Hugo and I would think many of them, like me, will feel the film stands up as entertainment for all age groups.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the resonance and intricacy of the theme of clocks, clockworks, animatronics and ""the ghost in the machine""--our fear, in the post industrial age that perhaps we are just a rather complex machine, rather than a divine creation. This is all beautifully rendered cinematically. I doubt the little ones will be bewildered while older viewers can pick out levels and layers in the film.<br/><br/>Good fun and visually interesting throughout. The 3D is used in service of the story. I hope Hollywood is watching and notices that special effects are only special when they get the heart of the machine working, like Hugo's little man."
"doubleosix","10","240","444","9 November 2011"," Scorsese's first movie for kids is a Masterpiece
","I attended the DGA screening over the weekend, followed by a Q&A moderated by James Cameron. Cameron's first words (after correctly referring to Scorsese as ""maestro""), were ""I thought we'd just geek out over 3D for a half hour, but having seen the movie... it's a masterpiece."" I brought my ten year old daughter, who sat -- if anything -- even more transfixed than I did. Every single image is arresting, the use of 3D is perfection itself, the story is engaging and thrilling and heartbreaking and uplifting and I never wanted it to end. If only it'd be three hours! All the performances are excellent, including the kids. Great British actors appear in roles with only a line or two, but it helps lift the movie into the realm of Instant Classic, and Sacha Baron Cohen brings nuance and heart to his humorous role as the Station Inspector. On the way to the car my daughter asked if we could get the blu-ray when it's available, and I had the same feeling as well."

Hugo's father was a watchmaker and he has inherited his father's talents for all things mechanical . During the early scene which introduces the interior of the train station , there are appearances by characters representing Django Reinhardt, James Joyce, and Winston Churchill . On his adventures , Hugo meets with a shopkeeper , George Melies (Ben Kingsley based his characterization of 'Georges Mèliès' on Martin Scorsese) who works in the train station , a nasty Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) , a librarian (Christopher Lee) and a beautiful woman (Emily Mortimer) who has a flower shop . Hugo befriends Melies's ward, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) , and together they have a lot of adventures , one that centers around Melies and wife (Helen McCrory) .<br/><br/>One of the most legendary directors of our time , Martin Scorsese's first PG rated film in 18 years , takes you on an extraordinary adventure full of amusement and entertainment . This is an impressive production with awesome scenarios , groundbreaking set design and over-the-top 3D visual effects , being the first movie in this system directed by Martin Scorsese . The opening track shot of the city ending at the train station was the very first shot designed and it took one year to complete , it required 1000 computers to render each frame required for the shot . Brian Selznick book's imagination is brought to life with top-notch computer generator special effects . Marvelous performances by the entire casting as Butterfield as an orphan who lives in a Paris railway station, Grace Moretz as a likable little girl who befriends and helps Hugo and of course the great Ben Kingsley as the magician George Melies . It packs amazing fantasy , breathtaking adventures and overwhelming images that convey us a sense of wonder and surprise . Provides enough amusement to keep the hands on your seat and dazzling eyes until the moving ending . The film displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Robert Richardson , winning the Oscar's cinematographic category for this film meaning that he and Vittorio Storaro are the only present living cinematographers to win the award 3 times . The picture pays tribute to George Melies , in fact in flashbacks we see Georges Méliès staging his productions with lavishly colored sets and costumes. As the real Méliès only used sets, costumes and make-up in grayscale, since colored elements might turn out the wrong shade of gray on black and white film , many of the prints were then hand tinted in post-production. <br/><br/>Emotive and imaginative musical score by Howard Shore . This enjoyable story is lavishly produced by Johnny Depp , Barbara De Fina and the same Scorsese . This Martin Scorsese movie won the same number of Academy Awards as Scorsese's ¨The Aviator¨ totaling five . Both were nominated for Best Picture and Best Director Oscars but lost out. The film also won the same number of Oscars in the same year as ¨The Artist¨ , both films examined silent cinema . Rating : Very good , better than average . Essential and indispensable watching ."

","It is overwhelming to see the latest film by the old master. Not an ounce of jadedness from the artist who gave us ""Raging Bull"" The love from Scorsese to his profession is palpable, tangible, visual and ultimately contagious. 3D, who ever thought we'll see a Scorsese film in 3D. Well, this is like no other 3D film. The device is used organically and we're part of the story. completely. The opening shot is one of the mos beautiful I've ever seen.

"inkblot11","8","8","10","16 January 2013"," Quite beautiful, a film where ""images are everything""; could have used a sharper edit, however
","Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan in Paris around 1930. His father (Jude Law) died in a tragic accident and several weeks ago, the lad's rather good-for-nothing uncle passed, too. Wanting to keep the news of his ""home alone"" status a secret, especially from a train station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), Hugo continues winding the large station clock, something his uncle was hired to do. Naturally, the young boy has resorted to being a pickpocket and a fruit snatcher to survive. Gifted mechanically, Hugo steals tools from a toy shop owner, Georges (Ben Kingsley) and, one day, is caught with a five finger discount. Very upset, the grouchy toyman takes away Hugo's prized notebook, a gift from his late dad. Terribly distraught, Hugo makes several attempts to reason with the old man. Fortunately, M. Georges has a ward, a girl named Isabelle, who is about Hugo's age. She wants to help Hugo in his endeavors. Well and good, thinks Hugo. But, M. Georges has many secrets, and the closer the young pair get to them, the angrier the toyshop owner becomes. He is even somehow connected to an automaton which Hugo's father was trying to restore. Also, although the Inspector has caught the admiration of a pretty flower seller (Emily Mortimer), he continues to haul young orphans off to institutions. What are the secrets of M. Georges? Will Hugo uncover them before he is caught in the inspector's net? First, this quite a beautiful film and such a change from Scorsese's last brilliant effort, Shutter Island. Although I was not fortunate enough to view the movie in 3-D, the scenery is breathtaking and the camera shots are equally so. Also, the cast is remarkable, with Kingsley, Butterfield, Mortimer, and particularly Cohen, enlivening the happenings. The story is also strong, especially its eventual glimpse into the world of silent cinema. Therefore, the film's weaknesses are its slow pace and far-from-sharp editing. Yes, Scorsese probably found it difficult to ""slice away"" beautiful images, but the flick would have benefited if he had. But, by no means should you skip Hugo. Its riches can be enjoyed by the entire family and everyone will bask in the bountiful imagery that is indeed, head turning."

Ben Kingsly looks seriously bored all the way through; certainly the film does not stretch his talents at all. Sacha B C tries a style of slapstick that is inferior and derogatory to any disabled person.

"secondtake","8","14","20","24 March 2012"," A fantasy, a children's dream, and a very adult appreciation of a brilliant filmmaker
","Hugo (2011)<br/><br/>This would have been my vote for Best Picture for 2011, especially if you limit the voting to nostalgic visions of silver screen history. This sort of does exactly what ""The Artist"" does, paying loving homage to early movies, ""Hugo"" is so much more imaginative, filmed with overflowing ingenuity and fluidity (it is a Scorsese movie I know), and it pays respects more directly and beautifully.<br/><br/>Yes, this really is a love letter to the first decade of mature movies before ""Birth of a Nation"" and full feature films. Here we rediscover the short cinematic (very cinematic) inventions of French filmmaker Georges Melies. Never heard of him? Well, that's why you should see this movie. At times it almost plays like a fabulous documentary (to its detriment as a movie, but to the benefit of Melies), so you do learn quite a lot about this man. And it's mostly accurate. Things that get stretched for the sake of the movie are reasonable enough. <br/><br/>(By the way, a little known reference to Melies, charming and beautifully done, occurs in the otherwise flawed ""Klimt"" and is worth watching just for those scenes.) <br/><br/>There is a feeling that this is a children's adventure, but even more than ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" this is a movie for adults, and kind of about adults, too. The two leading kids--a girl and a boy--are terrific but in that child actor way where they fill their roles perfectly (not like, say, the slightly older Judy Garland in ""Wizard of Oz""). The adults are not quite caricatures, and make the film have a lot of depth, but they are kept in check by the children's storytelling aspect to the whole enterprise.<br/><br/>Whatever the limitations there, it's the filming, the sets and costumes and moving camera and special effects, always kept in check, that make the movie special. If you are interested in the also-rans of the Oscar season, this is the first to see. If you want to just have an enjoyable bit of escapist and light hearted filmmaking, this is a must. And if you are curious about Melies, there is no better place to start."
"chuck-526","8","11","15","1 December 2011"," homage to the invention of movies
","This movie is a homage to the invention of movies (especially to Georges Mèliés). For all I know, much of this is available to film school students; for the rest of us, this is as good as it will ever get, far better than even serious amateur cinephiles have much chance of seeing. Hugo is a real live breathing movie, not at all a pedantic history lesson or a viewing of archival footage; but all those history lessons and archival footage are woven in.<br/><br/>I happened to be reading a book on the history of film when I saw this, and several of the still photographs from the book came alive as fully moving pictures occupying the whole screen: Arrival of a Train, Workers Leaving the Lumiére Factory, A Trip to the Moon, The Great Train Robbery, Intolerance, and more that I didn't immediately recognize. There are also bits of early animation techniques: a ""flip book"" and a ""lightning sketch"" drawn live on stage. We're shown a library and museum of very old movie research and memorabilia and equipment, including a hand cranked projector with a a rotating butterfly shutter wheel to block the light between frames.<br/><br/>The production is thoroughly modern, using giant realistic sets with hundreds of extras and some CGI magic. (One nice bit of CGI is watching a glass studio building age over several years in real life from proud use to derelict, very believably and all in the space of only about twenty seconds of screen time.) There's no feeling of being confined to either a sound stage or a frame here; there are believable aerial views of Paris nearly a century ago.<br/><br/>At the same time as the film is thoroughly modern, the story ""feels"" like those very first movies: Many of the principal characters wear garish colored costumes that stand quite apart from what everyone else is wearing, reminiscent of the way some of those old movies were hand-tinted. The sets are huge and unmistakably simple, yet intimately detailed at the same time. Each bit of architecture in isolation is quite believable, yet taken all together it can only be a fantasy. Today we'd call the story a melodrama; the personalities of the principal characters are exaggerated; and there are plenty of thrilling foot-chases and sight gags. Things are not so far over-the-top as to be hard to believe, yet they're plain enough so it would be clear what the general outline of the plot is and who the ""bad guy"" is even if there weren't any sound. (Yet, there are a few things not found in the old movies too: one would never expect to find any Freudian personality subtleties in old movies, yet here they are in ""our"" movie.) <br/><br/>What we see is a seamless combination of new footage of this movie, clips of restorations of old movies, and thoroughly convincing modern recreations of parts of old movies. The blending is always believable and realistic: For one example, many of the restoration clips are screened as movies within the movie. For another example, some of the characters in what appear to be old movies are recognizably the same as the characters in the ""new"" movie. For a third example, a few times the camera starts by showing us a bit of an old movie, but then draws back to show us the whole old studio creating that bit (including quite a few insights into early special effects).<br/><br/>A few visual idioms are repeated to emphasize they're still current: First we're shown the original, then we're shown how it fits into a modern story. The man hanging precariously from the hands of a high outdoor clock may be the best example. First some of the characters sit in a movie theater and watch the original on the screen. That fairly long screening shows what leads up to it, with scaling a brick wall, standing on a ledge, and a bit of slapstick with a window that opens by revolving. Later, one of the characters in ""our"" movie hides by going outdoors and hanging from the hands of a tower clock we're familiar with in ""our"" movie."

"billygoat1071","10","35","58","17 February 2012"," For The Love of Movies
","Hugo is known as Martin Scorsese's first film that is suitable for all ages. In the trailers and movie posters, some may think it's just another Family/Adventure film. But it's more than that. Hugo is Scorsese's love letter to movies. Bringing back the classic style and showing why movies are magnificently wonderful. It's an extraordinary Scorsese film. The performances are charming and there are plenty of sweetness in them. Everything else is spectacular. Hugo is a reminder why we watch and love movies.<br/><br/>But Hugo is not entirely about movies. The main story is about an orphan boy named Hugo Cabret who manages the train station's clocks and steals machine parts to fix his father's automaton. The film is introduced in a classic style. An exposition to the characters with little dialogue. While the plot goes, there's the life of Georges Méliès. Both stories of Hugo and Méliès are told together. But the first half is about Hugo. Last half is about Méliès. Both in the middle. Their stories are told in a strange clever way. But it has plenty of emotions and wonder.<br/><br/>Asa Butterfield is good as Hugo. His performance is better in the emotional moments. Chloë Moretz always gives a lot of personality and soul to her roles. Her and Butterfield are simply charming. But the best goes to Ben Kingsley. He's always been a great actor. He's just wonderful as Georges Méliès. All the credit definitely goes to Martin Scorsese. He expresses his love to cinema movies and shows its history. It often explores its eye-candy spectacles. There are fun silent comedy and romance from the minor characters.<br/><br/>It's all recapturing the old style of movies even without making it black and white or using old fashion score. 3D is usually used for large scale adventure films or action movies but Hugo used it to show its spectacular visuals and it works great. The production design is splendid. Same goes to the music score. Everything you see in this film is just gorgeous.<br/><br/>Hugo is for the people who love movies. But the center story is really about a kid who can fix stuff and wanted to be a part of this world. They just suddenly talked about movies in the second act and ends with Méliès' story. It's not a bad thing. There are plenty of love and joy here in Hugo. And it makes a wonderful Family Film."
"TomTomH","8","13","19","10 June 2012"," A well-scripted, masteredly directed and a spectacular 3D extravaganza that deserved to win Best Picture!
","Last December I saw 'Hugo' with my friend and it's one of the best films I've ever seen. The set design is fantastic, the special effects are unbelievable, the relationships between the characters are lovable. But most of all that's special about this masterpiece is the brand new pure 3D. This film is the next step up to 3D. Cinematographer Robert Richardson did some perfectly good shots where the 3D would stand out. It really feels like your actually inside Hugo's adventure. Loads of stuff come towards you. It's actually the best 3D film I've ever seen. I thought the effect was better than Cameron's 'Avatar' and should've been shot also with Imax 3D cameras as well. Scorsese has the soul of master storytelling. An artist that's switched from violence to magic. A love poem for the magic of cinema. It brings back long-time true stories and old film clips that could've been lost. A Parisian orphan boy, a mechanical man and a bookworm girl who've been wrapped up into a mystery from his late father. The main people that worked so hard on this film are mostly Martin Scorsese, Graham King, John Logan, Robert Richardson, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo and mostly the author that wrote and all of this into one book, Brian Selznick who's got an enchanted mind of clocks, mechanical men, 1930's, mystery and magical twists. By the time you've finished watching you'll be able to have the true feeling of cinema."
"TheHighVoltageMessiah","8","48","85","23 November 2011"," ""If you ever wondered where your dreams come from, you look around. This is where they're made.""
","Upon seeing the trailer for ""Hugo"", I wasn't overly impressed. The blaring emphasis on 3D made me worried it was more spectacle than substance. Still, it was directed by Martin Scorsese, and had Ben Kingsley in it, so I decided to put aside my fears and go see it anyway.<br/><br/>Am I ever glad I did! This is a sweet and gentle tale, full of unexpected warmth and depth. It is the story of Hugo Cabret, an orphan and keeper of the clocks at a train station in Paris. His only connection to his deceased father is a broken-down automaton the two were repairing before his father's demise in a fire. When Hugo is caught stealing parts for the automaton by the old owner of a toy shop in the station (Kingsley), his booklet of sketches related to the curious mechanical man is taken from him. Attempting to retrieve it, he meets Isabelle, the goddaughter of the aged man. Together, they begin to unravel the mystery behind Kingsley's character and help bring his true identity to light. (It shouldn't be that much of a surprise to anyone with knowledge of early film history that has a chance to look at the cast list here on IMDb. Does the name ""Georges Méliès"" ring any bells?) <br/><br/>Asa Butterfield does capably in the title role, and Chloe Grace Moretz shines sublimely as the precocious Isabelle. Of course, Ben Kingsley gives a terrific performance, powerful and poignant. He plays a broken man anguished by the shadows of the past.<br/><br/>These three are the central figures of the film, yet the side characters are handled equally well. That really struck me. A lesser filmmaker might have let such characters come off as just caricatures, especially in a children's film. Scorsese doesn't allow for that to happen. Richard Griffiths', Frances de la Tour's and Christopher Lee's characters are all skillfully imbued with humanity so that the audience feels for them and seems to get to know them in spite of their short periods on screen. Even Sacha Baron Cohen's silly Station Inspector is more than a one-dimensional figure. In between his cartoonish antics and chases after Hugo, he is shown to be painfully shy, pining desperately for the affections of an attractive woman who sells flowers. We learn also that he was wounded in World War I, and that it was his days growing up without love in the strict environment of an orphanage that so embittered him towards the world. He is not merely some comic antagonist tossed in for the sake of slapstick. Instead, he is a fascinating and well-developed character in his own right. One feels compassion and pity for him, and hopes he will have the courage to speak up and win the heart of his love, that their quirky relationship will blossom into romance.<br/><br/>In short, this is a simply lovely film. There has been some uproar and befuddlement over the director of such films as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"" making a 'children's movie'. I must admit I was a little abashed myself upon first hearing it. But ""Hugo"" shows that a so-called children's movie doesn't have to be inane or infantile. This is an intelligent and wondrous work – never sappy or banal. In part a tribute to the magic of cinema, it reminded me why I love motion pictures so much. With its richness and nuance, ""Hugo"" should appeal to children and adults alike. I realize that saying sounds a little clichéd, but in this case I have faith in the truth of it."
"JoeHBH","1","84","157","5 January 2012"," No one liked it in our group
","Hugo was the dullest film I saw last year. We had a group of five, all ardent filmgoers, ages 12 to 80, and it was an unanimous verdict - sort of interesting in the 3D presentation, but a terrible story. Scorcese basically lectures the audience on the value of film preservation. If that's not a yawner from the get-go, I don't know what is. He includes scenes from historically-important films, either replicating them directly, or paying homage to them. When he tried the Harrold Lloyd clock scene, I could only think of how inferior it was to the original; no suspense, no humor, just waiting for the scene to end. Then he must have done that train coming into the station four or five times. Okay, you don't need to sledgehammer everyone. And why did everyone in Paris have an English accent? Quite strange. There was nothing subtle, nothing surprising, nothing beyond cliché in the story. To top it off, we had to pay extra for the 3D. I would have liked the money back on this one."

","This film began in the mind of Brian Selznick and the Novel he wrote. Now legendary film maker Martin Scorsese imbues the book with life in this extraordinary movie called "" Hugo. "" It concerns a street urchin, named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) who lives and works at a busy Train station in France . That is until one day he is caught stealing from a shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley) who wants to know how the boy became so artistically proficient with his incredible artwork. Putting him to work, he soon meets a neighborhood girl named Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who enjoys reading and seeking adventure. Without their knowledge, stories intertwine with an early pioneer film maker. With the boy's ability to repair robotic machines, nearly all the characters in the story are enjoined and make for a heart warming, tear-rendering story. Indeed the entire cast and story create the making of a true Classic and one which will be enshrined among Scorsese' best works. Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Jude Law and Christopher Lee add true-life Thespian talent to this wonderful film. Highly Recommended to all."

","It is clearly evident in Hugo that Martin Scorsese has made this to be a very personal film in its design. No effort was spared in visual effects, production design, or cinematography. The visual effects are exciting and awe-inspiring, especially for those dazzled by color and intricacy (read: children). The production design is incredibly immersive, inviting us into an incredible new world. The cinematography is very good as well, capturing all the actors' emotions with pristine clarity. The film itself is very warm and heart-warming all around, making it very inviting and easy on the eyes. <br/><br/>The visual dazzle of Hugo draws the viewer into a heart-warming story about an orphaned boy searching for his father and a retired filmmaker searching for his former passion. The crossing of their paths will change both of their lives forever. This story is well-conveyed by Asa Butterfield and Ben Kingsley, as the chemistry between the two only adds to the impact on the viewer's emotions. The supporting cast is just as good, adding dimension and liveliness to the movie. <br/><br/>The only criticism I have of Hugo is its length. It feels like a very long film even though it is only 125 minutes. This dragging feeling has a chance of alienating most of its potential audience: families. However, Hugo is a film that even the most stingy of critics will like due to its emotional journey and warm, inviting character that allows all to enjoy it."
"artistgp","6","5","6","2 July 2013"," Some Thoughts...
","This is a tough one to break down. The movie was brilliantly shot, but I must say that it seemed to fail at ever fully creating the majestic mood it was going for. The pacing made it very tough to become completely engaged in the first half of the movie. The second portion did take it up a notch and add something to the film.<br/><br/>It mainly felt like he made this film as an excuse to tell the origins of film, or at least through one persons life. The acting was hit and miss, but overall I enjoyed the film because it tried to have a big heart and that is at least worth something.<br/><br/>These are just my thoughts, I'd suggest that you watch the film yourself and see what you think."

","How often do you see Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Kingsley in the same movie. It happened to me in a single week. How often do you see Chloe Grace Mortez play her age. Only once and this was it. And finally, what about Martin Scorcese doing a children based movie that too a 3D one. Now that I have established it is a crazy combination packaged as a classical movie, how was it implemented is the final question. Awesome!! Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who is covering for his uncle keying clocks at a railway station in Paris. He is passionate about a Droid the last thing he and his father (played by Jude Law) worked on. Hugo meets and makes friends with Isabelle (Chloe) who is being raised by George (Kingsley) and his wife and he has a mysterious past related both to movies and the Droid living a sad life. Putting into this mix is the Station Master (Cohen) with a limp who is by the book and determined to catch Hugo and also is in love with Lisette.<br/><br/>It is an epic story spanning decades of achievements, determination, hope and innocence. Though not watched in the format, 3D does not seem forced. Screenplay is neat, background score majestic, cinematography and editing are done in a way the filmmaker knew what he wanted. Chloe does a tremendous job in pushing innocence and maturity to Hugo's character that complements well to the story.<br/><br/>A classic unlike Scorcese's earlier work"

","Starring- Ben Kingsley and Asa Butterfield; The Hugo, a sentimental melodramatic movie accompanied by mystery and suspense, made under the ""Paramount Pictures"" banner, directed by ""Martin Scorsese"", written by John Logan, based on Brain Selznick's imaginative New York Times best seller ""The invention of Hugo Cabaret"" is a big step ahead in the history of movie-making, for it is the first ever movie made in 3-D with amazing special effects. I was swept away by the beauty of the means used to narrate a wonderful story, of an orphan boy living secretly in the walls of Paris Railway Terminus- maintaining the clocks of the station, avoiding the constable by using his wits, who intends to send Hugo to an orphanage. There is a slight twist of fantasy - deliberate nature of Hugo and Isabelle's yearn for adventure. Hugo's father died suddenly and mysteriously, and moved on with the automaton left by his father, believing it had the key to his future. The excitement is added when two wounded people interact- actions of one lead to reactions of the other, in turn both get healed. The boy's attempt to excavate his father's message leads to an excavation of past of old shopkeeper and the first three decades of cinema history. The plot is resolved by a heart-shaped key. British accent with French layer on dialogs add to the presentation and ferocious Doberman nearly lands in your lap is a lasting 3D effect. Scorsese passionately depicted early cinema in perfect detail, also he highlights the passion of his life-Cinema and its evolution using flashback technique. It is a great tribute to twentieth century cinema, glorious past when movies were non-narrative, efforts of inventor of the concepts of special effects, use of tricks like dissolves, multiple exposure and time lapse photography. Ticking Clocks and there spare parts are remarkably associated with passing events and that each one of us has a purpose in life. Time alters the taste of audiences, it turns today's hit into tomorrow's wreck. It was a sincere effort to awaken audiences to the glory of the past. The movie screen is loaded and packed with clocks, gears, cogs and round objects – which trigger the audience to an obsessive delight of magic and mechanics and unties young and old. I highly recommend you to take out time from your busy schedules and go watch this meaningful and moving movie."

I had heard a lot about how great Hugo was, but somewhat purposely avoided to find out what it was about except hearing little hints along the way (It was a tribute to the movies! A Trip To The Moon is somewhat involved!) and I'm glad I did. Hugo is made by Martin Scorcese, clearly a guy who loves the historical background of the movies (I've actually seen, and touched his collection of films at the Eastman House Archives (no public access!) and this was obviously a labor of love for him. I enjoyed it. I wasn't necessarily OVERWHELMED by it, but it was cute, it seemed to have a bit of a ""Chaplin"" feel to it though, and may have just been a wee bit sentimental.

","Hugo is an almost flawless movie with one remarkable characteristic: is visually stunning. Colors, scenarios, visual effects, city landscapes, everything is so beautiful that the whole tale becomes hypnotic. Scorsese shows once again how versatile he can be, proving that he deserves his place in the Hall of Fame as one of the greatest directors of all time. There's only a few guys in this business who can get the best out of every genre, and he's undoubtedly one of them. Hugo is a magnificent Dickensian-style tale, surrounded by lovely characters that will captivate you from the very beginning, making you roll into a mesmerizing 2 hours ride. Why ALMOST flawless? Well, you can call me picky if you want, but if part of the attraction of this movie is that it is situated in Paris, then let be in French. The Dickensian touch is great and the accent of the characters is musical, but if you want to use those resources in the film, just adapt the story and make it in London, cause having all these amazing Parisian characters speaking UK English sounds really misleading. I mean, you let it go when it's an animated movie and the main character is a funny little rat, but when actors are real things are different.

"The_Invisible_Dog","8","5","6","13 December 2011"," More nostalgia than adventure - this is a film about dreams.
","The site reviews of this film seem to be one extreme or the other. I can see both sides.<br/><br/>I'm sure that many felt disappointed in this movie because they expected a fun filled, family, Christmassy, period adventure film in 3D. It does come across that way from the marketing.<br/><br/>True it has all those elements, but what is unclear until you see this film is it is less of a family adventure movie and more a nostalgic look back at the glorious and magical days of early film. Particularly it is a biographical story about the great film pioneer George Melies.<br/><br/>If early film is not something that interests you, then you probably won't be 100% interested in everything this film has to offer. But beyond that there is still a wonderful world of magic, mechanics, childhood, wonder and dreams, all set in a bygone age, making 'Hugo' a real treat in it's own right.<br/><br/>Plus it's a joy to see a 3D film set in snowy, golden 1930's Paris rather than just 3D action blockbusters.<br/><br/>'Hugo' is brimming with Martin Scorcese's affection for the subject.Not just one of the world's greatest film historians, here he has brought the old world of film to life. Stories can be more powerful than text books. <br/><br/>In fact, my most magical moments of the movie were the scenes of Melies shooting his films back in the early 1900s. 'Hugo' allows us to revisit and re-experience these old treasures in a whole new light - now in glorious colour and 3D. You can trust Scorcese to get the accuracy of the details just right.<br/><br/>So this for me, is Scorcese's greatest magic trick in the film - breathing new life into old classics. I'm sure Melies would have approved and probably would have shot them in colourful 3D himself, had he had the technology back in 1900. 110 years later - Scorcese is doing it for him. I actually found this quite a moving tribute.<br/><br/>Also worth adding is Sacha Baron Cohen's character and acting were hilarious. Echoes of Peter Sellers in Dr Strangelove. Made me laugh out loud a few times. I put that in here because there are some negative reviews of him and i think those people may have missed the subtly, nuance and timing of which Cohen is a master.<br/><br/>So overall, expect less and get more. Expect a movie about film nostalgia and experience a movie about dreams, magic and the warming of the human soul.<br/><br/>Now i know what to expect of 'Hugo', i'm sure i will enjoy it even more on 2nd viewing. I'm sure others will too."

","It must be said from the outset that 3D is not absolutely necessary for the story but it would enhance it greatly, I imagine.

That particular film is also shown as one of the old film excerpts.<br/><br/>The story is, as others have pointed out, a pretty standard action-adventure quite comparable to Pearl White's ""Perils of Pauline"" and though actors playing Django Reinhardt, James Joyce and Salvador Dali appear briefly, the characters are not identified as they are in Woody Allen's name-dropping ""Midnight in Paris"". (They actually don't need to be!) A scene for Douglas Fairbank's version of ""Thief of Bagdad"" is also shown but the character of Hugo is closer to Sabu's in the second version, at least because of his age.<br/><br/>The DVD also includes a ""making of Hugo"" extra.<br/><br/>Is it a great film?

","Three years ago, I picked up a book that I knew almost NOTHING about, save a couple of paragraphs of a review that I had read. That book was ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", the debut novel of established illustrator Brian Selznick. Faithful to his previous illustration work, Selznick chose to tell his story in a rather unusual fashion- using pictures and words. But ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" is far from a GRAPHIC NOVEL. It is a novel with some breathtaking sketches. When I read that Martin Scorsessee was attached to adapt the book into a movie, in 3D no less, I was actually VERY excited. I felt that 3D was the BEST way to tackle such a visual novel, and it turns out that I was right, in some ways. <br/><br/>Scorsessee's adaptation of the novel, which went through several title changes before settling with ""Hugo"", received much praise for it's storytelling, and especially for its use of the ""overrated"" medium of 3D, particularly from ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic"" director James Cameron, who called the film the ""Best use of 3D ever."" Mr. Cameron knows his 3D, I trusted his word, and rightly so. As soon as the opening credits started, I became fully aware that I was in for a REAL TREAT.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" is the story of a young orphan, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who lives in the Paris train station during the 1930s. He has been alone since his father (Played in flashbacks by Jude Law) was killed in a tragic fire, and his uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a frequently drunk man who worked as the timekeeper at the station disappeared. Hugo must move throughout the train station carefully, so to avoid the watchful eyes of Gustave (Sacha Baron-Cohen), the often comical station inspector. It's his sneakiness that gets him in trouble with an aging man known as Papa Georges (Sir Ben Kingsley), who runs a small toy stand at the station. Along with Georges' god-daughter, Isabel, Hugo embarks on a journey that is equal parts remarkable and magical, and one that is filled with long- lost secrets from the past. <br/><br/>""Hugo"" is FAR from a carbon copy of Selznick's REMARKABLE novel, but it IS remarkable in it's own right. Scorsessee and his team PERFECTLY capture the look and feel of the novel's settings, and ESPECIALLY the characters. In the end, this is certainly Scorsessee's love letter to classic cinema, and to the French Filmmakers who he truly admires and looks up to. By the time the film ended, I was left truly moved, and with the impression that I had just had one of the most MAGICAL movie going experiences of my life."

Glancing through their comments, the principal objection seems to be that it was ""boring"", which leads me to wonder why someone who COULD think this would have wasted their money on it in the first place? <br/><br/>So, as a useful guide, here is a list of movies that were awarded 9 or 10 stars by reviewers who gave Hugo 1-star. If you tend to like the following films, there's a good chance you'll be wasting your time on Hugo.

","Ah, before reading my ""drivel"" the reader should realise that I am one of those brain dead morons who thought that Hugo was a brilliant movie. Certainly it is not a Ben-Hur or Deer Hunter but it was not conceived to be a movie like those that were on a much larger canvas. In my opinion you should not compare apples and oranges,they are too dissimilar just as these huge movies must not be compared to smaller personal dramas like Hugo. The movie was first and foremost set driven and script driven and Scorsese's brilliant direction brought the film together. Not being connected with the industry I would think that this type of movie would be very hard to direct (as opposed to some of the ""Haters"")because the plot demands the ability to assembly disparate elements in a complex script peppered with many subtleties. Lo Schiavo's Set Direction was beyond any criticism; she turned literary words into concrete reality in a very complex movie. The media is right in my opinion!"
"jeromec-2","10","15","24","5 September 2012"," ""Come and Dream with Me""
","This film is unlike any that Scorsese has ever made, or at least those of his that I've seen. It is a complex mixture of mechanics, imagination, familiar images, people's psychology and most of all dreaming the way children dream. It is both a tribute and a biography although to call it either would diminish what it really is – a masterpiece of a master storyteller.<br/><br/>It is the story of one child prodigy (Hugo – acted by Asa Butterfield) who fixes things and who inherits from his father, an automaton that is broken.<br/><br/>It is massively complex, but the boy is able to fix it. He cannot make it run however because he lacks one essential element and doesn't know where to find it. He meets a young girl his own age, 12 (Isabella – charmingly recreated by Chloe Grace Maretz that the Romance Novels would describe as ""having pluck."" She has around her neck, the piece of the machine that finally makes it work: It is a heart shaped key. By this time, we are so engrossed in the plot that the symbolism passes right by us. It does not pass by Scorsese though. He reminds us that without heart, nothing works. The heart is the key to turning us from machines into well functioning humans.<br/><br/>Everyone of major importance seems to learn something, and as a consequence, so do we.<br/><br/>Georges Mêlées (played by the master of understatement Ben Kingsley) learns that perhaps he should not look at the past as failings and filled with unimaginable horror. He should perhaps see the world as he and his wife created it for themselves. The world for them was for fun and dreams and wizards and mermaids and images that could come from no one but someone with a very fertile imagination who essentially loved. Mama Jeanne (his wife – Helen McCrory) is a startling woman who at just the right moment learns that she can make her husband see the world he left behind through her eyes. She learns that her feminine view has its place as well.<br/><br/>Isabella has her first adventure and she laps it up the way a kitten laps a bowl of milk.<br/><br/>Finally Hugo finds a family who understands him, and he learns that he can grow and develop.<br/><br/>It's a fine film well worth an evening."
"MartinHafer","10","16","26","2 January 2012"," A great film....and Martin Scorsese is now my hero....
","While I have given ""Hugo"" a well-deserved 10, I am don't think this film is for everyone. Despite the advertising campaign which made it look like a kids' movie, it is NOT. Now I am NOT saying it had adult content. Despite being directed by Martin Scorsese (""Taxi Driver"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""Raging Bull""), it is very family-friendly--without cursing, sex or violence. But, I also think younger kids would be totally bored to tears by the film--particularly late in the movie. Don't bring kids younger than about 10--they will most likely feel restless the longer the film progresses.<br/><br/>For folks like me, ""Hugo"" is an absolute must-see. I adore silent films and of the early silents, Georges Méliès is like a god. I have reviewed at least a hundred and have seen just about every existing film the man made...because they are THAT good. He was a brilliant early filmmaker who introduced lots of camera tricks and made extremely fanciful films. I could try to describe them further, but it's best you just see a few yourself. And, in addition to a plot that eventually turns to a homage of Méliès, it features clips from some of the great silents that I have long loved. In particular, a nice chunk of Harold Lloyd's ""Safety Last"" is included...as well as clips and posters from ""The General"", ""The Kid"", ""Judex"", ""Fantome"", ""The Great Train Robbery"" and many other seminal films any cinephile worth his salt would have seen and loved.<br/><br/>Despite EVENTUALLY being all about the wonderful Georges Méliès, you would not know this through at least half the film. I knew--because I know his films and instantly recognized Ben Kingsley as Méliès--the makeup was dead on the mark. Otherwise, it's an intriguing film about a strange orphan--an orphan that literally lives within the ductwork and walls of a train station in Paris! He has a bizarre obsession to complete the restoration of an amazingly complex automaton that was begun by his father--before the man's untimely death. Yet, despite being anchored by a boy, it is NOT a film strictly for the kids. I'd say more about the plot, but frankly you just need to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Why I loved this film is not just because it's a delightful homage to silent films (which, by the way, has made Scorsese practically a god among filmmakers to me). It's also because I have never seen a better use of 3-D and the film just looks exquisite--and it seems to have a lock on the Oscars for cinematography and art direction. Now I am NOT just talking about incorporating wonderful 3-D tricks into the film (like they did so well with ""How to Train Your Dragon"" with all the great flying sequences)--but integrating them in a more artistic manner that is not distracting but enhances the film throughout and makes you admire all the wonderful eye candy. I also loved the great use of computers to colorize flashback scenes to make them appear to be a nice homage to the early hand-colored films of Méliès. And, when it's not in flashbacks, the film simply looks like you are in early 1930s Paris.<br/><br/>I also loved the film because of the nice performances. Sacha Baron Cohen is more subtle and likable here than usual and I loved the performances by the kids in the film. Ben Kingsly was great--but he's nearly always great.<br/><br/>Finally, perhaps the best thing about the film is that it is so different. Watch the film and then try to think of another film that reminds you of ""Hugo""--I seriously doubt if you'll be able to do this--the film is THAT unique!"

","This movie makes a sport of building up your expectations only to completely crush them. First the trailer makes you think you'll be watching some kind of fantasy adventure (I expected some kind of magical dream-like circus and for Ben Kingsley to be the new and improved mechanical man...). And then during the movie they keep telling you it's going to be a great adventure, but nothing really adventurous is happening and then you expect some great tragedy that happened to Ben Kingsley only to find out that people didn't like his films anymore (sad but certainly not a tragedy). The 3D really was the best I've ever seen, but the story... keeps wanting to be big while it really is rather small. It was a nice story and I'm sure I would have liked it more had I not been expecting anything, but I kept feeling bored and disappointed, waiting for the ""real story"" to begin. And then it was over."

","Tackling 3D for the first time, I think Scorsese has hit the ball out of the park with Hugo, his film was gorgeous. Unfortunately he forgot to give us a compelling story. <br/><br/>Hugo is a noble film, but it is never quite sure what kind of film it wants to be. It is a little too mature to be a kids movie, yet it's too cartoonish to be an adult movie. One minute, it is played as a fantasy in the kind of world where the moon is bigger than the Eiffel Tower, and the next minute the film is played realistically; a serious biography of one of cinema's pioneers. Indeed Hugo's best quality after it's look, is its educational factor. How Ironic it is to be watching bits of hundred year old George Melies films on a cinematic format that was almost invented yesterday. The photography was diverse and spectacular, the characters were charming and quirky, but in the end, the movie just wasn't compelling enough. <br/><br/>I went in expecting to laugh and cry in all the right places, and I didn't. I guess that's more Spielberg's terrain; Scorsese is much colder than that of course. Hugo is pleasant, but it's not a great movie"

I was interested for the first 15 minutes and after that it was like watching paint dry. The script was unrealistic, the acting of the two young characters was bad, but worse of all is the plot - it is barely there so the whole film is padded out with pointless little stories and scenes. Also, the whole film is incredibly over-sentimental. It is rare a film is so dull that I consider leaving a cinema before the film has ended but I seriously considered it, and several people in the cinema did walk out early so it can't just be me! Also several of those walking out had kids with them, so it seems this doesn't appeal to children either."
"rocketry101","1","82","165","4 December 2011"," Hugo Cabret Goes ""Nowhere"" in a Hurray!
","Hugo Cabret has been so obscenely overrated by many ""Bandwagon"" Reviewers that it is sickening! Just because Martin Scorssese directs a movie, doesn't make it ""great"". He's had plenty of lousy directing jobs. But the Hollywood ""elite"" jump right on the bandwagon to justify anything that Spielberg, Scorsesse, Abrams, etc. do even when they suck. I went for the ""godly"" reviews but ended up disappointed.<br/><br/>I saw Hugo 3D tonight and found it extremely slow and boring. After 30 minutes the lady next to me kept asking, is it going to get better. I could only nod in agreement. Being that this is tauted as Scorsesse's first family film, I doubt many families would be able to sit through this too lengthy debacle of boredom. At a price tag of about $170,000,000, your grandfather could have been given 2 months of directing lessons and made just as good a movie at half the cost. They spared no expense in making this movie and probably as much in the ""hype-up"" money spent on marketing.<br/><br/>Better yet, Paramount should have saved 3/4 of the money and had Marty direct a real ""family"" movie. With a few of Marty's super duper camera angles, throw in 3D, some subdued lighting and dialogueless scenes and it would become a ""Masterpiece"".<br/><br/>To show how brain dead the media gets with ""A"" list Directors, Producers and Actors....It surprises me that no one in the media made a single comment about the fact that here are all the main characters born and living in Paris, France, but none of them speak French, nor English with a French Dialect. Instead, they all speak ""Bristish English"". In Harry Potter it was understandable. Even the inspector who watches over the Train Station. How ""unbelievable"" can you get. Even Danny Kaye could do a movie in English with a Frech accent and maintain the image. In Hugo, the reality of being in Paris went right down thru the tubes. I guess the Hollywood Elite can do no wrong. I am not surprised that non of the media reviewers commented on the fact that the movie was very different from the book. If it was someone else, they would have lambasted for that departure. <br/><br/>Nothing can justify the blatant dis-honest and subjective accolades given to this film without mentioning it's so many faults. Reviewers are calling it a ""Masterpiece"". ""3D brought to a new level - beyond James Cameron's Avatar"" What kind of falsified ""BS"" is that.<br/><br/>Lawrence of Arabia is a ""Masterpiece"", Gone with the wind is a Masterpiece. Doctor Zivago, Ben Her, etc, etc. are all considered ""Masterpieces"". But Hugo? Not in the same class at all. For the price tag - Is the Cinematography pretty....yes. Are the sets beautiful....yes. Does it have a rather dismal feel to the movie....yes. Is the acting exceptional....NO! Ben Kingsly is good in anything he does, he is a seasoned actor and he was very watchable in this movie although somewhat despicable in the beginning. Jude Law had a ""blink"" and you missed him cameo appearance...so nothing great there. And the 2 kids, well Asa Butterball was marginally interesting. Any good Hollywood actor of 13 or 14 would have done a great job in this movie. There were so many boring moments in the movie where Scorcesse has you look at him for what feels like hours without dialog.<br/><br/>I didn't feel any kinship with the kids characters, no energy or life in the portrayal by Asa Butterfield. I didn't even feel any sense of ""pain"" from all his loses and how he lives. Somehow Hugo's pain was less important than Ben Kingsley's. More of a coached neutral acting job and with a British Accent no less. Chloe Moretz must have been picked for her french last name, but she didn't speak french or have a french accent either. Her performance was usable, but nothing dynamic. In so many places the film needed more passion and energy, and a nudge over the top, but most were given only as a flat performance. Not sure what the had in mind with these 2 picks, other than not to have them overshadow the ""A"" lister actors. Very Disappointing performances in a story that called for much more passion and emotion. I saw the reviews on Sacha Baron Cohen....o.k.what was the big deal? He was o.k. at best, nothing exceptional. Just because he didn't do ""Bruno's"" characterization, doesn't mean he is suddenly the greatest thing since chicken soup.<br/><br/>Hugo is very long and draggy and ends on some Scorcesseish need to expose some ""Cinema Verte"" Hollywood cliché'experience to sucker in the ""drone"" reviewers of Hollywood. Or maybe they were all drugged before they saw the movie or paid off. Personally, I like to think for myself. The marketing of this film was also played out with all kinds of games going on. Initial limited distribution, blitzing articles, ads, exposure bought just about everywhere. They must have spent as much on marketing as the film cost. can't go anywhere and not see something about Hugo. I don't agree with buying audiences.<br/><br/>I never fall asleep in a movie so this is my first. I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through it, as it dragged on. Who was this movie was intended for. Was it made to show in a film class about what you can do with a big budget? Was it meant for adults who find long boring dialog in movies interesting, or is it simply an attempt for the director to jumble into a film a whole bunch of stuff and cram out a warm/fuzzy ""Cinema Verte-Esq"" Genre-ee"" from the old days, so that the director could pay homage to something and older people would remember the silent films of yesterday... To borrow a phrase from the Tom Hanks movie ""Big""....I don't get it!"
"ryancauchifilms","10","10","15","12 August 2012"," An elegant and enchanting film that appeals to the child in all of us.
","From it's very first page, Brian Selznick's 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' (2007) promised to be no ordinary work of fiction. The award-winning book was a gorgeous pastiche of words, illustrations, photographs and movie stills. It begins with a series of beautiful pencil drawings that transport us through a busy Paris railway station, and towards a giant clock, where behind lurks our hero, 13-year-old orphan Hugo Cabret. <br/><br/>This sequence is translated beautifully - and in groundbreaking 3D, nonetheless - in Martin Scorsese's tour-de-force adaptation, simply titled HUGO, which promises to be no ordinary cinematic experience, and indeed one of the best films of 2011.<br/><br/>HUGO is unlike anything Martin Scorsese has ever directed and yet it seems like the film he was born to make. The kid-friendly source material could easily have attracted the likes of French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Tim Burton and - dare I say it - Steven Spielberg; but, like any great artist, Scorsese makes the property his own, and with his formidable talent, produces an inspiring and sophisticated celebration of film history and the magic of cinema.<br/><br/>HUGO is a film that has to be seen in 3D. Much like James Cameron with his 2009 hit AVATAR, Scorsese pushes the boundaries of the gimmicky medium. The 3D not only enhances Robert Richardson's beautiful cinematography or Dante Ferretti's rich production design; it heightens the audience's involvement in this very poignant story and their understanding of the characters and their world. <br/><br/>The cast is simply brilliant. Asa Butterfield, who made a solid debut in THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS, gives a focused and engaging performance as our title character, while Chloe Grace Moretz (Hit Girl in KICK-ASS) is charming as Hugo's wide-eyed, bookish friend, Isabelle. Sir Ben Kingsley delivers a superbly touching performance as early film pioneer Georges Melies, and Sacha Baron Cohen is a delight as the malicious, yet bumbling Station Inspector, clearly patterned after such slapstick performers of the silent era as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. In fact, the character's awkward romance with a beautiful flower seller (Emily Mortimer) reminded this reviewer of a similar love in Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS (1931). The rest of the supporting cast is made up of some of today's finest British talent: Jude Law, Ray Winstone, Richard Griffiths, Frances del la Tour and the great Sir Christopher Lee. Each of these performers are impressive in their limited screen time. <br/><br/>HUGO has been labeled as Scorsese's love letter to cinema and it shows in every scene. There are homages to silent film classics ARRIVAL OF A TRAIN A LA CIOTAT (1897) and Harold Lloyd's SAFETY LAST! (1923) and, at the heart of the film, there is a fantastic montage of silent cinema, expertly assembled by Scorsese's regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker to Camille Saint-Saens' 'Danse Macabre'. But for this reviewer, the highlight of the film was Scorsese's recreation of the history and career of Georges Melies, a 'cinemagician' who employed trick effects and elaborate set designs in his own glass studio, to transport his audience to worlds of fantasy and make-believe.<br/><br/>At a time where big-budget 3D romps featuring dancing penguins or globe-trotting Belgian reporters, raises skepticism towards the 'family' film sub-genre, HUGO provides relief. It is nothing short of a masterpiece, an elegant and enchanting film that appeals to the child in all of us. At the end of the film, Melies invites his audience to come dream with him. Will you come dream with Marty?"

","If you go in to see a magical film in the likes of Narnia, filled with magic and adventure, with a fantastic, mystery automaton at the core as the trailers suggest , you will be sorely disappointed. ""Hugo"" is nothing like that. The trailers are extremely misleading as to the actual story and with over 2 hrs runtime, and a story that goes nowhere, it is a VERY boring film.<br/><br/>Hugo is a little orphan boy that has gone through H!ll and back, yet there is absolutely no emotion from him, he is as hollow as the little automaton he is repairing. His little friend is absolutely a horrible actress too, her performance is awful! No emotion (plus she wears the same mismatched clothes all through the movie!)<br/><br/>The story starts out about a little orphan boy who lives in the Paris train station and winds up the clocks. He is in possession of a little mystery automaton which he is repairing because he thinks it holds a message from his dead father. By chance he hooks up with mystery toy shop owner George Melies (Ben Kingsley) and the story suddenly becomes about George Melies and *his* sorrow over how his movies were not what people wanted to see after WWI.<br/><br/>The cinematography is absolutely stunning. I did not see this film in 3D. The sets, the mood, the people, the costumes... fantastic!! But the story wasn't there. There was no magic, no mystery and no adventure. It was not a Narnia like film... it was a lecture on the early days of cinema and one of the great directors' work.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed was that there was a lot of silence in the film. Great shots but you ended up staring at them for a good few minutes with no story or dialog happening. I can't see my kids sitting through this. I can't see an adult sitting through this!! I think a documentary of George Melies would have me much more interested than false advertising for a magical film...<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley performed as expected. He is really good at everything he does. Jude Law... well you blinked and he was gone. He had like 5 sentences to say. Now he can add ""played in a Scorcese film"" in his resume. Christopher Lee had a nice small part too. Sascha Baron Cohen... hmmm. I know a lot of people didn't like him but I found him good. Although he was supposed to be funny he did come out more annoying than funny but I did end up sympathizing with his character, so I liked him.<br/><br/>If only the story was there as promised (advertised) if this was indeed a magical adventure. If more talented young actors were chosen that delivered emotion... paired with the stunning visuals of the films it would have been... magic!! If only..."

","Story that takes place in the 1920s. An orphan named Hugo (Asa Butterfield) lives in a huge Paris terminal making sure all the clocks run correctly. He gets involved in a mystery involving his dead father (Jude Law), a mechanical figure and the mysterious Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley).<br/><br/>The first film directed by Martin Scorsese for a family audience. Too bad it's so terrible. It's boring (I considered leaving a few times), heavy handed, simplistic and slow. The plot is virtually nonexistent and the coincidences that occurred were WAY too hard to believe. Plenty of plot loopholes too. To make matters worse we have a station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who (I suppose) is supposed to be funny but just comes across as annoying. On the plus side it LOOKED great (the station and overviews of Paris in the 1930s are astonishing) and this movies uses 3D better than any other movie I've seen. It also has a message that books are great and movies are magic--two VERY positive messages for any child to hear. An extra bonus is seeing the actual films of Georges Melies on a big screen in great condition with the hand colored frames of the originals. The acting was OK and it was a treat to see Christopher Lee in a small role. But, all in all, I found this pointless and boring. It's only being praised to the high heavens because Scorsese did it. A 1 all the way."

","Here in Richmond, we have the privilege of viewing movies in a top notch place called The Bow Tie Cinemas. Going to the movies is still an ""experience"" at The Bow Tie, and all viewers alike go just for that. Tonight was no exception to say the least. My brother and I had been seeing the previews for this movie, and from the start we both were completely awestruck by how incredible it looked from the trailer itself. Well, let me tell you, we were NOT disappointed. AT ALL. This movie was everything that a movie should be. The cast was perfectly picked, the acting spot-on, and the cinematography was beyond articulate. Ben Kingsley played his character to the ""T"", and both Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz were surprisingly splendid. I say surprisingly because the acting I witnessed from these two kids was nothing short of brilliance; something you don't witness everyday with young actors/actresses. We were lucky enough to view it in 3D, and that just made it all the better. I don't like reviewing movies just to completely summarize the movie like so many people on here do. I am reviewing it so that you can know what to expect. And what you should expect from this movie is sheer perfection. SOLID 10/10"
"MichaelStorer","10","11","17","17 February 2012"," Why Hugo gets my vote for Best Picture
","I'm a latecomer to Hugo. I only took it in a few days ago, in February of 2012. I'd seen a trailer for it last year. My recollection of that: ""Well this looks sorta fun.. another kid's story they hope will also appeal to adults. Probably another Disney/Pixar type thing, but with live actors plus 3D this time. I enjoyed Cars, Toys, Inc., etc. I'll take it in if I find time.""<br/><br/>Then last week a buddy said, ""We should see this movie Hugo. It's getting all kinds of nominations."" I needed a push to drive somewhere to see a kid's movie just then, but ultimately we met up for a (cheaper) Saturday matinée. With no great expectations, I kindly lowered my 3D shades when told to. It took me awhile to figure out where they were going with these frankly stunning, snowy, fairytale-like shots skimming over 1920-something Paris. The camera eventually led us into a gigantic and bustling central station, romantically old-fashioned to our eye, yet golden and sparklingly with-it in this, its glory day. Fashionable Parisians were scurrying around shops and boarding steam-billowing trains. We're following a wide-eyed, clever but sad boy, Hugo, played by a quick, intuitive young actor, perhaps akin to Daniel Radcliffe as we first met him as Harry Potter. By no means his twin, but with the same, or perhaps even more striking innate sense of confidence on a movie set. We watch as his loving father dies and leaves the boy an orphan to fend for himself as a thieving stowaway in this brick monument to technology. His watchmaker father has left him an old and forgotten museum piece to finish piecing back together. It's a 90% scale mechanical man made of tin, cams and gears. From the kind but very curious expression on its face, it's clear that this over-sized wind-up once must have performed some miraculous feat, but what? I'll leave you with that as far as storyline goes.<br/><br/>Just prepare yourself for the least expected.<br/><br/>Although Hugo is in part about a young boy's struggle to solve a riddle, what he discovers is far beyond mere kid's stuff. It's a shockingly beautiful lesson on so much you likely don't know about man's sheer delight in –and need for– unfettered imagination, creativity and our ingenuity and tenacity to make magic become reality. On one level, children can love it, but quite honestly, the truly magnificent depth of field you'll grasp and the exhilaration you'll feel having lived on earth awhile, will be lost on youth, but is shown as a gift for each of us to pass on to them. <br/><br/>Though no filmmaker, I was born in the heart of Hollywood, so perhaps the magic of moving pictures is in my blood. Nevertheless, this cutting-edge tribute to every step mankind has achieved in cinematic art and technology, our drive and creativity to surpass that which has gone before stunned the living daylights out of me and brought streams of tears to my eyes. See Hugo immediately."

","Even to say that ""Hugo"" is visually stunning is a tremendous understatement. It would be so anyway but with the beautiful 3D effect it really is an outstanding accomplishment. The city of Paris is shown in lovely sweeping shots as snow flakes drift toward the ground. The train station itself is an architectural masterpiece and takes on a life of its own as Hugo navigates its deep recesses with an easy finesse. The shopkeepers, passengers, and police who traverse the station daily make for excellent people watching for Hugo, who manages to find sustenance one way or another during their distractions. These efforts finally land him in trouble with the somewhat comical, somewhat villainous child hating gendarme who patrols the station. Hugo is the kind of boy who makes a normal human being want to give him a reassuring hug and take him under their wing. As you watch his struggle, you can't help but hope for a happy ending."
"bdgill12","9","11","17","30 November 2011"," Beautiful, Touching Homage to Film
","Recently I had a conversation with a friend who noted that his enjoyment level with a film is often influenced by those he's attending said film with. If his fellow moviegoers are having a good time, he's more inclined to follow suit; if they're less than enthusiastic, so is he. I haven't found that to be the case for me personally, except when it comes to comedies; I'm probably more inclined to laugh hysterically when my cohorts are doing the same. I guess the whole ""laughter is contagious"" thing is true. But otherwise, I pretty much go my own way and my level of enjoyment is based on my personal experience. However, there have been times when I've had a moment of realization wherein I suddenly become aware that no one else in the theater is as into whatever we're watching as I am. So it is with Hugo. While I became more and more enamored with Martin Scorsese's beautifully crafted ode to film, it became abundantly clear that my friends and the rest of the audience were less than impressed. In some ways, this general disinterest from those around me may have made my appreciation for Hugo even deeper; I almost felt I needed to get up in front of the crowd and defend the film and point out its many merits. Since I did not deliver my speech at that time, I'm afraid we're going to have to cover it in this space.<br/><br/>Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) has lived an unfortunate life. When his father (Jude Law) dies in a fire, he is snatched up by his uncle Claude(Ray Winstone), a drunkard who forces him to quit school in order to take up a job repairing the clocks within the Paris train station (and thereby allowing Claude to spend his time at the bottom of a bottle). After Claude disappears, Hugo finds himself living all alone within the walls of the depot, always mindful of staying out of the sight of the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). In his limited spare time, Hugo uses the skills his superior mechanical skills working on the repair of an automaton his father found in a museum attic shortly before his death, a machine he believes will deliver a message from his father. To make it work, Hugo begins stealing gears and parts from a small store and soon draws the ire of its proprietor, Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley). Georges allows him to work off his debt by repairing things in the shop and soon this job leads to a friendship with Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), who happens to own a key that fits the automaton perfectly. But instead of a message from his father, the automaton draws a picture that traces back to Georges and leads Hugo and Isabelle on a journey of great discovery.<br/><br/>To boil the plentiful elements and concepts contained within Hugo into a few paragraphs is a tough task. It is a tremendously complex film with a wide range of plots and purposes that don't always interact in the most straightforward way. It is all at once a poignant family film, a coming of age film, an adventure epic, and an extremely personal homage. The mix of genres is a strong indicator as to why Hugo is having such a hard time finding an audience. Its rating and the inclusion of the 3D component make it an obvious draw for families but the truth is, this is not a film kiddos are going to enjoy. (Case in point: the young boy sitting behind me who spent the entire second half of the film telling his mother in a not-so-quiet voice that he wanted to go home.) This is the rare ""children's movie"" that's actually made for adults, designed to make us remember how magical everything could be when we were younger. So, basically, Scorsese's take on a family movie.<br/><br/>Hugo is a deep and nuanced film that draws you in a little more with each passing scene. It starts slow (too slow, honestly) but builds consistently to the climax that, for me at least, delivered tenfold on the promises made throughout the runtime. As the movie progresses, Scorsese seems to be asking the audience to invest in Hugo's struggles, a call to action I had no problem responding to. Butterfield provides a quality performance that peaks at the right times and his relative lack of experience is tempered quite well by Moretz, who always displays a maturity beyond her years. Their dynamic works well and Scorsese does an excellent job of relying on his young stars just enough to draw the audience's attention but not so much as to put too much pressure upon them. The supporting actors, particularly Kingsley and Michael Stuhlbarg, all play their parts with subtle flair and each does a great job of highlighting the main characters. The surrounding story lines, while a bit distracting in the early going, come together with precision to expand the film's narrative and<br/><br/>But where Hugo truly excels is when it delves into the world of the early cinema. A forgotten filmmaker, Georges has retreated within himself and locked away the many painful memories that came from his post-war exile. It falls to Hugo and Isabelle, along with the help of a film expert (played exquisitely by Stuhlbarg) to reawaken Georges' love of film. Scorsese uses this piece of storytelling to unveil his own admiration for the early films and the further he takes Hugo into this realm, the more enamored with his work I became. It is a supremely well- made, beautifully shot film (as all Scorsese films are) that is nearly overpowering in its personal nature. You get the impression that Scorsese loves this film and wants you to love it as well. I only wish more viewers would join me in reciprocating that love.<br/><br/>Please check out my reviews at ieatfilms.com"

","Lovely movie, with the story every bit as magical as the special effects. The acting, the screenplay, the music, the editing, all flawless. And the paradox at the core - a movie about time and temporality is also about the timeless quality of all that's important...family, relationships, the things we all long for, and then rather than leave all of the metaphors and symbols up for grabs, he dares to offer an answer, a moral answer: We're all broken. So we have three choices in life. Be someone who breaks things, be someone who fixes things, or be someone who just stands there, bemused and bewildered, doing nothing. For many years Scorsese has been doing his best to fix the problem of decaying films. With ""Hugo"" he shows how love can fix almost everything, and that yes, the world is filled with things that are broken, but that we're put here to work. See a problem? Get busy."

His direction is quite good, but Hugo's real delight is the technical work behind the scenes. When I started watching Hugo, the idea passed through my head that maybe this was animated film because of the elaborate way the film looked and was dressed. It has a rich costume design, jaw-dropping sets, and cinematography with color that bounces of the screen. Scorsese takes family movie clichés and fills them with blood, making them alive again in a fresh manner.

I thoroughly enjoyed the pacing and setting of the movie, which added life and texture to the story. Although liberties are taken for the sake of romanticizing 1930s Paris, the focus of Hugo is less on the 1930s than it is on the efforts of early filmmakers and what can be learned from the past. Kingsley's acting is particularly noteworthy, though promising young star Butterfield gives an excellent performance, proving that he can keep up with the more experienced actors. Endearing and well-crafted, Hugo resounds with themes of love, family and reunion, making it a satisfying and enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/"

","Hugo is a unique, visually stunning, and beautifully performed fairy tale that weaves together the true story of a cinematic genius with folklore and fantasy. Branded as a children's film but truthfully I believe the young at heart will be the ones who will just have their breath taken away by this adventure. It has a more methodical pace than your usual children's adventure fantasy, and the emotional depth to the film will leave you with tears in your eyes. Scorcese proves his worth as an artistic director with Hugo. Asa Butterfield absolutely shines as the young boy looking for purpose in his world. He is part Oliver Twist, and part Huckleberry Finn and just rivets you to his story. Chloe Moretz is excellent though I think nearly underused in her part. Her and Butterfield are adorable together. And Sir Ben Kingsley gives his best performance in YEARS as Georges Méliès, the depressed film maker with an incredible back story. On top of these three main incredible performances there is a host of truly terrific supporting characters played by Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Winstone, Christopher Lee and Jude Law. Despite a disappointing box office take, I guarantee Hugo will become a cinematic classic in later years. Please see this, and just let the adventure take you!! 9/10"

","The movie is very nice to look at, let's start from that. I saw the movie in 3D, and while it didn't add anything significant to the movie it didn't detract from it like it does in so many other films. Would I have preferred 2D had it been available? Yes, but mainly because I'm one of those guys, who gets a headache from 3D glasses. For most of the people, I think that this movie is finally one of those that are actually enhanced by the 3D effect. But, no matter the amount of dimensions, the movie looks great. The costumes, the details, the backgrounds, the people, they're all wonderful to look at.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the visual effects are the best part of the movie. Nothing in it is bad, far from it, but nothing is as masterful as the visuals. The ensemble cast of high-quality actors all played their parts brilliantly, but I never felt quite connected to the characters. They were all unique, well-rounded and sympathetic, yet that extra little spark was missing. The same can be said about the story. It hit all the right notes, was interesting and had absolutely no plot holes or unnecessary scenes. And yet I don't think that I'll remember any of it after five years.<br/><br/>But movie isn't bad, not at all. The amazing visuals kind of overwhelm the other aspects of it, but it was still enjoyable to watch. I especially liked all those little moments where they replicated a scene from an old black and white film that they had shown within the movie earlier. All in all it's a nice movie and a brilliant love letter to the movie industry in general. Is it Scorsese's strongest work? Not even close, but it's definitely worth a watch for any fan of movies out there."

","Hugo is based upon the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. The film is a period piece film, taking place in 1930's Paris, France. Fans of director Martin Scorsese may also want to note that this is his first time directing a family film and also one in 3D. The film is full of enchantment and lots to behold and wonder at, so I feel that if I was to give too much away it would spoil the film, so I suggest you look elsewhere for a plot synopsis, or even watch the film's trailer. I found a lot to like about Hugo, but there were also a few things that I had problems with as well. First the good. The film looks great. Normally, I am not a fan of films in 3D because I find that they look fake and it just feels ever so much more like you are watching a computer program, or video game and does not feel real in any way. The visual effects in Hugo are all extremely well done and they look believable and give the film a great look. Every so often a character's face may look a bit askew when trying to capture it with the 3D background, but that does not happen too often and for the most part it looks great. The whole film looks great from it's visual effects, costumes, set decorations, make up and cinematography. It's a wonderfully authentic and dazzling piece of eye candy that also looks and feels of 1930's Paris, France and has all the charm and beauty of the city as well. The acting here is all very good from everybody. The whole cast is very talented and they all do a great job in their individual roles. The adults are good and the kids do a great job here as well. The story to the film is very original and for me I was quite intrigued as to how and where the film would go and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a little bit of everything from fantasy, mystery, comedy, science fiction and is even an open love letter to a certain art form that if you see the film you will know what I mean and I think that reason alone is why film lover Martin Scorsese made the film in the first place. The film enchants with it's visuals, keeps us interested with it's adventuresome and likable characters and the different magical and mysterious things going on. The film is marketed as a family film, but I can definitely see adults appreciating the film more than children, but older children may find something here to like as well. Now on to the few things I had a problem with during the film. I thoroughly enjoyed myself during the duration of the film, but there were times when the film did feel a bit long. It's not an overly long movie at two hours and seven minutes, but there are certain scenes that do drag on a bit and after the film is over it somehow feels like the film was much longer than the running time I just provided you with, even though it is not. Also, I did like all of the characters in the film, but I felt that there were too many subplots going on during the film that took away from the main story. It's not that they were not interesting, but they didn't have all that much to do with the central theme, or message of the story and ultimately just made the film longer and this is in parts where it began to drag, so I would have to say some of the additional stories were a little unnecessary. Had they been trimmed down, or edited a bit, or maybe found a different way to incorporate them into the film it could have worked, but as it is they don't. Those are probably my only problems with the film and while I still liked it a fair bit and admired a lot about it, I can not honestly say that it is a great film, or one of the year's best. Still there is a lot here that I think movie lovers will admire and get a lot out of, so I still recommend Hugo and it is a nice feel good film, especially appropriate now in time for the holidays, so I would still recommend it, but for me it had enough flaws to prevent it from being a masterpiece, but it is still definitely worth seeing even if you have to pay a little extra for the accompanying 3D glasses."

","My wife and I took our 3 adult children for our traditional Thanksgiving family movie, and we were all disappointed. I think there is a good story, from the book, behind it but it wasn't actually shown well on the screen. It was too mosaic. There are several characters played well by great actors who are not developed well and could have been left out entirely without changing how you ""felt"" about the main characters or how they changed/grew through the twists and turns of the story. I would have preferred seeing a better written story that better demonstrates the internal changes that the characters are forced to make. I recommend folks go with low expectations."

","LOGLINE: Set in 1930's Paris, a young orphan who lives in the walls of a train station and works maintaining the public clocks within. After an accident kills his father (a short and memorable performance by Jude Law), Hugo works to finish rebuilding an automoton found by his father believing that a mysterious message will be released to him once it is complete.<br/><br/>Hugo is breathtaking, but not because of the over-hyped 3D. Although the 3D is a step above the scores of other movies released in the recent 3D boom, it doesn't rely on the technique to wow the audience. Hugo relies more on heart from John Logan's amazing script and Martin Scorsese's direction rather than on the thrills to be found wearing your cheesy 3D glasses.<br/><br/>Scorcese directing a kids movie seems like a weird move, but the master of telling intense crime dramas handles this challenge with ease. Hugo is not your usual children's tale. In fact, I'm not sure I would even label it as a children's movie. The story may go over the head of the kiddies used to seeing dumbed down garbage such as Alvin in the Chipmunks or Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill. The story line runs parallel to a time when movies were truly a magical escape, and gave the audience a live look into what dreams must look like. With Scorcese behind the wheel, Hugo delivers the same excitement as the first movies ever made.<br/><br/>For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"

","I will start off admitting that I have little to say about this film. It is an instant classic, containing many inexplicable elements that make it very difficult to give an in depth review. Simply put, it is simply heartwarming and near perfect. The only thing I can criticize on it, is the slightly whimsical dialogue; however, I'm not sure I can really call that poor, as it almost played into the atmosphere. <br/><br/>The story is perfect. It has perfect pacing and writing, and is complimented by equally charmingly perfect acting. It's not necessarily an emotional film, but it is just so enjoyably heartwarming. Hugo is a film that you simply will enjoy whatever your age or interest. It's like Pixar. Everybody loves Pixar. And so, you will love Hugo too."

","How so many people didn't enjoy Hugo truly baffles me. It's quite possible that hype backlash from the rave reviews and award nominations did Hugo a big disservice. No, it's not a masterpiece; it's not one of Scorsese's best films, and in most years, it wouldn't have deserved a best film Oscar nomination. But in the very weak 2011, it certainly deserved a nomination, and, considering the competition, maybe even the win.<br/><br/>The number one thing people ought to realize when going into it is that Hugo is not a fantasy movie. Personally, I was happy to find that out, but apparently many were disappointed. So, once again - Hugo is NOT a fantasy story, though a dreamlike atmosphere helps it straddle the line between fantasy and reality while never really crossing over. It's a fanciful adventure story, focused around a child, yes, and definitely fun for children, but by no means a children's film exclusively; most of all it's a love letter to cinema itself, most of all to the pioneers of film, and that love is what makes it so effective. Like another flawed Scorsese film - Gangs of New York - the director's unbridled passion for the subject matter makes all the difference, and it's difficult not to catch his enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Clearly, not everybody enjoyed Hugo, but for the life of me I can't really understand why. I can see how you might find the subject matter tedious, the protagonist annoying, maybe the movie thirty minutes too long; but speaking for myself, it was so much fun and so gorgeous that I didn't want it to end. Even if you didn't like the narrative, the cinematography and the sets are beyond beautiful. This is also the first movie I've seen in which the 3D actually added something to the narrative, as it helps create that feeling of magic, that dreamlike quality of cinema, that sense of wonder that we have lost in the century since the medium was invented, and which Hugo is all about."

","""Do you ever wonder where your dreams come from? Look around, this is where they are made."" Hugo Caberet spends his days winding clocks and searching for parts for his auto-man. After running into shop owner George Melies (Kingsley) and his daughter he is forced to reveal his secret to them, which sets off a chain of event that changes him and the city. I have to start by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. I really liked it but it is very slow moving and for the casual movie watcher it may seem like nothing happened. That statement may seem strange but after you watch it it will make sense to you. This is a movie that each scene builds on the next (like most Scorses's) and is hard to talk about without giving anything away but I will say that it is a movie that entertained me all the way through. I can see why the movie is up for 11 Oscars, but I will be surprised if it wins any of the major ones. Overall, a movie I really enjoyed, but again not for everyone. I give it a B+."

","After reading all of the positive reviews following it's release, I was really excited to see Hugo, but I was utterly underwhelmed to say the least. Martin Scorsese is a wonderful filmmaker, which just adds to my confusion about how bad this movie was. <br/><br/>The story is never really intriguing to begin with, but it devolves into messier, and less interesting territory as the film progresses. By the time I had gotten to the final reel, I was just praying for it to end. <br/><br/>I mean, it's great that Scorsese wants to share his knowledge and love for movies, but he can do that in much less time. This is a thirty minute movie drawn out to over two hours, and that is it's major flaw. This could have been made into a short and been far more effective, allowing the thin story line to be constrained into a shorter running time, so that it was not drawn out and boring. <br/><br/>The film has been advertised as a kid's movie, DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. They will be bored to tears, they won't be able to follow the meandering, thin story, and there's not any action to get them through it.<br/><br/>All this being said, there are small things that are good about Hugo. The performances are great, it's visually stunning, and there's a beautiful tracking shot, but this is not enough to carry a long, boring endeavor that will ultimately leave a lot of audiences frustrated."

I fought through the urge to fall asleep toward the end of the movie. 8.6 average user rating? You're dreaming. At least this film would be better than watching a film by George Melies.

","The film ""Hugo"", Martin Scosese newest film currently has cinematic reviews that were similar to his other works ""Gangs of New York"" or ""Shutter Island."" Each movie succumbed to the marketing hype of Martin Scorsese's genius, meanwhile forgetting the fact, each of these films is never chosen for a re- watch. I am a Martin Scorsese fan. This film leaves the viewer watching ninety minutes of stage preparation and bland information before the story starts; and still, a poorly comprised story at that.<br/><br/>Hugo is prime example of a badly written screenplay with a huge budget. As other reviewers have said, it is a visually gorgeous film. That however doesn't make up for the languishing story that starts as fast as a 1930's steam engine. <br/><br/>The entire story places misguided buildup on character points and plot lines that change over the course of the two hour film. As wonderful as it is to be given the accurate view of the everyday activities of the Paris train station workers (despite they all speak English), they were sidebars to the story. Seeing the mundane jobs of characters who do not have a place in the story takes away from the precious time Martin Scorsese had for character and story development needed to make this a good movie. <br/><br/>My expectation is this film will always have moderate to good reviews. However, on a movie night at home, like ""Gang's of New York"" or ""Shutter Island"", viewers will choose to NOT watch a movie at all than waste another two hours of their life watching a bad movie."

","Director Martin Scorsese has delivered the ultimate tribute to film making in HUGO from Paramount Pictures. The story dives into the real life of pioneer silent film maker Georges Melies (Sir Ben Kingsley) who made films between the years 1896 to 1913. ""Hugo"" is the name of a young orphaned boy (Asa Butterfield)in Paris, France in 1931 living inside a train station's clock and crosses paths with Melies who now works at a toy shop inside the train station when he catches Hugo stealing.<br/><br/>Hugo's quest to discover a message from his deceased father (played by Jude Law), who was a clock repairman, lies in a mystery left behind in the workings of his Dad's greatest project – a mechanical doll, or ""automata"". Through his journey, Hugo enlists the help of Melies' adopted daughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) The operation of the automata leads Hugo and Isabelle to uncover another mystery, this one with Papa Georges whom they soon find out is a great film maker now in hiding.<br/><br/>It couldn't be more appropriate that legendary film maker Martin Scorsese re-awakens the beauty in the art of film making with ""Hugo"" to remind us of how it all got started with a tribute to the re-invention of film making in 3D. A technology first for Scorsese.<br/><br/>The visuals of the movie and brown sepia tones along with the 3D effect makes it look like a combination of typical Scorsese style but at times with the 3D it also looks like a beautiful pop-up book. There are many strong human scenes in Hugo that are signature Scorsese. One particular scene was when Papa Georges caught Hugo and Isabelle snooping through his old movie drawings. In actor Kingsley's hurt reaction, ""I trusted you. You're just crueljust cruel"" there viewers can see the Scorsese stamp in revealing of the character's soul through the actor, the same style seen in ""Good Fellas"", ""Casino"", ""The Age of Innocence"" just to name a few.<br/><br/>The characters in the train station are ultimately connected to one another that all tie-back to the discovery of the message revealed in the automata. Their fight against being alone ultimately unites them all in the end. Even Hugo's worst enemy, the station inspector, humorously played by Sacha Baron Cohen, who is constantly hunting him and other orphaned children to send to the orphanage find a common bond.<br/><br/>The most touching part of ""Hugo"" is the re-introduction of film and how it all started. At a time where technology has moved us so far along into the digital age, this movie is a much welcomed tribute to the pioneers of film making. A Montague of mile stones of early film included: silent film actress Clara Bow, 1903 film ""The Great Train Robbery"", and Melies movie, ""A Trip to the Moon"". No details were left out – the glass sets that were used to shoot-in in order to light with the sun, the hand-crank projectors, the old way of cutting and gluing film pieces together in editing, and hand-painting film before color film was invented! ""Hugo"" is a must-see for any lover of film! Scorsese also worked-in the message of film preservation in a few scenes. Since founding The Film Foundation in 1990 Scorsese's name has become synonymous with film preservation in his accomplishments to save great, worthy films of the past.<br/><br/>Hugo's dad said it best in his reaction after watching ""A Trip to the Moon"", ""it was like dreaming in the middle of the day"". ""Hugo"" defines the magic in film making and telling the story of what happens when people follow their dreams as well as the consequences it brings – good or bad.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" opens in theaters Wednesday, November 2011 in 3D.<br/><br/>www.HollywoodJunket.com"
"joshbarker7","2","42","85","5 December 2011"," If you call this film a masterpiece, you're wrong.
","After reading many reviews on IMDb itself and seeing ""Hugo"" being given 8's, 9's and 10's everywhere I just had to see this movie. The fact that Martin Scorsese was given $170,000,000 to make this film raised my expectations and made me even more intrigued. So when I payed £10 to watch this film (in 3D) the bar was raised even higher.  <br/><br/>From the start of the film though, nothing is made clear, and I'm not a fan of what children call ""acting"" so for the first 10 - 20 minutes I wasn't impressed. But I thought ""it's going to open up, something will happen that is going to make this movie incredible!"". But, unfortunately, that moment never came.  The story and script was bland leaving no room for anticipation as well boring the audience. Seriously, I saw this film with my brother and no one in the screen looked remotely interested. And that's because this is a BORING film.  OK there's the odd chase and a few funny moments but for the first hour, literally, all that the film is is a little boy running round operating clocks! Which I'm sure a child would love to see! After all isn't that what cinema is all about for children? Going to watch clocks being worked on? John Logan (screenplay writer) seems to think so.<br/><br/>From then on the film takes you nowhere and the ""journey"" that the trailer claims is really just a boy running from the station inspector who is played by Sacha Baron Cohen. Now not only is he funny, but he's the only reason why I didn't walk out of the cinema. His part is played superbly as the dark side of a ""baddy"" is mixed with ridiculousness. If it weren't for him then this really would have been the worst film I have ever seen. <br/><br/>But I suppose that's what annoyed me most about ""Hugo"", the fact that Scorsese has been a legendary character when it comes to film! Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Shutter Island and Gangs of New York were all brilliant films and now, I feel, that Scorsese has let himself down. The 3D was OK, but in reality it was a film about a boy called Hugo, when really, he didn't do anything at all in 2 hours.<br/><br/>Scorsese's first Children's movie is more of a disappointment, not a masterpiece."

Martin Scorcese should stick to adult themed films. I kept expecting it to get better due to Martin Scorcese's career and all of the misleading reviews but it didn't and in hindsight, I should have gotten my money back.<br/><br/>I bet the French hate this film more than I do.

","When I first saw the trailer for Hugo I was a bit skeptical. Scorsese (the incredible director behind some of my favorite films ever, including the masterful Taxi Driver) had never done film like this before, not to mention the trailer itself sort of seemed like a formulaic, run-of-the-mill family film. Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>Hugo is a real film lover's film. Many have mentioned this before, but its true. Scorsese's brilliant direction, along with the great script, produce real magic here. Film magic, not often seen even in the greatest of films. The film isn't executed in the usual family-film way. In fact, I can imagine a lot of kids and their parents sort of leaving this film with a 'meh' reaction. It's not a soaring, thrilling adventure that we usually get. It is an adventure, but quite an intimate and personal one. That is where the film succeeds.<br/><br/>I can't really say much more except that the performances are splendid, as are all of the visual and technical aspects of course. This stands out among Scorsese's filmography, and in many ways, that's a very special thing."
"DonFishies","8","9","14","26 November 2011"," Simply stunning to watch, but a bit of a chore to love
","Martin Scorsese directing a kid's movie? You cannot be serious.<br/><br/>That was the thought that ran through my head when I first read about Hugo, based on the children's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. While it seemed like an intriguing idea, I was a bit skeptical that a man who has spent almost fifty years in the business directing violent gangster pictures and sweepingly violent period pieces would really be well equipped to direct something that was directed at youngsters. Add the fact that it is in 3D, and you have the first real time I had a doubt in Scorsese. <br/><br/>Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives as an orphan rotating and setting the clocks properly at a train station near Paris post 1930s economic depression. He is caught by the local toy store shopkeeper (played by Ben Kingsley), who confiscates the sketch pad filled with inventions and ideas originally owned by Hugo's father. Hugo obviously wants to retrieve it, but there is something deeply troubling the shopkeeper. And with the help of his granddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), the pair set out to find out just what is troubling him.<br/><br/>For all the critical praise it has and will continue to receive, it does not negate the fact that Hugo is two-thirds of a horrifically boring movie. It starts off interesting enough, but then it slows right down and barely picks itself back up. Until the subplots kicked in about the pioneering of the filmmaking medium, I had absolutely no idea where the film was going – and neither did the film. It just plays itself out without much concern, introducing characters, ideas and elements which may have proved valuable at the time, but are next to useless in the final end game. I found myself frequently questioning just what Scorsese was trying to accomplish, and found that the film was more often than not, at odds with itself. It is not a children's film by a long shot, but it is not necessarily an adult film either. There are moments of adventure and whimsy, but then there are some really dark and disturbing moments as well. It just does not know what it wants to be, and suffers as a result of it. When I am fighting the urge to pass out during one of the most highly anticipated films of the year because I am bored to tears, then there is clearly an issue.<br/><br/>While we can blame the lack of any semblance of plot development on the source material (I have not read Selznick's novel, but it sounds like a mish-mash of ideas that barely come together), I feel that Scorsese is a talented enough director that he should have been able to see through the problems, and fix them with relative ease. He is out of his element here making his first real ""children's movie"", but his craft is just as impeccable as always. Surely he could tell that he needed to make his thinly veiled plea for cinematic restoration and preservation a lot sooner and clearer than he does, right? He clearly has a passion for the material, but the film lacks that electric feel that most Scorsese films have. It lacks that jolt, that spark that really transcends the medium, and sets his work apart from everyone else's. If you had very little knowledge of the project and left Hugo before the cinema subplot kicks in, you may not even know the film was part of Scorsese's oeuvre. It may simply look like a very gorgeous film, with some intriguing characters and a total lack of a cohesive story. <br/><br/>But for all the story related issues, I must say that the film is very impressive to look at. The sets, the costumes, and the editing style – all of it is just as incredible as we have come to expect. Scorsese knows how to make a really authentic and meticulously designed period piece, and his work here is no different. But what really makes it dazzle and come to life, rather surprisingly, is the 3D. It is generously employed throughout the film very carefully, very rarely coming off as the gimmick it inherently is. Instead, it adds depth and a stunning realism to the film. It feels like you are in the movie, experiencing what Hugo sees and feels. It may look extremely fake when it hits Blu-ray, but there is no questioning how astonishing it looks here. Seeing the clocks in action is particularly wonderful, as is the subtle use of snow outside and dust inside. And even though it is used quite frequently, you never grow tired of it. You just sit in your seat, and wait for the next effect Scorsese throws at you.<br/><br/>Acting is strong across the board, from main players like Butterfield, Moretz, Sacha Baron Cohen and Kingsley, to bit players who serve very little purpose like Frances de la Tour, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee and Emily Mortimer, to blink-and-you-will-miss-them extended cameos like Jude Law and Ray Winstone. Everyone is on their A-game, and shines well above the dialogue and actions they are given. Particular attention needs to be played to Butterfield, who shoulders the majority of the film almost exclusively. His plight is the stuff of wonder and imagination, and would have been simply riveting had the film's content been a bit better focused. <br/><br/>While Hugo is a positively stunning experience to view, the majority of the story leaves a lot to be imagined. Even with the great acting and wonderful 3D, the film suffers from a horrendous element of boredom constantly. When the third act kicks in, it finally figures out what it wants to be and suddenly the film becomes the masterpiece it should have been all along. I did enjoy Hugo, but this is quite simply a good movie that could have been brilliant. <br/><br/>8/10."
"gsf369","7","9","14","26 November 2011"," A little over hyped!
","Preliminary reviews suggested that this was a masterpiece but upon seeing the movie I found it fell short of that lofty appraisal. The story is very good but the movie runs too long and has stretches of boredom, especially when trying to develop subsidiary characters. The movie picks up every time Ben Kingsley appears but Asa Buttererfield disappoints in the lead role as I found that I was watching him act rather than being caught up in his character. Chloe Grace Moretz and Emily Mortimer are very good in their roles but Sacha Baron Cohen is over the top in a uneven performance. I am not a fan of 3D and this movie could have done without it, although I must admit there are some incredibly wondrous 3D effects but there are also a number of scenes where the 3D is a distraction. <br/><br/>I would suggest that this is not a ""kids"" movie but one for those at least 10 and over.

","Scorceses first foray into 'childrens' movies is his best since the Departed, and gives Kingsley his best performance since 'Sexy Beast'.<br/><br/>The film is a love affair of all things cinema, but the Auteur doesn't let you in on this until late in the second act.<br/><br/>The titular character lives in a dreamlike train station, keeping the clocks to the correct time, watching the everyday lives of the people who work there, and trying to stay one step ahead of the station agent.<br/><br/>The events that led Hugo to live there are tragic though. His father was killed in a fire and his uncle took him into his 'care'. Before the tragedy, Hugo and his father were in the middle of restoring a clockwork man, which when working, had the ability to write.<br/><br/>But despite all this, Hugo strives to complete the restoration, despite stealing parts from the toymaker. But one thing is missing, a key shaped like a heart, that will reveal everything and maybe a little more about the everyday people who work on the station....<br/><br/>The film is flawless, everything you would expect from a film released at this time of year, but with the added class of Scorcese. Again the man has tackled different forms of cinema (3D) a has given the film something other 3D movies don't give, intimidation, warmth, a personality.<br/><br/>From the Burtonesque external sets, to the 'in your face' moment when the station agent asks the two children what they are doing, the 3D is an important part of the film and in some cases even the narrative. This maybe because Scorcese is saying 'yes it's all good and well using 3D' but look what they did when all this was fresh, and people were not bothered about budgets and reaping profit'.<br/><br/>It's a decidedly heavy subject for young children, but my six year old was dazzled at the scenery, cinematography, and appeared to be awe-inspired at the footage of the old movies.<br/><br/>The storytelling is amazing, you are constantly thinking 'where are they going with this' but as the narration explains, the answer is all in the key. Kingsley is amazing as the pioneer, and I wouldn't be surprised if he is up for an award sometime soon.<br/><br/>Moretz and Butterfield are too excellent as the children on the quest, and look comfortable acting alongside veterans such as Lee, Lae, Winstone, and Mortimer.<br/><br/>Cohen fares well, his conversations with the chief are one of the highlights of the film, but he comes across a little too Clouseau and sounds like Boyce from Only fools and Horses.<br/><br/>But believe me, this is one of the years best movies, and has flawless narration and is beautiful to look act, whilst educational for young ones too, teaching them that simplicity can be good too."

","It may seem odd that a movie about the magic of cinema, in an age where cinema proved itself to be more than just a fad, the 1920s, would be made utilizing 3D, a gimmick that seems to be all the rage today. This gets lampshaded by one particular scene, where the audience watches a scene where a train pulls into a station and flips out, as they think the train is coming for them. Yet, given the subject matter, it only seems inevitable that a man like Martin would think up such an idea for such a plot, anyway.<br/><br/>Based off the book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", which is a stunning mix of hand drawings and writing, and set in 1920s Paris, the film ""Hugo"" tells the story of Hugo Cabret, a young orphan who works and lives in the clock tower of a train station, which is ruled by a ruthless inspector, and is also where he has been stealing several toys for their parts to fix a broken automaton, made for the movies of Georges Méilès. One day, when caught trying to steal a toy, the owner notices Hugo's notebook, which contains conceptual sketches for the automaton, and steals it, to which Hugo tries to get back.<br/><br/>But Hugo instead meets Uncle Georges' adoptive daughter, who helps him try to get the notebook back. But through all this, they both end up in the mystery surrounding the automaton, and movies. Isabelle hasn't seen a movie, and after a stint in a cinema, they find out that film itself is what keeps drawing them closer and closer in this spider's web... and so begins an adventure for the two where they discover themselves, the joy of movies, and the need to stick together in the face of adversity.<br/><br/>Wow... What a film. Honestly, I don't think I've seen a movie like this at all. I always knew you could count on Marty to blow your mind, and here he really has outdone himself. I was left speechless after the movie- honestly I don't think I've been left with that feeling in ages.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is just brilliant. First, the acting is STELLAR. Asa Butterfield plays the titular character so heartbreakingly beautifully. He puts so much pain and emotion into his performance that it's as mesmerizing as it is heartbreaking. He is a great actor with the eyes too, and he really showed it here... Every melancholy expression of his had me on the verge of tears (and I'm a very manly guy!!!). Moertz... Well, we knew she was amazing when we saw her in Kick-Ass!, and she is especially brilliant here. Cohen is his usual funny self, let's face it: he was made for the comic roles. He does brilliantly here. But best of all is Kingsley... Oh man. Word to all directors ever: if you don't want your audience reduced to sobbing messes, never have Ben Kingsley play a broken old man, ever. We all know he's an amazing actor. But here, he gives his most devastatingly beautiful performance ever. I cried in a few places, he is that phenomenal.<br/><br/>The plot? Well, you knew already it's great. But my synopsis does not do it justice, believe me. Absolutely beautifully done.<br/><br/>The cinematography is perfect, and the 3D is amazing. This is the best 3D I've seen in any movie, ever. It helps tell the story, for once- it helps a movie about the magic of filmmaking, that should say something. This must be seen in a 3D cinema, I mean that. Every single detail is exposed, there's several moments where its like you're looking through a window. I think Scorsese made a wise choice to shoot in 1:85.1, too. That helped give the movie the old timey feel it aimed for. I will definitely add this film to my Blu ray collection, even if it's just to show off my HD equipment for family members visiting in the future.<br/><br/>And another thing- the feel of the movie is perfect. This is a film made for us who go to a movie to immerse ourselves in it. To escape from reality and indulge in this world being brought forth to us. Not since TRON: Legacy have we gotten a film as magical as that, and I did not want this movie to end at all.<br/><br/>In short, do not miss this film. If you're tired of brainless blockbusters and dialogue driven movies that turn them into videotaped plays, and want a film that sums up why we go to the cinema, see this movie. You will regret having missed it, if you don't, and that I guarantee.<br/><br/>Bravo, Scorsese. You have re-proved yourself as a favourite filmmaker of mine.<br/><br/>OVERALL: 10/10<br/><br/>THE GOOD: Everything!<br/><br/>THE BAD: ...the fact that it had to end. :("
"classicsoncall","10","11","18","3 December 2011"," ""Do you want to have an adventure?""
","3-D movies have been in the mainstream for a few years now but I've never been compelled to see one in that format. So given the choice today, I stuck with 2-D and when all was said and done, I was suitably impressed. The period setting and particularly the workings of young Hugo Cabret's (Asa Butterfield) clock tower home were visually stunning to me; all those gears and wheels working together harmoniously together conveyed a sense of logic and purpose to the unfolding story. What I wasn't expecting was director Scorsese's unbridled tribute to cinema as an art form when the picture steers a path toward the life work of film maker George Melies (Ben Kingsley). Reaching all the way back to the silent film era, Scorsese makes a connection with all those great directors of a time gone by - Chaplin, Keaton, Griffith - and I found myself enjoying snippets of their own pictures interspersed throughout the story.<br/><br/>As for the principals, I found the youngsters Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz providing the heart for this picture, aiding the Kingsley character Papa George to cast off the despondency of his current life to relive the glory of an earlier time. Now had I known Sacha Baron Cohen was in this film, I might have stayed away from it altogether as I'm no fan of Borat. But he gives an interesting and amusing performance here as the train station inspector attempting to make a connection of his own with the fetching flower girl Lisette (Emily Mortimer). He provides a nuance to the character that I wasn't expecting given the absurdity of some of his previous work.<br/><br/>Virtually every other review I've read about the film on this board mentions it's relevance as a kids' movie, but somehow I didn't get that sense while I was watching it. It doesn't present a childish theme or approach it's subject matter in a juvenile way; in fact my impression was that a real young child might have to have a fair amount of the story explained to him or her. Certainly the areas of the picture dealing with the silent film era, including the recovered Melies reels would be almost boring for a young viewer. However considering my overall impression with the picture coming out of the theater today, I'd have to say that I'm ready to make that mental leap of faith by seeing my first 3-D film, and it very well may be ""Hugo""."

The story was so geared towards movie buffs, old movies; there is hardly a child that will understanding nor care about the plot. I almost fell asleep. I had such high hopes for this one. I didn't cry, I didn't chuckle.... just watched, and watched, and watched. It felt like it would never end.

"JimmyCollins","6","19","35","18 January 2012"," Lush, beautiful to watch, great acting but a tad boring in parts.
","Hugo has been lauded as a modern masterpiece and I can totally see why it has got the great rap that it has, Martin Scorcese is a director who doesn't do anything half great, it's always perfect and exceptional, and Hugo is no exception to that, however I do think that there is a severe lack in plot. The gorgeous look and feel of the film didn't override the fact that for 2 thirds of the film I was somewhat bored and uninterested, the plot doesn't seem to really take off until the third act, after that it is a truly wonderful film going experience.<br/><br/>The production of this film is just exceptional, from the opening scenes of Paris to the closing scenes of the automaton the way the film looks can simply take your breath away. The music is divine and beautiful to hear as it is perfectly suited to the time and place. And the acting is wonderful, Asa Butterfield who is in pretty much every scene is a great young actor who I'm sure will be mega, and Chloe Moretz impresses with a very different role to her usual roles, she is already huge and just seems to get better and bigger, she will definitely be winning awards very soon I think, and the supporting cast are swell, none really standout but they are all great.<br/><br/>A few other things I had a problem with was continuity. I picked up on quite a gee things that didn't match up, and also Emily Mortimer's role was very underwritten, I think for a tiny part such as hers it should have been played by an unknown, not a distinguished actress who is far beneath a tiny role. I mean if you can forgive it for it's few tiny flaws, it's slow pace and it's lack of plot you will really enjoy Hugo, it does pay off in the end.<br/><br/>But really it's worth seeing purely for the way it looks, and in 3d it's even more beautiful to watch. Give it a go. I'm sure you will probably love it."

","When I walked in the theater to see this, my first 3D film in a theater for several decades, there were eight people populating the entire theater to watch this grand homage to Mr Melies. Two people left during the film, so one-quarter of the audience walked out.<br/><br/>I love early cinema so Scorsese was preaching to the choir with me, but as entertainment, this film falls flat. The visual wonders of the film gave way to incredible boredom. The story is convoluted and after awhile one stops caring because the film has no heart; the mechanical animations are the films heart, not the characters, who are wooden props. The sole redeeming feature of this film is Ben Kingsley as George Melies, who plays the mysterious, forlorn character.<br/><br/>After seeing Kundun in 1997, the Gangs of New York in 2003 and now this, I think that Scorsese has lost his way. It looks like he's taken an unofficial retirement from his Italian/ gangster films that he was so good at, only to focus on trying to impress audiences with how eclectic and balanced of a filmmaker he is. <br/><br/>He is out of his zone again and his annoying practice of preaching about film preservation comes into full bloom here, especially the scene when the book is opened at the library. It truly was vomit-inducing, as are what seem to be the paid shills who are lining up to give over-the-top praise to this $170 million clunker."
"unrealban","1","22","42","12 February 2012"," Snooze Fest ... ZzzZZzzZzZzz
","Wowzer !! Sorry Scorcese, you finally let me down in a huge(o) way. This film was a complete snooze fest from about 5 minutes in all the way to the anticlimactic ending.<br/><br/>Where do I start? Well, lets just say that the movie doesn't make anything clear. It does not have any exposition dialog informing us what Hugo's mission and desire is. We are shown flashbacks of a soon to be dead father and a mechanical robot, and somehow are supposed to relate the two together and care about them. Somehow this mechanical robot is deeply rooted in Hugo and his father's life, yet we are never told why this is.<br/><br/>What this movie was missing was a cliché, but desperately needed narration (voiceover) by Hugo himself. Throughout the entire movie, I could care less about Hugo's struggle to fix the mechanical robot. There was nothing at stake .. so what if Hugo fails at his mission to fix the robot? Am I really supposed to cry about this failure? What Hugo should have been trying to do was get himself out of the terrible, homeless, and impoverished life that he was living. Instead, the whole notion of using time as a symbol, was overwhelming the story. In nearly every frame, there is a picture of a clock, or a ticking sound, and quite frankly, it gets annoying quick.<br/><br/>Yes, the visuals are absolutely stunning and the environment Scorcese creates it's breathtaking, reminiscent to Scorcese's Gangs of New York, where every extra or character is dressed perfectly with the set or time period they were in. Other then that? Ehh ... there is no heart, depth, or emotion rooted in the story. Maybe it was the actor, Asa Butterfield, who simply couldn't command screen presence or likability or endearing qualities to him. But usually, even an actor cannot completely tarnish an entire film with such great potential to it.<br/><br/>There are some redeeming qualities to this picture, but as a whole, the film comes off as flat, forced and melodramatic. It is hollow and tries to be dramatic, but fails to deliver the goods due to bad storytelling and screen writing. <br/><br/>Scorcese tried to salvage what he could, and capitalize on what little greatness there is in the visuals and setting, but in the end, Hugo will be remembered as having an insane amount of potential that never lived up to the billing."

","Can't say that I was keen to watch this movie. Reviews gave me the impression that it was aimed at people who had an encylopaedic knowledge of early cinema. Did read an interview in my local tabloid with Chloë Grace Moretz where she mentions fooling the director Martin Scorcese with her English accent when auditioning for her role in the movie. That was a sort of a hook into this film for me (I have seen Chloë in a couple of other movies where some random factoid also provided a 'hook' to see the movie). In any case, Chloë's accent is probably the least interesting aspect of this movie. If you like slow burning mysteries, there's a lot to like here for you.<br/><br/>It's the story of the titular boy (played by Asa Butterfield) who is an orphan and lives in a clock tower in Paris. He has certain items which belonged to his father. Part of the mystery is how Hugo got to be an orphan. The other part of the mystery is the relationship between Hugo's father and Georges (played by Ben Kingsley)...they seem to have some connection as evidenced by Hugo's possessions.<br/><br/>Georges' story becomes a reverential homage to the history of cinema in the hands of Scorcese (the character of Georges was unknown to me by name alone...so perhaps cinema afficionados would appreciate this movie on 'another level' if the name rings a bell for them). There does seem to be some factual basis to the story so my curiosity is piqued as to how much truth there is to Georges' biography in this movie (concerning what happened to him after World War I)...is there a lot of fact or a lot of wish fulfilment on Scorcese's part? <br/><br/>Performances are uniformly strong. Chloë (as Isabelle) has an element of ""jolly hockey sticks"" to her performance at times, which seems to be from another movie...if this movie has source material, perhaps this element was diluted in the movie? Wasn't so much of a fan of this aspect to her character. Asa has a very fine moment near the end of the movie where he emotes movingly (to the following person...). Sacha Baron Cohen has a major role as the station inspector where Hugo lives...often coming across as a hybrid between Inspector Clouseau and an Innitman. Some of his physical comedy is good in this movie and I guess that he may have improvised some of his lines...it seems at times that the people he is playing against are genuinely surprised and amused by his utterances. Ben Kingsley also shows many sides to his character and getting a take on his character early on his hard.<br/><br/>A weird observation to make, but...looking at Chloë sometimes, she seemed a bit androgynous looking to me (had a touch of the Macauley Culkins to me, it seemed. Maybe she could have been framed better at times...although there is some effective 3D imagery where certain characters are grotesquely framed)...maybe she could play a boy in another movie and win an Oscar? That would certainly be a 'hook'! Isabelle certainly does have an interesting vocabulary...I had to paint the picture myself of how I imagined Hugo would process her utterances...but, again, this element of Isabelle's character is not overplayed, fortunately. Maybe Chloë was miscast, in the following sense...she is a big girl now and towers over Asa...so, unless Asa prefers more mature women...(hmm...tongue in cheek, Isabelle's interest in Hugo does come across as a little bit creepy with that height differential...not sure if any source material has an (probable) age difference like this).<br/><br/>One pleasant surprise to me...have read in the past about the very first reactions to cinema, when it was invented...it was nice to be reminded of this in this movie...e.g. the black and white footage of a train pulling into a station.<br/><br/>This isn't an action packed movie or a laugh a minute, but it does have an engaging story and people may get a kick out of the footage from the early days of cinema. Maybe I've got a melancholy disposition, but I could have imagined giving this movie a higher score if things took a dark turn towards the end...when Hugo is keen to show Georges something as a surprise.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in 3D. Many times the effect is impressively realised through camera movement or framing."

","Hype surrounding a movie is not always a recipe for success – there are the rare exceptions – but, unfortunately, Hugo is not one of them.<br/><br/>However, this will not affect box office figures as the big names attached, such as its director, and cast, but I can't see it having any lasting effect on audiences. <br/><br/>Mix together the elements of Harry Potter, The Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings, Moulin Rouge – without the magic – and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, et voila, you get Hugo. <br/><br/>And that is the problem in a nutshell – it has all the money and colour that Hollywood can buy, but it does not have its own unique identity due to a weak storyline. <br/><br/>It is the sad tale of a young boy (Butterfield) who's left all alone in the world when his clock-fixing father (Law) dies, but not before he has learned a few skills of his own. <br/><br/>His alcoholic uncle (Winstone) arrives on the scene and leaves Hugo with little choice for his future – either he starves or does his uncle's job, maintaining the clock tower at Paris railway station. <br/><br/>The only thing Hugo takes with him from home is a robot that his father rescued from a museum, and was in the process of fixing its intricate mechanics when he met his demise. <br/><br/>The notebook where he kept his drawings and ideas about the robot falls into the hands of French film pioneer, Georges Méliès (Kingsley). <br/><br/>Until he can get it back, Hugo is determined to finish the job, believing his father will send a sign through it, and he almost does complete the task but a heart shaped key needed to turn the robot on eludes him. <br/><br/>Hugo follows Méliès home and befriends his godchild (Moretz), who helps Hugo on his way to a happy ending. <br/><br/>On the outside, this has the potential to be a great movie, with the high-profile director at the helm, the scenes of Paris of the early 20th century are magnificent, and the cast could not have be bettered – notably, Butterfield (The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas) is excellent in the title role, and station inspector (Baron Cohen) brings some humour to an otherwise sad story – but there is little substance to it. <br/><br/>There were a few subplots, including those involving Christopher Lee (Lord of The Rings) and Frances De La Tour (Rising Damp), which were not explored enough. <br/><br/>In fact, the characters added little or no value to the story, and should have been cut out. <br/><br/>I could try to explain away my disappointment in this movie by being more than two decades older than the target audience, but that unfortunately still makes it mediocre.<br/><br/>Incidentally, look out for a cameo appearance by Scorsese photographing a young Ben Kingsley mid-way through the film."

","I went to go see this movie with my mother, after reading several good reviews. I felt completely ripped off.<br/><br/>First of all, I had to pay almost double for the tickets, as it was showing in 3D. This feels like a complete scam, because the 3D adds absolutely nothing to the movie. I would have rather watched it in 2D, since I wouldn't have to wear the doofy glasses.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a wide view of Paris, which is funny, because the entire movie is in English. There is not even a single character that has a French accent. An English film set in Paris is borderline offensive, if you ask me, and is the first reason why I felt insulted by the film. Did Martin Scorcese not respect his audience enough to be able to read subtitles? Watching characters speak English and then pronounce French names and cities felt silly and slightly offensive.<br/><br/>Another major problem with the film is that there is not a single solid performance out of any of the characters. The actor playing Hugo was visibly shaking throughout the entire movie, and did not sound convincing at any point in the film. Chloë Grace Moretz's performance was the worst of the film. Every time she spoke she talked I wanted to leave the theater, because her tone sounded so mushy and overly-emotional. She also had an expression of exaggerated excitement throughout every scene that felt very unnatural.<br/><br/>I can almost excuse the actors' performances, however, because the dialogue was god awful. I felt like I was supposed to be laughing at the absurdity of some of their lines, for example, Hugo often goes on stunningly dull tangents where he says things like ""Maybe I like to fix things, because I feel that everything has a purpose. If everything has a purpose, that means I have a purpose. My purpose is to fix this machine, and to find out what my father's last message was. I must fix this machine."" Honestly, a four year old could have written a more interesting script.<br/><br/>This film is incredibly boring, mostly because it's plot is set at a crawling speed. Something will happen, and then it will take the characters 30 minutes to stop talking about it. I also felt that many scenes were added just to take up time. For example, when Hugo is running from the inspector with the automaton. This scene is nearly 10 minutes long, and adds absolutely nothing to the film.<br/><br/>Do not waste your life by sitting through this movie."

","As a huge fan of Martin Scorsese I was really looking forward to watching Hugo. While it didn't look like the type of film I would usually associate with Scorsese the reviews were good and the story line sounded decent so i went to the cinema expecting a children's film which would also be entertaining for adults.<br/><br/>Within half an hour of the film my girlfriend was completely bored out of her mind and I have to admit I was really struggling with it. The film was set in Paris yet most of the cast had cockney accents, the main star was little more than a cardboard cut out, Sacha Baron Cohen's character was cringe worthy and most disappointing of all, the story really wasn't that entertaining. As the film went on my girlfriend was desperate to walk out but as it was Scorsese I was convinced that something incredible was going to happen if we just sat it out, i was wrong!!!!<br/><br/>On and on the film went and it struck me, this film was primarily meant for kids! I really couldn't imagine any child being captivated by this story. In fact some of the kids in the cinema were fast asleep!<br/><br/>SPOILER - When it was eventually revealed that Sir Ben Kingsley's character was an old movie maker the film did get slightly entertaining as we were effectively given a 20 minute documentary on the early history of film. This 20 minutes saved the film from being a total disaster as it was actually quite interesting. However, if Scorsese wanted to write about the early history of film why didn't he just do a documentary on it rather than put it around this feeble, boring and at times embarrassing story line.<br/><br/>When the film came to an end I looked on in stunned silence. I really couldn't believe just how bad it was compared to some of the reviews I had read. When I told my girlfriend that the film has now been nominated for 11 Academy awards we wondered if we had seen the same film as the Academy members as to our recollection it was self indulgent dross. Thankfully, after speaking to some of my friends who have also seen the film their thoughts on it coincided with mine, in fact some of them were clever enough to walk out half way through and not waste any more of their time.<br/><br/>If this film wins best picture or director at the Academy Awards I will be stunned and it will only emphasise that it has been a pretty poor year for film. I really really wanted to like this movie, and gave it every chance, but its just not that good!"
"tthreadgill","9","5","7","19 January 2013"," Wonderfully Un-Hollywood
","Reading the other reviews of Hugo here at IMDb makes it quite obvious that this is a movie people either love of just don't get. So, before you decide to watch this movie you need to ask yourself a few questions. Are you a fan of Hollywood movies? Do you prefer clear or predictable story lines? Are blockbuster action movies your cup of tea? Or romantic drama's where the characters always fall in love end up together. If so, maybe this movie is not for you.<br/><br/>However, If you are you a fan of foreign films, particularly European films, where subtle character development and a complex unfolding story is the norm, you just might love this movie as much as I did. The acting, direction, cinema photography, art direction and overall production value is simply wonderful. The plot unfolds like peeling away layers of an onion. If you're in a hurry, it just ruins the experience. This type of movie is to be savored like a fine wine, not garbled down like a diet coke.<br/><br/>Did you see Jean de Florette, Chocolate, Cinema Paradiso, Delicatssen? If you loved these, you'll love Hugo."

","I saw this in theaters about a year ago. I was able to make complaints about pacing, a certain lack of character shading, and some technical issues with sound and sfx visuals. Since then, I recently woke up thinking about the intro of this movie for some reason and how well it placed you in this Parisian setting. I loved watching it in 3-D due to the TASTEFUL use of the effect that Scorsese placed in it -- particles of dust, a foreground object here or there, with only 2 or 3 major set piece 3-D scenes. I watched it again and felt comforted by the simple story, the straightforward emotions of the characters...it kind of reminded me of when we watched ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" or ""Oliver"" in elementary school. These movies were set in a period far removed from ours yet struck a chord by teaching you something or giving you a bit of perspective on the lives of kids from previous generations. Even if the sets were blatantly artificial. Like any good Scorsese film, though, the movie is ultimately about redemption. The sadness of the toy shop owner and his redemption through the children who are still able to be inspired by his dreams. Even if it's still got some flaws, ""Hugo"" is a pretty solid movie, and if your kids are ADHD-rattled punks who will watch colorful, crass kid's stuff (which, I will admit, are still likable), it ought to give them a movie to feel comforted by, especially on a cold winter's day, warm under a blanket. A movie experience like ""cuddling up with a good book""."

","Once again this school holidays we have another family film pestering serious moviegoers to be seen because of its impressive line-up of talent on both sides of the camera, its dazzlingly positive reviews, its boastful incorporation of weighty concepts and its self-professed widespread appeal. People eventually discard their misgivings and hop and board because they feel that they would otherwise be missing out on something important. Unfortunately, the film usually disappoints as soon as the audience begins critically examine this critically-lauded film and finds its story to rife with revolting clichés, its themes plucked from easy and overused targets, such as World War 2, and its universality entirely dependent on the younger viewers misunderstanding the true substance of the piece.<br/><br/>For these deficiencies, the critics always make the excuse that one must re-enter that state of childlike acceptance of the preposterous in order to fully appreciate the film. However, they condemn those that do watch films in this same mindset when writing about the way they flock heedlessly to summer blockbusters. It often seems that reviewers just arbitrarily pick out one of the many hackneyed and saccharine family films and refer to them as ""heart-warming"".<br/><br/>Hugo, however, doesn't ask forgiveness for anything. All it requires of us is two hours of our time to show all the spectacular tricks it can perform. Adapted from Brian Selznick's book The Adventures of Hugo Cabret is a film in two indistinct halves: one simple, slow and enigmatic, elevated by astonishing visuals, the other more pacey and fascinatingly complex, with more of a focus on story; one exploring the wonders of machinery, the other delving into the rich world of early cinema.<br/><br/>Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is one of the many orphans left in the aftermath of the Great War, now scraping out an existence stealing food from the shops of a Parisian train station and dwelling inside and secretly operating the intricate workings of the enormous clock tower that overlooks the busy swarm of passengers boarding the trains to work each day. He is constantly dodging and living in fear of the ruthless station insepctor (Sacha Baron Cohen), a hardened war veteran who hobbles about in a troublesome, squeaky peg leg. However, it is not the inspector who eventually catches him but the equally humourless and world-weary owner of a toy repair shop (Ben Kingsley) who catches him stealing parts for a mysterious project. He seizes searches and harasses the poor boy, who he sees as a worthless thief, finding an eerily familiar notebook of mechanical calculations and sketches in his pockets, which he confiscates. Hugo insists on having it returned to him, no matter how many times the man refuses or threatens him, and goes to the point of enlisting the help of the man's sympathetic ward Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz).<br/><br/>It takes quite a while for any light to be shed on the subject of this all-important notebook, or indeed anything else surrounding the boy or the old man, but it would be terrible of me to reveal anything as the audience is very deliberately kept in the dark for much of the movie. As I've said before, the breathtaking 3D imagery of the vague early passages prevents the audience from drifting off or becoming impatient. Details such as the camera's swift turns and dips in a fast-paced navigation through stylistically designed cascading snow-covered rooftops, jungles of clockwork and fast-moving steam trains make every scene utterly captivating.<br/><br/>Then, as secrets are uncovered, characters fleshed out, relationships cemented and dramatic events start to occur, the eye candy is either packed away so as not be distracting, or the audience becomes accustomed the stunning aesthetic – I'm not sure which – and the film takes flight in a very different way. As describing these climactic sections is impossible to do without ruining its effect – this is the most prevalent flaw in the concept of film reviews – let me simply say for all its teetering on the edge of toxic contrivances, it pulls through with believability and purpose. In fact, it is on these latter two qualities where it finds the common ground between the two aforementioned fields. At least in its early stages, motion pictures were among the other stupendous carnival attractions that impressed everyone with its innovative creation of a seamless illusion.<br/><br/>Finally, as for the ensemble of accomplished cinematic practitioners, due credit must go to Martin Scorcese, who directs without losing his artistic integrity or his maturity, but still ensuring that younger audiences will have something to marvel at, and some element of the film's meaning to hold onto. His cast has been impressively assembled, and do a fine job in their roles. It is a pleasure to see Helen McCrory, Richard Griffiths, Frances de la Tour (all who are now best known for their involvement in the Harry Potter films), the lovely Emily Mortimer, the charming Jude Law, the irrepressibly robust Ray Winstone and the monstrously prolific, now 89-year-old Christopher Lee taking on colourful supporting roles. However, deserving of particular mention are Asa Butterfield, Ben Kingsley and Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen and Kingsley give terrifically sympathetic and multi-layered portrayals of two of the war's most miserable victims, and while Kingsley has put his abilities to good use, Cohen sadly often wastes his lively comic charisma trying to offend as many people as possible instead of making them appreciated in films like Sweeney Todd and Madagascar. Most importantly, our young star Master Butterfield has finally found some worthy exposure for his remarkable portrayals of troubled boys who have long lived in very difficult circumstances, but have hardly grown especially stealthy or adept at coping with their environment, and still retain an internal emotional delicacy.<br/><br/>So, believe me when I say that Hugo is a must-see remarkable cinematic achievement for the entire family, and, best of all, you can critically analyse all you like, it can take it!"

","One of the most awful movie I have ever seen. Boring, way too slow and constantly talking about death, missing families and all that. The storyline is nothing to write home about and I don't know how so many people liked this movie, perhaps teenagers did it because to me this was clearly unwatchable. Maybe Scorsese's eyebrows are beginning also to grow inwardly making him lose the ability to make a good movie, just saying, don't know. Nothing of this movie astounded me, it just didn't appeal to me at all. I felt like I was wasting my time. The movie just strain way too much for effect and instead of swaying people it bores them.

","I went to see this movie with an open mind. I'm a big fan of several of the actors and Scorsese too. Sadly, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is a beautifully shot movie, even in the 2D version, but there are so many things that are never explained or explored, I keep wondering if there is about an hours worth of plot that ended on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS) For instance, why is a superstar like Christopher Lee cast as the book store owner with about three lines and two scenes? It's obvious that he knows the name Cabret very well. This is not explored further. In his second (and last) scene with Hugo, he gives him a copy of Robin Hood. This seems to be of some importance. Nothing more comes of this, making the whole second scene pointless.<br/><br/>There are several other plot holes (or, at least, depressions), but I'll let you judge for yourself. I found it made for a very weak story. And then there's a bit of overacting, but I expected nothing less.<br/><br/>3/10. Scorsese can do better than this."
"Leofwine_draca","3","6","9","23 July 2014"," Scorsese screws up
","HUGO was marketed as being this huge, magical children's feel-good adventure film, Oscar bait and a visual triumph from director Martin Scorsese. Having just watched it, I can instead report that it's the director's worst film to date, an overblown and deathly dull outing that disappoints from the outset. Even Scorsese's assured direction can't disguise the shortcomings of the script.<br/><br/>Essentially, HUGO is a tribute to the work of early cinema pioneer Georges Melies, played well by Ben Kingsley. However, this part of the film takes up half an hour at most and Scorsese would have been much better off making a documentary about Melies as it would have been much more interesting. The rest of the film is a non-starter about a orphaned kid lurking around in a Paris train station.<br/><br/>The film goes for a steampunk style look which was already done in CITY OF EMBER, so visually it did nothing for me. The CGI effects are over obvious and it annoyed me that effects like a toy mouse and a character climbing a wall were achieved by CGI when they could easily have been done physically - it's sheer laziness. Asa Butterfield is an extremely limited actor who brings zero warmth or charisma to his lead role, to the extent that I was hoping he'd disappear from the screen before long - no such luck though.<br/><br/>Much of the film concerns a ridiculous sub-plot involving the dreadful Sacha Baron Cohen, once again going completely over the top as a comedic station inspector who chases the titular character about. How does this ""actor"" still get work? The comedy is laboured and unfunny and I was cringing in places. Then elsewhere we get Chloe Grace Moretz, way out of her comfort zone and inanely grinning at everything and everyone around her. The film drags on for over two hours, throwing endless cameos at you (hello, Christopher Lee!) and it easily feels like double that length. Yes, I hated it, if you couldn't already tell."

I'm amazed but not surprised that this little gem of a film didn't get more attention and theater time - it is subtle in its approach, PLUS there's no magic wands to merchandise, no Lego sets to push, and no Hufflepuff scarves to market. No wonder it appears to have gone to DVD and Blue Ray so quickly.

"napierslogs","7","6","9","4 December 2011"," An orphan goes on an adventure, and we discover the magic of filmmaking
","""Hugo"" has Martin Scorsese master the children's adventure movie genre. Scorsese's 2010 hit was ""Shutter Island"" where he mastered the suspense thriller by paying attention to every detail in the film. Here, the camera is in the walls of a 1930s train station in Paris where we see the inner workings of clocks, an automaton, and an orphan boy looking for a key. It's also in 3D and is about the history of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Visually, this is a masterpiece. Easily the best 3D movie released in recent memory, if not of all time. There is seamless merging between computer-generated graphics and real sets. Conceptually, this is very impressive. As Hugo is on one of his adventures, he starts finding connections to old films. These are not just fictional films that help the story along. Scorsese is actually telling us the history of filmmaking and uses the real footage of important films. He even rendered these real films in 3D. I don't know how he does it.<br/><br/>Story wise, ""Hugo"" suffered. It meandered a lot, never quite deciding which little adventure to start, or solve, or finish. A trick that I have learned in screen writing is to use a time frame to set the story in, a ticking clock as some might say. Ironically, for a film that had more actual ticking clocks than any other, they didn't give their story one.<br/><br/>One has to question if this was really meant to be a children's movie. The over two-hour run time sent the younger kids crying into the arms of their mothers as exhaustion set in. And as the story moved away from an orphan boy on an adventure to the history of filmmaking, it became quite dry for the older kids. I found Hugo, our hero, to be a snotty kid who didn't even want to tell us what he was up to in the beginning, but at least the kids liked him. And I, at least, had the history of filmmaking to amuse me immensely.<br/><br/>I don't think ""Hugo"" was just supposed to be the history of filmmaking, but the magic of it. For those of us who love films, it certainly was magical. Hugo, the young boy, was removed from discovering the magic because his little adventure was mostly solved by the time we got into it. Unfortunately, I think this removes the kids in the audience from discovering the magic of it. But the kids can have fun watching a robot while the adults are educated — perhaps that is what makes ""Hugo"" so special.<br/><br/>Conveniently, both ""Hugo"" and The Artist"" are supposed to be the big winners of awards season this year, both were released the same month, and both have something to say about movies. After you watch ""Hugo"" and are introduced to the earliest films of the Lumière brothers and Georges Méliès, watch ""The Artist"" it picks up where ""Hugo"" left off and introduces us to stars of silent films, the golden age of Hollywood."
"ferguson-6","8","6","9","28 November 2011"," Through the Eyes behind the Face
","Greetings again from the darkness. This latest from Martin Scorsese can be fitted with multiple labels and each would be correct: a tribute to the birth of movies, a case for film preservation, a children's fable, a special effects/3D extravaganza, a family movie with touches of Dickens. Very few directors would tackle such an ambitious project and succeed in producing such a magical experience.<br/><br/>Based on Brian Selznick's (relative to the film giant David O. Selznick)children's book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", this is a story of redemption and fulfillment. Asa Butterfield plays Hugo, made an orphan when his watchmaker father (Jude Law) dies in a fire. Hugo gathers up the project he and his dad had been working on, and he moves in with his drunkard Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone). They live in the walls of a 1930's Paris train station and maintain all the clocks, ensuring accurate time. When his uncle disappears, Hugo carries on the daily mission unseen by passengers and station staff. He steals the occasional croissant and milk to survive, all while continuing the mission of repairing the automaton his dad salvaged. Hugo is convinced there is a hidden message from his father that will be revealed when the automaton is fully functioning.<br/><br/>Hugo gets cross-ways with a station toy vendor named Georges, played by Sir Ben Kingsley. Georges is a bitter old man and has no time for Hugo the urchin. Chloe Moretz plays Isabelle, a ward unto Georges, and she and Hugo strike up a friendship. Hugo introduces Isabelle to the world of cinema ... previously off-limits to her thanks to Georges. She returns the favor by awakening Hugo to the power of books in a store run by the mysterious, and always great, Christopher Lee. All this is happening while Hugo tries to evade the grasp of the oddly dedicated and slightly twisted station inspector played by Sacha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>The kids' research and automaton revealed hint lead them to a film history book written by Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg). It's here that they discover Georges is really George Melies, the famous pioneer of film who developed the first special effects and studio system. If you know much of film history, then you recognize Melies as the one who brought us the 1902 ""A Trip to the Moon"". It is here that Scorsese delivers a quick recap of the origination of film, including the Lumiere Brothers, the famous clock stunt by Harold Lloyd and other silent film classics like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. The best portion is dedicated to recreating the system used by Melies to produce films in his make-shift studio.<br/><br/>It is here that we are allowed to remember just how magical movies can be and how the best ones fill us with a sense of wonderment. The lines between what we feel and what Scorsese is showing us becomes so blurred it no longer matters. As Isabelle is overwhelmed in the theatre, that same feeling sweeps over us. How interesting that Scorsese's first special effects film features the man who originated film special effects. We even get a re-creation of the famous oncoming locomotive clip that caused audiences to jump. We get it in 3D in Hugo's own station! <br/><br/>I have been extremely critical of 3D and its misuse in movies these past couple of years. It rarely adds to the movie and always dims the colors and brightness. Scorsese is a firm believer in the technology and set out to show what can be done and how it can compliment the story. While more impressive than any 3D since Avatar, I still have my doubts about the benefits. What I do know is that if you can overlook the story that drags a bit and the unnecessary 3D effects, you will probably find the film to be quite entertaining and fun to watch. Howard Shore's score plays a vital role and supporting work comes from Emily Mortimer, Richard Griffiths, and Helen McCrory. It's not for the youngest kids, but it will make you feel like a kid ... while reminding you that movies are the stuff that dreams are made of."

","I was seduced by the reviews on IMDb into watching this movie. It's got some big names, it's got terrific production values (think Dickens crossed with steampunk), an interesting concept, but ultimately badly let down by the execution, which generates no real emotion, not even sentimental nostalgia. Part of it is disbelief: the two main child actors talk and act like adults, are dressed and shot like adults, their reactions and motivations are those of adults. Then there's the complete lack of chemistry between any two members of the cast.<br/><br/>You're rewarded for your patience (it's a two and a half hour film) with some great visuals, humorous scenes especially from the supporting cast, a bit of early film history (the famous train scene is shown, as well as a bit of Méliès' work) though too disjointed to really enjoy, and a generally pleasant film, but precious little else."

I thought the robot was going to come alive and that is what the movie is centered around; DOES NOT HAPPEN. The exciting parts of the movie are in the previews. Instead, you have a sleeper of a story about Kingsley. Shacha Baron Cohen's performance will be raved about by critics, when actually it's very predictable.

He wouldn't have abandoned his determination after being so determined up to that point. He would have worked himself into exhaustion and despair after hours of trying everything.

Nothing happens, there is no magic like you would expect or anything giving this film a twist.<br/><br/>Obviously people don't have any expectations anymore, or maybe the 3d and great visual is already enough to please everybody. But after all, shouldn't there be an interesting story been told?"
"ajrimmer2003","3","15","29","18 December 2011"," Brilliant Visuals but Empty Story
","Sometimes a movie is presented to an audience with such a build up of expectation, that when a viewer does eventually manage to see it, their expectations allow them to see a better film than what is actually on the screen.<br/><br/>Such is the case with Hugo.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a masterpiece. The image of Paris of the mid-1920's is exceptional and stunning. The viewer achieves a level of time and place that is authentic and wondrous. At no point are you jarred into the present by a misplaced phrase or image. No disconcerting 21st century idea or philosophy is found in this scenery. For this alone, Hugo deserves an academy award nomination. As well, the 3D is some of the best ever seen. The illusion of 3 dimension is never lost and it adds to the stunning beauty of the film.<br/><br/>That was what was good about Hugo. Unfortunately, it is not enough to compensate for an empty screenplay, unnecessary characters or a lack of vision.<br/><br/>To start with, there is the character of Hugo himself. A young boy, living in a train station in Paris. Brought there by his drunken Uncle after his father is tragically killed, Hugo continues the joint project he and his father were working on, of trying to get an automaton man to work. Hugo steals parts from the toy seller, Georges, in the station to help with this project. After his Uncle disappears one day never to return, Hugo also assumes the duties of repairing and winding the clocks. In this way, he is able to continue to live in the station.<br/><br/>It is about the midpoint of the film, that the viewer realizes Hugo is not the hero of this story. The true hero is Georges, but we don't realize that until about 15 minutes before the movie ends. And this is the single most disappointing aspect of this movie; so many of the characters have no place or business being there. For example; what is the purpose of the character of Isabelle? Outside of being a vehicle that gets Hugo into Georges home, she doesn't seem to serve a much more useful purpose. It is almost as if the film is commenting on this fact when, while standing on a chair to reach a box she and Hugo have found hidden, the chair begins to break but Hugo remains impassive as Isabelle begins to fall. I found myself midway through the movie wondering how long Chloe Grace Moretz spent perfecting an English accent (couldn't have been easy, given as she's from Georgia and has a Southern twang) for such an empty and pointless role.<br/><br/>This is case for character after character in this film. They serve no purpose to the storyline; even as each is presented to the viewer by marvellously talented performers. The station Inspector as played by Sasha Cohen is without argument the most interesting, sympathetic and engaging character in this film. Energy and interest levels rise every time he appears. Yet, he is ultimately wasted. He serves the purpose of providing a element of danger to Hugo, but nothing more. His dog was as useful to this purpose as he was.<br/><br/>Then there is the character of Monsieur Labisse wonderfully managed by Christopher Lee. Labisse doesn't seem to like Hugo although we are never told why. That Lee breathes life and dimension to the character for the short time he is on the screen is a testament to his incredible talent. But sadly his role could have been replaced by a Dewey Decimal card catalogue.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it gradually dawns on the viewer that even the character of Hugo himself serves no real purpose in the film. We never learn enough about him, about the absence of his mother, how deeply he was affected by the death of his father, his feelings for Isabelle or Georges. In the end, we realize that Hugo himself could just as easily been replaced by just about any other character in the film and it would not have affected the storyline at all. We care more about the story of the mute, metallic automaton that Hugo, supposedly, is desperate to fix and less about the boy who is apparently fixing him. But when the automaton eventually does comes to life, we are disappointed by the result. We expected so much more and it delivered so little.<br/><br/>And that sums up this film. When the story eventually plays itself out and we are delivered the overarching plot of the story, we feel the air go out like a deflating balloon. We had hoped for so much more and what we got was so little. The film was presented to the audience as a magic journey that in the end, was little more than a cliché on the wonders of the cinema.<br/><br/>So, in the end, it is up to the viewer to decide if they saw art or just empty visuals. Saying the film was brilliant because of the visuals is fine; the visuals are indeed brilliant. But that doesn't change the emptiness of the story."

Much of it is tediously boring, and too satisfied with itself and its references to old film.<br/><br/>Part of the problem in this film is the 3D. It simply doesn't need it. In fact, I felt it pushed me out of the film. In this sense, Hugo is the anti-Avatar of 3D. Its worst moments recall Turner's colourization of black-and-white film, by 3D-ifying silent film. Ugh. Have some respect, Scorsese.<br/><br/>And, while I was surprised to read about of all the true references the film made, the fact remains that if you don't know about these particular references beforehand, they add nothing to the film. It's like watching Scary Movie. Audiences (particularly audiences of film reviewers) are made to feel smart for getting all the references. But when it comes to plot and character, the film never knows what it wants to be about. Is it about reconnecting with a memory? Is it about making a friend? Is it about restoring a career? Is it about promoting silent film? It feels very much committee-made, devoid of heart, save for a metal one in the form of a key, another gimmick.<br/><br/>There is a thin plot here, about an orphan boy evading forces out to catch him, and finding a new family, rejuvenating it.<br/><br/>I love silent film. I love 3D film. I only sort of like, or tolerate, this film. But I wouldn't say it's bad -- just seriously over-hyped.<br/><br/>So, my advice: DO NOT see it in 3D. But DO see it on cable."

","I liked ""Hugo"" quite a lot, mostly because of the feast of visual effects that the film offers. The opening sequence, zooming through long-ago Paris, is exhilarating, perhaps even better than a similar flight in the otherwise forgettable ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001) by Baz Luhrmann. The story of ""Hugo"" is rather predictable and only mildly intriguing, and the acting is nothing special. However, Martin Scorsese's effective command of photography and sound leave no doubt that a master filmmaker is at work. It is well-nigh impossible to take one's eyes off this delicious screen banquet. What dazzling impact will next make itself be felt? Watch ""Hugo"" and be prepared for an amazing journey. Just don't expect much in the way of eventful storytelling."
"zuma06-891-357867","8","2","2","7 January 2014"," Could have so much better
","I remember seeing the trailer for Hugo and being very interested. It did look like a mystical adventure where fantastic magical things happen. What does happen is a very visually rich movie. Really great visuals! It is really worth watching just for that. Scorsese is a master and to be fair he kept the movie very close to the book. If anything, he IMPROVED on the book. He actually brought the book to a higher level. So for viewers to complain about the depth of characters is like complaining that a movie made from ""Good Night Moon"" didn't have good character development. That being the case it still could have been better but it would have meant deviating from the original story.<br/><br/>Personally, I would have like to see more about Hugo's loneliness and Gustav(the station inspector)'s loneliness and similarity to Hugo. Hugo could have very easily ended up with the sad mean life that Gustav had. And Sacha Baron Cohen as Gustav shows in this movie that he capable of being serious and threatening as well as vulnerable.<br/><br/>The movie is sprinkled with references to cultural figures of the early 20th century such as James Joyce sitting in a café in the train station and Django Reinhardt playing at the same café. Not to mention the brief history of cinema that is used as part of the plot.<br/><br/>You can find this information elsewhere, but the train accident that is part of Hugo's dream really did occur at a different time at the Paris station. As well as other events such as Georges Milies working in a toy store at the station in his later years.<br/><br/>Overall, I am pleased with this movie and would watch it again.<br/><br/>See if you can find the cameo by Scorsese."

I was taken aback when every single sequence had the dust swaying around like I was inside the film along with the cast. And with a beautiful performance by front-runners along with great direction, this film is the right food for cinema aficionados.<br/><br/>Now with what I did not like: the story is little shallow to be believable and with the conclusion so instantly inferring, it further attenuated the whole point. The reminiscent of old movies was absolute, but the editing is very poor. Great cinematography & CGI, but when you have an abrupt screenplay, it turns you off. To be frank, the first half really is monotonous and it is only the second part where fun kicks in & your curiosity is answered without killing the cat.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Recommended still, because of the aesthetic value and pure cinema pleasure.

"fellow456","6","2","2","10 March 2013"," A Movie About Movies
","Pros: Granted, this movie is derived from a book, which has assumedly fleshed out the world in which the story takes place. I haven't read the book, but I've sampled some of the pictures within it, and there's just no comparison between the illustrations of the book and the visuals of the movie. Coupled with the wonderful visuals is a very deeply interwoven audio track. Each scene practically jumps off of the screen and draws you right into the world Scorsese created. The majority of the plot takes place in a train station in Paris, but given how thoroughly the filmmakers fleshed out that world, you can't help but want to explore more of it.<br/><br/>We're all aware of how Hollywood is jumping all over the 3D bandwagon so that they can charge more for admission. But there are some instances where the technology is actually a useful tool and enhances the storytelling effect. This is one of those instances. The visuals become literally enveloping and greatly aid in the effect of pulling the viewer into the story. They are neither campy and in-your-face nor an afterthought, but instead they create a fully realized world that hugs the viewer in a magical blanket. (...Did I just use the word ""magical"" in something other than a very literal sense? I'm afraid I did.)<br/><br/>Cons: The rather sizable problem with the movie, however, is that the compelling nature of technological achievements in storytelling is completely at odds with the more traditional storytelling devices, like the script and acting. The audio-visuals are busy sucking me into a world where the story and characters are trying to push me right back out. It's a very conflicting viewing experience, to say the least. The plot is one that I really couldn't care less about, but that could be remedied with a decent script. The main character, Hugo, rarely does anything other than flash those enchantingly bright blue eyes, cry, and say things that are completely void of substance. Little better can be said for the remainder of the ensemble.<br/><br/>The cast sports the likes of Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone, Jude Law, Sascha Baron Cohen, and Chloe Moretz, but in a vacuum, you would probably conclude that all of these people suck at movies. Moretz plays her character of a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed tyke to an aggravating tee. Cohen falls flat as the comic relief. Kingsley does an alright job, but he suffers from the same problem as the rest of the lot, and the movie as a whole, in that it's aiming to appeal to your average 10 year old. Don't get me wrong; there's a place for movies aimed at 10 year olds. I loved movies when I was 10. But I thought the median age of the Academy votership was 62, not 10. What is this doing as a Best Picture nominee?<br/><br/>Overall: If you really want to watch this movie, I highly recommend forking out the extra cash to see it in 3D. It does the best job in recent memory of completely pulling the viewer into its world, and it's a great example for how 3D can enhance a story. The problem is that enhancing a story from ""bad"" still doesn't do a whole lot. This is another case where I get the sinking suspicion that the Academy saw a movie about the history of movies and leapt at the opportunity to heap it with praise, even if it was, in some cases, undeserved. While I gag at the fact that it also got a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, I give it a 6 out of 10."

Also, Asa Butterfield has beautiful blue eyes. It also seems that dust-motes are visible throughout the film creating a visual annoyance.

","First of all this is my first review of a movie on IMDb which I respect for being a source for my movie information. Now getting on to the ""masterpiece"": Hugo is a disappointing movie. All the trailer promised was a lie - there is nothing magic about this movie. I am a film student and I feel quite offended for the latest addition in Scorsese's resume. The movie is about silent movies in the end.. that's it. Hugo, the character, is just too shallow and there's nothing magic in the whimsical setting he is placed in. Everything is weak, I might even say the visuals - YES, you heard me. Although the visuals are interesting throughout the movie, they do not back up the lack of story - hence, boring. Long story short, this movie is about film-making, and the whole world spins around that French rail station. Maybe the rail stations were like today's malls, I didn't research that, but after opening with a wide shot of periodical France and afterwards are let to find that 70% of the film is in a train station, you are left down. Hugo's story is that he lost his parents, Disney style, and he can't find his place in this world and works on a robot ultimately leading him to the real plot - movies, silent movies - the magical world of movies. Ironic for me is that Scorsese wants to portray this magic world of movies with a Boring ONE. Scorsese is like and old man, wagging his stick and talking about ""the good old movies"" and even takes the time, during the movie to lecture the audience. No. This is a pure cash-in movie, nothing more - and it's edited like s**t - 2 hours for a story that can be told in 30~45 minutes max (with better actors) is unacceptable. Very, very disappointed.<br/><br/>Tudor M."

And, in truth, there isn't much of a story in this attempt to emulate a Dickens novel. The non 3D effects, the re-creation of early 20th Century Paris are excellent, the review of early cinema pioneers, enlightening, but you can't hold a movie together on these factors alone.<br/><br/>I know there are those who see great symbolism in the man/machine comparison, but this has been addressed in other movies with more success. One of the problems is that the movie is trying to be all things to all people. It tries to please young viewers with adventures within clocks and magical mechanical men while it tries to please older viewers with information on George Melies and overdone symbolism. In the end, it does neither. I watched this with my 10 year old son who had trouble staying awake. It was the one thing we had in common.<br/><br/>The acting is lukewarm. Unlike a good Dickens story, there really is no villain. Sacha Baron Cohen is unconvincing. Ben Kingsley is wasted talent. The kids are irritating. I just hoped the movie would end so that I could get on with more interesting things like cleaning the lint trap in my washing machine.<br/><br/>Scorsese's talent was likewise wasted here. I would pay to see him do a documentary on early film makers or his favorite films, because he has clearly dedicated his life to this study, and anything he put together would surely be fascinating.

"chaz-28","10","8","14","4 January 2012"," Martin Scorsese's love & appreciation of early motion pictures enables one of 2011's best films
","Hugo is a thank you letter from Martin Scorsese to motion pictures, specifically the first motion pictures and their early pioneers. Using the inquisitive adventures of a young, orphaned French boy, Scorsese leads us into a much broader and surprising area than where the setup begins. Furthermore, Hugo is in 3D which at first thought seems an odd medium from the director of The Departed, Gangs of New York, and Raging Bull. The polished result and gimmicky tricks of 3D do not resemble Scorsese's gritty and realistic cinematography preferences. It turns out; however, Scorsese is proficient in both mediums. The 3D effects in Hugo are perhaps the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a recent orphan scurrying around the Paris train station in 1931 maintaining its myriad clocks while dodging the watchful eye of the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). Hugo's father (Jude Law) was an accomplished watch/clock tinkerer and before he passed on, transferred much of knowledge and skill to young Hugo. Unlike other fictional orphans though, Hugo is having some trouble taking care of himself. He is quickly outgrowing his childish clothes, he frequently has trouble pilfering food, and his lack of schooling is starting to show. <br/><br/>Hugo's loitering ways and incompetent shoplifting efforts not only keep the Station Inspector alert, but they also catch the eye of Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), a toy shop owner in the train station. Through Georges, Hugo meets his granddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), an extremely precocious girl who loves books, always tries to fit in new learned vocabulary into her sentences, and finds the orphan boy running the station clocks to be a very intriguing friend. All of this is just setup though while leading towards the true purpose of Hugo.<br/><br/>Papa Georges is not who he appears to be. I will not disclose who he is, but film aficionados will most likely figure it out early on. Hugo's father used to take him to movies which instilled in Hugo a love of the medium as well; he considers them dreams during the daytime. The discovery, eventual realization, and reaction to Georges are the film's highlights and are what will stay with the audience rather than Hugo's exploits. Scorsese's appreciation of early motion pictures is infectious and will hopefully inspire the kids in the audience to seek out old movies and remind their parents of what once was.<br/><br/>The characters in Hugo are truly fun to watch as they weave in and out of the train station and its hideaways. A particular highlight is Cohen as the Station Inspector. He receives some quality screen time as he attempts to professionally safeguard the station and maybe even impress the local flower girl. Moretz as Isabelle is also quite good. She shows here she may very well break out of her current child actor status and become a much more accomplished actress. <br/><br/>Because Martin Scorsese wanted to share his affection for early motion pictures and found a great script to deliver his message, he has once again made one of the best films of the year. Both children and adults will love this movie regardless that a child is its main character or that it is in 3D. I highly recommend Hugo and encourage you to just sit back and enjoy it."
"Chris_Pandolfi","9","8","14","24 November 2011"," The Mystery of the Mechanical Man
","The genius of Martin Scorcese's ""Hugo"" is not just that it employs the latest in filmmaking technology, but that it employs them in a story about how filmmaking itself came to be. This is a subject near and dear to Scorcese, who, apart from directing and producing, is renowned for his work as a film historian (he's the co-founder of The Film Foundation and the World Cinema Foundation, both nonprofit organizations dedicated to the preservation of film). He doesn't present history so much as immerse us in it, and not in a way that's distant or clinical but rather in a way that's warm and inviting. He beckons us with the art of illusion, gets us interested in the mechanics, and allows us to study them up close. In that process of revelation, never once does the magic elude us.<br/><br/>""Hugo,"" adapted from Brian Selznick's novel ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret,"" is an absolute triumph, not just of plot, but of casting, performance, character development, art direction, set design, special effects, and theme as well. It's also one of the best looking 3D films I've ever seen, and if you've read my reviews, you know how I feel about 3D in general. Rather than assault our field of vision with crude pop out gags, Scorcese allows the process to envelope us like a blanket, making us at one with the world he has created. We're not watching the story unfold; we're actually a part of it. There are times when I wanted to reach out and try to touch the images, for they were so well integrated into the shots that they achieved an uncanny tactile quality. For the first time ever, I'm recommending you spend the extra money for a 3D movie, especially if your local theater uses digital projectors that allow for bright, clear pictures.<br/><br/>Taking place in Paris sometime in the early 1930s, it tells the story of Hugo (Asa Butterfield), an orphaned boy who lives within the walls of a train station. As the son of a watchmaker (Jude Law in a flashback sequence), he has an affinity for clockwork and mechanical creations, which is why he keeps himself busy by winding all the station's clocks. His secret lair is a world of iron, gears, pendulums, springs, and steam. He observes the everyday hustle and bustle through various openings, usually clock faces. He sees Monsieur Frick, the newspaper vendor (Richard Griffiths), trying to woo the café owner, Madame Emile (Francis de la Tour), while simultaneously trying to avoid her irritable dog. He sees a flower girl named Lisette (Emily Mortimer), who cheerfully sets up shop every morning. He desperately tries to avoid the mean, crippled station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), who, along with his Rottweiler, rounds up unattended children and has them shipped off to the orphanage.<br/><br/>Before he died in a fire, Hugo's father was trying to repair a metal automaton, which he found rusting away in a museum. Hugo, determined to finish the work his father started, runs afoul of a bitter, reserved man known as Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), whose assortment of windup figures has the gears Hugo needs. Georges, who knows Hugo has been stealing from him, is shocked when he discovers a notebook Hugo's father sketched in. He then takes it and refuses to return it. He even threatens to burn it. Hugo must get it back. Here enters Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), who quickly becomes Hugo's friend. Well read and adventurous, Isabelle wears a heart-shaped key around her neck – the same key that fits a special lock on Hugo's automaton. Why does she have it? And what will happen once the automaton has been wound up?<br/><br/>Alas, I cannot describe the rest of the film without becoming annoyingly vague. What a shame that I'm unable to reveal how all this connects to the art of filmmaking. All I can say is, Scorcese does a masterful job of depicting what it must have been like in those early days of movies, in which it was evident that not even the limits of technology could put a damper on the imagination. We see boundless creativity in gaudy costumes, plywood sets, and celluloid that has been hand tinted frame by frame. We study first generation cameras and projectors and marvel at their hand-operated mechanisms. Best of all, we see audiences staring in awe as pictures, projected on a white screen, actually move.<br/><br/>Every character is so engaging and richly developed that I couldn't possibly praise them all. This would not have been possible were it not for the spot-on casting. As Hugo, Butterfield is sympathetic but not manipulative – a Dickensian character capable of real emotions. Moretz is just plain charming as plucky young Isabelle, and Kingsley shows great range as Georges. The biggest surprise is Cohen as the station inspector, who we expect will be little more than a traditional cross between a frightening menace and comedy relief. We would be wrong; as he nervously makes passes at Lisette, we begin to see a real person, a man who has yet to process his misfortunes in life in a healthy, constructive way. As a historical fable, and as a celebration of the cinematic arts, ""Hugo"" is a treasure.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

","Something unfortunate happens when directors decide to celebrate their love of the cinema. They end up celebrating themselves and their own fannish sensibilities, and their movies turn all mawkish. That's what happened in Truffaut's smug DAY FOR NIGHT and Tornatore's treacly CINEMA PARADISO, and it's what happens here. Ostensibly an expression of Scorsese's infatuation with film, it's really an example of his self-infatuation. <br/><br/>HUGO is undeniably beautiful to look at, with sumptuous atmospheric sets and elaborate shots from high overhead or down long corridors -- trust me, miles and miles of corridors -- expressly designed to make maximum use the 3-D camera. But the story itself is glum and painfully slow. Around me audience members kept yawning, and they stirred restlessly in their seats whenever a character launched into another interminable nostalgic reminiscence. (I felt especially sorry for the kids, for whom the film had to be a letdown.) Too many scenes are as earnest and didactic as a museum lecture on the early history of cinema.<br/><br/>Although HUGO's got a splendid cast, the characters struck me as formulaic and lifeless; it's like watching one of those motion-capture Bob Zemeckis movies, such as THE POLAR EXPRESS or A Christmas CAROL, populated by figures not entirely human who resemble animated Chris Van Allsburg illustrations. (The film's very distinctive look is in fact pure Van Allsburg -- a mixed blessing. Everything we see is gorgeous, but it all looks fake, like the expensive film set it is. Eventually the artificiality grows tiresome.) <br/><br/>I've always loved Georges Melies's wonderful silent fantasies, and it's commendable that Scorsese is reminding modern audiences, via this movie, just how inventive, magical, and ahead-of-their-time they were. But somehow the sheer self-congratulatory reverence that Scorsese lavishes on those old films made me long for a simple unpretentious documentary."

","MINOR SPOILERS The prolific Martin Scorsese is back with another addition to his filmography. This time, however, we do not get a motion picture aimed at adults, but instead aimed at children. This new work seems to be the one closest to his heart as it is the perfect symbolism for his entire life's work.<br/><br/>Mr. Scorsese's downfall began with his previous effort, Shutter Island. A film that is compelling for most of its runtime collapses on itself at the end when you introduce logic into what you sat through for two hours. Its best attribute is its technical prowess and the fact that Mr. Scorsese has not lost his directorial touch. You can apply the style over substance argument perfectly for Hugo.<br/><br/>The story behind Hugo is simple: a young orphaned boy (Asa Butterfield) is fixated on achieving his dream of repairing a device that he and his father worked on prior to his untimely death. Hugo has turned the life of a thief while simultaneously operating the clocks in a Paris railway station. He meets Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley), a cranky old man who has taken Hugo's notebook as punishment, and who eventually hires Hugo to work for him as reparations. While working, Hugo becomes closer to Méliès' god-daughter, Isabelle (Chloe Moretz). This is when the film finally picks up its slacking pace and begins with a plethora of excellent visuals and two charming actors who fill the screen.<br/><br/>That is the only praise to be leveled at this work because it is style over substance. Any substance that it may have (note: may) is overshadowed by the visuals and the over-use of 3D, where watching it in many instances is painful and uncomfortable. Why did Scorsese opt to use this technology when it doesn't suit his close-ups without causing audience members to squirm in their seats? Why did he opt to use this technology when many scenes that have too many items on screen make it difficult to discern and enjoy the format? The substance that may exist lies in the film's messages, and they are very good ones: children should use their imagination to its breaking point; finding a purpose in life is essential; and not giving up on your dreams, no matter the obstacles that pop up. The problem with this is that children are not going to care about these messages when they see spectacular imagery, such as a train crashing through the station, slapstick comedy where an inspector injures his testicles, and overlong subplots involving blossoming relationships with the patrons of the station. These images overshadow anything remotely important for children to learn and the subplots cause the film to drag even more than it already does, boring them in the process.<br/><br/>The gravest of ills in Hugo, however, is when Scorsese goes the Tarantino route and decides to have scene after scene after scene implying that cinema is very, very important. Why would Scorsese pay tribute to an industry that at this very moment in time consists of nothing but derivative, repetitive trash? Sure, there are fun summer movies, but they aren't the bastion of art. Romantic comedies may be perfect choices for dates, but they don't make you think and spark discussion. As the much-maligned Armond White put it: <br/><br/>""As with the preposterous celebration of Howard Hughes' Hell's Angels in The Aviator, Scorsese pretends to honor cinema history by exaggerating the importance and wonder of movies that are frankly unwatchable, only notable as historic footnotes."" <br/><br/>Scorsese continues the trend of creating something that will not stimulate a child's mind but will instead cause him or her to only display wonder at what is on screen; he or she will not care what is in the film's subtext but what is in front of their eyes, in glorious 3D.<br/><br/>Another mighty has fallen, and it hurts far more than seeing filmic icons such as Spielberg fall. Scorsese has a near flawless record when it comes to solid entertainment and his first foray into child territory falls flat with his exuberance of style that trumps any message he had hoped to pass along to the younger generation."

"IMDBcinephile","10","7","12","4 December 2011"," An Amazing Piece of History counterpoised with 3D
","I have heard people say Martin Scorsese, it seems, wouldn't have made a film like this. I want to direct anybody about these qualms on that ""kiddie film"" idea to watch ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through the American Movies"". To put it in a laconic way, Scorsese was predestined to make a film like this. What makes it enchanting and close to home is that the film is a fable per se; underneath it, though, is Scorsese's true love for films.<br/><br/>The film is based upon a book about Hugo Cabaret, which Johnny Depp had in production for a couple of years now. Martin Scorsese was commissioned to direct and the result is a lavish design with an amazing stellar cast including Ben Kingsley who portrays George Melies with bathos and subtlety, Christopher Lee who plays a book keeper, Asa Butterfield as Hugo and Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabelle. Even the minor role by Ray Winstone as Claude the Uncle becomes momentous to the story. I think the real thing that came to mind for me was that 3D wasn't subordinate to the story or concurrent to the story IT WAS THE STORY. If you have ever seen Yasujiro Ozu's films or ""Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles"" (1975) and films by Akira Kurosawa and even Orson Welles that you'll fathom out that film has ALWAYS been Three Dimensional. What Scorsese done with his amazing crew was that every spatial part of the foreground would be shot with depth of field. Melies at his celebration talking about what Scorsese would refer to as ""the illusionist"" the magic tricks he would pull with Mermaids and Magicians, it's as though he has been cut out and is sticking out the screen (to use a cliché).<br/><br/>The magic of cinema, the montages of the films to decipher ""Papa Georges"" despair, the film follows a young boy, who tries to fix an automaton. He constantly evades an inspector and always runs the clock in its amazing interior (referencing ""Safety Last!"" in terms of cinematic iconography) that his Uncle Claude does. His Father is no longer with him after a fire, while he was trying to fix an automaton, which his son subsequently has tried to fix using bits and bobs he can purloin from shops like George's shop. What's amazing is that throughout there's pervasive hints as to who this mysterious man is such as the poster, which seems to be showing ""A Trip to the Moon"" (though it's in French so you can't tell).<br/><br/>The film is relatively simple, though its tale of history is extremely pivotal to its anniversary of over 100 years now. Reduxing the Melies sets is wonderfully done through flashback and even little moments like Baron Cohen (playing the inspector who's basically a Keystone Cop in my opinion) constantly having pratfalls and pitfalls on the train station can actually feel more interactive as though his feet are sticking right out at us. Scorsese has not only proved the potential of this gimmicky device, but he's also used it to counterpoint with the old technology as an ardent student still learning his craft as he says. It could be up there with his great films (""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"" and even ""Casino"").<br/><br/>The person I went with to the cinema had prior to it been told about Melies by me. I was oblivious to the premise being central to this Man; my reasons for talking about were because I was showing him primitive versions of Joan of Arc because I'm always interested in Dreyer's version, but I think that the way it branches out is fascinating. I then drew to the 1899 version of Jeanne D'arc by George Melies and how beautiful it was in its grainy hand painted form and I was telling him how Melies' anger caused him to burn the first carbon copies of his films. And then I get even more history on it in this film with so much poignancy about ""reinventing the wheel"" and basically the guile of the artist. For example, Scorsese plays with the dream sequences at one point; the boy tries to get something off the tracks and the train comes straight to him like an old suspense thriller from the silent era with Pickford or Gloria Swanson; though it was different here. The swishing of the train is emphasized as it crashes right through the building and then it's contrasted later on as if it was breaking the forth wall for a couple of minutes in my opinion.<br/><br/>It will be the first time you'll see Intolerance in this format, The General, ""Trip to the Moon"" and even Edwin S. Porter's ""The Great Train Robbery"" in this format. Even the projector in the cinema where Isabelle and Hugo go for an adventure flashes right out at the audience as we dabble into true magic. What an experience and I will note though that it will be tardy and slow paced for some. But it was simply rewarding in the end."
"witster18","7","7","12","28 November 2011"," Good not great
","I went in with high expectations. Heck, the movie was sitting at 8.6 on here(still is?).<br/><br/>74/100 Hugo is a visual masterpiece. It did have some of the best use of 3D technology to date, but I still wish I had gone to see the 2D version. 3D is kind of cool, but I think it takes away from the clarity of the picture. This may be the last time I spend my money on a 3D picture, and it has nothing to do with Scorcese's first attempt with this technology - he did a great job.<br/><br/>This movie is not a comedy. It's quite important to know that going in. It is a drama about an orphan/genius/clockmaker.<br/><br/>The film is, for the most part, light-hearted and feel-good throughout, but the film really doesn't have a great story to tell. Scorcese goes in many different directions here, and tries to mold them together in what becomes an anti-climactic finish.<br/><br/>I think the film would have benefited from more dialog for its' lead character.<br/><br/>Small spoilers coming. The whole movie-theme here was interesting, but like the rest of the film it thrives only visually and doesn't seem to have much substance. Hearing Ben Kingsley talk about why his films waned in popularity seemed like a bunch of jabberwocky. The whole theme resonated like another nod to Hollywood that really boosts ratings for some reason, but never really tugs the heart-strings. It's a given that any film ""about film or making film"" is going to be over-rated in these circles. Why? I have no idea.(Hollywood likes itself - see Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Get SHorty, The Player, Adaptation, Ed Wood, etc - make a Hollywood movie and the critics will Loooooove you) Granted, some of those films are very good, but they still tend to be over-rated.<br/><br/>That also means this is going to be getting some Oscar nominations. It could be in the race for cinematography and some other 'visual' categories, but this is no best picture by any means.<br/><br/>We needed this film to have as much focus on the dialog and story as it did the visuals and the film-theme. It was obvious to me that the director was bowing to film-makers and Ben Kingsley, and not really worrying too much about the rest of us.<br/><br/>The film needed some more comedy and action. And even though it's a drama - it needed more drama too.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful to look at, and in that aspect it might very well be the best movie of the year. The problem here is that there are virtually no stand out scenes. I've read some reviews that talked about other peoples' reactions to the film. While I didn't interview anybody else in the theater - everyone in the theater did not react to the film for the duration, and they were half way out of their seats 5 seconds before the credits rolled.<br/><br/>A great example of visual genius with a huge dose of existentialism from the director. In the end, it's just another over-rated film about making film that the average person can't relate to, and the other story-lines fall kind of flat.<br/><br/>The whole time I was thinking, ""what he's doing with camera is amazing, but what he's doing with the story is dull"".<br/><br/>I know this review was harsh. This is a good movie, but it deserves more like 7.5. If you want a better example of this type of story/style - then revisit ""The Black Stallion"". It has more interesting characters, more action, and more that the common person can relate to than this film does - and it's no less of a visual masterpiece. I find it weird that ""The Black Stallion"" can employ a kid that never acted in his life before the production, and yet that performance has more substance than the lead characters in the last two blockbusters I watched(Hugo and Super 8).Why ""The Black Stallion"" is rated 7.1 and this is rated 8.6 is beyond me. I know which one I'd rather re-watch.<br/><br/>Worth a look, but do not expect action or comedy.<br/><br/>You might like this if you liked:The Black Stallion(better), The Polar Express(not as good), Cinema Paradiso(much better) Great Expectations(hawke version, better), or City of Ember(worse).<br/><br/>Right now it's sitting at 7 on my top 10 of 2011 list, but it might have trouble holding on with Meloncholia, 50/50, Midnight in Paris, and Drive still in the watch-list."

Maybe it's a side-effect of replacing genuine photography with CGI. I don't know and I don't care. It looks silly and I'm tired of it.<br/><br/>Likewise, I am tired of tales like this one that involve a young child on his own, overcoming false obstacles that mostly take the form of curmudgeons you hope will all love him before the story is over. This film is just one tired cliché after another of such stuff. The full cast of modern ""Dondi"" films is present, with the innocent boy, precocious girl, multiple dubious authority figures, whimsical elders, and so on. You've seen every last one of them over and over.<br/><br/>Sure, there's plenty of steam-punk pseudo-wonder intended to keep the lips of your inner seven-year-old pursed into a little ""o"" for over an hour. Brass keys, spinning gears, and wind-up contraptions of every kind are in almost every frame of this film, all to make you think that something oh-so-magical is going on in front of you.<br/><br/>Ho.<br/><br/>Now add to that: hum.<br/><br/>While I can't say this one lacked for anything original, it lacked for anything surprising. Each and every set-up is, soon after, resolved in precisely the way you most expect that it will be. Original, perhaps, but familiar all the way.<br/><br/>Your inner seven-year-old will love it. Your actual seven-year-old will probably love it too.<br/><br/>Grown-ups, on the other hand, may wonder before it's over just what it is that $170,000,000 can buy anymore."

","Just got home after watching HUGO, and boy, What a film! I don't think there are many films that have all the qualities of a masterpiece and yet you can enjoy it with the whole family and Hugo stands on top of any movie which may be (if ever possible) comparable. In my eyes, Hugo is Scorsese himself who is paying tribute to someone who has inspired many visionary filmmakers even after his life. This is a film that you remain in your seat and witness a mystery being unfold in the most artistic way where art, visual effects, music and 3D technology are serving the film, unlike most of the never ending so called 3D flicks which are made just to be high-tech and suffer lack of story and good directing. The acting is pretty good, Chloe Grace Mortez is as adorable as ever and Sacha Baron Cohen can always make you laugh no matter how serious he tries to look. Scorsese himself pops up in a short scene for a second just to remind us who actually stands behind the camera. I'm not a great fan of him, though loved Shutter Island and the Departed, but this one is just so different. I totally recommend it to anyone with any taste in movies."

","With all these wonderful and glowing reviews of this film, I can't even believe I saw the same movie. First of all, why do the characters in this film speak with English accents? This is set in Paris, France, not London, England. Secondly, everything visually in this film looks artificial, and the CGI isn't even all that good. 3D moments are few and far between. Corny romantic moments between various characters in the film seem forced and fake. The comedy falls flat on its face, clearly they were geared towards children 5 and under to laugh. The dialogue was weak, and the acting was bland and uninspiring. So what was Scorsese's motivation for doing this movie, if it feels like it was phoned in? Was it greed? Kids movies rake in more money than films that are rated R. Add 3D to it, and you have a better chance for a higher return on investment. Sadly, this film is soulless and boring, and I think it will be something Scorsese will wish he didn't make.<br/><br/>This is an add on to the review: Can someone please explain to me how the automaton could have drawn the man in the moon with the rocketship in its eye? Are we to assume that Melies had drawn this image years before he actually made the film? Because he mined the automaton for parts when he was building his first camera, so I can't see him 'reprogramming' it to draw an image from a film he would complete later on."

Only the ultimate conceit that the film is about films, specifically those of Georges Méliès, gives it what slim interest it has.

","Hugo is a very strange movie. Visually, the movie is truly glorious, amazing sets, fantastic to look at and beautifully filmed.

It appears that the director thought that deep, meaningful glances which went on for 10 seconds too long while the camera explored the pores of the actors faces was acting, and that some truly weird, weird, weird script portions were to be humour. Neither angle on movie making did it for me.<br/><br/>For the life of me I could not figure out if this was meant to be a kid's movie, or a farce of some kind or an adults movie with central roles acted by children, or a movie about a renowned movie maker or automatons or deep and meaningful themes about humanity or trains.<br/><br/>I loved and adored looking at it. I thought the child actors were charming, particularly the girl and no one else even vaguely appealed to me and seriously, whatever Ben Kingsley was doing I'll never feel the same about him again, he was so bad that if I didn't know he was a fine actor I might have thought he paid someone to be in the flick.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it for great visuals if say, you also want to sit with the volume turned down and do your homework or chat with friends."

This film could be seen as a salutation to a child's dream, fantasy and the dare to dream spirit. Watch this film and feel the romance of old Paris. This film is a film for every one. My 10-year-old son likes it as much as me. All the actors are splendid. Please watch it. I can only promise you a wonderful experience both visual and emotional. I like films with young protagonist. Because they often fill me with awe and inspiration. The make me feel young again. Hugo is such a boy. The settings of this film is grand. You have to spend a lot to recreate the old periodic romance. The details are carefully drawn. This film is certainly made with a lot of care and affection."

","I went into this film, not knowing much about it other than it has been much loved since its release last year. And rightfully so. ""Hugo"" is one of the most unique and captivating movies I have ever seen. Hugo Cabret is a young orphan who isn't quite sure what he wants to do with his life, except for one thing he is absolutely certain of: fixing a strange mechanical man that could not be completed due to his fathers death. One day, when trying to steal from a toy maker, his plan backfires and the toy maker takes something very important to Hugo: his fathers notebook. In his attempt to get it back, he meets a young girl and together they find out that there is more to this toy maker than what meets the eye. Throughout the first hour, I wasn't sure where it all was going but everything couldn't have come together in a more enjoyable or astounding way. I can see how this movie would appeal specifically to film buffs, like myself, because of the numerous direct references to the early history of film and how cinema really is how it is portrayed here: dreams coming alive."

","Hugo, the title character, is an orphaned boy that lives inside Paris' train station where he's in charge of making sure that all the clocks run as clockwork. It's an assignment that he takes with the most regard and is very passionate about. He lives secretly behind these clocks looking onto the passerbys that have become as part of his daily routine, a part of his own little world: enters the flower girl bringing her fresh cut flowers to sell in the station, enters the station inspector wearing a prosthetic leg (played by Sasha baron Cohen) and his loyal Doberman dog, or an older couple that never really seem to get their relationship off the ground due to her vicious little dog. Among these characters there's one in particular: George Méliès (Ben Kingsley) who runs a shop full of magic tricks and toys. He observes the man and is curious as to what makes the man such a ""scrooge"".<br/><br/>In the first few minutes, Hugo believes that George Méliès is an evil man. After all, he takes away his precious notebook away from the boy and attempts at turning Hugo to the authorities for no apparent reason. There is, however, something that piques George's interest: a drawing of a ""automaton"" a.k.a. robot. He questions the boy as to how he came about this notebook and, when Hugo refuses to answer him, he takes the notebook away from him and threatens to burn it. I remember being saddened by George's actions but I also wondered: what made his so upset? Why did he want to know about the notebook? What events took place to blacken his heart and make him so bitter about everything? READ FULL REVIEW AT MY BLOG ITALO'S CORNER"
"merrywriter","10","5","8","12 March 2012"," Scorsece Stimulates Dialogue Between the Generations for the Sake of History
","I am shocked at some of the poor reviews; these have to be by a younger generation who do not understand the time, place and history weaved into ""Hugo"" by the writers, Scorcese, and producer & francophile Johnny Depp. The near accuracy of the film is part of the movie magic. <br/><br/>Before Atomic Clock Time, ""Train Time"" was the most accurate; Standard Time resulted (to make connections). Thus anyone responsible for keeping time at a train station had an extremely accountable job - too exacting for Hugo's alcoholic uncle who realized his shortcoming and understood Hugo's advanced skills taught to Hugo by his father. The station inspector keeps checking his watch, as if inspecting the job the clock mechanic was doing. Clockmaker"" was a respected profession. Knowing the inner workings of clocks was akin to our computer techs today; both considered highly innovative as attested by the pinnacle of creativity, an automaton/robot. Add this to the set designs of the innards of the station clocks, and again, high imagination, creative magic.<br/><br/>I was surprised to be told the film is set in 1931; more accurately it has a 20s feel, especially in costuming. I'm not sure how I am to bridge this gap. My confusion also lies in the fact that Hugo & Isabelle snuck in to see Harold Lloyd's ""Safety Last!"" 1923. Outside the theater as Hugo picks the lock, we also see a Hal Roach poster with Charlie Chase, another popular comic of the 20s (though my favorite scene of Chase's is in Laurel & Hardy's ""Sons of the Desert, 1933). However, 1931 was only 14 years after the Great War and shortly into the Depression; most people would not have been stylish and would have still worn their old clothes of the 20s. Isabelle's dress for Méliè's tribute is straight out of the 20s. Hair styles were also not of the 30s, though today's stylists never get 20s, 30s, or 40s hairstyles accurate, in part because they no longer have the waving machines used then. Also there was no mention of ""talkies"" (or I missed it) which by 1931 were fairly evolved from the first sound-on-film in 1919 (although Kingsley, a dead ringer for Méliès, states that ""People don't want my kind of films any more.""). At the scene in the library, the book, 'La Revue du Cinéma,' which features Lumières' ""Arrival of a Train at a Station,"" did have the effect on 1896 audiences as we see - a wonderful touch to be brought back to that time and place of innocence. <br/><br/>The juxtaposition of ""Hugo"" is of 3D and film origins via Méliès' films. First, we see his glass stage set. (Even Hollywood did not advance that - ""inside"" sets blow with the wind in many American silents; they were filmed outside for the light.) We also see 1890's traditional theater set design and its illusions of water, moonscape or the slaying of dragons. We see this transition of how Méliès advanced old into new (i.e. filming through a fish tank with real fish) which was surely considered ""special effects"" back then, amazing audiences to see real swimming fish before the actors in the background. <br/><br/>Because of Scorcese's age, born 1942, he has living memory of film history, a reason he has been so dedicated to its preservation. In ""Hugo"" we get only the highlights of film history, of the people Scorsese wants to be sure are brought back into public consciousness. I too nearly wept in awe at seeing the brightly colored hand-tinted Méliès' tribute films. I have only seen bastardized hand-me-downs and loved them as movie magic even then. The clips are the climax of the film, and the après film party a tidy tie-up of the loose ends of the characters (Inspector Gustav's ""high-tech"" brace designed by Hugo, of course).<br/><br/>When we see old films, we have a connection to our ancestors, what they saw and felt. Though the written-word is a first connection, it can lead to misconceptions because tone can be lost. No other mediums except film and sound have brought us into such direct contact with the past. Scorsese purposely accomplished bringing generations together for conversations that kids can have with grandparents. Then we have the revival of the actual train derailment at Gare Montparnasse in 1895 in 3D. Scorcese wanted today's audience to feel that which the 1896 audience felt with a train coming directly at them. The past brought to life through restoration, juxtaposed with the most advanced film-making to date. <br/><br/>Trying to make a film for everyone can get dicey, but there should be something for everyone to bite into in this juicy film, especially since it has state of the art 3D, and especially for students of film and film history, though I pray that young costumers will not take it as gospel that the clothes are those of the 30's. I am sure that Scorcese's 12 year old daughter is well schooled in film history to have brought Selznick's book to her father's attention. Just as the fictional character René Tabard was influenced as a child upon meeting Méliès to have kept track of all things Méliès, I can also safely assume that Scorcese, the writers, Depp and all others involved with this labor of love hope that ""Hugo"" will ignite the interest of younger generations to study and help preserve past generations of film. <br/><br/>============== Recommendations of important films quickly cited in 'La Revue du Cinema': 1)Griffith's ""Intolerance"" 1916, told in four stories, it is one of the first statements on social injustice (and his reaction to audience (mis)understanding of ""Birth of a Nation""). 2)""The Thief of Bagdad"" 1924, Douglas Fairbanks (advanced special effects and set design). The scale of both sets have not been seen before or since. 3)Anything Hal Roach. I know, I left too much out."

The words often give way to the pictures and, if you allow it, the pictures will take you deeply into the story. It is good to be over seventy and have experienced movies before they became all action, movement and noise. We were educated to wait and enjoy the trip to the end.

","Hugo is a standout. Nothing I've seen competes with the visuals on show here ... if the plot had been limited to a reading of the telephone book I'd still watch it happily. However and fortunately, and despite some of the incomprehensibly negative reviews posted earlier, the storyline was engaging and satisfying: not sophisticated and not subtle but just right for the extraordinary, magical steampunk world Scorcese has created in 1930's Paris.<br/><br/>The evocation of the days when you could see and feel how machines worked (so, steam and clockwork) and its presentation in 3D was sublime, staggering, entrancing. The intricacy of the mechanisms, the beauty of the metal and patterns in gears, grates, railings and steps, the lighting, colour palette, size and scale were enough to make this memorable, but the extra sense of involvement made possible by a near-perfect use of 3D technology raises this to another level, a masterpiece.<br/><br/>We were engrossed from start to finish, luxuriating in the created world while following the story with interest and hope and absorbing the film's unsubtle but moving messages about purpose, belonging and the wonder of films and illusion.<br/><br/>Don't see this on DVD and don't see it in 2D; it's a big-screen must. I'm not normally a fan of 3d (gloomy and gimmicky) but for this film it's essential, as is the scale of a real cinema screen.<br/><br/>Fabulous."
"lasttimeisaw","9","5","8","7 February 2012"," Hugo
","This year a blossoming homage to the genesis of the film industry has progressed into raptures for film aficionados and filmmakers (two front-runners of the imminent Oscar, THE ARTIST, which I have yet to watch, and HUGO have aimed at B&W silent film and innovator Georges Méliès respectively). Martin Scorsese stews this $170,000,000 budgeted 1930s Paris Gare Montparnasse train station adventure feature in an almost immaculate way, and for the generation which may not be stupefied by Georges Méliès' A TRIP TO THE MOON (Le voyage dans la lune 1902), for sure they will worship Hugo as a pristine monumental milestone for the new era of film business. I saw it in a 2D version and plan to watch the 3D version inconveniently double-bespectacledly. <br/><br/>Don't be deceived by its fairytale sphere, a PG rating for Scorsese is a soft ball and none like any other adult-prone masterpieces. But the thrill and tension is still copious and similar to another gem of my 2011 9-out-of-10 league THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN, both represent the paramount expectation from a true film master to bake a nutritious meal which is able to assuage everyone's appetite, and both Scorsese and Spielberg have done that this year!<br/><br/>Juxtaposing with fellow New Yorker Woody Allen's love letter to Paris (MIDNIGHT IN Paris 2011). Scorsese has accomplished a more imposing one to the witchcraft of the whole film system at its very beginning, which embodies in the up-and-down career of Georges Méliès, and it accompanies Hugo and us to the journey of the pure magic. <br/><br/>The retro-setting of the train station is majestic and jaw-dropping, and Howard Shore's fluently enchanting score is the cream of 2011, but a colossal budget has impeded its Oscar's path since its lackluster box office, $61,911,429 so far (which I cannot figure out the reason why? A mishap of a Christmas season decision?) signifies that it will never be profitable and even impractical to make ends meet. And another Achilles heel is it bears zero acting nomination, which I put Asa Butterfield in my leading actor category (2nd to George Clooney so far) and he delivers his grit magnificently in his feeble appearance, as for Ben Kingsley, not as splendid as I hoped, at least he sits comfortably above Jonah Hill from MONEYBALL in my supporting actor list."

","Like clockwork, we are all part of a much larger whole designed to connect with each other and work as one. It's a comforting thought but in a world without spare parts, what happens when you feel you've outlived your value? When you have no purpose? Thus one of the main themes of ""Hugo"" Martin Scorsese's first foray into PG territory. Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a lonely orphan living in the walls of the Paris train station circa 1930's. While tending to the various clocks around the station, Hugo also has a habit of stealing cogs and widgets from an ornery toy shop clerk Georges (Ben Kingsley). He does this to fix a mechanical atomization his father left him. What it does? Hugo has no idea. When his fathers notes on the machine are taken by Georges in comes his equally precocious goddaughter Isabelle, who helps Hugo discover the purpose of his machine.<br/><br/>For those of us who appreciate the art of film, ""Hugo"" is sure to impress and enchant. The first thing that catches the eye is the color palate which contrasts warm reds and blue hues. Even in the costuming their seems to be very little gray or other bland tones. This creates a Paris with an otherworldly quality enhanced further with competently handled 3D and dazzlingly elaborate camera-work.<br/><br/>The second half of the film concerns itself with a topic near and dear to Martin Scorsese's heart; film history and preservation. Homages to various films are slyly inserted and immortalized names from cinema's early era like Lumiere and Melies become an integral part of the story much to any film fanatic's enjoyment. The plot unravels at a deliberate pace and the story itself may prove daunting for some children. But those on Scorsese's wavelength will receive an exciting and elaborate history lesson.<br/><br/>Hugo, Isabelle and Georges are linked by a yearning to be accepted and appreciated. At times they feel like Hugo's mechanical man, useless, antiquated, broken. In the end they all find what their looking for by motivating each other, in essence existing for one another which when you think about it, is a pretty good purpose.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

This should be a film about the French movie- maker pioneer Georges Méliès. But the industry decided to lure us with a promise of adventure, mystery and magic. You will get none of them. And Georges Méliès sure deserves a much better movie than this one to tell his remarkable history. Unfortunately we get a hoax. Not at all attractive to children. Half of the people in the theater got asleep while ""watching"" it. The other half just left in the middle of this movie ? Visually it is OK, with good use of 3D and some nice picture. But that's all. You will waste your money, do not watch it. Or, on a second thought, watch it if you want some nice sleep Oh, by the way.

","Released around Christmas last year, my visit at home over the holiday season enabled me to sit down in front of the fire with my family and 3D glasses and finally catch-up with Martin Scorsese's Oscar-winning film. It could have been the morning afternoon mulled wine, but we all absolutely adored it.<br/><br/>Based on the kid's book by Brian Selznick, Hugo is an imaginative retelling of cinematic history for new, perhaps uninitiated audiences.<br/><br/>Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan living in the labyrinthine walls of a Parisian train station in the 1930s. He spends his days sneaking croissants from bakers, winding the station's clocks to keep them ticking accordingly and hiding the po-faced station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), who gets a kick from throwing troublesome kids off to the local orphanage.<br/><br/>Keeping one of his father's (Jude Law, in flashbacks) most-loved hobbies alive, Hugo spends his free time fixing old automaton, swiping gears and parts from the a station toymaker called Georges (Ben Kingsley). After the crotchety Georges catches Hugo one day, the boy begins discovering eerie connections between Georges and his father, connections that lead him and his curious friend Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), to uncover the forgotten stories of cinema's inception.<br/><br/>It may sound like a simple adventure story, but Hugo is much more than that. Behind the child angst is Scorsese' ode to cinema's first real auteur as, quickly enough, we discover that Kingsley's disgruntled shop clerk Georges is none other than cinema wizard Georges Méliès. Of course, that will mean nothing to most audiences, but throw in some archive footage of the iconoclastic 1902 short feature A Trip to The Moon and audiences of all cinephilic levels can't help but be enthralled.<br/><br/>His first foray into 3D filmmaking, Scorsese's Paris is something to behold. It's a world painted with vivacious broad strokes balanced with steampunk locomotives and 1930s smoke. A harmonious juxtaposition of beauty and tragedy which coloured Méliès' own life.<br/><br/>Instead of a elegiacal portrait, Hugo is an uproarious celebration of the cinema of attractions. The performances are delightful, particularly Butterfield and the ""Jennifer Lawrence in-the-wings"" Moretz. Ben Kingsley is unsurprisingly great, and even Cohen shows himself to be a competent actor outside the outlandish shock-cock films like Bruno and The Dictator.<br/><br/>Backed up by the magnificent visuals of DP Robert Richardson and Howard Shore's swooping score, Scorsese's picture is not just an intelligent, fun-for-all-the-family fable, it's a movie which will inspire the young filmmakers of tomorrow.<br/><br/>More reviews at www.366movies.com"

It centers on a young boy whose father passes away and lives in a train station tuning clocks and collecting parts to finish his father's last project in hopes of learning why his father is deceased. But more than that it explores how powerful the art of film is and how if you're open to it can inspire you in all of life's aspects and mysteries.As a fellow film lover myself i found myself blown away by the passion Martin Scorcesse displays on screen with the help of a talented cast and wonderful cinematography Hugo is truly cinematic marvel."

I have never been to France and so I have absolutely no personal experience to draw on. When I was at school several decades ago (but later than the 1930s date of the action in Hugo) I was always taught that the French used twenty-four hour clocks. I cannot imagine that a director with the acumen and expertise of Martin Scorsese would make such an elementary error as having the wrong clock in French railway stations and also no one has mentioned this in the goofs section so what's the answer please?"

","Kudos to director Martin Scorsese, master of cerebral and dark, presents a very colorful jubilee of sights and sounds. Based on Brian Selznick's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret, an orphan boy named Hugo(Asa Butterfield)lives in the walls of a 1930s Parisian train station. Hugo's father(Jude Law)dies leaving the young boy in the custody of the lad's uncle, who disappears and leaves him to wind the hug clocks at the station. The only tangible memory of Hugo's father is an automaton, a mechanical man. Hugo is smart enough to make the unfinished work complete by stealing various small metal items from a toy shop in the station. Hugo is finally caught by the store's owner Georges(Ben Kingsley), who puts him to work instead of turning him over to the station's only policeman(Sacha Baron Cohen). In the process Hugo meets Georges' goddaughter Isabelle(Chloe Grace Moretz, who will befriend Hugo and help him search for a key that fits the automaton that is believed to foretell Hugo's destiny. A family fun movie that holds interest from beginning to end. Also starring are Frances de la Tour, Ray Winstone, Christopher Lee and Emily Mortimer. HUGO is very award worthy."

If so, rent it, buy it, borrow it, or somehow find a way to watch it. I think you will like it, if not absolutely love it. For me personally, I think it really is a beautiful and stunning film to see, and the acting is spot on. I just didn't care for the film after the first say hour and a half or so. Not that the last half hour is bad, in fact I rather liked it at first. It was after re-watching part of it, and thinking about it in depth that I began to realize its flaws. I do think it was rather predictable in ways, which is to be somewhat expected as a family film. I also can't get over the ending feeling like an attempt at becoming a shoe-in at the Oscars. This does bother me to a certain extent how it was done, and how educational it became on the start of the film industry. I hope if anything this ends up inspiring youth to be more creative as I find there to be far too few of these around today.

"seaview1","8","3","4","24 February 2012"," A Genius Is Rediscovered in HUGO
","Martin Scorsese has a deep love for movie history and film preservation. Both passions are imbued in Hugo, a charming tale of a child's personal search that leads to a treasure of memories and redemption.<br/><br/>At a Paris train station in 1931 a young boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives a solitary existence. The train inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) lurks about looking for stray children to send to the local orphanage. One day Hugo notices an elderly watchmaker (Ben Kingsley) who sits lonely and silent. Joined by a curious girl, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), the two join forces to investigate the old man and learn that there is much more to him than meets the eye. Add to this a mysterious mechanical man built by Hugo's father and known as an automaton whose cryptic writings may provide clues to the past. But how to unlock these secrets? What the young couple finds will lead them back to the old man as there seem to be a surprising connection, and through the old man, a remarkable past is rejuvenated that will harken back to the birth of movies.<br/><br/>As the mysterious, old man, Ben Kingsley provides the gravitas to flesh out a character that at first seems dull and lonely, whose past catches up and reveals a lifetime of hope and genius heretofore forgotten by the public until Hugo and Isabelle rediscover it. The kids are well cast although Hugo comes across a bit of an oddball whereas Isabelle is a sweet girl who compliments him. Cohen, quite effective in a villainous role, is properly mean and threatening until he has a change of heart near the end, and you wish there had been more of him because his character evolves toward the end.<br/><br/>In fact the whole heart concept permeates Hugo. There is the budding love between Hugo and Isabelle, the old man's romance in his past, and even the hint of love from a flower girl. There is the heart shaped key that unlocks the automaton's mechanism. The automaton serves as a static character, a kind of Pinocchio in scenes where Hugo talks to it in the absence of his father. Above all, it's all about a love for movies past and present.<br/><br/>It is clear how much Scorsese loves movies in smaller, intimate scenes as when Hugo and Isabelle sneak into a Harold Lloyd film or when he shows snippets from earlier moving images. The main thrust of Hugo's plot provides Scorsese the excuse to restage classic kinescope and film clips. It's like reliving history. Film buffs will love these moments as Scorsese lovingly and painstakingly recreates early silent film. We see history and magic being made simultaneously! A minor problem with the film is that it feels a bit uneven at times, and you never feel fully engaged with the characters as much as you want to be. Hugo and his friend Isabelle should be the focus all the way, but the film seems to occasionally stray from their journey. As a couple, they are more tentative and reserved than Harry Potter and his friend Hermione in the Harry Potter series. It lacks a strong emotional center. One wonders how a director like Steven Spielberg or Tim Burton would have interpreted the story.<br/><br/>Technical and production quality are superb. This is a fully realized fantasy world especially with the overall design and art direction and costumes within the train station and immediate neighborhood. Even the visual effects work well within the story without being a distraction.<br/><br/>The film does works for both children and adults. Hugo in a way represents the painful and joyous past that people keep hidden until it is released by patience and love."

Running Time: 2hrs.&8mns.<br/><br/>My Take ***1/2 (Out of ****) <br/><br/>At the end of January 2012, the nominees for the 84th Annual Academy Awards were announced. Leading the pack with 11 nominations is Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" (2011), a film that was met with universal critical acclaim. Unfortunately for the people behind ""Hugo"" the movie's box office returns were disappointing. The film grossed just $90 million, which is far below the film's $150 million budget. Perhaps on Oscar night all will be forgiven and there will be a renewed interest in the picture (as of this writing the 84th Annual Academy Awards is two & 1/2 weeks away).<br/><br/>On the surface, ""Hugo"" appears to be a departure from what movie goers expect from director Martin Scorsese. Over the last 30 years he has made a reputation and a Hollywood career out of gritty hard edged crime dramas, many focusing on the mafia. Don't be deceived. Scorsese has been known to make lovely artistic dramas as well. Even now it's hard to think that the man who brought us the likes of ""GoodFellas"" (1990) and ""The Departed"" (2006) is also the same guy who brought us the 19th century period piece high society film ""The Age of Innocence"" (1993) or ""Kundun"" (1997), a film about the Dalai Lama.<br/><br/>To watch ""Hugo,"" it is apparent the movie was a passion project for Scorsese. He's a celebrated filmmaker and ""Hugo"" is celebration of the movies. More importantly, it is about dreamers and the dreams they dream. Who better than Scorsese to bring this story to you? The movie opens in the winter of 1930s Paris. Young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan living in the Gare Montparnasse train station. He was the ward of his uncle (Ray Winstone) after his father (Jude Law) passed away in a museum fire. Now the uncle has been missing for several months, leaving no one to wind the clocks in the great station, save for Hugo. He performs his duties daily without fail.<br/><br/>Before Hugo's father passed away, the father and son had started restoring a dilapidated automaton, which is a mysterious mechanical man that supposedly writes a special message with a pen. Hugo is determined to bring the mechanical man back to life, if only to write Hugo a message which he believes will be from his late father.<br/><br/>Everything is a challenge for Hugo. To make ends meet, Hugo steals food to survive and mechanical parts for his machine restoration. He is careful to not get caught by the train station watchman, the inspector Gustav (Sasha Baron Cohen) who is ever vigil and quite experienced in sending orphans into group homes. The most prominent figure Hugo encounters at the train station is the toy store owner Georges (Sir Ben Kingsley). Hugo regularly lifts items from his store until one day Georges finally catches him. In a heartbreaking turn of events, Hugo's dream of restoring the automaton comes to a bitter end.<br/><br/>Hugo has been on his own for so long, he's not too sure how to take the prospect of making a new friend in Georges goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz). She has a lively imagination and a love of books. Hugo loves to hear about the stories she reads and he in turn shares with her one of his loves he used to enjoy with his late father: the cinema. The movies Hugo and his father loved best were the ones rich in imagination where the possibilities of the screen seemed boundless. In fact, one character in ""Hugo"" describes the movies as a place where a person could see the dreams from their sleep on the screen.<br/><br/>It is pleasant to watch Hugo and Isabelle talk about dreams as if they are an elixir of life. Leave it to true dreamers to see them as such. These are smart kids dealing with the circumstances in their lives on their own terms. You generally don't see kids in the movies with this much passion about what makes them tick.<br/><br/>It has been suggested that ""Hugo"" is Martin Scorsese's autobiography. He has been consistently a powerful filmmaker with precise clear vision. ""Hugo"" talks about the human drive for visions and imagination. It asks viewers what inspires them and what encourages them to carry on with their daily lives.<br/><br/>Sometimes people lose their dreams. When that happens, everything they've done previous to that can be lost. ""Hugo"" also shows us this loss and what it is to reach redemption and become reinvested once again.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" easily boasts the best looking visuals used to re-create the past, giving everything a recognizable, yet unearthly quality. The best way to describe it is it looks gritty and feels like something out of a storybook at the same time. All the buildings, machinery, sets and costuming are created in top form.<br/><br/>There are a lot of really brilliant metaphors in ""Hugo"" that hint about ideas, hopes and dreams. I believe that more than one viewing of this picture can take people to different places with each viewing. That's an unusual thing to say about a family geared movie. But then, ""Hugo"" isn't just any film. How many features do you know that challenge us to look at ourselves, no matter what our circumstances are and then invite us to keep on dreaming? ""Hugo"" does just that. The film honors the wonder of the movies and encourages us to celebrate dreaming."

Ben Kingsley also does a very good job by portraying an angry workshop named George Mellies owner,but his secrets are shown in the movie portraying him as a very good and warm-hearted man. Chloe Grace Moretz and Sacha Boren Cohen do their roles as the daughter of George, and the rest of the cast also make the movie into an Oscar worthy movie.<br/><br/>The Cinematography in the movie is perfect,displaying Paris in the 1930's perfectly, from excellent scenery's shown in the movie,along with great display of the people in the city at that time. The Visual Effects are also excellent in the movie and im sure it would have been much better in 3d. The Music is as good as it gets, another Scorsese classic, and the background scores deserves to get rewarded.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese shows us yet again why he is one of the best directors of all time, by making a very unusual family film, and making it into one of the best of 2011. He makes the young actors act perfectly in their roles, while also displaying the life of Hugo perfectly,and showing the audience the world from his point of view. He also keeps the audience thinking in the movie,and makes it highly entertaining for the audience, making a perfect movie for a family to see. He really deserves an Oscar for this movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I Think this is bound to get many Oscars after getting 11 nominations,and anyone will find it highly entertaining."
"saleem-555","7","3","4","20 January 2012"," Scorsese re-invents himself brilliantly for multiple ""homages"" to the cinema
","Considering Scorsese's track in films to date, Hugo is indeed very different, very fresh and original, and reflects not only the director's admiration for silent cinema and Geoges Melies, it simply reflects his passion for cinema and its tremendous power to surprise and entertain audiences whether at the turn of the last century or of course today. Hugo fulfills its target as a worthy tribute to the cinema, where Scorsese has put his savoir-faire brilliantly into the making of the film, and the cinematography and the camera work are mind-blowing with fantastic sweeps, where at last 3D is superbly put to use. I have given the film a 7 rating, mainly as the main character -Hugo- as played by the young actor did not seem quite suitable for the role, though one has to admit it is a difficult role in the storyline. The musical score was used with profusion and one wishes it used less accordion sound (do we have to be reminded this is Paris?). Talking of Paris it did seem digital at times in the background, and we scarcely notice sunshine or daylight in the film, leaving it with a studio feel (maybe intended? for the love of cinema..). Scorsese homages to the cinema in the film include winks to the late Spanish director Luis Bunuel (the dream in a dream sequence)and Alfred Hitchcock (Scorcese makes a brief cameo appearance as the photographer of the Melies couple) and the list may not be complete. To sum up Scorsese's love of cinema is contagious, when it is conveyed as masterfully as in Hugo !"

","Many reviewers have labelled this kiddie-friendly adventure as Martin Scorsese's ""love letter to cinema"", and quite frankly, I couldn't have put it better myself. Set in a train station in 1930's Paris, Hugo tells the story of the titular orphaned boy (Asa Butterfield – occasionally grating in his overplayed innocence) who will do anything to fix the life-like robot left to him as he believes – hopes – it contains a message from his dearly beloved father, all the while discovering how cinema began thanks to a chance encounter with a grumpy old store owner (Ben Kingsley). Although played out honestly enough, it's merely a means for Scorsese, a self-confessed cineaste, to show off his encyclopaedic knowledge of all things movie-related; and, boy, it truly is a wondrous world we've been invited into by the maestro. Complete with flawless 3D that adds tremendous depth, countless references to pre-sound motion pictures and another incredible turn from Chloe Grace-Moretz, this is one trip that any self-respecting movie aficionado must take."

","After reading the reviews on IMDb I thought this would be a good movie to see. Sadly I was extremely disappointed and bored to tears while watching this movie. It was never ending and had little or no story to it. I found it painful watching this slow movie. I don't get what all the hype was about. I felt sorry for Hugo being an orphan and all alone in this world, but the movie was an absolute drag. And the ending was a let down too. I cant imagine any kid wanting to sit through two hours of this movie and enjoying themselves. This movie was massively over rated. I saw a few people get up and leave and I was tempted to do the same. The only reason I didn't was sure the ending would make up for the rest of the movie."

"ohashmawi","Null","4","6","5 March 2014"," Hugo is a really great movie, it's a pleasant surprise knowing that Martin Scorsese can do such an outstanding job with a family movie.
","I really enjoyed Hugo, I thought it was a fun and beautiful adventure, I enjoyed the acting, the story, almost everything, there were only a few things that I didn't like about the movie, but I'll start the review:<br/><br/>The acting in Hugo is incredible, everybody gives great performances, especially Chloe Grace Moretz, she provided an electric performance, she looked really happy in all the scenes, and her English accent was very good too. Veterans Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helen McRory also provide great performances, in particular Mr. Kingsley, whose character was a bit of a dick, but he played him gracefully. Asa Butterfield in my opinion was the weakest link in the cast, I thought his performance was very awkward, except for the scene where the automaton is writing, during that scene, he was incredible, I really bought the anger he was feeling. Overall the acting in the movie was very good, I noticed that quite a few people were from the Harry Potter movies(which is interesting). <br/><br/>The movie's writing was very good, it is an adapted script, so there's not much to say, but I'll talk about what stood out to me. I really liked that Isabelle kept on using vocabulary from old books, words that you don't hear every day and all. The symbolism of Melies' movies going from the top to the ground(literally) was really great. I also loved the ending of the movie. <br/><br/>The art design of the movie is great, all the props look great, the automaton was totally believable, the sets were awesome and everybody's clothes look very good as well.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of Hugo is good, the French instrumental music is incredible, it reminds you of Ratatouille, which is another great movie that takes place in France. The music is very fun to listen to, it just makes you feel good.<br/><br/>The effects in this movie are definitely the high point of the movie, they were drop dead gorgeous! I'm not even exaggerating here, they are stunning, the part where all of Melies' drawings are falling from the chest is amazing, there are so many memorable scenes in this movie, I mean the dream that Hugo has? Really, the effects are outstanding. The directing and cinematography of the movie are also amazing.<br/><br/>This movie is really great, it feels like something out of a dream, really. I strongly recommend it, I give it a 9.4/10."
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","4","6","29 January 2014"," Scorsese proves his versatility
","There's so much to love about Hugo, I'm not really sure where to begin. The film is impeccably shot. Every frame is chosen with care and you can tell that the director has a passion for his work. This should come as no surprise from one of the greatest living directors, Martin Scorsese. <br/><br/>The film takes place in 1930's Paris and centers around a boy named Hugo who lives by himself in a train station. He has taken it upon himself to restore a mysterious machine that he and his father were working on. Hugo operates the many clocks that are spread throughout the train station. This is where some of the greatest shots take place. The cinematography while inside the bowels of the train station are simply stunning. This is also where the use of 3D truly shines. The gears and other inner workings of the clock literally make you feel like you are with Hugo as he makes his way around the hidden hallways of the train station. I've been pretty vocal about the 3D craze, but it's clear to me that, when in the right hands, 3D can be an amazing tool. Scorsese uses it to perfection here. <br/><br/>Hugo also pays homage to silent films. There are many scenes, especially early in the film, where there is no dialogue and the scenes play out while Hugo is spying on the inhabitants of the train station from the inside of his hidden lair. <br/><br/>One thing I want people to realize is that Hugo is not really a kids film. The trailer makes the film out to be a fantasy film, but that is a little misleading. In fact, the second half of the movie deals with the history of cinema and the preservation of the arts. A topic that most kids (and some adults, you know who you are:tongue:) would find pretty boring. As a fan of cinema, I found it to be fascinating. <br/><br/>The cast is great lead by relative newcomer Asa Buterfield who plays Hugo. Sometimes in the same scene he shows the strength of a young boy all on his own, with the fear of a child just yearning to be taken care of. Chloe Grace Moretz is superb as usual as a girl Hugo befriends who just wants to go on adventures. Ben Kingsley gives the films best performance as a shop owner who has lost his passion. Sacha Baron Cohen provides the films comic relief. Ray Winstone and Jude Law have small parts, but both are solid as usual. One complaint is that I wish there was more for Christopher Lee and Emily Mortimer to do. <br/><br/>Please don't dismiss Hugo as a kids movie. It's far more than that. Also, don't read into the trailers. This is not some fantasy adventure. That being said, Hugo is perfect movie escapism. It mixes mystery with themes about being a dreamer and to never stop doing what you're passionate about. One thing is for certain, Scorsese is passionate about making films and I, for one, hope he never stops making them."
"Cineanalyst","9","4","6","22 August 2013"," The Magic of Méliès and Scorsese
","My knowledge of motion pictures is strongest in respect to the earliest silent films, as anyone who looks at the list of the titles I've reviewed for IMDb can tell. This includes over 50 of the more remarkable 199 films of Georges Méliès available on the DVDs from Flicker Alley. Thusly, I greatly appreciate the attention this recent mainstream movie, as well as the graphic novel it's based on, has brought to the early cinema pioneer. Although it presents plenty of historical inaccuracies, this is to be expected in a fictionalization of a historical person, and it's nonetheless commendable how much ""Hugo"" gets right and how felicitous the movie's style and tone are to the spirit of Méliès's own films. And it's all the more commendable considering that this is an atypical picture for Martin Scorsese, although he's well known for his appreciation of film history and work in film preservation. This shines through Hugo's best scenes of flashbacks of Méliès making his movies in his glass-ceiling studio in Montreuil and a passionate plea for film preservation during the climactic celebration of his career and screening of his films.<br/><br/>That ""Hugo"" is a family-oriented picture is appropriate given that Méliès's féeries (fairy films) and fantasy adventures were among the first films ever made largely for an audience of children, although as with ""Hugo"", people of all ages, of course, may enjoy them. Méliès also introduced and exploited ""special effects"", which in his day mostly consisted of substitution splicing (stopping and resuming filming, touched up by editing, for transformations, appearances and disappearances of characters and scenery) and superimpositions (also known as multiple-exposure photography or matte shots). ""Hugo"", likewise, exploits today's tricks of computer generated imagery (CGI) and 3D digital photography. Additionally, although ""Hugo"" isn't hand colored the way Méliès's films were offered to be, its digital color grading scheme imitates the early Autochrome color photography process invented by the Lumière brothers--the same guys most often credited with inventing cinema. Although I can't speak personally to the 3D since I've only seen it in 2D, it seems to be almost universally praised as some of the best work done in the field. Reportedly, it's the first movie ever photographed entirely by 3D cameras, whereas earlier 3D movies have all had 3D conversion done in some part in post production. James Cameron said it's the best 3D photography he's seen, and he should know since he's the director of ""Avatar"" (2009) and is the biggest pusher of the technology.<br/><br/>Critics have also praised or panned the supposed leisurely pace of ""Hugo"". Compared to Méliès's films, however, the pace is frenetic. ""Hugo"" and most movies since the adoption of the classical style in the late 1910s are composed of shots lasting an average of a few seconds, whereas Méliès would often leave a shot-scene on screen for minutes, and for whom continuity editing was largely ignored in favor of theatrical imitation. Thankfully, the makers of ""Hugo"" don't try to faithfully replicate that theatricality; instead, it begins with swooping camera vistas and tracking shots that truly can go anywhere via CGI. The quick interpolation of clips from Méliès's films in ""Hugo"", however, may give an impression counter to the actual slow pacing of his tableaux.<br/><br/>The narrative follows a boy's ""adventure"" of discovering Méliès, and I'm sure for many viewers ""Hugo"" is their own introduction to the cinema magician. That may be the case for some popular critics, too, as it seems they mention the historical inaccuracies of the fictional story as though they were facts from Méliès's real life. For instance, while it's true that the Lumière brothers refused to sell Méliès a camera, it's not true that Méliès's introduction to cinema was from accidentally walking into a fairground screening. In fact, he was at the Lumière brothers' first public exhibition of the Cinématographe at the Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895. And the end of Méliès's filmmaking career happened before and had nothing to do with WWI, although the prevalent view is that his style did fall out of public favor (as well as because his non-business, artisan ethic was no match for the monopolistic practices of his competitors). This isn't so much a criticism of ""Hugo"", however, as it's a criticism of anyone who takes their facts from a movie. For more on the history as it relates to ""Hugo"" and ""The Artist"", see Fiona Pleasance's blog article ""Yesterday's Men"" and for that and other interesting observations on the movie read ""Hugo: Scorsese's birthday present to Georges Méliès"" by film historian and theorist Kristin Thompson.<br/><br/>Regardless, for replicating Méliès's Montreuil dream factory, ""Hugo"" is a history lesson that has come entertainingly to life. Not even some otherwise fine documentaries, such as ""La magie Méliès"" (1997), do as well at capturing the process and wonder of the film pioneer at work. Given that early histories dismissed the importance of editing in Méliès creating his trick effects, it's great to see its central role in the flashback sequence here. I also liked other details that ""Hugo"" recreated, including how Méliès had two cameras shooting at once--one print for the domestic European market and another for the American. And Ben Kingsley very much looks and, indeed, embodies the part. Various silent films of others are referenced in ""Hugo"", too, including a visit to a cinema where movie posters are seen and the children see Harold Lloyd's comedy ""Safety Last!"" (1923), which is imitated later in a key scene in the outer narrative. 2011 was a good year for fans of classic movies and for those who enjoy movies about movies, with the releases of ""The Artist"", ""My Week with Marilyn"" and ""Hugo""."
"dirtyharry2489","9","4","6","4 June 2012"," Hugo (2011)
","Scorsese departs from the norm with a brilliantly magical family film about a lonely boy who lives in a train station. Left an orphan, the boy is recruited by his boozy uncle to manage the station clocks, and wanders into an adventure that delves wonderfully into the charming world of early cinema. Child actors Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz provide strong and endearing performances, and Ben Kingsley is knockout as usual. Strong cinematography, script, and editing bring the whole piece together, and somehow retains an enthralling atmosphere despite the relaxed pacing of the film. A certain level of ultra-innocence is present (as expected) from a filmmaker who rarely deals with the genre. Overall, certainly one of the more exceptional films of the year."

When people decide what a movie is supposed to be before they see it, aren't they setting themselves up for disappointment. Also, it would seem that it also shows a lack of much imagination. I found the character of Hugo to be incredibly complex and diverse. He does have a quest. It's to get answers to questions that have defined his life. He meets wonderful characters as they slide through the masterfully created milieu of the train station. There are forces out there that could send him off to the most dismal of existences. This has all the charm of the best children's books that I seen when I go to the library. The artistry is there. I suppose if you are expecting Narnia with a bunch of pseudo-religious manifestations, you will certainly be disappointed. This is like saying that you didn't like Gone With the Wind because there were no space aliens. Also, it gave life to a mystical figure, George Melies. I remember seeing that spaceship hit the moon in the eye and thinking how rapidly the artists adapted to the invention of film. I would hope you would not be put off by the nay-sayers.

","I just read two scathing reviews of Hugo. I saw it last night with my wife. We clapped spontaneously after it was finished. All I can say is that I laughed, cried, and was thrilled by this movie. I believe it to be the best thing Scorcese has ever done. It was absolutely brilliant on so many levels. It was a touching story about a young boy surviving on his wits and being welcomed into a family. It was a movie about discovery. Inner discovery and outer. It was a movie about love. It was about patience. It was about steadfastness. It was about wonder and delight. It was about magic. It was spiritual and also utilitarian. In other words it covered lots of topics and levels. I had no expectations. I knew nothing about it going in. Sometimes that is the death knell of having a movie being enjoyable. It seems every time I read lots about a movie and then watch it I am disappointed. However often when I know nothing about a film I find it delightful. This was the case with Hugo. I don't see how anyone could not have been carried away by this film! It is a sad state of affairs when a humane film like Hugo garners such scathing reviews. I wonder what these people consider ""good"" movies. Anyway we loved it and feel enriched by the experience."
"chaos-rampant","Null","4","6","22 February 2012"," Clockworks, or the invention of dreams among clocks
","Consider a movie about a mechanical man who draws a picture from inner heart, once unlocked with the right key.<br/><br/>Consider this picture one of many unlocked from a box and fluttering around in a room. Motion pictures that guide vision.<br/><br/>And consider a boy - adept at fixing things - who will have to quite literally discern the mechanisms that shape pictures into a narrative and that time beats at the heart of them. And all of this as our movie about the invention of dreams.<br/><br/>And before we're lost in the gaudy swirl of impossible dreams, visions, movies, daredevil escapades, misty-eyed wonders, sweeping CGI vistas, nostalgic lushness, sparkling metallic gadgetry, and earthly artificiality of 1930's Paris, consider the simplest premise: a movie about an old man who even unbeknownst to him has devised the mechanics that will generate a narrative that restores dreams and hope. This is a remarkable idea in how it has been visualized by referencing cinema, one that at least in my eyes vindicates Scorsese's several missteps as of late. <br/><br/>Oh, it is a little heavy-handed at times. A little heavy with emotion. And a little unimaginative when you'd expect it to, notably the climax on the clock. But it's an erudite work of someone who's been building clocks all his life, has mastered the art in his own way big or small, and now wants to tell you about the function of time.<br/><br/>Now the first generation of filmmakers were actual inventors, engineers, optical scientists. Quickly it passed into the hands of artisans usually from less than respectable art: vaudeville, the circus, popular theater, the magic show. What joyrides we've had since. A more important function as it turned out, was that images drawn from thin air into a film strip had the capacity to mend and purify in novel ways. The only thing asked from us, was that we shed self and be a part of them for how long it took.<br/><br/>Scorsese's wonderful trick is that instead of giving us fantasy that ordinarily affects with smoke and mirrors, he makes the actual plot of the film about what it means to stage the trick. This way we get to note how the thing tics, the actual function. What the mirror mirrors. In our case, several iconic images of early cinema.<br/><br/>So, our film is about this man who first engineered illusions, contraptions for dreaming. One of these is a mechanical man, stored away and forgotten. Years later, father and son dust it out from an attic broken and work hard to decipher its mechanism. Father dies and kid goes to move inside a giant clock hovering above a train station, where tracks of life disperse the narratives. His own is an adventure that sets in motion the wheels and chains of the world in such a way as to redeem the old inventor and fix, restore the purpose of dreaming. This is given to us as the actual restoration of his films and playing before an audience, a clever wink.<br/><br/>To think that in many quarters this has been received at face value, as a movie about kids, or as just a love letter! It boggles the mind with how little delicacy some people handle films. The famous Lumiere short about a train arriving at station is enacted at one point, and as a dream (within a dream). What better clue did they need?"

","This is a rarity - a film that both pays homage to film and is enjoyable for ALL ages. It is more of an adult story, of losing childhood and the passion which following your dreams entails, but it never feels too mature, a testament to Scorsese's determination to make a family film. <br/><br/>This is a genre- less film, and to some degree it is Oscar bait, although it will probably fall just short of a slight more 'artistic' movie, but this movie is pure film-making in every sense of the word. One of the better movies of 2011, but this shouldn't be surprising to anyone familiar with Scorsese's versatility."

","There is a rare gift in film-making that can take you beyond the ordinary, beyond what most films portray as the ""Human element."" What has come to pass these last few years in Hollywood and elsewhere as ""Movies"" is largely the big budget blockbuster that delves into the gut-wrenching emotions of love, hatred and other primitive feelings as they attempt to make us feel a part of the life and death struggle.<br/><br/>Those are fine as far as they go, and I like a good bang-bang shoot 'em up as much as the next guy. They've evolved as I said to use more technology and more ""So called"" magic to do what they do. It's all still smoke and mirrors unfortunately. None of them comes close to telling the sensitive tale that is Hugo. <br/><br/>We first meet the young boy where he lives, carrying on his meager, miserable existence in a train station. And yet, you have the sense that to him, it's not miserable, he's not lonely, but rather that he's fascinated by the world around him: The life, the hustle, the bustle, the activity, the people, and then you realize it, this is a child, and he's innocent! And yet, Hugo has suffered much in his young life. <br/><br/>The tragedy that he is becomes part of all of us. That is real screen magic. The audience begins to empathize with him, even to feel his pain. The pain is real, it's inside each of us, it's the longing for connection, to be part of the story, to make a difference! Those who were in our theater that didn't fall asleep (there were a few, I must be honest, and they snored - how rude!) were touched by the magic of the film-making and given a fresh glimpse of hope, of a new life. We made a connection with the past and learned how that makes us better in our present. We learned that relationships really do matter and they are worth fighting for, even if it means we might lose everything.<br/><br/>Hugo is a winner! The magic is not in the film-making per se, rather it's in our hearts as we learn that we are all Hugo."
"remedy305","8","4","6","12 December 2011"," 1920's Paris comes to life
","This is a wonderful story about a boy, Hugo, who fixes and maintains the clocks in a Paris railway station after his father dies and leaves him an orphan. With the help of a young girl, Isabelle, they set about finding out the story of an old toymaker, Georges Melies, the young girl's father. In actual fact there are many story lines in this movie, many threads that are followed, and the way Scorsese ties them all together is wonderful. If I had any criticism it is that the actual story takes a while to get moving. In fact until about half way I wasn't sure where the story was going, which story was the main thread. If this was Scorsese's intention then the second half made it all worthwhile and I will certainly enjoy the whole movie on a second viewing. But I was a little bewildered for the first hour. I again commend the director for producing a wonderful movie without bad language, sex or gratuitous violence."
"Reel_starz","8","4","6","5 December 2011"," Hugo: A Waking Dream
","Ask any film buff walking down the street who Martin Scorsese is, and they're likely to respond with something along the lines of ""living legend"" or to mention Taxi Driver, Raging Bull or Goodfellas, perhaps the occasional After Hours or The Departed. With roughly half a century of filmmaking under his belt, the director has become revered for his dark, uncompromising looks into the human psyche, often focusing on seedy or morally ambiguous protagonists. Therefore, the news that his next project after the twisty, B-movie homage Shutter Island would be a kid-friendly fantasy, in 3D no less, was greeted with understandable skepticism by the film world. Despite its enormous departure from his usual tone and material, the result, however, feels like arguably the most personal of Scorsese's many works. Joining a host of other films from this year suffused with nostalgia, Hugo is a giddy, mischievous romp through 1930s Paris steadied by the confident hand of a master who not only knows his craft inside and out but is also madly, hopelessly, infectiously in love with it.<br/><br/>That adoration permeates through every aspect of the movie, from the breezy performances and tone to the absolutely stunning visuals and the love letter to Georges Melies and silent films, an ode that might have come off as ham-handed had its intentions not been so blatantly earnest and pure. Indeed, there is an innocence to Hugo that is all the more surprising when compared to the gritty realism of the rest of Scorsese's oeuvre. It celebrates the magic and joys of cinema with childlike wonder, allowing the audience to get swept up in much the same way that the story's two young protagonists, Hugo and Isabel, are when they sneak into a theater to watch an old Harold Lloyd comedy, the way audiences were when the first moving picture came out and viewers ducked and screamed because they thought the train in the film was going to hit them. In spite of the decidedly 21st-century technology used to make the movie (though it must be noted that Hugo boasts the best use of modern 3D in a chiefly live-action film so far, as even Avatar used as much CGI and animation as live-action), Hugo feels cheerfully old-fashioned, featuring long sequences without dialogue, including the remarkable opening sequence, and a wonderful score by Howard Shore that not only evokes the proper setting, but the entire feel of that era; you can easily imagine hearing it over a Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton film. Also refreshing is the strictly platonic but heartfelt relationship between Hugo, an orphan who has lived in the Paris Nord train station since his father died in a fire and has a natural instinct to fix things, and Isabel, the god-daughter of a crotchety, old man who runs a toy shop in the station. They exude naiveté but are not dumb or overly cute, treated by the filmmakers with the same respect accorded the adults in the story.<br/><br/>Another running trend through this year in film, in addition to the strong currents of nostalgia, has been the unusually strong performances from kids or teens, from the gang in Super 8 to Hunter McCracken in The Tree of Life and Kerris Dorsey in Moneyball. Though the youngsters here aren't necessarily the most impressive entries into that list, they both hold their own against their more seasoned costars. Asa Butterfield is passable as Hugo, able to convincingly play the character as both a lonely misfit and a smart kid who has learned quickly how to take care of himself, though there are moments when his emotions feel more forced and artificial than truly organic. However, it is Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabel who shines, radiating warmth, sincerity and a charming sweetness, a performance that is a far cry from her breakout role as the foul-mouthed Hit Girl in Kick-Ass; in the year since that movie came out, she has shown incredible range and, in Hugo, only further establishes that she is one of the most talented young actresses working today. Among the supporting players, a solid if eclectic group, Ben Kingsley, who portrays Georges Melies, seems likely to attract the most accolades, but perhaps the most surprising performance comes from Sasha Baron Cohen, who suggests here that he's capable of more than you'd think judging from Borat.<br/><br/>However, despite some notable performances and a lovely script, it is the visuals that bring Hugo to life. Normally when someone says the visuals are the most impressive aspect of a film, they're referring to CGI-and-F/X bonanzas, and it's usually a criticism, suggesting that such technical proficiency only serves to distract from uninteresting characters or a weak plot, but Hugo shows that this doesn't always have to be the case and that it's not always a bad thing when set design or special effects steal the show. The period sets and costumes are flawless, feeling authentic with a slight touch of whimsy that adds to the film's fantastical, dreamlike atmosphere, and the many shots overlooking Paris are simply breathtaking. Scorsese creates a world that feels completely real, even when it clearly isn't, so much so that there's a dream sequence that audiences likely won't recognize as a dream until it is nearly over. It is a world where magic is real and dreams come to life, and it is this sensibility that makes Hugo such a stirring tribute to not just old, silent movies, but cinema as a whole, and to the power of the imagination."
"goldwriting","7","4","6","5 December 2011"," Finding the Magic in Dreams
","Yes, this 3D trend has gotten a little more than annoying recently, but mainly my rage about it is focused at studios that purposefully add this gimmick only to jack up the ticket price and bring nothing additional to the movie experience when the film wasn't shot in 3D. I avoid tempting my anger over this issue by mostly seeing everything in 2D when offered (unless I know for a fact it was shot in 3D) and this tip keeps me calm and content during my numerous cinema trips. Yet, when a legend in the industry, like Martin Scorsese, decides to shoot his new film in 3D, that can be enough to tempt me into dropping the few extra dollars. So I went, I watched, and I fell into his fantastical world.<br/><br/>Hugo is the story of a small orphan boy who lives in the train station. His sole obsession is to finish fixing a small robotic person that his father found. Hoping to build himself a new friend, Hugo slowly gains the support of a young girl and together they chase after the breadcrumbs of a mystery that very well may link them together in ways they never dreamed of.<br/><br/>Since I led this review with my feelings on 3D, let me first congratulate Scorcese on achieving a beauty and simplicity for this technology seemingly avoided by most other directors (James Cameron gets a pass on this too, since the 3D in Avatar was insanely well done). Right off the bat, the snow falling in the foreground was amazing and added a rich texture to the scene. That straightforward approach to the use of 3D held on through the rest of the film, not overdoing it with overtly sensationalized moments, but using the technology to enhance the depth and reality of the story on screen. Chalk this up as another point for those directors and studios who choose to use 3D from the outset to enrich the experience instead of after the fact in order to enrich their pockets.<br/><br/>** Spoilers ahead – Hard to avoid when talking about the story on this one. **<br/><br/>Now comes the story, or I should correctly say ""stories"", both rich enough to be their own movie. You have the original story of Hugo and his mysterious machine boy, then later comes another adventure about legendary film auteur, George Melies, who was believed to have died in the war, but turns out to be living in an apartment in Paris trying to forget everything about those magical movie-making times. Screenwriter John Logan captured exactly the magic I feel when I sit in that darkened room and am transported away to an unlimited number of worlds. I relished those touching moments where Melies waxed poetically about where dreams came from and how we could all live better lives by helping bring those into reality. I loved both story lines, but found the connection between them a little forced and unfinished.<br/><br/>Another portion of Hugo's personal story, the one about the machine, which strongly resonated with me was his desire to always fix things. There are few things in this world more pure than a desire just to see everyone and everything working at their utmost intended perfection. We all want to be the best versions of ourselves and most of us would also lend a hand if it meant bringing someone else to their pinnacle as well. It rang a touch similar to Pay It Forward, but not nearly as heavy- handed.<br/><br/>Scorcese and Logan did an amazing job in creating a rich and lavish landscape of characters inside the train station, but I ended up wanting Hugo to interact with them much more. Since he really doesn't, it makes all those layers feel superfluous and unnecessary."
"escobar-86","7","4","6","3 December 2011"," A nice film
","(No spoilers here so don't worry) <br/><br/>Took my partner to see Hugo 3D tonight we were supposed to go with some friends but decided I wanted this to be a personal film. Now this being my first written/typed review I think Hugo is a perfect film to start with as I have been so anxious to see it trying my best to stay away from reviews etc. <br/><br/>If you have heard that this film is not for children its mostly correct I am 25 & at times felt to young but at the same time was thinking that if I had a son/daughter this would be the first film I would want them to see. If your going to take a group of children think again as they may find it boring.<br/><br/>Hugo is a nice film you can tell that a lot of passion has gone into it. Visuals are awesome story is great and you get a bit of a history lesson too. It didn't have that Spielberg magic to it though you know like the first time you watched E.T. This was disappointing to me. I am a massive Scorsese fan & in my opinion should stick to the drama/crime as they have all felt epic and stuck with me. The 3D is good in this film as you have probably heard also but I do not care for it much anymore.<br/><br/>To sum it up yeah Hugo is a nice film maybe not one for the kids but the 3D may wow them for the length. Performances were great. To me this is a personal film with a lot of heart. But will not really entertain you or maybe it will. Just go see it."
"EmmaDinkins","8","4","6","29 November 2011"," Chix Chat on Film review: Lives collide in a French train station.
","Since I was not familiar with the book, I can't say that I was excited about Hugo, nor was I anxiously awaiting its release, what I was feeling was curiosity about the story's plot and how would the story be handled by Martin Scorsese given that I knew it was nothing like the films he had previously directed. I sat through the first half hour of this film with absolutely no idea where it was going, I soon saw some familiar faces playing in some key roles George Melies (Ben Kingsley), the Station Inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen), Hugo's Father (Jude Law) and amazingly Monsier Labisse (Christopher Lee). I simply applaud Mr. Lee's career, he is truly a marvel to behold, I remember as a child being scared witless by him as Dracula which was filmed before I was born, later for him to be a part of the Star Wars prequels and as the White Wizard Saruman in the Lord of the Rings trilogy it just boggles my mind that he is still delivering great performances in great films and now for my own children to see and appreciate him in these roles. Not to take anything away for the two young actors who basically carry this film, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz). Their on screen interaction was very enthralling. I truly hope that they both see long and fruitful careers as has Mr. Lee. So now that I have done exactly as this film did, and have taken forever to get to the point. I will say that this was a really good story about how the lives of a famed French film maker and a young boy intersect. I did find it amusing that the young protagonists were reading a French book in perfect English, but I'm sure that bit of movie magic was for the benefit of the American audience. I was totally on edge during the scene from the movie poster with Hugo hanging from the clock hand. That scene and many others throughout this story were interesting, provocative and actually did elicit the excitement that I initially lacked in relation to this movie. This film was a visual gem, the opening scene was a cinematic treat. Even with the lengthy start to develop the story, which took more time than I thought was necessary to get to the meat of the story, this is a lovely film for adults who can appreciate the art of film making as do I. It gets a well deserved green light."
"griffolyon12","4","10","20","25 November 2011"," What Happened?
","The art of adaptation is tricky. Often filmmakers manage to find nuances from the book and expand upon those nuances to make a movie that is as deep and affecting as the book, unfortunately Hugo is not one such movie.<br/><br/>This adaptation of Brian Selznick's enchanting novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret lacks the taut structure and emotional heft of its source material, resulting in a cinematic experience far from enchanting. Director Martin Scorsese did put together a nice ensemble of craftsmen to create some breathtaking sets, costumes, and cinematography, but the thrill of the expertly crafted crafts only lasts for maybe ten minutes, then one would think the story should draw the viewer in, but it never does.<br/><br/>Hugo is an orphan living in the walls of a 1930's Parisian train station, winding the clocks whilst rebuilding an automaton that his father found before he died. Here is the thing, the actors do the best with what they were given, but the script lacks any real life and feels like a workman's paycheck. Time is never given in the editing or the pacing of scenes to let the audience reflect on the emotions of the moment, so we never see the actor's reacting or showing any emotion to the events transpiring.<br/><br/>For example, after Hugo's notebook is taken by the owner of a toy shop booth that he has been stealing from to get parts for the automaton, he should be devastated, right? But instead we see Hugo, immediately after, winding the clocks and watching people in the train station, laughing at their humorous situations. Not to mention, these attempts at comedy always fall flat, in particular with Sacha Baron Cohen's Station Inspector, whose antics just take too long to develop and fills up far too much screen time. The script by John Logan is just poorly paced, with scenes going from high tension and a hankering for a huge pay-off, to the brakes being hit to deliver a laugh.<br/><br/>While Scorsese obviously shows his penchant for film history near the end with a nicely put together ten minute mini-doc in the movie that details the life of pioneer filmmaker Georges Meilies, ten minutes of enchantment do not make up for a haphazard hour and fifty minutes before all of that. As much of a fan I was of Selznick's novel, Hugo is an adaptation that perhaps should have never happened.<br/><br/>I give Hugo a 4 out of 10!"

","This was my first digital 3D and the snowflakes-in-your-face are very impressive; I can see now where it will be a challenge to go back to 2D.<br/><br/>The next pleasure was to simply look at this representation of Paris in the 1930s in this format.<br/><br/>So far so good. And then the underscore music by Howard Shore, and I knew I was in for a rough ride because he chose to imitate Philip Glass and this left me somewhat nauseous for the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>Why did he go that route? Because of the tic-toc-clockery theme? If so, either he or Martin forgot that clocks are inherently sleep-inducing. Combine this with the slow pacing, and after an hour I realized I was hopelessly bored.<br/><br/>The only cheer at this point was a credible effort by young actress Chloë and then the storyline veered off to a film-business homage.<br/><br/>With all due respect to Georges Méliès, I was really not at all prepared to spend an afternoon at film school. I would be happy to do that at another time when in the mood.<br/><br/>If that is your bag, then this film is a must-see.<br/><br/>Otherwise, there must be something else out there much better..."

Not only is Hugo a well-made, beautiful children's film, but it's about the preservation of old cinema. First off, this film is beautiful to look at. The cinematography and set designs are top-notch. This is one of the few films that 3D actually works with. The movie also has a great story which lead to a well-written script which then led to the casting of great actors who did such a fantastic job.<br/><br/>This film, which is based on the novel ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", is about an orphan boy who lives alone in a Paris train station and owns an automaton. He happens to be caught as a thief by a toy store owner, George Melies. The boy ends up meeting Isabelle and together they find out who the real George Melies is.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with fantastic acting. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz are two young, fine actors. Ben Kingsley is perfect as Melies. Sacha Baren Cohen adds some old-fashioned comedy here and does it well. It's also nice to see character actors like Christopher Lee and Richard Griffiths here.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great homage on cinema. I became interested in the history of cinema thanks to this film. The final half-hour of this film is no doubt the best part as we see Hollywood paying respect for this guy.

","We all have the power to intuit when something is ""off""--a skill discussed at length in Malcolm Gladwell's ""Blink."" With this in mind, there is something more than a little ""off"" about Hugo. The characterization especially rings untrue, whether it's the kids who are way too advanced for their years and whose actions seem motivated only by the impulses of the scriptwriters; the keystone cop there for slapstick comic relief and a hint of menace; or Papa Georges who is at turns a prick and a pal.<br/><br/>What's also wrong is the way the story reveals itself. It doesn't unfold like a flower, of its own innate potential. It's painted onto the screen (not unlike the picture of the man in the moon drawn by the automaton), purposely confusing but then when it's all suddenly pulled together, we're all expected to gasp in amazement.<br/><br/>The problem is: it's all too unnatural. And at the heart of it all is a giant conceit about how glorious is the ""art"" of movie-making. ""Hugo"" is beautiful to just our sense of sight.

The acting was good, the cinematics were good, but the storyline was drab. This movie takes two hours, to deliver an obvious ending, that is neither gratifying or overwhelming.

A straight telling of the story of Georges Méliès and his contribution to the early days of cinema, filtered through the Scorsese aesthetic, would have really entertained me. Instead, what we get in Hugo is neither one nor the other, and so it is all a bit flat and lifeless. There is the heavy-handed morality tale element that no Hollywood film can travel without, this time about a broken boy fixing a broken automaton in order to heal an old's man's' broken spirit so he can love life again... It is layered on a bit thick, tipping the story over into gooey sentimentality.<br/><br/>And Sacha Baron Cohen is criminally under-used.<br/><br/>The opening sequence does show a heightened awareness of how to use 3D, and this element is kept up throughout.

The cast is mostly British, giving the whole thing a Dickensian feel, with many nods to the slapstick of early silents. Sacha Baron Cohen plays the villain of the piece, the station's policeman, like a cross between the Child Catcher in 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' and Mr Bumble the beadle in 'Oliver!' Some of this is broad and the gags wheeze a little. It's all a little too patchy to be truly great and the story splutters along in places, but 'Hugo's quixotic faith in movies is intoxicating: 'If you ever wondered where your dreams come from, they're made here,' says Kingsley's Méliès. It might be curtains for celluloid, but Scorsese, a boyish 69, clearly isn't leaving the stage any time soon. He directs every film with the passion of his first. And it shows.

When brought together as a whole, there was this undeniably, palpable sweet tenderness between them, that is so often hard to come by. <br/><br/>I had wanted to see this movie for some time now but it had fallen off my radar, until last week during an impromptu visit to the library, when I cam across it. The first thing that came to mind was a dream I had awhile back, where I heard the character Hugo from the movie, say his name ""Hugo, Hugo Cabre"". Naturally I had to check it out. <br/><br/>These were a few things that stayed with me...<br/><br/>1. Quote said by Hugo: Everything has a purpose, clocks tell you the time, trains take you to places. I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine. Machines never come with any extra parts. you know. they always come with the exact amount they need. So I figured if the entire world was one big machine...I couldn't be an extra part. I had to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason, too.<br/><br/>2. Hugo, looking out into his day, specifically through the number 4, on the station clock.<br/><br/>3. In the scene where Georges Méliès, is in a flashback burning all the things that he once held so dear to his heart. It made me come to terms with a moment back in my time, when, in a similar dramatic fashion, I went through letting go of all the things I felt so passionately about. <br/><br/>I imagine, you too, can take something significant from watching this film."

"thrillerclub","9","6","11","30 November 2011"," The automaton steals the show
","HUGO dazzled, delighted and inspired me as Scorsese intended. Under the guise of a family film HUGO is really a plea for film preservation. It's as much about the life of pioneer filmmaker Geo. Melies as it is the child Hugo. And it was nice to see both Christopher Lee, whom I had no idea was in the picture prior to seeing it, and the young actress Chloe Grace Moretz a few short years after her breakout role in the fun though ultra violent KICK-ASS.<br/><br/>The real stars of the movie were Ben Kingsley and Helen McCrory who play the Melies (husband and wife) during their hey day on stage performing magic tricks and making/starring in (nearly 500) films, then in later years living in obscurity never dwelling on their all but forgotten past. The automaton steals the show in parts and seemed almost lifelike, but Scorsese never crosses the boundary into fantasy. My friend whom I saw HUGO with wanted the automaton to wink at us at the end. I'm glad it didn't! Based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret. While somewhat dramatized, many of the historical details in the film are based on fact. Included are scenes from early cinema, actual footage (bits of A TRIP TO THE MOON are tastefully enhanced with 3-D) from THE GENERAL, SAFETY LAST and other nascent flickers shown being watched by astonished audiences of the time. Overall beautifully done!"

They say that the movie was much better than the original story. From the trailer, I thought it was going to be a movie for kids with lots of 3D twists and turns. Instead, I got a beautifully sentimental story about the wonder of film and about our potential to be healed from past hurts. <br/><br/>This really isn't a typical kid movie. I think my 8 year old and 10 year old would have liked it but I don't think they would understand what it was really about. The pacing and character development is really more like an old Capra movie than a modern Disney or most Pixar movies. My 12 year old thought it was good and I think my 16 year old really liked it.

Are you reading about Martin Scorcese? He was one of my idols during my years, working my way up to be the Professor of 'Knowing stuff about Films'.<br/><br/>Little girl: I had no idea my uncle Martin was a film director!<br/><br/>Hugo: Wow. How spiffingly amazing<br/><br/>Professor: Well since he died, during the Great 'War on Terror', time has not been kind to his movies. However, we have managed to keep hold of this one.<br/><br/>Little girl: But my uncle isn't dead.<br/><br/>Professor: What? But I'm sure I saw him die...<br/><br/>Hugo: Dear sir, can we watch one of his movies?<br/><br/>Professor: Of course! Allow me to introduce you to the genius of Martin Scorcese.<br/><br/>Later<br/><br/>-Knock knock- <br/><br/>Helen: Hello children.<br/><br/>Little girl: Hey Aunty Helen, I had no idea uncle Martin was a famous director!<br/><br/>Hugo: Like, yeah, you know what I mean? How did we not know about dat? What a wise guy. Did he pay off the cops?<br/><br/>Helen: Hugo, why are you wearing sunglasses?<br/><br/>Little girl: You can take them off now. We're indoors.<br/><br/>Hugo: Hey, quit breaking my balls!<br/><br/>Helen: Yes, uncle Martin made films. But he does not like to talk about it any more since the War on Terror ruined his business. Be quiet, or he'll hear us and start emotionally manipulating us into feeling bad.<br/><br/>Martin: It's too late for that.<br/><br/>Little girl: Uncle Martin!<br/><br/>Hugo: Hey what's up Marty? I had no idea you were such a guy, you know? I had you down as one of those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks and took the subway to work every day, and worried about their bills. Making dumb toys in your shop, which I'd just steal to make my terminator in some random part of the station no one ever goes in, because property is so cheap in Paris there's no incentive to make maximum use of all available space.<br/><br/>Martin: Hugo, before you were an irritating thief but now... what's happened to you?<br/><br/>Hugo: Fuhgeddaboudit.<br/><br/>Little girl: Why did you stop making movies uncle Martin? And why were they so... violent?<br/><br/>Martin: Well, after the War on Terror, all everyone wanted to watch were films and stories about terrorists, corrupt politicians and global warming. No one was bothered about mafia films any more so I went into a strop and burnt all my films and my set. Then I decided to make a terminator to get revenge on society, but all it could do was draw pictures.<br/><br/>Little girl: The academics at the university think you died in the war.<br/><br/>Martin: It's true that my position was nearly overrun during Operation Michael of 2018 in the Franco/Luxembourg war that had been triggered by Jihadists throwing toilet roll at the Centre Pompidou. However, I called in Robert Deniro to help me out. He owes his career to me.<br/><br/>Little girl: What were you doing in the war? Weren't you 75 in 2018?<br/><br/>Martin: I was loading artillery for the Hershey bar fusiliers.<br/><br/>Hugo: Wow. You musta whacked some guys. But life on the streets ain't nothing like the army, where you shoot 'em a mile away. You gotta get up close like this... badaBING!

"Vinegaroon3","4","7","14","8 December 2011"," Gorgeous Spectacle...but that's all
","""Hugo"" provides a gorgeous spectacle of a 1930s Paris that never existed. The sets and scenery (nearly all computer generated I imagine) are simply beautiful, and I imagine it was the previews of these scenes that prompted me to see the film. An 8.6 IMDb review probably didn't hurt either, although I definitely should know better by now to take that with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>The story however, was painfully weak and boring. I dozed off a couple of times during the movie, simply because nothing was happening. The gorgeous visuals alone are not sufficient to carry a more than two hour long movie.<br/><br/>The imagery and tone of the film suggest initially that something magical and dramatic is eventually going to happen...but it never does. The ""story"" just plods on and on (did I mention it was loooong?) to a completely disappointing climax. Actually, there really was no climax...the film just sort of ""ends"".<br/><br/>""Hugo"" is really only worth seeing if you think you would enjoy sitting for two hours taking in a portrayal of 1930s Paris that looks like it came from a Thomas Kincaid painting. There are some interesting characters thrown in....I enjoyed Sacha Baron-Cohen's portrayal of the Station Inspector....but there is nowhere near enough substance in the story to support a full length movie. I found ""Hugo"" on balance to simply be too long, and very boring.<br/><br/>This was yet another film that demonstrates that visuals alone, no matter how compelling, cannot substitute for a decent story."

Here, he sets the station's clocks--a job that his drunken uncle is supposed to be performing. <br/><br/>However, what is a fairytale on the surface actually contains quite a bit of non-fiction, specifically in regard to the great film innovator Georges Méliès. This review will not give too much away about the factual content revealed about Méliès, but the reviewer finds it an ingenious intermingling of fantasy and fact. Therefore, it works on two levels: as beautifully rendered myth about the boy and the various characters he meets at the station, and as a short history lesson about one of the great pioneers of the cinema's earliest years."

","Hugo, I can't begin to explain how much I adore this film. There are not enough words in the English dictionary to truly describe how amazing this film is, so I will do my best with the limited vocabulary I possess.<br/><br/>Everything in this film is excellently executed. Every shot, every camera movement, every frame is a work of art in its own right. Their is a simplistic beauty to Hugo that captures my imagination as an inspired filmmaker. The story is easy to follow, but that doesn't mean it's an overly simplistic movie. The movie takes the time to explore and thoroughly develop each major character, something you don't see in a lot of movies today.<br/><br/>Hugo has a charm about itself that isn't found in many movies today and that is thanks to the cast's performances which are all superb. The artistic visuals and music also compliment the movie's charm and overall enhance the movie the way visuals and music are suppose to. The movie doesn't focus on its music or visual effects, the movie focuses on character development. A visual effect without a story is a boring visual effect. There are no boring visual effects in Hugo.<br/><br/>Is there anything negative to say about Hugo? I honestly don't think so. This is a very well made film with a solid script, excellent acting and beautiful visuals. I encourage everyone who hasn't seen this film to find a time to watch it. It is a must."

He absolutely did an amazing job at blending 3D with CGI and Cinematography, one of the best uses of 3D, It inspires me to get a 3D TV just to experience that again, It's that good. It also has good use of sound which it also won an Oscar for; all the sounds of the clock ticking, the trains and camera rolling are really well done if you pay attention. <br/><br/>Acting on everyone Is top notch.

","i was curious enough as it it to know martin Scorsese directing a children movie, not only is it not his genre ..at all, but why would he want do it anyway? what if he messes up? after delivering hardcore intense drama, what good can he bring from a child story? well i was glad to know martin answered it all, HUGO demanded those technical details which only an experienced master can deliver. the dramatic set pieces, those steamy London rail stations, those bustling crowds just bring in the whole experience and nails it bang on!! Those nostalgic moments of old cinema even though hard to convince to younger generation it was a touch of class when he could translate this to us in such a good fashion that even we feel the urge to have been there amongst them doing things which would later have been applauded, cherished. HUGO is more than a movie, it feels more of a movie made with interest with curiosity and urge to perfect things with its rich lifelike details.It tells us the story of a boy who loves to fix things with passion.. and told by a person who loves to tell new stories and push the boundary with that same passion. Don't miss this one, i wouldn't be shocked if HUGO eats up a major chunk of its Oscar nominations. and i really wish it all the best at it.."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","5","9","16 December 2011"," Movie magic, like it once was intended to be.
","At first I was not really sure what to think- and how to feel about this movie. Not beforehand but also still not afterward. It's an adventure movie that's lacking some real adventure and a family movie that probably isn't all that fun or entertaining to watch for the just entire family. Some people might even call it boring, I could imaging. But still there is something about this movie. Something magical. It's innocent, visually overwhelming and manages to come across as something fresh. This is pretty much how movies still were like, at its most early days. This movie gives you sort of that same sense and feeling of watching something totally new and innovative, for the very first time.<br/><br/>Actually, I was never all that interested in seeing this movie in the first place. I feared the worst for it. I mean, a family movie directed by Martin Scorsese? In 3D? With children as the main characters? It all sounds so unlikely but yet after watching it, it all makes perfectly sense and everything falls into place for this movie. <br/><br/>You could say that this movie is Scorsese's love song to cinema, in which he pays special homage to its earliest days and those who were involved with film-making at the time. And if there is one person who knows how to- and is justifiably allowed to this, it is Martin Scorsese. This guy has given so much to cinema, not only with his own movies but also by restoring and saving lots of old and cinematic historically important movies. He probably knows more about movies and the history of it than any other working movie director. Or perhaps better said; he understands movies better than anyone else!<br/><br/>To me, this is what made ""Hugo"" a very warm and heartfelt movie. I'm pretty sure that even when you don't really know how to feel about this movie, it still gives you a happy feeling regardless, that you just can't really explain. It's because of the magic of film-making, that Scorsese manages to put in this movie. Perhaps this is just a movie you shouldn't think to much about but simply let it come over and simply experience it for what it is. It's a movie that plays to all your senses and provokes lots of different emotions.<br/><br/>Especially visually this is one wonderful. Normally an $170,000,000 sounds like an absolute absurd thing but in this case, I'm glad they spend so much money on it! And it also shows all on the screen. The movie entirely recreates a certain time period and has a wonderful, warm, atmosphere to it as well. The sets are all grand and great looking ones and so are its special effects. No, this is not a science-fiction movie but it still is a movie that is heavy on its effects, which in this case is something the movie absolutely benefited from.<br/><br/>What I also liked about this movie was the way the story kept bouncing around. Most of the time you will have absolutely no idea what the direction the movie will be heading in, which makes the movie surprising, as well as original. It's best to simply go watch this movie, without knowing anything about it.<br/><br/>The kid actors Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Moretz do a good job at carrying almost the entire movie but lets please not forget about its adult cast. Call me weird but I got a kick out of it seeing Christopher Lee in a Scorsese movie (but then again, I always love seeing him, in anything!) and I also absolutely loved Ben Kingsley. And sorry but this is something I really have to say; Sacha Baron Cohen is an absolute comical genius. His role at first sight might come across like some lame and forced but he really manages to turn it into something absolutely hilarious. His comical timing- as well as his overall acting skills are brilliant in this movie and I'm happy to see him appear in more and more big movies and receiving all of the credits he deserves for it.<br/><br/>Now, I'll definitely admit that this is not a perfect movie. The way of storytelling and the story itself is still somewhat lacking, which doesn't always make this a throughout fun, entertaining or compelling movie to watch and you feel that the movie is still lacking a certain edge to it all. It's a warm and heartfelt movie but with a little bit better writing, the movie perhaps also could had been a good dramatic or emotional one. This was something, I felt, the movie was lacking. It's not always being a very open and inviting movie, that gets you involved with the story or its characters.<br/><br/>Other than that, this remains a great watch and a great example of how some great movie making can create movie magic, which it manages to do, by going back to the earliest days of cinema, when every movie experience was something new, overwhelming and joyous.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"OtherBrotherDarryl","9","5","9","1 December 2011"," If you love film, you will love Hugo
","Though it is based on a kid's book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, I have a hard time thinking of Hugo as a movie for kids. This isn't a movie that you scarf down like a Whopper or a Big Mac, it's a movie that you savor, that you relish, and much of that is due to what your eyes are witnessing. Breathtaking sets and masterful use of 3D draw you into the story, but I'm not sure that is enough to captivate children the age of the protagonist and title character, Hugo Cabret.<br/><br/>There's a key scene halfway through Hugo's journey where it is explained to him that there are just some things that he's too young to understand, and I can't help but wonder if that might be true of the audience at which this very mature, very visceral journey that Scorsese has painted for us is aimed. This film moves at a rather slow pace through the first half, if not 2/3rds of the tale, but the payoff is all the greater for it, assuming you're old enough to appreciate the history being portrayed. I imagine there are plenty of kids who have seen it already who were expecting something a bit faster paced and closer to what they are used to, and were disappointed. Most of them probably don't even realize that it's actually based on (loosely, but rather accurately at the same time!) the real life of Georges Méliès, who was known as the ""Cinemagician"" because he was, basically, the father of ""special effects."" <br/><br/>So wait, you might ask... Is this a film about a kid named Hugo, or about the early days of cinema? <br/><br/>It's both.<br/><br/>And it's wonderful. It truly is a love letter to cinemaphiles, and I'd rather not give away any more than that, because that's only slightly more than I knew going into it, and in my experience, the less I know about or expect from a movie, the more likely I am to enjoy it. Just know that you really should see it in 3D. I know people are tiring of it lately, but it really does play an integral role in this film, and if nothing else, your eyes will thank you."
"CaptMTS","9","5","9","27 November 2011"," Hugo is an Enchanting Film
","Hugo is an enchanting film that will dazzle the viewer with its beautiful scenes, real characters, and simple emotional story. This wonderful film reminds me of one of my favorite Italian films ""Cinema Paradiso"", as they both stir up strong emotions in a simple and beautiful way.<br/><br/>Hugo is an orphan who lives at a train station and cares for the station's clocks. Hugo is devoted to fixing a mechanical robot (an automaton), hoping for a message from his deceased father. Hugo steals from a toy shop owner, constantly dodges the train station policeman, and befriends a young girl. These characters become an important part of Hugo's life, as he works to uncover the mystery of the automaton.<br/><br/>I haven't been a big fan of 3-D technology, which has been disappointing in most films that I've seen in 3D. However, Hugo's 3-D effects are stunning and really make you feel part of the scenes. The director Martin Scorcese does a magical job with this 3-D medium in creating a visual masterpiece.<br/><br/>While billed as a children's movie, this film will be more appreciated by adults and older children. The story moves slowly, but, since the movie pulls you into Paris of many years ago, you don't even notice. Overall, Hugo is a wonderful and unique film that we'll be a rewarding movie experience."

Also there was a documentary part. even in the documentary no one died :(<br/><br/>please erase the movie."

","There are only seven or eight American directors now working who can be called true artists, visionary auteur's with a signature. They are Paul Thomas Anderson, Terrence Malick,Clint Eastwood, The Coen Brothers( who I treat at a single directorial intelligence), David Lynch, Steven Spielberg(despite his flaws), maybe Spike Jonze, and above all, Martin Scorsese. Martin has done four classic gangster movies, a (flawed) musical, documentaries, a brilliant, under-rated costume drama, two startling religious epics, two brilliant biopics about gifted, tormented men, a Hitchcockian thriller, and two superb black comedies, one of which ( After Hours) almost out-Lynches Lynch.). Admittedly, He has not yet done a War Movie or a Western. ( Though I would not count out either as possibilities.) Another genre he has not touched is the children's film. He has made two PG rated films, The Age Of Innocence and Kundun, but neither could be called a kids film. Now, Scorsese has made a children's film. Even more incredibly, he has made a 3-d children's film that is also a period film, and he has hit the ball out of the park. As a cinematic achievement- indeed,as a sheer feat of human imagination, Hugo can only be called superb. This film is an beautifully designed, shot and edited tribute to the innocence and imagination of childhood, AND a heart-felt love letter to the movies. Touching, funny and extraordinarily inspiring and redemptive, this is a masterpiece from a director who can only be called a god of the cinema. I will never forget Hugo."
"Kalki528491","9","6","12","23 November 2011"," My impression of the movie (midnight screening)
","This movie will definitely go down as a children's/family classic. I couldn't help but get the same vibe I used to get while watching family films from the 80s and 90s...something that has been missing in films IMO from 2000-2010 (as far as live action films go).<br/><br/>To be honest, this film felt like a very very good Spielberg film. I'm not a die hard fan who over analyzes Scorsese's work (meaning I don't know what his signature director ""trademarks"" art, or rather what filming techniques are unique to him), and if the film was credited to Spielberg I'd believe it. That's not to say Scorsese is a bad director. He's a living legend. This just happens to be virgin ground for him...directing and producing a children's/family movie. And the movie happens to be just as good/on par with, if not better than, a solid Spielberg film.<br/><br/>Best Picture winner? Maybe not, but will definitely be a nominee. There are a lot of independent films that have been released this year that will surely get recognized, and there still are a couple films yet to be released that will get recognized by the academy.<br/><br/>Best supporting actor nomination for Ben Kingsley? Definitely. Will he get his second Oscar? I hope so. He was fantastic in the movie and it's the only other role he's ever played other than Gandhi where he was totally dissolved into the character he was playing. In other films, perhaps it was bad writing or bad characters that didn't let him show his true potential as an actor. Or maybe I just haven't seen enough of his films. Regardless, this is the best I've seen him since Richard Attenborough's Gandhi.<br/><br/>Is the 3D worth it? Definitely, but only at decent modern theaters. I saw Tron Legacy at an older theater last year and the 3D there was just awful...images were blurry, dark, etc. I saw it first at an Imax Digital 3D theater and it was amazing (the 3D and the picture quality). At my local theater, which was renovated about 10+ years ago I believe, the image quality for Hugo in 3D was superb. Only the dark scenes were a bit off-putting, and only because for some reason my eyes were seeing both images separately instead of together as a stereoscopic image. Most of the movie is bright and colorful though which made the 3D very nice.<br/><br/>I don't suppose seeing this in 2D would hurt the overall experience though. But, the 3D in this film was very immersive. Similar to how Avatar was. Plus, it was filmed in 3D and is how the film was intended to be seen. Just to see the insides of a clock tower and train station in 3D is a real treat IMO.<br/><br/>Plot holes? Some early reviews I read suggested there was some, but I didn't catch any (or rather, I only noticed one and it was very very minor). The only thing that the film was lacking was a little more character development for the supporting and background actors, but they weren't major characters and weren't really that important to the story (since the story was focusing on Hugo and Ben Kingsley's characters almost entirely). There was one plot hole I suppose, but it doesn't really matter and isn't distracting. The plot hole involves Hugo's uncle, who appears in the first half of the film to be Hugo's guardian, the station's clock mechanic (who makes sure all the clocks are working properly and are on time), and an alcoholic. After he is introduced, he quickly vanishes from the film until the last half hour.<br/><br/>Is this film Scorsese's masterpiece? I don't know if I'd go that far, since it definitely isn't his best or most powerful film. But if you want to call it a ""family-film masterpiece"", and not Scorsese's best, then I'd agree with you.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen's character... Kind of weird seeing him in a family film considering his filmography, but he wasn't distracting and fit in well as comic-relief, sometimes villainous, and was believable as a quirky French train station officer.<br/><br/>I gave the film a solid 9/10. Not a perfect 10 because there were some flaws...but only in the character development (of supporting/minor characters).<br/><br/>ALSO! One thing I loved about the film was how there were a few short scenes and segments showing Hugo watching the people in the train station go about their daily routines. Many of these scenes almost looked as if they were re-enactments of old silent films...just as Sacha's character trying to sum up the courage to talk to a woman he likes, or an older man trying to woo a similarly aged woman but her dog doesn't like him and is hostile to him, the ridiculous chase sequence between Sacha and Hugo, etc. It's almost as if all the scenes in the film not directly related to the plot were montages (or homages) of silent film plots. And they were all pleasant and amusing to watch.<br/><br/>Anyway, go see this film. It's a very pleasant film. It also employs a lot of themes as well, probably the most prominent is the theme of honoring past filmmakers and preserving their work so they can survive the ages. The whole part about Ben Kingsley's character having made hundreds of films only to have burned all of his master copies to get extra cash, living his life believing that all of his life's work gone forever was just...well...sad and depressing. Even sadder is the fact that it's based on a true story.<br/><br/>All in all this is a very lovely film. Has a lot of charm to it. There is no doubt in my mind that it will go down as a classic."
"ofpsmith","10","4","7","9 February 2017"," A reminder of why I love movies in the first place.
","When I was 9 years old, I read The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. It was one of the major driving points that brought about my fascination with film. Although the movie was released in 2011 I didn't see it until much later. I have to say that Martin Scorsese was the perfect choice to direct this film owing to his own love of movie history. Hugo does not disappoint. With great acting all around, a faithful telling of the book, and a fantastic array of characters, Hugo is a terrific cinematic experience. Watching the story brought me back to days when I read the book, to when I made short movies with my friends, and to when I started my fixation on cinema. Not only a great movie but a reason why we love them."
"BringBackFear","10","4","7","13 December 2013"," A very artistic film.
","What an incredible movie! Through out the whole movie, I was going through the adventure with Hugo and felt all the emotions he felt.<br/><br/>Set in 1930s Paris, an orphan who lives in the walls of a train station is wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton.<br/><br/>This is a great story! Martin Scorsese did an outstanding job directing this film. The movie was artistic and the camera angles were unbelievably amazing.<br/><br/>The cast in the film was perfect. Each character in this film was completely different and well developed. I personally couldn't pick a better cast for this movie.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to anyone. It is a must see movie!"
"raphaklopper","10","4","7","15 April 2013"," Now I can say that Scorsece has made movies of almost all kinds.
","After ""The Departed""; ""Taxi Driver""; ""GoodFellas""; ""Raging Bull""; ""Gangs of New York""; ""Shutter Island"" ... I never thought that Martin Scorsese would make a movie like this, and what kind movie is? Well, read to the end and find out. <br/><br/>""Hugo"" tells the story of.... Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan boy who lives in a train station in Paris, his job is to make the station's clock always running. But while unraveling the mystery of the little ""robot"" that his father left him before he died. Until he met the mysterious toy seller (Ben Kingsley) that inadvertently shows have known anything about it. So Hugo embarks on a quest to find out this secret, which seems to be difficult with the station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) in pursuit of any ""offenses against the law."" <br/><br/>Throughout the movie this mystery increases with each passing minute, but nobody realizes that the John Logan (screenplay) always gives little hints of secret throughout the film. And when it comes, is a true wonder to who's watching because nobody was expecting that, although the tips are always there. With the secret many will say that the movie is really meaningless, and that is very childish. But no one sees how much this is awesome, a director who has always done adult films, and now makes his grand debut in 3D making a movie for the whole family. Managing to keep the entertainment of his films, and a impeccable 3D direction. And the secret might not impress much, but who is a lover of cinema (like me) will love it, because while it is for movie fans, it is also a tribute to the King of cinema Georges Méliès.<br/><br/>Even the cast impressed me, Ben Kingsley perfect as always and Asa Butterfield also excellent. But I was impressed with Chloë Grace and Sacha Baron Cohen, Chloe who was the Hit-Girl in ""Kick Ass,"" and Sacha who was Borat in ""Borat"", Bruno in ""Bruno"" and Dictator in ""The Dictator"". Both actors have been in completely different characters from the ones they are playing in here, well, this just proves that they are great actors. <br/><br/>I loved ""Hugo"" from beginning to end, had a great time and met the King of the 7th art in a fun and realistic way. A true tribute that gave many movie fans a chance to meet their King in such a fun and exciting way."
"lerochka-572-401309","10","4","7","2 February 2013"," Knew I was going to hate it
","My college dorm was watching the Oscars. Sweet, I thought - time to shine with my intellectual, high-end movie taste. Then the nominations came up; that's when the problems began. The Artist, War Horse, The Descendants - not only had I not seen the movies, I hadn't even heard of them. Well, I had seen Harry Potter and Transformers. That didn't make me especially proud. So there I sat sighing, as just a couple films separated me from elitist movie criticism.<br/><br/>With this year's Oscars coming up, I knew what I had to do. It was now or never: I had to catch up on last year.<br/><br/>To be honest, I was in the mood for a comedy. But work was work. And becoming a knowledgeable Oscar watcher somehow meant watching anything but a lighthearted comedy. Still, my mood for something funny and uplifting meant movies called The Descendents had to go immediately. The Artist - aka black and white 1930s-wannabe movie where the main actor (also won Actor Oscar, incidentally) speaks the grand total of 2 words - seemed like a bit too tough of a challenge. People said Midnight in Paris was good, but I wasn't dying to revisit the city whose people smirked at me when I bought the wrong baguette or wore shorts or wore something non-black/white/beige or spoke English or spoke French or did anything really. So that was out. That left me with Hugo. An adventure movie about a little boy, when I wanted a comedy about grown-ups. Tough luck. I hadn't even started it, and I knew I was going to hate it.<br/><br/>And then I loved it. The visual effects were amazing. I didn't watch the movie in 3D, but even in 2D I felt enveloped in the story, flying through clock towers and transported back in time to the 1930s. But these 1930s didn't seem old and grim like they often do in films - they were vibrant and mysterious.<br/><br/>The plot itself was very touching, albeit unrealistic. I found myself crying a couple times through the movie, and the relationship of Hugo with his father was depicted very sweetly. Hugo himself had beautiful eyes, and his friend Isabelle was very cute (reminded me of Hermione (young Emma Watson), because of the puffy curly hair and love for reading books!). All the actors played well, and you didn't feel for a second like you were watching rather than living the plot.<br/><br/>The thing I liked most about it, though, was that at its heart Hugo is a tribute to early filmmakers. People today are often caught up in glam, colorful Hollywood productions with one-stereotype characters and cotton candy sweet endings. True, we had the unrealistically happy ending here too, but we also learned about the history of the invention of film and black and white movies. It's not often that a your typical American would pass up some juicy reality TV to learn more about the early history of creating black and white, soundless movies. But thanks to this movie, we gained some real understanding and respect for these early pioneers of one of our favorite pastimes - and had the best of times while doing it."
"SaranshTMF","5","4","7","25 February 2012"," Dreams and imagination are often indescribable but not this time! Unfortunately an empty dream.
","story: Hugo is an orphan boy living in the walls of a train station in the 1930s in Paris. He fixes clocks and other gadgets as he learned to from his father and uncle. The only thing that he has left that connects him to his father is an automaton that doesn't work. Now here is the kind of film that divides the audience into two equal halves. The decision weather the film is good or bad depends completely on one's point of view. On one hand, it is something more than just a visual treat. It is film making at a whole new level (cinematography n vfx wise). this film is a craft that only an artist can understand. Whereas, on the other hand, it is an empty candy wrapper. It is void, null, blank, hollow and similar adjectives. Both are right according to their point of view !<br/><br/>Unfortunately, i fall in the 2nd category......the adventure which the movie screams about is non existent. Movie just goes on at a constant pace without an iota of fluctuation. film is catastrophic in the sense that almost entire film is shot in a train station(only a part of station), repeated loops of same imagery makes one feel nauseated. Main storyline is hardly of any interest. Its just plain dull. the character of HUGO and Isabella are unlikable and underdeveloped. they just lacks the punch. Its like gazing into an A4. In simple words 'it is boring as hell' ! For the storyline part, it is in 2 parts. (spoilers) 1st part is the first three lines of this review. 2nd part is about a depressed and broke film maker who want to forget about his past. Had the film is about only the 2nd part, i would have given it a 10/10 and maybe entitle it as a masterpiece. Trust me It was that good ! Apart from that, probably the best ever looking film i'v seen in last 3- 4 years. Visuals, art direction, cinematography -> every single frame is speechless stuff. It is beautiful! like an imagery which forms in your mind when you read a novel or a story book....something that can't be expressed practically. I can go on and on about it but that would only make this review long. best characters: station inspector and Georges melies(film maker). For me, it is epitome of beauty and i can't imagine a more beautiful movie than this one. I Bow before you Sir. Scorsese, you will always be the greatest director ever born on earth.Apart from that, as i said, It is an empty candy wrapper ! ps: went in with no expectations and presumptions. Unadulterated review !"
"ringaile-miliauskaite","9","4","7","22 February 2012"," Between fiction and the reality
","Hugo - a new film by Martin Scorsese, or should I say a new masterpiece by Scorsese? I still don't know the right answer to this question. After a few days have passed I still have a bit mixed feelings about this film and I still think about it a lot.<br/><br/>One thing for sure - it is a real 3D experience that you should not miss. The special effects are really well thought and give much impression to this film.<br/><br/>The story of this film is the other thing that gives you a lot of to think of. Originally the film is based on The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick (2007) but the story goes deeper than this. This story goes a bit further than the usual story for kids about a small boy searching for the reason of his existence and looking for a friends. This goes deeper into human psychology and to the history of film- making.<br/><br/>Summarizing all the above and much more that left unstated, do not expect it to be a simple movie for kids, expect and look for something more and you will definitely find it."
"kdnor2011","9","4","7","21 February 2012"," Beautiful and Touching
","Despite the fact that I am a huge movie buff, I actually haven't seen a lot of Martin Scorsses' films. I saw Shutter Island, which was good but far from perfect, and about twenty minutes of the Departed before I realized that I didn't care, skipped to the end and then shut it off. However his newest film Hugo is not a mystery, nor is it a thriller, it's a family film, and a damn good one.<br/><br/>If you have ever done anything creative, such as writing, painting, sculpting, and especially film, then you really should see this film. This follows the tale of a young boy named Hugo, who meets a girl who's grandfather used to be a film director. He was actually the first filmmaker to realize that movies don't have to just be moving images, they can be a way to make your dreams come alive. His most famous movie being ""A Trip to the Moon,"" you know that one with the rocket crashed into the moon that for some reason has a face. The film has a very well told story that is touching, funny, and even quite sad at times. And it is also beautiful, the cinematography is absolutely amazing and the lighting and special effects are very well handled.<br/><br/>Hugo is not a kids movie, it is a family film. There are no stupid jokes that cater to the lowest common denominator. The only real problem I had with the film was that at times it could get a little boring, but that doesn't stop the fact that this is a great film both technically and story wise."
"jordanbutler1996","8","4","7","18 February 2012"," Great Movie.
","I thought Hugo was a great movie! The camera angles, the picture, the acting, the set, the STORY ! everything was just awesome. I enjoyed the movie very much and would recommend it to everyone. I thought it was great how the story slowly and mysteriously unraveled as the movie went on and how the movie incorporated a bit of history in it. I also thought that seeing all the clockwork was awesome. All the gears moving together somehow made the movie so much more magical. In some parts I found myself with my eyes wide open and grabbing onto my hair from the tension. The two main, young actors did such a great job in portraying their characters and the small story lines on the side to do with the officer and the woman with the dog were also good :)"
"bmcd10","9","4","7","18 December 2011"," Hugo is THE quintessential family film.
","It is an atypical Scorsese as far as its appropriateness for all viewers, but it does not lack the quality of a typical Scorsese by any means. The story itself is fictional, but it is loosely centered around the true story of filmmaker George Melies. The story is brilliant, fun, poignant, and a little inspirational. That is thanks to its brilliant cast including spectacular performances from Kingsley, Butterfield, Moretz, and Cohen. With the exception of Kingsley's performance, they are not particularly Oscar-worthy; that's not to understate the good quality they do have, but rather to explain the lack of acting nominations this movie will receive. On the other hand, the film as a whole, in my humble opinion, is worthy of a win Best Picture at the Oscars. Even though it would be the first PG winner since 1986, I believe that its strength in quality and is traditional themes will make it able to get the conservative votes of the Academy. However, it will not win the Golden Globe Award; just wait and see. <br/><br/>Putting all that aside, this film was spectacularly made. It portrays the world in a mechanical perspective, revealing to us that we must be alive for some reason and that we are not just spare parts. Hugo (Butterfield) represents all people who have it rough and find their way to make their way in their world; he, like so many others, perseveres when all else seems to have failed. He holds onto the one thing left from his past to help him with his future because he doesn't know any other way. Hugo goes through what kids do not usually go through. He is forced to take care of himself and try to cope with his solitude. <br/><br/>Also, George Melies (Kingsley), or Papa George, is a has-been filmmaker, who quit his work of ""making dreams"" through film when tastes of the audience changed after the Great War. Many supposed him to have died, and he set to live the rest of his life as a ""penniless merchant"" at a train station in Paris. Then he meets Hugo . . . <br/><br/>The majority of the film takes place in the aforementioned train station where Hugo lives in the walls. The highlighted elements in the train station are the Station Inspector (Cohen), a florist, a café owner, a kiosk owner, and book shopkeeper. The miniature plots of these characters are woven seamlessly into the main plot of Hugo and Melies. Scorsese masterfully presents the stages of these plots together and leaves nothing behind.<br/><br/>I highly recommend that you most definitely see it."
"hvsteve1","9","4","7","16 December 2011"," You have to read the book
","The Selznick book is considered a modern children's classic. If you read it, you will see how it inspired the film. The opening paragraphs of the book are, almost word for word, the script for the opening scene of the camera soaring down from the sky into and through the railroad terminal. The book, itself, is a very unusual construct. Some pages have only a few sentences of text followed by pages that advance the story with nothing but drawings. Scorcese was very true to both the visual and textual style of the book.<br/><br/>The film, itself, is full of great film and stage actors in small rolls that are pure gems. There is more depth to the characters than in the typical family film.<br/><br/>As to the 3D, the director shows how it can add to the film without distracting from the art of telling a story. Some reviewers seem underwhelmed by the 3D because objects don't jump off the screen, but that's the point. It adds depth to the story, but does not drive the story. The scenes, especially those set among the clockworks, would look too busy and confusing without the 3D camera layering the moving objects. The Scorcese technique of following his actors down hallways, up staircases and through crowds becomes stunning with the 3D camera. If you want to know how good this 3D is, see it as I did, in a theater that used the opportunity of an audience with 3D glasses to precede the feature presentation with trailers for a half dozen current and upcoming 3D films. Watch those, then watch Hugo, and see how Scorcese has, as James Cameron has said, advanced the art of 3D beyond any place it has ever been."
"fatsamuraireviews","9","4","7","14 December 2011"," Huge win for Hugo
","I have not been a fan of 3D movies. They use the 3D technology as a gimmick and not as a part of the composition of the scenes. Hugo is a movie that does the opposite and makes it a component of each scene. This is a great example of how to use 3D as a device to transport the viewer to another place and time. This movie has a mystical setting that lends itself to the magic of filmmaking.<br/><br/>It really took me to places I was not expecting. This story is a homage to the visions of Georges Méliès who was the father of the art of storytelling in film. The Parisian train station setting and the era it took place gives it a feel more like big Broadway stage production. This is a green light film. It is purely and simply magical.<br/><br/>For more on this review go to http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/"
"tugce-tunalilar","6","4","7","10 December 2011"," Overrated
","I haven't read the book so I don't know how well it is based on the book, but I can comment on other things. <br/><br/>Overall, I think with an 8.5/10 it is quite overrated - I agree with the ones who wrote it before. I mean before seeing the movie, looking at IMDb and the trailer, I was expecting a very thrilling fantastic story with wonderful 3D effects. I was very pumped up before seeing the movie, but now I am a little bit disappointed. <br/><br/>The 3D effects were good, I am not knowledgeable enough to say that it is the best 3D so far but they were good, although sometimes my eyes were weary of them and I felt the need to take off my glasses and look at the screen with bare eyes. It might be because I was sitting at the front, pretty close to the screen, but still I found myself asking if the 3D is really necessary for this film. I mean it is a matter of choice, but I think it would do without the 3D as well. <br/><br/>The storyline did not contain many action scenes and failed to be very interesting for me at times. Seeing the trailer, I was expecting more of an action film, but it did not turn out to be. To be honest, one of my friends even fell asleep during the film. I was not bored as much as she was, but there were times where i thought the film was much too slow-paced. I think I wanted to see more action - and more magic, learning that George Melies was an illusionist. <br/><br/>I really liked the acting tho. Especially Hugo, Asa, was pretty successful as well as Isabelle -they were both pretty good at acting. Ben Kingsley - no words for him. <br/><br/>In addition, I really liked the juxtaposition of comical and dramatic elements of the movie, for example, especially the contrast between Sacha Baron Cohen's funniness and Asa's despair, in the scene while he was trying to run away from him - a scene towards the end of the film. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I think the film is a little bit overrated. Scoresese did a good job with the 3D, but the story was boring at times. A little bit more action would not hurt the film, and would actually make the 3D much more successful and useful for the film."
"zeetoddy","6","4","7","3 December 2011"," Has all the bells and whistles of a great movie, but doesn't deliver!
","Is it the story? No. Is it the actors? No. Is it the cinematography? No. Just what is it that makes this movie so hard to sit through or not take a little nap in? Well, I am not sure exactly, but to put it crudely: its just too long and boring. It is also a bit misleading. You are expecting something magical and more fantastical. You are expecting the clockwork man that Hugo finds to reveal perhaps something else and come alive. Yet, it never really does. Its very sad to come away with a feeling like that with so much substance and so many great performances. My advice is to rent it when it comes out on DVD when you have time to pause or stop it and make a snack or go to the bathroom. Its very hard to sit through. If you are thinking to take your child to it, forget it! This is an adults only movie because it is somewhat sophisticated and somewhat artsy...and yes, long and boring!"
"me-2736","1","7","15","6 March 2012"," Lacks (almost) everything
","I went to this movie with expectations (after all IMDb rated it at 8.0). Alas I did not read all the comments, my fault. Next time I will doubt IMDb ratings. The movie is quite long and the first three quarters far too slow. The last quarter, when the story finally completes and reveals itself for what it is (a tentatively poetic documentary about George Meliés, the famous movie-maker), is bearable, but only if you were out at the bar (three pints and a pack of peanuts would help) for the first three. The movie lacks acting, above all by the two protagonists (almost expressionless), I would save Kingsley and Baron Cohen. Dialogues are far too simple. I would suggest Scorsese to look in the dictionary for the word ""pace"", maybe he forgot about it. There is no construction of pathos, except for a few scenes at the end the movie is totally flat. Even the ""deus ex machina"" (literally), the automaton, who/which is the only character with an expression (!) and it has the (only, alas) role of keeping the link between all the characters in the movie is quickly discarded without much resentment."
"jjes1994","4","8","18","1 March 2012"," A long boring wait for something that never came.
","I came to watch this movie with low expectations but with hope that I would be wrong, I wasn't. I did not watch this in 3D but I am guessing from what it looks like in 2D it was pretty awesome; however despite the way the film appears it is just empty. The story keeps you waiting for the big revelation, why is the guy who works at the toy stall so sad? And when you find out why you realise you guessed it in a previous scene, there is no big revelation, there is only the appearance of one and that is just annoying, I spent over an hour waiting for something that should have been at least good but instead was just embarrassing for the old toy guy. Without including any spoilers his story was much less devastating than that of Hugo or even his Goddaughter and made his situation seem like a joke. The only reason I gave this film 4 out of 10 was because I thought Sacha Baron Cohen was funny and again the film looked good. Also (and yes I know this was a kids film) the acting was over the top and cheesy."
"jozzev","1","8","18","21 February 2012"," The most boring, lame, slow and predictable movie ever made
","I had great expectations of Hugo, especially in 3D. The critics were very positive, particularly about the 3D effects. Yes, the opening scene when the camera flies over Paris and through the train station is great. But there the greatness of the film ends. Why was this movie made in 3D? It doesn't add anything to it, there is hardly any difference would you see it in normal 2D, but above all: the movie is made for kids between 6 and 10 years old! For adults it is a torturing 2 hour sit, with absolutely no interesting twists to the story. It is so incredibly predictable, of the kind that is only seen in small children's movies. On top of that, it is painfully slow and boring. Also, the acting in general isn't bad, but the girl (Isabelle) is just terrible. Not believable at all, and over-dramatizing everything. Furthermore, I cannot stand the fact that in Paris everybody speaks traditions UK English... and the train hall inspector is a typical English character, again, in Paris??! All in all it was the worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I have seen more slow and boring movies of course, but this one topped them all because 1) the great critics it got and 2) it was so annoying that you could see exactly how this movie would roll out from minute 1 to last. 1 out of 10 stars, and only because I cannot give it zero stars."

","From the trailers I was very excited to see the movie with my 9 year old cousin (so was she). I could tell from the trailer she wouldn't be bored to tears and she would be able to understand the movie (with not wanting to see Christmas movies, and the other too inappropriate). Unfortunately the the entire time throughout the movie I wanted to close my eyes and take a nap. The story line in the beginning left me with numerous questions as to why an orphan boy was living in a clock tower, looked healthy as can be, didn't have very long hair, and had a smile of his face. ""Eh, it's a children's movie"" I'm thinking to myself. So I go along and it takes a while (about what seems to be 40 minutes) for these questions to be answered. As to why he looks so healthy and lively is probably because it's not exactly appropriate to show a sickly boy in a 'children's' movie. <br/><br/>As the movie progresses the story line seems to be pulled along by a train with no wheels. Hugo 'be-friends' a girl named, Isabelle. Isabelle is a bookworm as it seems and a the god-child of Georges (whom Hugo works for). Throughout I bare my eye open in knowing I'm going to have to have a reason as to why I disliked the movie so far. We learn Hugo has a 'metal manikin' and through the excitement of Hugo and Isabelle I assumed the 'manikin' would provide comfort to Hugo seeing as he only has Isabelle as a friend so far. I assumed it would get up and talk the way Hugo was so excited about it. No, it did not. <br/><br/>Moving past the way the movie moves so slowly I would like to address that this movie is NOT recommended by me to have a child who does not understand what Silent Movies are, why they have such a meaning to us, and what is reality and what is not. Though the first part is about Hugo and fixing this 'manikin' the second is about finding out why Georges is so upset about finding Hugo's notebook. Also, why (when Hugo fixes it that is) why 'manikin' drew a picture with Georges signature on it. The two friends find out that Georges created silent movies that opened the 'world's' eyes it seems to what could be made from movies. Entering dreams. They show some silent films made by Georges and they are great to see (as I, though only 15, have enjoyed). Younger kids may not understand this part of the movie so explanation maybe needed. <br/><br/>In one scene it seems that a train is going to hit Hugo while he on the tracks. The train is pulling into the station at a very fast speed (again, why? What trains pulls in at what seems to be 45mph?). The train hits Hugo and barrels through the station and eventually through the (what I think), the clock. Hugo wakes up in a panic. As this scene is going on a child behind me continually asks his mother an father what is going on. My cousin gives me a confused look and I'll know that later I'll have to explain. Turning back to the screen I see Hugo unbuttons his shirt to reveal he is made of clock work. Again, it is only a dream and again the child behind me asks because he doesn't understand. <br/><br/>In another scene Hugo actually jumps down on the tracks to get the 'manikin' that has fallen down there. At first I'm unsure as to why but eventually I realize that this is reality but I'm unsure whether Hugo knows that. The train is barreling down the tracks and nearly hits Hugo but the station 'officer' pulls Hugo to safety. In my opinion that isn't appropriate to a child who doesn't understand what is reality and what is not.<br/><br/>My final is that Hugo and Isabelle are children around the age of 11-13. From what Hugo does I would much rather have him be a 14 or 15 year old boy. He's outside a clock and one wrong move could send him down to his death. His knowledge and maturity does not fit him, nor Isabelle's no matter how bright she is. I assure you, I was not this smart when I was their age. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie bored me, I didn't find the trailer fitting to the age group, and deserved a 3 or 4."

The warmth and humanity of the drawing robot's performance put all the others to shame. The drawing robot must have been embarrassed to share the screen with Baron Cohen. Mechanical parts went round and round... and then the film turned away from the actors, to show us the insides of some clocks, instead.<br/><br/>It was a visually very busy film.

","This movie is visually stunning, even in 2D. The problem with it is that it can't make up its mind about what it is. This project seems like it was rushed. They really did not know whether this would be a movie about an orphan kid, about the history of cinema, about an automaton, or a character movie set in a train station. It tries to be all of these things, and it ends up being none of them. There are other problems as well. As others have commented, the British accent used by the actors makes no sense and ruins the suspension of disbelief. What is supposed to be the biggest enigma of the movie, the automaton, turns out to be entirely unnecessary and superfluous. The only redeeming part of the movie was its last 30 minutes, on the history of early movies, despite the fact that it came out of nowhere, being totally disconnected from the previous one hour and a half. In the end, it felt like a movie without a purpose."

","Before watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, I had previously watched many Martin Scorsese pictures that were violent or at least adult concerning subject matter. This one is meant for families but also offers something of a historical matter concerning the beginnings of the magic of the movies. As the young protagonists, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz provide a nice way to identify with their plight and Ben Kingsley is fine as the now-financially strapped magician/filmmaker Georges Melies who gets a reevaluation with their help and that of a chronologist, Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg), who happens to be his biggest fan. Anyone who appreciates film history and preservation should marvel at the way Scorsese shows various clips of many classic silent movies that get showcased here other than those of Melies like my wondrous reaction when a clip of Harold Lloyd's Safety Last (which I recently watched on YouTube) was shown when Hugo and Isabelle were sneaking into a cinema. All I'll say now is I highly recommend Hugo. Oh, and the 3-D imagery was great, too."
"LongDarkTeaTimeOfTheSoul","9","5","10","3 December 2011"," Magical -- an enchanting 3D film with real emotional depth
","Hugo is a film that enchants the heart and also captivates the mind. It tells its story interwoven with a fascinating history lesson about Georges Méliès, an innovative French filmmaker. It is as much a film for adults as it is children. When we discover the fate of many of Méliès' films, we feel genuine sadness for him after all his endeavours, and we really feel a sense of the freshness of film as a medium as it was then.<br/><br/>The images in Hugo are of course stunning! There is a real charm, beauty and inventiveness to this film, fitting, given that ""Méliès is sometimes referred to as the First ""Cinemagician"" (Wikipedia). <br/><br/>Ben Kingsly is a mesmerising presence as Georges Méliès, and Sacha Baron Cohen as the station inspector is also fabulous! There is a beautiful message in this film about what can happen when you allow yourself to heal and move forward in life. I came out of the cinema feeling inspired. <br/><br/>Hugo is a breath of fresh air, weaving together a narrative of broken machines and broken people and the beginning of their healing, through the actions of one small boy who stands up for what he believes in. <br/><br/>*****spoilers below!*****<br/><br/>As an addendum I wanted to add a comment in response to the people complaining that we don't get to see the automaton do very much, that the film builds a sense of expectation that is never fully realised. We don't *need* the added FX of seeing the automaton fly into action at the end of the film -- the magic has already been created in the healing journey for the central characters. Not only that, but what is left to the imagination often works far more powerfully than the actual images themselves ever could (we've just been conditioned by Hollywood into thinking otherwise). <br/><br/>For those who like a good, fast, action film, with lots of stuff getting blown up, you probably won't like this. But for anyone else, give it a try. This film is great sleight-of-hand by Scorsese, he builds us up believing something might happen with the automaton, and yet we suddenly see the story was really about something else far more important all along. *Do* take your children because if they can sit through this they mightn't be as willing to consume the tired, formulaic excuse for films that we get bombarded with nowadays."
"Quinoa1984","10","5","10","30 November 2011"," nothing less than marvelous
","Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Brian Selznick's inspired novel (which itself was like a pop-up-graphic-regular-novel hybrid, which is the first clue as to why 3D was appropriate) is in just one word: wonderful. It has a lot of drama to it, and not just because it deals with deceased fathers, or supposed deceased father figures, and yet the film also carries the wonder of invention, for things seemingly fantastical (an 'automaton' that is kind of like a robot only with a specific task to be carried out), and overtly fantastical as cinema and the process of invention itself. It ostensibly follows its young hero, Hugo Cabret (a very talented young actor Asa Butterfield), as he hides in the clock- tower of a train station in Paris circa 1933, and how he slowly bonds with a crotchety old shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley) via his much younger relative (Chloe Moretz), and a discovery is made about who this 'Papa Georges' really is. <br/><br/>Nothing less than beautiful as a ""kids"" movie (in quotes since it can be for anyone that just happens to have two kids as its main characters) and as an ode to film- how precious is it, how important artists are, and what the medium is possible for. In fact, this is what makes the 3D not only impressive - it is essential to the craft of the film; where usually 3D is a gimmick used for cheap effect, or when filmmakers don't understand proper visual spacial relations or what depth of field is, Scorsese and the superlative DP Robert Richardson does. Remarkably as well in scenes that showcase what 'Papa Georges' did with his film sets as the director Georges Melies created fantasy realms. <br/><br/>Scorsese is one of the only filmmakers - maybe, arguably, the ONLY filmmaker - to understand how to use 3D to his advantage with the space he has. As the man who coined the phrase ""Cinema is about what's in the frame and what's out"", he takes this gimmick - and it still is a gimmick - and gives it a kick in the ass. And yet it's not just the technique that's impressive here, it serves as the tool for the story, which is about something precious and dear: the old and the new, and being able to make room for both equally. <br/><br/>There are other factors that come into play as well, for why Georges Melies wasn't celebrated throughout time and space (and of course sound in cinema and WW1 did a lot for that), but it's really about how to find wonderment in art and life, how the two are more than compatible, they compliment each other. Art feeds life. And ultimately a filmmaker in his 60's like Scorsese connects strongly with the young hero, a figure who finds some comfort in the world of fantasy of the automaton and cinema, and in Papa Georges (not to mention the Michael Stuhlbarg character, who is a film preservationist in the days when film nitrate was the used to make women's shoes).<br/><br/>I also neglect to mention some other things in the film, such as Sacha Baron Cohen playing a quasi-bumbling police officer at the train station who with his big dog has a penchant for carting off stray kids to the orphanage. His parts are the stuff of the ""B-plotline"", but it's still entertaining stuff, and gives a little time to spare between the tragedy that is Hugo's early life (the death of his father played by Jude Law) and the tragedy of Papa Georges' life (when Stuhlbarg shows the surviving film reels to Hugo and others, it's a bittersweet, touching moment, so rare in films these days in general). <br/><br/>Overall, it turns into a magical *cinematic* experience, and a deeply emotional one. Thankfully amid the clock-towers and sweeping crane shots and the (swoon) dream-within-dream sequences, there's heart and human beings, and one of Ben Kingsley's most affecting performances in years. There's spectacle in the vision, grace in the action set-pieces (few but significant as they are), and the colors rich and textured in grades of blue, green, red, gold and white. Go see this one."

","The plot uses 90% of the time to show meaningless actions, and 10% to make absurd and unbelievable leaps in the storyline. There are plot holes (train going full speed to dead end!) and unexplained vital plot points left and right, and all the steps taken seem forced and harsh. Some characters weren't developed at all. It was never explained why Hugo's father had that robot thingy. They didn't even explain how he died. Hugo isn't the main character, by the way. He is just a storytelling device that goes around making stuff happen, with very little development, while the person on the spotlight does very little and has a magical change of heart nearing the end of the movie. Not unlike every other character present, of course. Oh, and whoever Hugo's actor was, he did a terrible job. The sidekick that goes around with him magically becomes best buddies with some random person who threw rocks at her house. Oh, and whoever that girl's actor was, she did a terrible job. The humor is very rare, and cruel when it is there. What I'm trying to tell is that the plot is terrible and the storyline is slow, slow, SLOW. Go to the bathroom and I doubt you'll lose anything important.<br/><br/>The 3D effects are acceptable, but poorly used. The only moment you'll really care about it is when there is snow coming at you. Whee! But in all seriousness, layers are very noticeable during certain scenes.

","Martin Scorsese directs ""Hugo"", a film based on Brian Selznick's ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"".<br/><br/>A giant metaphor for Scorsese's love for cinema, ""Hugo"" stars Asa Butterfield as Hugo, an abandoned kid who discovers that Georges Melies, the famous pioneer and film-maker, is ""not really dead"". Melies' career, we later learn, was a career of ""wonder"", ""magic"" and ""enchantment"", but one which was nevertheless ""killed off"" by the ""violence"" and ""realism"" of Europe's many protracted wars. Reality and blunt violence, then, supplanted the magic and innocence of Melies, a magic which Hugo symbolically reanimates, thereby resuscitating cinema. For Scorsese, cinema lives, cannot be killed and is periodically reinvigorated by the mix of technical wizardry, nostalgia and youthful longing which Hugo represents. ""I'm fixed now!"" characters state throughout ""Hugo"", a nod to a cinema which heals, enchants and fills hearts with love! That a 170 million dollar, CGI suffused, archaically scripted 3D movie directed by a guy who uses violence like piano keys is simultaneously championing the cause of cinematic revolution, film preservation, innocence and the charms of 19th century silent films, is an irony completely lost on Scorsese.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" is at its best when it's mapping the nooks and crannies of the giant train station in which Hugo lives. Scorsese also paints a number of nice early 20th century buildings and promenades, though bad CGI lighting, digital matte paintings and excessive green screens occasionally hamper things; the film awkwardly juggles realism and high fantasy, and Scorsese's many CGI assisted long takes are less impressive than he realises. Beyond this the film contains a number of homages to early cinema (Keaton, Chaplin, Lang, the Lumiere Brothers, Renoir's ""The Beast"" etc), though modern audiences raised on touchpads and Wi-Fi will have no time for this. Nostalgia today goes only as far back as an internet browser refresh tab.<br/><br/>Some have criticised ""Hugo's"" happy ending, but such an ending is in keeping with the film's resurrection project. Ironically, the real Melies was forced into bankruptcy by the French and American studio systems, forces which pushed him into become a toy salesman in a train station. This is itself the fate of most post-war film-makers, including Scorsese, most eventually warped into unwitting toy pushers.<br/><br/>Everything ""Hugo"" does, Scorsese would do better with ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies"". Elswhere the film's many shots of kids scampering behind walls and woodwork recalls Hiromasa Yonebayashis superior ""Arrietty"", whilst its themes and metaphors pale next to the recent ""Ratatouille"", Brad Bird's kid-friendly examination of art, artists (also hiding behind woodwork) and their social function, good or bad.<br/><br/>Incidentally, love-letters to cinema tend to either celebrate the camaraderie of film-making (""Bowfinger"", ""Ed Wood"", ""A Prairie Home Companion"", ""Limelight""), or critique the tawdriness of the audience's relationship with the screen (""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", ""Contempt"", ""Phantom of the Paradise"", Cronenberg, Lynch etc). Others (""Cinema Paradiso"") celebrate both the screen's powers of illusion and its ability to immortalise precious moments. ""Hugo"" exists in none of these camps. It's emblematic of a bad romance, big, blunt and intent on bludgeoning its audience into submission.<br/><br/>5/10 – Worth one viewing."

","Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan living in the walls of a train station, in 1930s Paris. He becomes embroiled in a mystery involving his dead father, an automaton, and the enigmatic Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley).<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of 3D – in fact, I hate it. I'm yet to see a movie that does the format justice but, admittedly, Hugo comes pretty bloody close. What sets 'Hugo' apart from other 3D movies, and one of the reasons I enjoyed it, is that it's a 3D movie about 3D movies. It therefore allows the filmmakers artistic license, and makes the format more acceptable.<br/><br/>But that's what happens when Martin Scorsese makes a film – the man is a certified genius, who knows how to get the best out of what he's working with. We all know he can do it with the actors, we know he can do it with genres, now he does it with 3D. And the truth is that, as good as everything else about this movie is (and there's a lot of good), the best thing about this film is the visuals. From start to finish, 'Hugo' looks spectacular. The opening scene, as we see the camera 'zoom' through Paris to the intricacies of the train station is breathtaking, and it retains that high standard throughout.<br/><br/>It's also helped by the fact that the cast is full of incredible actors. From the young leads to the elder statesmen, everyone chips in with stellar performances. Asa Butterfield is a great choice for the lead actor, and Chloe Moretz does a very decent job with her English accent. That girl is gonna be a huge star when she's older, and will thoroughly deserve it. Not much needs to be said about Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee and Ray Winstone and Helen McCrory, and all the other veterans. They're good, we know. Sacha Cohen is a revelation, though. He is fantastic as the Station Inspector.<br/><br/>'Hugo' deserved all the awards that it won – it's a fantastic film and I loved watching it.

"donuthaters12","9","3","5","24 July 2013"," Scorsese's Love For Cinema
","Hugo is a family film directed by Martin Scorsese. Hugo is an odd film for Scorsese to do as most of his films are much more mature, dark, and at times violent. Though different from his acclaimed films, it's damn entertaining.<br/><br/>I have seen a few of John Logan's screenplays, some are OK (The Last Samurai) and some are near perfect (Gladiator). Hugo would be at the same level as Gladiator for me. This film is adapted from Brian Selznick's novel entitled ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"". This film is fun from start to finish, as it's an adventure film while at the same time a message saying that films from the past are important and in need to be preserved. The children may not care so much about the latter but just on the adventure alone makes this one hell of an experience. It's main focus is on Hugo but the times where it focuses on the other people from the train station, it's just as interesting. Being a children's film, sometimes the dialogue can be a little bit cheesy and it's present in this film but only minimally. The film's plot is easy to swallow and can be enjoyed by both children and adults.<br/><br/>Like I said, this is an odd turn for Scorsese but he still delivers. Scorsese has created something magical, using a story that also relates to his passion for films. A certain flashback sequence on Hugo reminds me of the same love and passion that Scorsese put on the Hell's Angels production scenes from The Aviator. Scorsese has also opened my eyes on the beauty of the distant era of cinema and it's beginnings.<br/><br/>The film is gorgeous from start to finish. Scorsese and Robert Richardson have captured the beauty of 1930s Paris and the train station that the film is set in. Richardson has created a magical, almost fantasy like image of Paris and definitely makes the film feel more like a pleasant dream. The beautiful imagery is supported with a wonderful use of visual effects, making the film feel more realistic but at the same time not losing that touch of magic and fantasy that makes the film so pretty. Richardson has, again, shot a period piece that brings out the beauty of an era that once was.<br/><br/>Howard Shore has done it again with Hugo, created a wonderful score that aids in putting the audience in this fascinating world and era, similar to what he did for The Aviator and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings saga. His score here is more enlightening but without making it sound cliché or familiar.<br/><br/>I love seeing films with child actors that do not bring down the quality of the film. Both Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz gave strong performances that was at par with great actors like Ben Kingsley and Jude Law. I think both are going to have a very memorable career, so far Moretz is showing a lot of promise. Ben Kingsley as the toy maker was great and sweet, while Sacha Baron Cohen stole the scene when he comes on as his comedic delivery is fantastic. When he is on screen he is either doing something funny or showing vulnerability, which is very rare in his own films. Cohen has great chemistry with Emily Mortimer, who needed a little bit more screen time to make their relationships more empathetic but doing so may retract from the point of the film, nevertheless it's entertaining. Jude Law, Michael Stuhlbarg and Christopher Lee had minor roles but their presence makes the film all the more entertaining. Scorsese has a great cast that many other filmmakers would envy.<br/><br/>I came into the film thinking it may be not hold my interest as family friendly films don't really impress me as it is sometimes clouded by it's own restrictions and would generally end up being only a guilty pleasure or a holiday tradition film for me. Hugo is something I could watch over and over again as it is a love letter to cinema."

","Martin Scorsese is a magician who loves making movies, and each and every minute of Hugo is a testament to this; with his arms outstretched, he invites us to be hypnotized by his timeless creation, a cinematic ode to films – a medium that shall carry on so long as we dream, so long as our spirit for adventure doesn't die and our purpose of life remains strong. <br/><br/>Broken is the life of Georges Méliès, a man, a magician celebrated once for his innovative contributions to film, and only can Hugo Cabret being back happiness to his defeated existence; it is Scorsese who colors their lives with wit, with charm, with humor, with a tinge of sadness but most importantly, with hope. <br/><br/>Hugo is a visually brilliant film, a Scorsese's vision of Paris, and you soon fall in love with its characters, their lives, their desires, their dreams. It is an ode to cinema, and yet it remains entirely Scorsese's and that is what makes it new and fresh.<br/><br/>'Time is everything' chimes Hugo's uncle Claude, a drunken lout, as he brings Hugo to train station Gare Montparnasse's clock-tower where he mends clocks; Hugo's father has just died in a fire accident, and his son, now orphaned, is taught by Uncle Claude how to mend clocks. We see of Uncle Claude no more, its only Hugo and his little, secret life inside the enormous castle of a clock-tower. Scorsese opens the film with turning clock wheels dissolving into Parisian streets, then gives us a scintillating glimpse of Paris like we've never seen before, before taking us down to Gare Montparnasse station, moving along the station life and rising to the clock face but closing in near number five, where we see finally see Hugo's eyes.<br/><br/>Hugo controls time, the station time to be exact, and so long as the clock functions fine, he remains safe. His only hurdle outside is the station inspector, a hard-hearted monomaniac whose sole purpose is to catch hold of orphaned children loitering in the station and send them off to orphanage. Through the dial, he watches the movement outside – the amusing courtship between café owner Madame Emile and newsstand owner Monsieur Frick, flower lady Lisette's morning greetings to passersby, the station-master's watchful eye and toymaker Georges' tiny shop. He's particularly keen about Georges' shop because he steals toy parts whenever Georges dozes off to sleep; he needs these parts to fix 'Automaton', a mechanical man Hugo's father left behind unrepaired. Automaton, when fixed, will write down something and Hugo believes it would be a message from his late father.<br/><br/>But while attempting to steal some parts one day, he's caught by Georges. The toymaker threatens to alert the station-inspector unless Hugo reveals to him why he is stealing toy parts. When Hugo remains defiantly silent, Georges peruses the diary he's holding and mysteriously utters 'Ghosts!' before taking away the diary from him and declaring to burn it. Before Hugo can persuade him to return the diary, the station-inspector Gustave and his Doberman Pinscher give him a chase. Hugo escapes, but now has to find a way to get the diary back; he follows Georges to his home one day and beckons his goddaughter Isabelle to meet him. <br/><br/>The two little explorers embark on an adventure to get the book back and find the key that would make Automaton work. In doing so, they discover something they'd never even dreamed of – toymaker and Isabelle's godparent Georges is the man behind pioneering movies like 'A Trip to the Moon'; yes, he is indeed THE Georges Méliès, but he's defeated and lost all his former glory. And he's dead, according to Rene Tabard's book on film history, but that's until Rene meets Hugo and Isabelle in the public library, and things soon begin to change, for everyone. <br/><br/>Along the way, we learn how cinema began and just how important it was for the makers. Even today, you have filmmakers complaining that the glory days of film are over. Even Scorsese's film, as good as a film can get, still could hardly match up to collections of the Transformers movie released in the same year. The truth is, so long as you have love what you're doing and haven't lost the burning desire to do it, you'll live a happy life and be proud of what you've accomplished. And Scorsese should take a bow for creating Hugo. <br/><br/>Wouldn't have been such a delight without its wonderful cast – Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, who are expressive and believable, especially Moretz. The wrong casting would've made Hugo and Isabelle snotty and annoyingly precocious children, but Asa and Chloe play it right. Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic delight as Gustave while Ben Kingsley is convincing as the crabby Georges and touching in his later scenes. The DVD comes with a special feature that includes the making of Hugo, and you get a good insight on what these actors felt working with a man, a magician like Scorsese who loves making movies.<br/><br/>More on sashankkini.wordpress.com/‎"

","For me the rebirth of cinema in 3D, the moment when the technology met with art is not 'Avatar' but Scorsese's 'Hugo'. James Cameron's film validated the technology, brought it into the mainstream, and – of course – made a lot of money in the process. Hugo is in my opinion the first great film realized in this technology, taking a rather melodramatic story targeting the all family audiences and using 3D to amplify the visual effects, to create a world of dreams and fantasy – the material great films are made from. Based on the Paris of the 1920th it recreates the city on screen in a manner that is spectacular and sensitive at the same time, and populates it with characters who meld the qualities of fiction heroes and flesh and blood humans. The complexity of the staging, the attention to the details, the pace of the action and of the moves of the camera, the world of objects who surround the heroes – all this get together in a charming visual experience. We have known many versions of Paris in art, some from books like (Victor) Hugo, some from photos like the ones of Brassai or Robert Doisneau, some from works of art like the paintings of the Impressionist era, now we have the Paris as imagined by Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Bringing George Melies into the story is a real touch of genius.This film is a love declaration for cinema, full of respect and quotes from famous movies. The comparison with the other big film about cinema in 2011 The Artist is immediate and makes us forget immediately the simplistic kiddish story. But the story itself has a quality that makes jealous the current Disney productions. This is real Disney stuff, the one that would not make Master Walt blush as would the majority if not all the scripts of the films made by the studios who inherited his name. This is the Disney of Fantasia, the one that made me dream and cross the barriers of imagination.<br/><br/>George Melies actually did break with the studios and retired from film making before the war, and many of his films were destroyed to be used to manufacture military materials. He had a shop in the Montparnasse train station, and even if a round-eyed boy who was making the clocks turn in the station did not really exist – the imagined part of the story is as good and as moving as the real one.<br/><br/>A film like Hugo does not necessarily excel in acting, although big names show up in the cast and do more than a decent job. Ben Kingsley adds George Melies to the gallery of the great personalities he brought to life in his screen career, and Sacha Baron Cohen proves that he can be funny also out of his usual stand-up comedy style. It is however the complex and beautiful world in which the characters move will be the one that we shall remember from this film."
"Alcaminhante","9","3","5","9 July 2012"," If you like Carlos Ruiz Zafon , ""The Shadow of the Wind"" novel, you'll love this movie !
","If you're reading my review, either you know of Carlos Zafon's books and you are compelled by my reference or you haven't got a clue of what am i talking about and so you're curious to see why i posted a title like that.<br/><br/>If you know of Carlos Zafon's books and you're still here reading this, chances are that you absolutely loved his novels such as ""The Shadow of the Wind""',""Angel's Game"" and ""Marina"", at the most.<br/><br/>So...if just by me mentioning Zafon's ""The Shadow of the Wind"" is enough for you to recall that haunted, poetic and beautiful atmosphere from his books, well strangely enough it's all here exactly like that in this Scorcese movie !  Because...Watching Hugo is like reading the Carlos Ruiz Zafon book he never wrote but could have written and this is very hard to explain to people who haven't experienced this film knowing about novels like ""The Shadow of the Wind"". <br/><br/>The way the plot feels almost non existent if you're expecting it to be like a typical Hollywood movie where everything has to be explained , defined and mixed with action scenes every ten minutes. The way it creates a magical world based on real places as Scorcese does with Paris in the movie what Zafon does it with Barcelona in his novels. The way characters are all weaved into the atmosphere of the place and although their stories don't need to touch they are all part of the same magical universe, which has magic without the need to have traditional fairytale or fantasy stuff in. Christopher Lee in this movie plays exactly the same character you can find in Zafons novel , The Shadow of the Wind as the secret library book keeper!! <br/><br/>So what does this all mean if you're just a casual movie goer, don't like to read and you're expecting Hugo to be like a typical action packed fantasy movie for kids ?... Well , it isn't, you've been fooled by the trailer and Hugo is not the new Harry Potter. Deal with it ! By saying this i really cannot believe that so many people attack Hugo here in IMDb, mostly because they though the trailer mislead them. You're fooled, so what ? Why throw your anger at the movie because some wise guy at the marketing department sold it as something that is not ? Why cant these angry reviewers just try to enjoy this movie for what it is ?! A fantastic but most of all - a different (!!) Hollywood movie coming out of studios that usually just throw another brainless Transformer (or clone) at you every other weekend.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with the plot in Hugo. It's simple but its incredibly well done and contrary to what some bad reviews said, it was a joy to follow the (obvious) mystery, because the magic in this movie was not in th mystery or in he suspense scenes (much less in the action scenes) , but in the general ensemble final atmosphere that every little piece of the visual puzzle created. Sets, characters, world and love for the cinema. Also, i didn't think this is a movie for kids, or at least its not a kids movie for sure. Its just a movie with kids in it ! And probably one of the best and most beautiful looking movies i ever seen. If you like illustration or you're an illustrator you'll love this film to death. Its a visual steam-punk masterpiece.<br/><br/>Contrary to what some other reviewers felt, personally, i cannot compare it to Cinema Paradiso because for me the real footage from Meliés movies didn't affected me at all with the same dramatic punch Tornatore's movie did at the end and so to me if there was something missing from Hugo was a bit of emotion and also character development because in some parts of the movie i wanted to see more of the many characters and little stories but they're never fully developed.  But i liked the little touches, i was captivated by the small glimpses of love-stories and really liked Sacha Baron Choen character which to me is really the heart of the movie in a strange kind of way that maybe shouldn't have been like that.<br/><br/>Overall i think this is a fantastic and unique movie and one of the best American love letters to cinema I've ever seen. I wished it could be as emotional as Cinema Paradiso but it isn't and that is the only reason i don't give it ten stars. Otherwise its brilliant, poetic and beautiful in more than one way. <br/><br/>Although i agree a little bit with people who said the documentary style stuff stalls the plot and makes some parts of Hugo seem like they belong in a different movie. I agree that was not a good choice by Scorcese and to me th repetition of those bits in the second half of the story really toned down the dramatic effect and shouldn't have been done like that at all.   The way the real footage was inserted felt too intrusive and split the movie in pieces for too many seconds several times when it needed to create more empathy with the audience and the characters. Anyway... If you don't go into it expecting the usual Hollywood crap blockbuster you'll enjoy the way the story is weaved. Above all if you like books and have a passion for cinema you wont forget Hugo so soon."
"habstervillage","9","3","5","3 July 2012"," Great movie
","I just watched Hugo,and in one word: Beautiful. It's a long time ago that a film actually inspired and touched me. The movie has deapful meanings in it, in one scene Hugo says: ""I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine. Machines never come with any extra parts, you know. They always come with the exact amount they need. So I figured, if the entire world was one big machine, I couldn't be an extra part. I had to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason, too."" <br/><br/>This part of the movie truly touched me. There are a lot more quotes like this. As this is a kids movie, I think kids won't understand these deapful meanings. But adults will enjoy them.<br/><br/>The casting was done perfectly! I really fel in love with the main lead, Asa Butterfield, and I'm planning on watching more movies of him. His acting was very natural, and sometimes you couldn't see he was acting! It was like he was experiencing it at the exact same moment. The girl, Chloë Grace Moretz, is perfect for the role of the girl Isabelle. They work perfectly together and you can see the magic between them. They made the stationchef the comedian in the movie, and I liked it. He gives the movie a comic tone, so it's not all sad (because he lost his father and uncle), but also funny to watch at moments.<br/><br/>The sets, the music,.. everything was wonderful! But I missed something in the story. Therefore: 9/10. I would recommend to watch this movie to everyone! You truly will enjoy it."
"TooDrunkToWalk","8","3","5","6 May 2012"," A very immersing movie, with a touch of mystery about it
","I must say, I found the movie to be very gripping and this in one movie, where the plot seemingly twists from direction to another direction gradually, but not in one moment but very slowly and when the movie ends you realise the movie was not at all about what you were thinking about, but something else entirely. There is no one moment, where this plot twist happens its generally over the course of the movie that the question presented to you near the start of the movie, is not the pivotal question, even though at the start it appears to be.<br/><br/>There is a hint of mystery hanging over the movie throughout, and gradually the layers are peeled off, but far from things becoming clear they become more tangled up and then the movie takes its own turn, and things become more clear, and then the movie ends.<br/><br/>Many questions remain unanswered, and normally in 95 out of 100 movies when this happens, the movie is a disappointment. Not with Hugo though, it is one of those movies, where these questions remaining unanswered, is one of those times where you joyfully realise, that you were asking the wrong questions and more importantly that you focused too much on these questions to understand that the movie had taken a rather interesting turn, and the person who you thought to be the protagonist, at the start, while still a very important character, is not who the movie is about, but another person has very silently and unnoticeably stepped into his shoes.<br/><br/>It is a very satisfying movie from that point of view. Oh and those unanswered questions, are not really unanswered, just that the movie never expressly answers them. Once the movie, ends you only need to think back to those unanswered questions and you will find answers to them, just that they are a lot simpler than you thought they would be.<br/><br/>A good movie experience all along."

","Hugo is a story about an orphan boy who lives at Paris Montparnasse Station's platform and work in a clock tower of the platform. Based on a novel ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" by Brian Selznick.<br/><br/>After death of Hugo's father in a fire at the museum, his uncle takes him to a big clock at station where he used to maintain the working of clock. After teaching all the work Hugo's uncle left him alone there and did not return later he is found dead. For living Hugo used to steal foods from the station, and he also steals mechanical parts from a Toy Store to complete his father's Automaton (Mechanical Robot) which is not working and his father wants to repair it as his father is a watchmaker.<br/><br/>One day Hugo is caught by Toy Store owner and Store owner took notebook of Hugo in which working of the Automaton is written. Hugo follows the shop owner in seek of his notebook then he met to Isabelle, granddaughter of Store Owner, who promise to help Hugo. <br/><br/>Later Hugo fix the Automaton then Hugo and Isabelle tragically came to know that Store Owner is, a great director of early movies, known as Georges Melies.<br/><br/>First time I saw this movie then I thought if this movie would made in 3D it would be a great movie because I love the scenery, camera work and cinematography that are awesome, later I came to know that movie was made in 3D.<br/><br/>Entire movie is a great work of camera, cinematography and photography. Visual effects are too good and sound effects are also good. Acting, directing and editing is also beautiful. Everything is well balanced. Hugo had won several Oscar, Bafta and Academy awards also. I love this adventure drama film. Total entertainment for a entire family. Watch this on Sunday with family everyone appreciate your choice."

","Wonderful, wide-eyed, sentimental adventures through the eyes of an imaginative child. With a root premise ripped from the pages of industrial-era kids' stories, it's innocent and magical but also grounded, stretching reality like the best fairy tales. Though the plot is routinely jabbing in unexpected new directions, it's all done with a purpose and everything comes together beautifully in time for the closing credits. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz are appropriately doe-eyed and rambunctious youths, Ben Kingsley brings a perfect amount of hidden warmth to the role of the stern, icy toy shop owner with a secret, and Sacha Baron Cohen shows surprising versatility in his turn as the persistent, bumbling train station officer. Spectacular visuals, passionate storytelling and expert direction make this kids' movie suitable for all ages, even if it does drag for a stretch in the second act."

","I just rented this movie on amazon and set aside two hours to watch this, and I'm in love with it.<br/><br/>This movie is both great in general terms and in a personal touch. I am a big fan of movies, I like the movie-going experience, and I am also an adventurer, so in that regard, this movie touched my heart. Hugo is a boy who used to work with his father fixing clocks and tweaking other sorts of gadgetry. When his dad passes away, Hugo keeps on working on his dad's last project, an automaton that is missing a key to make it work again. This makes me curious about simpler times (1930's), in a culture where people were more polite, well-dressed, well-mannered, and a young boy could learn how to work with machines just by following his dad's footsteps. What is it about France that makes movies so classy and great? (The Artist and Midnight in Paris were nominated for best picture, along with this).<br/><br/>One of my favorite aspects of this movie is how much it looks and feels like a book adaptation. I could point out some scenes and parts that could be analyzed and interpreted in different ways like Shakespeare literature. For example, when the actor tells a young Rene Tabard that dreams come from movies, it made me pay attention to how the movie was showing some scenes that were dream-like, like when the train derails and crashes through the station and out the window in to the street in Hugo's dream. I also thought the parts with the dogs and their owners and the train inspector's love interest were an example of old style movies, in the sense that they were not 2 hour long videos like today, but rather short scenes and skits that, when composed together, told a simple story, like ""Trip To The Moon"".<br/><br/>And then there's the score. Oh man, I am in love with the score that plays in both happy moments and sad moments and work perfectly. Overall, a great experience, my only regret is not watching it on the big screen, in 3D."

I didn't read any of the critics or seen the rating at IMDb.com but I say the movie was magic.

It is the sort of film that you sit down to watch and shouldn't expect to stand up from till it's all over.<br/><br/>Every character felt real and true to me, I never felt like there was a glitch in the acting or how the characters were portrayed. Hugo as the orphan tinkering mechanic, Georges as the bitter old man who has a past he doesn't want to talk about and Isabelle the adventurer who is the one real friend in the short life of Hugo.<br/><br/>Even Sacha Baron Cohen surprised me in this film but I've never been a great fan of his ""work"" but here he actually portrayed some talent. It wasn't all fun and games with him, perhaps he will take on more serious roles in the future as this performance was something I'd never have expected from him.<br/><br/>Even tho this film is mainly portrayed in the ways of Oliver, the sad little orphan that does as good as he can of what he's got, it has more meat on its bones than that. It was beautifully sweet and sad.

The simplicity of it is amazing, yet you feel completely immersed and attached to all the characters. Some people complain that the movie is too long, but this is as long as it needs to be. It's a feel good movie, one that'll leave you smiling and amazed. It's probably too in depth for a child's movie, regardless of the PG rating. This is a movie for people who love movies. It explores how movies make us feel. ""Movies are our special place. Where we can go and dream in the middle of the day."" It's about cinema, how it has evolved into this amazing art the world enjoys. It might start a little slow, but once it picks up its phenomenal. The two main kids, are probably the best child actors I've ever seen. They each have so much to like, they both cry, both get angry, and both dream. Ben Kingsley, as usual, does a very good job as his character. The entire cast really, it's something special. The setting is easily believable and has very good special effects throughout this film.

","And clock machines too. This beautiful movie develops itself in and around a Parisian railway station in the twenties of last century where a small boy named Hugo is in charge of all the station complicated clocks since when his father died. His drunken uncle was the one in charge of that job and when he assumed the boy's guardianship put him to take care of the clocks huge mechanisms while he estranged himself for good to devote himself to drink and laziness. Nobody seemed to take notice of this and the boy could survive alone on petty thefts and some vagrancy. The boy however had an innate talent for mechanics and was trying to repair a strange automaton his father had left and was abandoned in the museum where the latter worked before dying. The boy's petty thefts lead himself to enter in contact with an old man who owned a toy shop (first in bad terms because the old man was also object of the boy's thefts) and his pupil girl approximately the boy's age. Between the two children a friendly relationship takes place and they began an adventurous life together in default of the girl's guardian who later was known to be the famous silent movies maker Georges Méliès who by that time had fallen into oblivion. All this is told in gorgeous images and sceneries reproducing faithfully the epoch in question and many moving scenes till the final climax which is also very moving in sentimental terms.

"gradyharp","7","3","5","29 February 2012"," ""Come away and dream with me""
","HUGO is a strange film. It purports to be for children despite the fact that the screenplay written by Josh Logan based of the book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick has more references to words and people and events that children would not relate to on the same level as adults. It is a spectacle in the order of director Martin Scorsese with some of the most beautiful contraptions and mechanical wonders ever filmed. It seems in many ways to be an homage to the history of filmmaking in the manner in which the rather disjointed story is presented. Likely it comes across better in 3D than on the small flat screen. Not that the film is without special merits: there are many moments of impressive philosophical values, child/parent relationships, and a few comedic turns. The cast is solid if somewhat underused in this visual mechanical Parisian extravaganza spectacle, but it well worth watching as pure entertainment - and that is really OK!<br/><br/>The story is well known: Hugo (Asa Butterflied) is a lad whose inventor father (Jude Law) salvaged a broken automaton from a museum to fix it but dies before accomplishing that: his Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a drunk, is let in charge of the lad. Hugo is soon left alone in the bizarre train station in Paris where he tends to the multiple clocks, misses his beloved father, and fends for himself by shoplifting food and a few 'parts'. He is caught by a rather glum Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) who runs a toy store while bemoaning his current lack of the thrill of living, despite the nurturing he receives from his wife (Helen McCrory) and his adopted daughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who longs for adventures. In time Hugo and Isabelle become fast friends and discover the secrets held by Georges and it is through their efforts that joy and the dreams of the aged filmmaker are resurrected.<br/><br/>There are some sidebars - an injured WW I veteran who serves as Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who dreams of the attention of the flower lady Lisette (Emily Mortimer), Madame Emile (Frances de la Tour) who sips coffee while tending her dog and attracting the attention of the hefty Monsieur Frick (Richard Griffiths), cinema devotee and historian Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg) who opens the doors to the mysteries that have collected during the story), and the odd Rene Tabard (Christopher Lee) who part is questionable.<br/><br/>The cast is strong - especially the children - and the special effects are very lovely to watch. The film takes us to the land of fantasy and it is worthwhile trip. Though the film seems to be impressed with itself and the revelation of the history of cinema, it offers many pleasures. Not sure it is a DVD to buy, though. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"LloydBayer","8","3","5","21 February 2012"," Who says Scorsese was all about mobsters?
","If I am allowed to be a little subjective here, I can tell you that Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese are two of my favorite directors, but for different reasons. In terms of what they do for cinema, I can't think of a similarity in their films, except that they are film makers with passion, vision and dedication. At the time of writing this, Spielberg and Scorsese are at opposite ends of the rope, with the Oscar for ""Best Picture"" in the middle. As directors, it becomes irrelevant who wins. However, when you consider Scorsese's ""Hugo"" with Michel Hazanavicius' ""The Artist"", even seasoned critics will find it hard to choose between the two. Up until the point when I actually watched these two films, I was, like a million others, questioning the choice of ""Best Picture"" nominees for the 2012 Academy Awards. Before I tell you why ""Hugo"" is a prime contender, let me say that for a year that was not really the best in cinema, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in my opinion, has considered the heart and soul of cinema in comparison to what cinema has evolved into today.<br/><br/>In comparison to his previous films, Scorsese fans are in for a totally different experience with this film. Based on Brian Selznick's novel, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", we follow the titled character's adventures in repairing an automaton, a mechanized invention left behind by his deceased father. Orphaned and living alone, 12 year-old Hugo lives within the walls of a Paris railway station, maintaining various clocks and stealing food for existence. Fixated at repairing the automaton, Hugo has to retrieve a book that shows how, having lost it to a bitter old man called Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley). Befriending Georges' goddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Moretz), Hugo begins a journey of discovery and quest, but must do everything he can to evade capture by a pesky railway inspector hell-bent on sending him to an orphanage.<br/><br/>As a director and film maker, Scorsese has not only outdone himself, he has severely raised the bar in the art of storytelling. Nominations for art direction and cinematography are easily justified with visually stunning aesthetics of 1930's Paris. Clearly, production design is one of the best; a feat that I feel has outdone the art direction in ""Anonymous"". Character portrayals are another big tick mark when considering the story revolves round the lives of just a few key people. With just under three films to his credit, Asa Butterfield is impressive in his titled yet heartwarming role as a boy saddened by the loss of his father, but goes on to become a catalyst in awakening self-worth in a stranger. Reciprocating this kinship is Kingsley in another fine performance, where his Georges Méliès is constantly evolving throughout the movie. Playing a World War I veteran turned railway inspector, Sacha Baron Cohen is the comic relief, albeit with an antagonistic touch, but one that is a far cry from ""Borat"" and the revolting ""Bruno"". Good choice in casting and I hope Cohen is seen in similar roles, given his unique talent as a comedian. Also nicely done are roles from Chloë Moretz and Helen McCrory, with shorts from Christopher Lee and Jude Law.<br/><br/>For a family adventure movie, this film is structurally intact except for a glaring flaw. Set as a period piece in 1930's Paris, there is hardly any French dialogue, and worse, absolutely no French accent from any of the characters. Am I missing something here? Why go to great lengths to make an epic movie in '30s France but have all actors sport a British accent? This flaw aside, every other aspect of the movie works in favor of making this a remarkable film. Apart from stunning visuals, fine acting and a well narrated story, the heart of this film lies in the homage it pays towards movies as an art form. Call it a movie within a movie; its essence stems from celebration of life and realization of dreams, through a medium we love so much – The movies."

","I saw Hugo a while ago; I just thought I'd sit down and review it now. Set in Paris during the 1930s, Hugo tells the story of a young boy who goes on a quest to solve the mystery of the automaton. It's an adventure, a mystery, and suspense-filled, all rolled into one.<br/><br/>This film is a masterpiece. The actors and actresses for the characters did a great job in their acting. When I read the book, I found that the characters in the film look the same as in the book. I also recognized some scenes from the book that were beautifully transposed into the film. However, there were some things that weren't in the book. Normally that isn't a bad thing, but the scene with the Station Inspector and the person attending the flowers - I found that to be a bit awkward. I don't think that has much to do with the actual plot; it seems like it was thrown in for a time filler. <br/><br/>I think that they did a great job with the back story sections. There was a part near the beginning where they explained how Hugo's father died and his uncle came to get him with the clocks. Then there was the scene where Etienne explains to Hugo and Isabelle about the building where Georges, Isabelle's godfather, works. The final section of back story is at the end, where we learn about the silent films from the early 1900s. I thought it was neat how they showed how people recorded films back then, and even just the recording sessions they had. <br/><br/>The soundtrack for this film was awesome, too. The accordion, which appeared in several of the tracks, for some reason made the song sound perfect for the film; I don't really know how to describe it. Of course, during the silent films, there was piano-parts playing in the background. There was also a small orchestra playing in the café where Hugo goes. It was a nice soundtrack that fit the mood of the movie well.<br/><br/>All in all, Hugo is definitely a movie I think everyone should see. It is over two hours long, and maybe it's a little too much for some people. If you haven't seen it yet, go and give Hugo a try. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD, and I'm sure, after watching this wonderful, memorable, inspiring film, you will, too."
"socrates99","9","3","5","4 January 2012"," It's hard to fault this perfectly executed adventure fantasy
","The fact that Ben Kingsley doesn't overact here you would think is blessing enough, but even more impressive is the discovery of someone like Asa Butterfield who is a director's dream and undoubtedly a once in a lifetime find. If that wasn't enough, Sacha Baron Cohen gives a wonderful performance which, surprisingly, makes up for all the crude and gross shenanigans he's engaged in up til now. I'd feel good about recommending it on the strength of his performance alone. Still, this is pretty much a kid's movie with themes a kid should be able to understand and feel an affinity to. That it can charm adults as well is a real tribute to Scorsese's unassailable mastery of the medium. <br/><br/>Scorsese probably thought that the story's eventual involvement with the birth of film gave him an excuse to pursue this children's story, but I was left wondering why he hasn't done even more in the same vein. I for one enjoyed this movie more than any of his previous films despite the subject matter or that it's a fantasy. Also it seemed odd to me given Scorsese's love of Italian themes that this movie is set in Paris, but it's a virtual love letter to a not too long ago Paris of steam engines and minimal conveniences.<br/><br/>I even saw it in 3-D which I was resolved not to see unless absolutely necessary. Happily it was not the impediment it usually is."
"daddyofduke","8","3","5","2 January 2012"," Martin Scorsese Scores
","When I think of Martin Scorsese I think of violence, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and a ton of profanity. I think of brilliant films about gangsters and one about a psychotic taxi driver. But now I think about Hugo, Martin Scorsese's latest directorial effort. In fact, I think about Hugo a lot. It is a brilliant film. Not perfect, but brilliant.<br/><br/>Hugo is brilliant on a multitude of levels: as a fable, as an interpretation of film history, as a venue for stellar acting performances, as a triumph of cinematic photography which involves 3D imagery, and as a vehicle for wondrous entertainment. That Hugo is directed by the same guy who directed films in which two men are savagely beaten by men with baseball bats and then buried still barely alive, a boxing ring's ropes drip the blood of a combatant, a taxi driver becomes a revered mass murderer, and a police captain is thrown off a roof, is testament to the genius that is Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>The story involves an orphaned waif named Hugo Cabret (played tenderly and effectively by Asa Butterfield) who steals to survive and lives among the gears and levers of the enormous clocks in a train station. His life is tormented by the owner of a toy shop ( Ben Kingsley at his best) in the train station and his freedom is in jeopardy due to the efforts of a weirdly pathetic police officer, played by Sasha Baron Cohen (who was the ""hero"" of Borat). Hugo dedicates enormous effort to repairing an automaton his father (played briefly by Jude Law) found in disrepair at a museum. During the course of his travails, Hugo meets a young lady named Isabelle (touchingly brought to life by Chloe Grace Moretz) who is the same age as he is. <br/><br/>Turns out that Isabelle is cared for by the toy shop owner. And it also turns out that the toy shop owner is Georges Melies, the onetime director and star of some of the first movies ever made. Melies, in case you don't know, is a real person who did in fact transform movies into the medium we now know. The film also accurately references the Lumiere brothers and their camera. The skills with which fantasy is weaved with fact alone compels watching this film.<br/><br/>In the film, and in fact, when Melies' success fades, partly out of depression and partly in need of money, he melts his films for the cellulose he can sell. Largely as a result of Hugo's efforts to repair the automaton, Melies stature is dramatically and appropriately resurrected. <br/><br/>As I said, the film isn't perfect. The police officer who harasses Hugo is played competently enough by Cohen, but the character just doesn't fit into the film's contextual essence or tone. Picture Gilligan taking the place of Ugarte in Casablanca and you get my point. <br/><br/>Visually, Hugo is a miracle; its cinematic imagery, nuanced by 3D technology, merits a thunderous standing ovation. The film's cinematographer, Robert Richardson, has helped fashion a film that has set new standards to be emulated for years to come.<br/><br/>I recently read that Martin Scorsese obsesses over every detail, no matter how minute, of every facet of his films. Annoying as that trait may be to those who work with him to make a movie, it has resulted in sustained artistic excellence spanning more than four decades. Any list of the best directors ever inevitably includes Martin Scorsese. Consider just some of his films, Casino, The Departed, Good Fellas, Taxi Driver, The Last Waltz, Raging Bull, Gangs of New York, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, and you understand why.<br/><br/>As for all time great films, add Hugo to the list."

","The book is an experience. Every sparkles of childhood flies in a magnificent dance. Adventure, secrets, the poor boy, the girl - axis of answers - all are present in Brian Selznick novel. So, to see an adaptation is not very easy. All is spoken. But - surprise ! Hugo is a magic exercise. And impressive show. A new kind of Scorsese and arena for best cast. The lost pieces from novel are forgiven grace of gentle art of details. For the acting and circles of events, for the metaphors and delicate nuances. A fabulous work for recreate a world and, most important, its essence. A homage for a pioneer of cinema and one of great role for Ben Kingsley. The Christmas Eve atmosphere is perfect. A film as a dream. And forest of a mythical forest."

","What begins as a fanciful mystery evolves into a wonder-filled history of the cinema. Scorsese is the first director I've seen to understand the real potential of 3D, and he uses it as magically as the mysterious object of this film. At its heart, the movie is about finding your place in the world, finding where you fit it. All of the characters have lost something in their lives and, like a puzzle missing a piece, are searching for that perfect fit. Scorsese captures the beauty, wonder and danger of Paris in the 1930s as seen through a child's eyes. His cinematography is breathtaking. The acting -- including a surprisingly poignant performance by Sasha Baron Cohen -- is first rate and engaging. I constantly marveled at the twists and turns the story took, always in a refreshingly believable way. This is an exquisite cinematic experience that really should be seen in 3D to be fully appreciated. But even without the extra dimension, this is still filmmaking at its best."
"Beckiferness","7","3","5","21 December 2011"," A beautiful film.
","I thoroughly enjoyed Hugo. I did think that the first hour or so was rather slow, and although I appreciated that Scorsese was trying to encourage the viewers to embrace the visual cinematography of the movie, it did take rather a long time to get to the point. However, once we began to learn more about Georges Melies, and get to see the plot coming together, I was hooked. This really is a beautiful film which I would watch again.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure it would keep the attention of young viewers, despite being advertised as a family film. The content is family friendly, but I'm not sure about the pace. But, if you are interested in the inner workings of cinema and how our current film industry came to be, then this stunning film is for you!"

I expected ""Hugo"" to be 'just' some 3-d adventure movie for family, but it is something bigger, much bigger. It is baffling, beautiful and lovely. I don't want to write much about the plot, because watching the film is some kind of exploring a young boy's world. The sad story of an orphan in Paris is told in unique pictures and lovely characters.<br/><br/>Scorsese's last productions have been awesome. Only ""Shutter Island"" appeared quit trivial next to epics like ""Gangs of New York"" or ""The Aviator"", but ""Hugo"" is something you see very seldom in the last years. We have seen it in ""The King's Speech"" or ""Into the Wild"". ""Hugo"" is a film of the heart. And next to ""The Artist"" the best picture of the year."

I highly recommend enjoying this surreal adventure in 3D in the  theatre. It deserves several Oscar nominations including Ben Kingsley  as the shopkeeper and Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabelle. Sacha Baron  Cohen's campy performance as the station inspector detracted slightly  from this otherwise excellent film (8.9 out of 10).

","Hugo! Darling Hugo. He lives in the walls in a French train station, fixing clocks and working on a magical little man. He encounters a toy maker who seems horrified at the thought of little mechanical men and the mystery unfolds. I won't spoil anything, but this is based on true events. In fact the most believable part (little French urchin living in a train station) was the fake part. Bravo, real life.<br/><br/>Hugo wasn't at all what I was expecting. I though it would be more of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close set in 1910s France – boy searching for the answers to life pertaining to his lost dad. Touching stuff. What I got was a celebration of film sneakily slipped in to a children's movie. From the scenes in the film to the actual clips shown as part of Hugo's journey to discovery, everything paid homage to the classics – Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Voyage to the Moon, - every piece of film celebrated the art. As someone who grew up on old films, I really enjoyed seeing these greats back on the big screen. They even got laughs from folks I suspect never knew these treasures existed.<br/><br/>That's not to say that every part of this modern film wasn't also spectacular. The opening shot made me dizzy, the colors were dazzling and rich, and even the costuming showed great attention to detail. Scorsese hasn't been my favorite director, but I appreciate his skill and his love of film. Well done to all involved, this is one of my favorites of the year!"

","Some people called it boring. Untrue. It's a cinematic masterpiece. It's beautifully done. Beautifully placed in a magnificent train station ""set"", which becomes it's own magical world. Great CGI as it should be used: to enhance, not to ""blow us away"" with special effects. Certainly too thoughtful and slow for fans that only like ""action-adventures"" such as ""Man of Steel."" (I happen to like both.) It's a fable about purpose. Purpose in life. Purpose in thought and action. Sacha Baron Cohen turns in the best performance of his life as the ""gruff"" train station policeman with a heart-of-gold that he is afraid to reveal to others. Great dog actors. Two small dogs and a Dobie. It's a story about a special orphan living in the clock tower of a Paris train station. His purpose is to tend to and wind the clocks because his drunken ""Uncle"" cannot do it anymore. He is befriended by a little girl, slightly older than himself, who is also an orphan. She lives with her loving grandparents. She does not know that her grandfather is the celebrated magician and filmmaking pioneer George Melies. He is presumed dead, but he is in seclusion, believing that the world has forgotten him, as he also believes that all of his motion picture films have been destroyed. It is not true. Hugo ""re-enacts"" the famous Harold Lloyd scene and hangs out the window of the clock-tower on the ""hands"" of the great clock, to avoid capture by the policeman. Several clips from silent films are shown including Harold Lloyd's above-mentioned famous scene and George Melies' filmworks. A magnificent movie for film enthusiasts and children who can sit through a wonderfully enchanting but ""slow-moving"" film. A Martin Scorses Masterpiece. Should be ""G"" rated. Nothing really objectionable. Based on the illustrated book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"". A bit like ""Polar Express"" but not as flashy as the movie and not computer animated. (It is live action with real actors.) Paradoxically, this DVD was released so early after it's theatrical release that there is no mention at all of the 5 academy awards that this film deservedly earned."

","This a masterpiece that only the likes of Martin Scorsese can pull through. He usually does more violent and 18+ type movies, but it is about time someone celebrated the beginnings of the cinema, and who better to do it than one of the best directors of our time! A beautiful story, based on a historical fiction book, this movie explores the life of George Méliès, who, after World War I, went into darkness. His movies no longer wanted, he burnt his brilliance and became a shopkeeper at a railway Station in Paris, living his life no longer in reality, but only in his dreams. A sad man whose brilliance was forgotten. And this is where a little boy by the name of Hugo Cabret comes in to change his life forever.<br/><br/>I strongly suggest anyone who is remotely interested in beauty and untainted art to have a go at this movie. It really warms your heart. You do not need to know anything from the background of this story. I didn't, and I was immersed in the wonderful story, which felt like a painting to me, that only directors such as Scorsese, and actors such as Christopher Lee, Sacha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer etc. can pull through. Not to mention the 2 lead actors, the two children that portray the innocence of this story we desperately desire in our time. We need more stories like these. Not gruesome, and full of blood, and dried up skeletons, but magical movies that take you places! My grading: 4.5/5"

The acting is embarrassing and sickeningly sentimental to the point where you find it hard to look at the screen. It's a 20 minute story dragged out for more than 2 hours at a snails pace and with little or no sense of mystery. There aren't many films in which you can sleep for over an hour knowing you haven't missed anything.<br/><br/>The only reason i can possibly think of as to why people enjoyed this film is that once upon a time they took a film studies course that directly relates to this film themes.....but that's not a good enough reason for me to call it a classic. The film is even that more meaningless if you have an average knowledge surrounding the history of film.<br/><br/>If you want a similar kids film that is actually entertaining and funny then watch ""Lemony Snicket's A series Of Unfortunate Event's"".....but if you want your heart to decrease it's beat to that of a dolphin knocking on deaths door then go with the incredibly boring & pointless HUGO."

","A child with a mission teams up with a kindred spirit against the big bad world: that is the central theme of this confused film, which is too convoluted for children, and too juvenile for grown ups. Paris is a city that does not need special effects to appear attractive on screen, and it is the use of unnecessary special effects and cardboard characters (the boy with a mission, his sympathetic friend, the alcoholic uncle, the misanthropic cynic, his long suffering wife, the cruel cop)that are used as twin devices to prop up this flawed film. Other characters (the flower girl, the woman with the dog) barely register, and the story within a story (of the adoption and popularization of cinema technology)is too forced and abridged to ring true. Child actors, if not properly handled, only too easily degenerate into precocious know-it-alls on screen, and this happens in Hugo. The film is not genre-defying; it defies the coherence of multiple genres!"

","Wow. I don't usually review films that I consider to ""mediocre"" (I'm lazy so I review films that I love and ones that I hate--in-betweeners I tend to ignore). But ""Hugo"" was such a disappointment that I have to drop in and post a review. It's a crying shame that so much talent resulted in such a boring movie.<br/><br/>Where to begin? It's a kid's film, certainly, but that doesn't mean it should be stupid and unfortunately that's where we end up. The dialogue in this film reminded me of that line from (the vastly underrated Jamie Kennedy film) ""Starstruck""--<br/><br/>""Real people don't talk like that!""<br/><br/>""Of course real people don't talk like that! It's called DIALOGUE!!""<br/><br/>Yeah... IT'S CALLED DIALOGUE.<br/><br/>Not one conversation in this film makes sense. The entire structure of the movie depends upon everyone being secretive when there is no need to be. It's nuts. It's just bad scriptwriting. Want suspense? Keep somebody in the dark! How simple! Especially if it's the audience that's being kept in the dark! <br/><br/>Roger Ebert complains that he hates it when the audience can see something that is obvious but the characters are so dense that they can't see it. Here is a similar situation. All the characters know something that the audience does not, but the director assumes that the audience (children) are so dumb they won't be able to figure it out. It's tedious.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, meet George Lucas. You two guys have perfected the art of making bad, expensive films that are supposed to please children but just annoy me."

","Now living in a Paris clock tower after his father (Jude Law) is killed in an explosion, 14-yr old Hugo (Asa Butterfield) takes care of the railroad station clock having been trained by his uncle (Ray Winstone).<br/><br/>Occasionally, a movie comes along that is pure gold. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Hugo are prime examples. <br/><br/>There appears to be two stories in here and each one compliments the other. First we are concerned with Hugo who is trying to find a message he feels his late father has left for him . Hugo believes that message is to be found within the Automaton (immobile robot) that he is attempting to rebuild and that was neglected and left to rust in some museum. But, later Hugo discovers that the message within the Automaton leads to a bigger message for the whole world when George Melies (Ben Kingsley) a pioneer film maker is rediscovered to complete an important part of art film history. <br/><br/>It is well known that Director Martin Scorsese (Bob takes a drink) is passionate about preserving film for ages to come and this story brings that home. The credits say that Scorcese (another drink is taken) also had a small part in the movie as a photographer. But, I couldn't see Scorcese (another drink is downed) unless Scorcese (a drink is gulped) was in some disguise. Well, the flashbacks did go back before the 1920s and we are in the 1930s. I was looking for an older Scorcese (drink taken again) not a young Scorsese (another drink downed). And, now you know how to play the Scorcese (finishes off glass) drinking game. The game was first introduced by two actors hosting some awards show (Golden Globes?) earlier this year. <br/><br/>The setting is Paris, France, and although all characters had French names, no one spoke with a French accent and, to be truthful, that was a good thing as everything was easier to understand. Reminded me of the movie Valkyrie when no one spoke with a German accent. The background music had French overtones that fit perfectly. There is also a very nice French song at the end when the credits run. You should listen.<br/><br/>Standouts: Kingsley, of course; Butterfield as Hugo with those haunting eyes; Chloe Grace Moretz as the almost girlfriend to Hugo; Christopher Lee with that imposing authoritative voice as the kind giver of books; and Sacha Baron Cohen as the comic relief who surprisingly played his role perfectly as the Stationmaster. Cohen mildly approached an imitation of Dr. Stangelove and there were times I expected his Borat character to emerge as well, but that never happened. Yes, we are wary of Sacha Baron Cohen as we never know what he will do next. All in all, the actors above and the rest of the cast were exceptional. Kudos.<br/><br/>The cinematography was simply outstanding. I liken it to Avatar when the eyes were given a visual treat. And, here the CGI was simple, complicated and more than just right. <br/><br/>Hugo was nominated for: Best Picture, Costume Design, and Directing. Didn't win. But, it won the Oscar for Art Direction, Cinematography, Visual Effects, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing. As far as I am concerned it should have won for all the Oscars it was nominated for. Hey, we are talking pure gold here. <br/><br/>An excellent family film touted as pure gold. BTW: That drink was iced tea although I am told others use something stronger.

Maybe I'll have to buy a 3D HDTV to love it as much at home. Scorsese is at his masterful best. Possibly this is Scorsese's homage to the magic of movies which can bring us to other worlds if our childhood imagination is intact. Nice to see that Scorsese, for once (except for his wonderful Age of Innocence movie), depart from his violent movies.

He fixes mechanical gadgets and railways clocks which he learns from his father and uncle. Unfortunately, his father dies in a fire accident and only way to seek the message left by his father is to fix the automaton. In order to fix the automaton, he starts stealing from a toy shop in the railway station owned by a cranky old man , George Melies (Ben Kingsley). But Hugo is caught stealing and the only way to compensate for his punishment is to work in the toy shop. Hugo befriends George's granddaughter Issabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) during his tenure and successfully fixes his father's automaton. Eventually , he gets the message from the robot but in form of pictorial diagram which gives him a clue about George's past. Along with Issabelle , Hugo sets out to find the truth. Hugo , directed by the legendary director Martin Scorsese , is his first 3D fantasy film based on a novel written by Brian Selznick. When I saw the trailer for the first time , the film immediately reminded me of Polar express which was of same genre. The film was shot completely in 3D made it more exciting to watch. I have always Scorsese's work and this film goes one step further to prove his versatility. The master director has captured each frame so beautifully that audience will fall in love with the movie. The visual effects and camera work is so enthralling that you don't want to miss out the movie even for a second. Story and screenplay has been handled so efficiently that you would not feel bored ever. Art direction is magnificent. Dialogues are superb and inspiring. The child actor who plays the part of Hugo does justice to his part. Same goes for Chloe Moretz. But it is Ben Kingsley who steals the thunder. The actor is effective and carries the part of George Melies with such an ease. So , overall , a superb movie in all respect. Hats off to Martin Scorsese was experimenting something unusual and making it a fun-loving flick to watch. Very Good : 4/5"

The whole visual of the city was polished, sophisticated and artistic. The production design has to be praised. The synopsis does not give away what makes this film so magical, and this is a good thing too. But what I am allowed to tell you is that it actually has a good message about how Hugo believes the world is like a big machine and that everyone must have a purpose in it, just like a machine's parts has purpose for the machine it will become (if that makes sense) The film had such an innocence and a comforting feel to it. Asa (Hugo) and Chloe (Isabelle) were quite good, I don't really like them as actors to be honest (I like the boy much better than the girl though) but I wanted to not let that spoil the film for me, and it didn't. Because they actually fitted quite well into the film, they had a good screen chemistry. The whole film is a great homage to cinema as well (but I can't tell you how they do it otherwise it would be a spoiler) watch it for yourself and you'll see what an amazing film this is. Who knew Martin Scorsese could make a clean film without anything offencive in it? ;D"

","Sometimes simplicity speaks volumes of what a person perceives or what he/she desires for and this movie so simply speaks about the subtleties of life. Hugo Cabret lives in train station's clock tower after his father tragically dies in a fire in a museum. Taken up by his uncle he starts winding up the clocks in the train station but has a hidden dream of setting atominator in motion and finding out the hidden secrets behind. What gets revealed out of it is the story Hugo speaks about.<br/><br/>Set in the 1930's Paris Hugo living in his clock tower wants to fix a atominator which his father had brought home from the museum because no one wanted to have it. The journey of finding missing pieces to fit in the atominator he comes across George Melies who runs a toy shop in the train station and has glorious past. He befriends his godchild Isabella and both of them start on an adventurous journey of reading books, watching movies without tickets and finding out the truth behind George Melies. In the train station there are various characters and newspaper seller who is in love with the lady who runs a bakery shop but what's stopping them from expressing their love is the lady's dog. Then there is the station inspector (a brilliant Sacha Baron Cohen) who is obsessed with orphan's n wants to make each one of them live in an orphanage because he had a tough childhood and he is in love with the florist but can't express it because of his defected left leg and all these characters combine to make a joyful journey for Hugo.<br/><br/>One day in the film section of the library Hugo and Isabella come across the history of film making and there they are awe struck by one name which is of George Melies and the writer who is obsessed by George's movies and he makes them realize that their Papa George is one of the greatest filmmakers ever but all his work is lost except one which also happens to be the first movie seen by Hugo's father. Now the kids want George to see the movie and realize how great he was and how people where influenced by him.<br/><br/>Starting off with the performance everyone has given a superlative performance with Asa Butterfield great as Hugo, Chole Grace Mortez good as Isabella, Sacha Baron Cohen superb as the Station Inspector, Ben Kingsley is marvelous as George Melies and Jude Law is under used. But the real stars of this movie are Director Martin Scorsese and the Art Directors Dante Ferretti and Francesca Lo Schiavo. 11 Academy Award Nomination is a befitting tribute to such a wonderful movie."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","4","8","18 January 2012"," As great a movie as it is an intensely personal one for Marty.
","Martin Scorsese made a family film? A wholesome one? And in 3D? GASP! Yes, believe it! Legendary director Martin Scorsese, best known for Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and The Departed, has made a terrific family movie out of Hugo.<br/><br/>First shot of praise goes to the film's cast. A talented bunch of actors to behold, each of them giving it their best, even if some cameos may seem superfluous (Honestly, anything's better with the great Christopher Lee in it). The movie's main focus is that of young Asa Butterfield, nailing the character of Hugo. He gives a very convincing performance, and tremendous sparks fly between he and his co-stars, whether he's holding his own against the secretive Papa George (The terrific Ben Kingsley), outwitting the relentless Station Inspector (The hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen), or sharing an adventure with the eager Isabelle (The lovely Chloe Moretz).<br/><br/>But this is still Marty's movie, and a very personal one for him. He and screenwriter John Logan have a delightful time dabbling in the history of film. Cinematic history practically courses through Scorsese's veins, and he infuses generous portions of his knowledge of cinema into the film. He excellently captures the spirit and nostalgia of old movies, movies that wowed audiences before technological advances in cinema (CGI, for example) were even thought possible. The film reaches more than a few levels of pure Cinema Paradiso inspiration. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for Marty, and you might also say it was even based on himself in several ways.<br/><br/>On top of that, he's hired technical crew members who make the film look and sound incredible, no less than it deserved. Dante Ferretti's superb production design, and Sandy Powell's wonderful costumes are to die for. Bob Richardson's cinematography and Thelma Schoonmaker's film editing are pure aces, especially when showcasing the film's truly special effects. And Howard Shore writes a lovely, if sometimes over done, musical score complete with graceful piano and accordion motifs.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"
"Christian_Dimartino","10","4","8","18 December 2011"," This is the film i've been waiting all year for.
","When I first saw the trailer for Martin Scorsese's newest film, Hugo, I was a little skeptical. Scorsese is the classic director behind gritty films such as The Departed, Gangs of New York, Goodfellas, and Taxi Driver, so I just felt like it wasn't his style. But then I realized that he was always a director of variety. He's done romances, mob movies, dramas, and biopics, so I started to feel like he could do something beautiful with it. I finally just saw it, and I must say,wow.<br/><br/>The film is based off the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret. The film's hero is Hugo(a terrific Asa Butterfield), an orphan who lives inside the clocks of a train station in 1930's Paris, where he roams and observes the fellow city people, while constantly being harassed by the station inspector(A hilariously lovable Sacha Baron Cohen).<br/><br/>Hugo is trying to fix a robotic man that his late father(Jude Law) and him tried to fix, while also trying to figure out who a vendor named George(an excellent Ben Kingsley)really is. So as Hugo and Isabelle(Chloe Moretz), George's granddaughter, investigate, the film turns into a film history lesson, and that's only part of what makes Hugo so fascinating.<br/><br/>Hugo is the film i've been waiting all year for. I don't mean that anticipation wise. I've actually been waiting all year for Midnight in Paris, and will see that later this week. What I mean is, it's the film i've been waiting for in sense of greatness. Hugo is my favorite film of 2011.<br/><br/>I haven't been more fascinated by a movie since last year's best movie, Inception. Hugo is an adorable, light, and gorgeous family mystery that Martin Scorsese was obviously born to direct. The guy is such a great director. The way that he makes movies is just a marvel on it's own. The camera angles, cinematography, and set designs are beautiful and unique.<br/><br/>The performances are also ones to remember. Kingsley and some of the other actors deserve nominations. And Scorsese, obviously. I love what he's done with this film. Not only does he focus on the main characters, but he focuses on the characters in the train station, which are just a delight to watch.<br/><br/>I have seen a lot of great films this year, but Hugo was the one that really showed me what a year it's been. It's as if it was made for me. It's a love letter to cinema, and I really had a great time with it. And it makes me sad that it hasn't made a lot of money. You really have to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>A"

","Amazing story, characters, cinematography, costumes, cast, effects. Loved the story and how everyone filled out their roles. The Story was woven together so well you get sucked in and root for Hugo (Asa) and Chloe (Isabelle)to finish their adventure the right way. We had hoped for more out of the Automaton but OK with it's critical history and so glad it survived. Always new Martin Scorsese was a gifted director but other types of movies. He has proved himself again with this Excellent Family Production. We Would see it again without hesitation. Worth seeing and great for kids especially if they love adventures and have imaginations."
"tploomis","9","4","8","10 December 2011"," A beautifully crafted movie at all levels
","Hugo is an orphan who has found an unlikely survival niche for himself hiding behind the walls and in the remote passageways of a Parisian train station. He is barely safe and functional by himself, surreptitiously servicing the station's clocks, work he inherited from his father. Great cogs spin at different angles, symbolic of the churning forces he must negotiate, always threatening to snag him and pull him into their teeth. <br/><br/>He is cut off from others, watching the happenings of the rest of society through peep holes and darting out to grab leftover food and steal machine parts. The walls of the train station are essentially the walls of his personality -- there to keep others at bay. He trusts nobody; he is cut off from others. In a memorable scene where he takes a first tenuous step toward connecting to somebody, he articulates his loneliness to a girl who has taken an interest in him. Can he find a normal childhood, a childhood with parental figures that love him and care for him? He has become a feral child, a lonely child, a child who has just barely survived the double punch of losing first his mother and then his father and now scrounges out an existence cut off from others.<br/><br/>The station master (Sascha Baron Cohen), who seems to have lost his heart as well as the functionality of his left leg in the Great War, is determined to catch him and turn him over to an orphanage. The station master, with a hatchet sharp face and with the aid of a very pointy-nosed Dobermann (both enhanced with 3-D), is a menacing, but also ridiculous presence, determined to make the train station a place where people come to get on trains and a place where people get off. There is no room in his world for society's cast-offs and he careens through the crowded station determined to catch Hugo. The station master was an orphan himself (he has absorbed some brutal punches in his life as well), and his efforts to run a tight station have a frantic quality to them, as though he is trying to chase away the memories of his own childhood. The rules he enforces are there to hold at bay the fears he felt when he was in Hugo's shoes. <br/><br/>Hugo's father (Jude Law), a mechanically gifted man, would make metallic gizmos and would involve Hugo in this, father-son bonding projects. They had rescued an animatronic in disrepair at a a museum and were in the process of restoring it, when his father dies. If working, it will write, and Hugo believes, after his father is gone, that what the animatronic writes will give him a message from his lost father. When he finally restores the animatronic, it does not write at all, but instead draws a picture of a rocket ship plowing into the right eye of the man in the moon. Hugo recognizes this as an image from a movie his father would describe to him. Father and son had also shared movies together, both fully appreciative of movies' importance. <br/><br/>Ben Kingsley plays the role of a bitter curio shop owner in the train station, after previously being the director of numerous early movies. With WWI the importance of his movies has faded and his mini-masterpieces of the time have often been melted down to make high heels for women's shoes. It is like Bach's sheet music for his three missing Masses being used by the local butcher to wrap legs of lamb. Kingsley is intrigued by Hugo but the child's presence also stirs memories and feelings too difficult for him to handle, and he treats Hugo cruelly. Scorsese here is firmly in the tradition of Lucas -- the story told from the child's point of view and he is in a Dickensian world -- adults have forgotten what it is like to be a child and are subsequently cut off from part of their humanity. Adults have been hurt so often that empathy has been all but stomped out of them. <br/><br/>As Hugo gradually comes out from behind his walls, encouraged along the way by the god-daughter of Kingsley, Kingsley also lets go of some of his bitterness. This is helped by a renaissance of appreciation from others for his role in the infancy of movie making. Eventually Hugo has found another family. <br/><br/>The movie is a meditation on the role of movies, and in a larger sense the role of art, in our society. There are clocks everywhere, one with a great swinging pendulum from the tower of the train station, and the passage of time is a repeated motif. If we can keep movies and other art from physically disintegrating, the clock can stop ticking for them. <br/><br/>The 3-D is effective. The opening scene has snow flakes that seem to fall right on the heads of the audience. My five year old grandson, who watched the movie with me (and liked it), reached his hands up to grab a snow flake. In that action he paralleled the audience who saw the first movie ever made: a train pulling into a train station. The audience tried to jump out of the way, thinking they would be run over. Later in the film the train does run through the train station, people jumping out of the way in front of it -- but this turns out to be a fragment of Hugo's dream. Scorsese examines the connection between reality, movies, and dreams. The spinning cogs behind the walls of the train station are a reminder that there is a lot churning behind the surface."
"mistarkus","9","4","8","5 December 2011"," Dreamlike
","Beautiful sets and costumes, alongside stunning CG/3D technology transport us into the visually wondrous world of Hugo.<br/><br/>The story seemingly about a young boy who is living in a train station working the clock evolves into a story about a filmmaker. A bit children's adventure and a bit mystery the story achieves a childlike wonder as you watch the clues and story unfold to nice surprises, satisfying conclusions and resonations of commentary concerning the preservation of film itself. Hugo is about nostalgia, nostalgia for Paris in a romantic period, the nostalgia for seeing movies for the first time as a child, and nostalgia for old films themselves.<br/><br/>It was a nice, pleasant story that seems a bit contrived and forced forward at times. The transitions in the plot were not smooth and happened so randomly that it pragmatically seemed like a stretch; however Hugo should not be watched for its absolute realism. The story as the visuals itself are surrealistic, beautifully imaginative and semi-realistic therefore transporting us to dreamlike Paris in the early part of the 20th century. The imagery and story itself feel as though you are in a dream which makes the contrived plot acceptable.<br/><br/>A delightfully nostalgic calmness resonates as we sense the old fashion flavor in conjunction with the old ragtime music similar to what would be heard and seen when experiencing an old silent film from around the turn of the century (20th century).<br/><br/>The softening of the typical contemporary edgy themes created an old fashioned, relaxed, slower paced flavor yet the innovated CG and 3D make it more modern than almost any movie of it day. The 3D effects enhance the experience. You feel as though you are walking into highly populated hallways, up towers, you feel like you are in clocks peering out over the dazzling, wintry, romantic city of lights and you can not help but crack up as Sasha Baron Cohen's face comes closer and closer to your own as he once again scolds the protagonist. The assortment of extras dressed to the nines in outfits of the time, the small side stories and mini romances such as between the train's security guard and the flower girl created details that make Hugo a nice, encompassing, well crafted film."
"Bob Pr.","9","4","8","5 December 2011"," A film to be appreciated at multiple levels
","At face level, this is the thrilling narrative of (fictional) young, newly orphaned Hugo Cabret's attempt to complete the automaton/robot his recently deceased father was restoring and how that brings Hugo's life and that of (real person) Georges Méliès, the French giant of early movie-making, into more and more conflict--but eventually satisfying contact with each other.<br/><br/>'Movies are like dreams that interweave fantasies with realities.'<br/><br/>At a deeper level, ""Hugo"" is Scorsese's homage and paeans to Méliès (actual episodes of many of Méliès' restored films are shown along with Scorsese's view of their making)--AND to ALL of movie-making. (Wikipedia's article on Georges Méliès helps define where Scorsese's version is surprisingly true to life and the few places it isn't; knowing this before seeing the film will increase its enjoyment for most viewers.) <br/><br/>'Movies are like dreams that interweave fantasies with realities.'<br/><br/>The more familiarity viewers have with movies across the past 110+ years, the more they'll be gratified by Scorsese's references to their power plus reminiscences of bygone actors and scenes; he interweaves these allusions into the face value narrative. As examples-- <br/><br/>--several bits hint at the boy-girl romances in many movies: will this station security master & flower girl get together? <br/><br/>--In a similar vignette, the man who gets a dog to win a lady's interest is a lookalike double of S.Z.(""Cuddles"") Sakall who played many feel-good bit parts in '40s-'50s movies. <br/><br/>--One scene has Hugo reprising silent film's Harold Lloyd (""Safety Last"") hanging on the hand of a clock far above a city's street. <br/><br/>--Etc., etc. <br/><br/>'Movies are like dreams that interweave fantasies with realities.'<br/><br/>At its deeper levels, ""Hugo"" is Scorsese's reminder of how important motion pictures have become in our lives.<br/><br/>My rating, 8.5 of 10, may be revised up. :)"
"cattjones","Null","4","8","28 November 2011"," All I Can Say is WOW
","Director Martin Scorsese really hit it out of the park with this one. He has taken 3D movie-making to the next level. This film felt like a fairytale for both adults and children and has forever changed the viewing experience from average to spectacular. Although the film started out a little slow, I think that this is one of Marty's better works and is definitely Oscar-worthy, even if it is just for the cinematography. It kind of had that Oliver Twist feel happening but with a lot more adventure. When I saw the trailer for this film, it really did not give any indication about the content of the film and Emma was not looking forward to seeing it. I was excited just to see what was going on with the 3D. If a commercial boasts that ""if you don't see any other film in 3D, you need to see this one""; that peaked my imagination and the film did not disappoint. Asa Butterfield (Hugo Cabret) was as endearing in this film as he was in The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. The relationships Hugo builds throughout the film definitely keeps you interested and wanting to know what happens next. The station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) added both some comic relief and dramatic moments. Sir Ben Kingsley's character, George Melies transforms throughout the film. You could not really decide if you liked him or if you hated him, but all things are revealed in the end. It is really hard to review this film without giving away its essence, but take my word for it; you will not regret going to see it. This film felt like it was very personal for Mr. Scorsese and although it definitely had a storybook feel, I think that anyone who loves movies (like Emma and I do) has to make sure that this one is on their list of films to see. Who would have thought that Marty would be the person that takes 3D films to another dimension? Even James Cameron stated that it was the best 3D effects that he had ever seen; including his own films. I gained a new found respect for the process of movie-making in general. This film does more than just entertains, but it also gives the audience a brief education. The conductor is shouting ALL ABOARD!!!!! This film leaves the train station with a green light."
"directjw","10","4","8","26 November 2011"," Scorsese Makes Another Masterpiece
","Scorsese is without a doubt one of the greatest living, if not the best, American film directors. His filmography is beyond compare in terms of its consistency of quality and diversity of genres covered. With Hugo, he has made one of his most personal films, as it deals with a young boy who discovers and falls in love with cinema. What sets Hugo apart from other family films from the likes of Pixar and Disney is that it does not resort to cloying pop culture references, and it respects the intelligence of both children and adults. <br/><br/>Most significantly, Hugo is in the end a love letter to film, to the wonder and awe that the first films and filmmakers felt as they created moving images. Scorsese is saying that this love for the film medium has been steadily depleted with the advancement of technology, but ironically, Scorsese is using the latest cinematic technology (3D), and using it to comment upon film history.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>The homage scene of silent films at the end of Hugo left the audience in tears, and Hugo is, without a doubt, one of Scorsese's top five films."
"maximkong","2","5","11","18 November 2012"," Scorsese should be banned from the Oscars!
","A real disappointment this one. I am familiar with Scorsese's style of inputting in scenes or characters that may appear random but humorous in their own way, but to realize at a stage where everything is so disjointed -- the characters and the pieces of the plot fail to connect to each other to explain things properly but instead just informing the audience that everything is just some sort of ridiculous coincidence?<br/><br/>And Scorsese do you expect me to believe something like that is enough to traumatize a person for life, and another thing as simple as that is enough to give a wake up call? Such amateurish writing and direction - not to mention the severe lack of chemistry between some of the actors who should have expected to excel even more! Please, stay away from the Oscars! Clearly Martin Scorsese does not qualify to be a versatile director, as his attempt to direct an unusual kid fantasy film is so far off from his forte, or he has become too old and should retire in peace."
"CanYouFlyBobby1234","1","5","11","12 April 2012"," So, so poor.
","The most contrived, pointless waste of 2 hours I've had to endure in ages. The worst film any of the actors have ever taken part in, the accents are just so bad, no attempt to even remotely sound french, Baron-Cohen looks like Arthur Bostrom from 'Allo Allo' but sounds as wooden and boring as he acts in this film, he is just pointless. Butterfield is annoying playing a very weak character that gained no empathy, Kingsley should know better by now, the rest of the cast are not in it enough to even mention what they do! <br/><br/>I couldn't ruin this film by telling you the ending, it is so bloody dull. The Paris setting looks like a very cheap Christmas biscuit tin, the structure of the story is feeble and directionless with no real explanations for key parts or emphasis on key aesthetic elements that left me not caring what happened less than an hour into the film. Two hours is way too long for a 'family' film, this felt like some awful self indulgent Chocolat- esque attempt to do a Jean-Pierre Jeunet type film designed for English speaking, trash watchers.<br/><br/>If you thought the worst thing about Amelie was trying to read sub-titles you will love this because you're an idiot."

","So I don't know what the hype is about this film. While it is entertaining there is very little else. Hugo contains a lack of emotional connection (except from maybe a child who hasn't seen a great film yet) and the climax is very abrupt and disappointing while the resolution is extended like Lord of the Rings Return of the King. Also some of the actions the characters make do not seem logical, and they took me out of the film, wondering why would he actually do that, no one in there right mind would think that. If you're looking for a film to kick back and relax to, this is a good film. If you're wanting to watch this film, like i did, because of the high ratings and the expectation that this film would actually follow through with it go watch something else."
"barbara-364","10","5","11","4 December 2011"," I thoroughly enjoyed this stunning film
","I was keen to see this film from its publicity posters. I thought the clock looked like the clock on the Musee d'Orsay art gallery in Paris, which used to be Quay d'Orsay railway station, near the river Seine. I have since found out the railway station is Gare Montparnasse. What a treat to have the whole thing re-created in this beautiful film. There are so many facets to it, that I can only give an overall impression. I was totally engaged from the beginning. I wasn't sure about the 3D until I was completely amazed by the effects, especially sparks from the brakes of a locomotive which seemed to fly out into the audience and the smoke which appeared to linger in the auditorium. How brilliant is that! I love the cameos of station life, the flower girl with the fresh flowers which came in on the early train, the zealous gendarme with the mechanical leg, the lady with the dog and her admirer. Those who linger on the station like the smoke from the engines and those who pass through, hardly noticing anything. This film has everything to engage the enthusiast such as re- created steam locomotives, books and an Aladin's cave of a bookshop (like Shakespeare and Co). It demonstrates the mechanics of early film making, weaving the pioneers of the art into the story with a skill which engaged me completely, and tying it into the intricate mechanics of clockwork, a theme which runs through the film. Hugo is crafted to achieve an appeal to all generations. Our family group ages ranged from 8 to 65 and we were all completely bowled over with it. The whole story is carefully explained using the medium of quality film. Wonderful!"

Brilliant cinematography, excellent acting, humorous at times, sad at times, and the music was perfect. Scorsese's world is a world you don't want to leave. From watching gears turn in the inside of a clock to a mechanical man drawing a picture, Hugo is just plain brilliant. It's one of the few movies where the 3D actually works, it adds to the effects, to the cinematography, it's not just a gimmick to appeal to the masses, it helps the whole feel. The camera shots were excellent using many shots that you don't see often in movies. Hugo is a magical movie for kids and adults."
"Ramascreen","8","5","11","23 November 2011"," A refreshing, wondrous detour for the great Scorsese!
","-- Ramascreen.com --<br/><br/>HUGO is a refreshing, wondrous detour for Scorsese. It's not one of my top favorite Scorsese films of all time but it works as a family movie. I can imagine the great director just having fun with this material and the 3D aspects, he's like a kid in a candy store, not to mention it gives him the chance to pay homage to silent films and his love of cinema in general. HUGO is for those of us who find escape in the world of movies <br/><br/>I've never read the best seller that became the basis for this movie but when I heard that it has a bit to do with an orphan and the story is somewhat of a period piece, I thought we were in for another version of Oliver Twist-type story. And perhaps certain elements of HUGO would give some people that impression. HUGO's set design, the visual, the 3D, the costume, the cinematography, everything about the environment is both marvelous and captivating. A while back I thought this kind of film should be better handled by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director who brought us 2001′s Amelie, but Scorsese proves that he too can deliver something that wildly imaginative and magical. One of the most visually arresting films in recent years. Some of the best scenes I enjoy in HUGO are the ones that deal with the silent films. To watch Kingsley and McCrory re-enact some of those films is a delight.<br/><br/>The first half of the story loses my interest, partially because I feel that the father-son relationship is a bit rushed and I find the interaction between Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and Isabelle (Chloe Moretz) not engaging enough but I warm up to it after the heart-shaped key comes into play, my curiosity kicks in high gear from that point on. Chloe Moretz's accent goes on and off but her character is so friendly and supportive, you quickly dismiss her tough attempt on the accent. The design they have for the automoton, the mechanic figure that can write, is nothing short of fascinating. I wonder if I could put that on my Christmas wish list this year, it'd be cool to own one.<br/><br/>I think it's appropriate to have the great chameleon actor Ben Kingsley portray who many consider to be one of the fathers of early cinema, Georges Méliès. As Méliès, Kingsley makes you see that the spark in his eyes and the excitement in his heart, his belief in dreams have long gone. Hugo's little sad story leads to a discovery of a grand story that opens the door to a celebrated past.<br/><br/>Nothing is left hanging in this film, every character has a purpose and each purpose connects with one another. Even the ruthless station inspector, well played by Sacha Baron Cohen, who hunts down orphans as part of his job, has depth and he, of all people, should understand what Hugo is going through because he's a grown result of the resentment over the system that he wants to throw Hugo into. I think the 3 big key characters here are Hugo Cabret, Méliès and the Station inspector and they collide perfectly in this cinematic enchantment straight from the heart of Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>-- Ramascreen.com --"

While this is the main plot of the story, it's not executed very well. I saw this movie in the theaters, surrounded by lots of interested people, and hardly anyone could remember the key plot points once the film was over. The movie seems to bank on distracting the audience with very small parts by Sascha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer, Helen McCrory, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Ray Winstone, and Ben Kingsley. None of these people really advance the already thin story, but if they had, the story would have been infinitely more interesting.<br/><br/>By the time the old footage of silent movies is shown, audiences have most likely checked out and aren't paying attention. If you're in Hollywood or film school, you'll think this is an essential movie that pays tribute to a wonderful era. If you're an average Joe, you'll think you were ripped off by your ticket price."
"Kingslaay","Null","2","3","1 June 2017"," A big let down
","A number of critics on this site have regarded this movie as enjoyable for cinematic fans. The opposite could not be more true for this disappointment of a film. <br/><br/>The history of cinema is something to behold and fondly remember. In the space of a century since the Lumiere brothers made some of the earliest films in history cinema has advanced greatly in all aspects. However one does not need a boring and unimpressive history lesson. This story drags itself for far too long and does not deliver. This film would have been much better if they had actually focused on George's days as a film maker rather than showing us archive footage. As a film it was poorly put together and does not connect too well with the audience. This certainly does not cater to film lovers as it does nothing to bring the senses or interest alive. Hugo has to be one of the most annoying characters in the history of film. His ridiculous periods of silence and stupidly looking dumbstruck frustrate the viewer.<br/><br/>Film has made great strides and directors, producers and yes even 'Cinematic fans' have played a part in maintaining the great legacy of film. Homage can be paid to the legacy and the past through the constant production and enjoyment of films. What is most surprising is this film is made by the legendary Martin Scorsese, the same director who made Goodfellas, Casino and Taxi. This is a blemish on his highly decorated resume."
"Screen_Blitz","8","2","3","3 December 2016"," Hugo is a smart, elegant adventure that marks a surprising new turn for Martin Scorcese
","Would you have guess influential filmmaker Martin Scorcese would step foot behind the camera of a children's movie, let alone on with the magic and energy that feels reminiscent to classic works of Steven Spielberg or Robert Zemeckis. This rollicking period piece set in Paris during the 1930s marks a surprising new turn for Martin Scorcese who is rarely known for stepping outside the gritty mobster genre, with 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' being some of his most notable work. If you thought that Scorcese effectively achieving the innocence of childhood and the liveliness of Brian Selznick's book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' would a task too good to be true, prepared to get blown away because Scorcese has proved himself capable of casting his hands on a genre that actually kid-friendly unlike most of his more somber works. Set in the 1930s, the film follows 12-year old Hugo Cabret (played by Asa Butterfield), a young boy living at a busy train station in Paris after the death of his father (played by Jude Law), where he works as a maintenance boy fixing the clock tower when he need be. The boy owns a robotic figure known as the automaton which was left be his father after his death. One day, he comes face-to-face with a girl named Isabelle (played by Chloe Grace Moretz), the granddaughter of a toy store owner and former filmmaker Georges Melies (played by Ben Kingsley). Hugo learns that Isabelle along with her grandfather hold a secret to his late father that the two children must set out to discover.<br/><br/>Although the film is marketed towards children, the sophistication of the plot can be a little difficult for elementary school-aged youngsters to buy into. Fortunately, that is not to say that Martin Scorcese doesn't bring a certain elegance to the story that would appeal to both children and adults alike, particularly if they watch this in 3-D. From the breathtaking opening bird's eye shot of Paris, to the inspiring visuals, the film has more than a handful to bargain for. The film tells a blissful story that captures the astounding innocence of childhood and an adventure of a young boy to discover the true meaning of home, while learning some astonishing secrets of his late father. Scorcese successfully captures this without diving too far in the dark territory nor coming off too juvenile, though the tone in which story proceeds lean slightly more on the former side. The story is certainly not an excellent as it kicks off on a rather meandering start during it's first half, but when it finally takes off its quite mesmerizing. As the plot proceeds, the film gracefully dives into the two young leads discovering the history of film ranging from the story behind the 1902 silent film 'A Trip to the Moon', to the dawn of the use of 3-D in cinema, to an inspiring secret that leads to a revelation of the one of the supporting characters. It's a subplot that serves not only as a tasty treat for the story, but also a love letter to Hollywood buffs particularly by Martin Scorcese who doesn't hesitate to express his love for the realm of cinema.<br/><br/>What comes from a sensational story based on the screenplay by John Logan (who last collaborated with Martin Scorcese in 'The Aviator') along with Brian Selznick's novel must come some engaging characters and performances. That is where English actor Asa Butterfield and actress Chloe Grace Moretz come in. Asa Butterfield effectively breaths life into the titular character, he brings a certain innocence to his character that many child actors his age struggle to deliver nowadays. Along his side is Chloe Grace Moretz who stands as one of the finest teen actresses working today. Differentiating from her high-octane foulmouthed persona as Hit Girl in the superhero actioner 'Kick Ass' and her vicious vampire portrayal in 'Let Me In', Moretz brings a fair amount of ingenuity in her character who becomes a loyal friend to the titular character on his mission, especially with her rich British accent she manages pull off. Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley delivers a sense of freshness in the role of Georges Melies, the grandfather of Chloe Grace Moretz's character. Lastly is Sacha Baron Cohen who provides some fair comic relief as the quirky train station operator who along with his not-so friendly dog makes several unsuccessful but light-hearted attempts to capture the young child and send him off to an orphanage, but to face a series of goofy pratfalls from the child outwitting him.<br/><br/>Hugo is a smart, if not masterful family-friendly adventure that marks a shocking new turn for influential director Martin Scorcese. It is an elegant adventure that will likely meet great appeal to middle school-age kids if not elementary schoolers. Nonetheless, it is a lively treat that sees Martin Scorcese expanding upon his cinematic range."

","I adore Martin Scorsese he's mastered a very particular kind of film but if I have one complaint about him it would be that a lot of his films are very similar when it comes to structure and tone but Hugo does not suffer from this and I found to be fantastic. This is a film that every film fan should see it's got a really fantastic tribute to cinemas Past and has a great way of exploring a child like sense of adventure and wonder. This film loom so incredible and cgi and green screens aren't even noticeable they make the city of Paris come alive with wonder and amazement. The practically built sets also look amazing like the train station that is so well designed and this is by far one of Scorsese' best looking movies. The screenplay in this film is just fantastic it's has a great way of appealing to its audience and always keeping its characters interesting and investing technically everything in this movie is perfect but also are the central performances. Asa Butterfield was so good in this movie he's just the right amount of vulnerable yet brave he was also really sympathetic all thanks to his performance. Chloe Grace Moretz has great chemistry with Butterfield I thought that they brought the best out of each other in their characters and performances. But Ben Kingsley in my opinion gave the best performance in this movie he captures the right spirit of his character at first a tired and directionless old man but you soon start to understand why he is that way and it just gives him more room to give the best performance possible and that's exactly what he did. Sacha Baron Cohen gives the best performance of his entire career in this film not only is he really funny but also very sympathetic and proved that he could do more than put on a funny voice to give a performance. The central mystery was a great way to ground the story it makes this film more focused and gives you a great guessing game that puts you in the central characters minds and makes you relate to them more. However I think this films greatest issue is the way it handles some of its supporting characters, some of the more minor characters are just cruel and horrible for no reason and some character arcs never come into their own or are just left behind. <br/><br/>Hugo is a fantastic film it absolutely nails everything on a technical level and has wonderful performances the central mystery is intriguing and it's so great to see such a legendary director get out of his comfort zone. While I don't think this is going to go down as one of his all time classics it deserved to do better and the box office and will be remembered by its loyal fans and supporters. <br/><br/>87%/A-"

","I had very high expectations going into this film because it was a Scorsese film, and I was really interested in seeing him do an animated film catered towards the younger audience. However, I was not impressed.<br/><br/>I thought that the entire movie was so dull and boring that I actually napped for a few minutes here and there, just to get through it. The music is seriously annoying and so improperly placed that it becomes meaningless to the film, and the characters bring no life to the movie because they have no energy and the plot moves way too slowly.<br/><br/>There are very little characteristics of a children's movie in here except that it is animated. It's boring, serious, and just a whole bunch of CGI with no meaning.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I give it a 6, because it's nothing great, but still a great CGI masterpiece."

","This movie, was excellent! Hugo was a young man going through struggles in his life with his father dying and him living in a train station. He fought hard against not being caught by the train guards, and he accomplished his goal that his father set before his tragic death. I definitely recommend this film to males and females of all ages! The setting was a little unrealistic but it gave the film a cool twist! Watch and you will realize that the streets of the city look nothing like they did in the year it was filmed. The picture was animated but still contrasted with real life pictures. This aspect of the film made it really interesting. The plot of this movie couldn't be any better! Long story Short it was a great adventure movie which I strongly recommend!"
"canadian58","8","2","3","7 September 2013"," Fantastic movie...if you're not a kid.
","Hugo is dubbed as a family/kids movie, but after seeing it, I believe any child watching it would find it boring and uninteresting. This is a two hour movie, which is a long time to hold any youngster's attention, and Hugo is very slow-paced, dramatic, and adult-themed in my mind. Although appropriate for children, I believe the adults will be the ones getting the entertainment out of Hugo.<br/><br/>That being said, Hugo is a wonderful movie. Heartfelt, inspiring, and uplifting, not to mention visually stunning. It tells the story of Hugo, a boy who is orphaned when his father dies, and ends up living in the walls of a train station and trying to repair a mechanical man that his father left behind in hopes of getting a message from him. He meets Isabelle and her godparents, and finds out there's more to them than meets the eye.<br/><br/>This is the first time I've seen Sacha Baron Cohen in a movie that is not raunchy and crude like Borat and The Dictator. He is sort of the comic relief of this movie, but his acting is very good as the station inspector. As always, Chloe Moretz is perfect in her role as Isabelle, and I must say that her accent was very convincing. Asa Butterfield does an OK job as Hugo, but doesn't stand out as excellent.<br/><br/>Overall, a movie with wonderful visual effects, and a very inspiring story. Kid friendly? Not really. There are a few parts that kids would like, but mostly adult-oriented. Also, I believe they could have cut this down to about 90 minutes and gotten about the same result. It does get a little tiresome."

I sat through the whole movie, with one thing in my head... the book is 1000 miles better. It was still an achievement. Martin Scorsese, one of the best directors in the world still made Hugo a good story, but the book had a better one. I expected a better story, but I had the same thought about four people. Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, and Sacha Baron Cohen.

"KineticSeoul","6","2","3","13 March 2012"," Visually amazing but has it's flaws
","This is a movie intentionally made for kids and the whole family, but to some degree it's disappointing. Adults can sit through this movie but for kids, it just doesn't seem that enjoyable for them. This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese and it shows because the cinematography the editing is just amazingly done, although it seems a bit too long. But it sort of lacks in the story department and for a Scorsese movie the dialogue isn't all that great. Which is a shame cause Scorsese is made movies that are really character and story driven in the past. I am not sure if it's because he can't pull of the same feats that he can do with adult movies, but this one lacks in that. Sure the whole family can enjoy this movie but it's something so much more that it can't really be generalized like that even with the flaws. In some aspects the movie seemed to lean more for the adult audiences to the point I can see why the kids might get bored watching this sometimes. But what this is, is a vivid and refreshing fairytale that is intriguing and even a bit riveting most of the way through. The movie takes a while to understand what is going on though but the way it shows piece by piece of the story is very well done, although there isn't a lot of meat in the story. But everything else is just wonderful to watch, especially the town and the environment this movie takes place in, is almost dream like. This is a very well crafted fable experience for just about anyone that should not be missed. But might disappoint if your looking for a very good character driven movie with a amazing plot. The movie can also get a bit tedious sometimes but it did brought back a bit of the nostalgic feel from back in elementary school during story time. Since it's a Martin Scorsese film and judging by the advertisement this seemed like it's going to be a epic magical super amazing adventure which this is not. The build up sort of drags and doesn't lead to something super exciting, but the story isn't way too bad, just nothing special. Especially since for most audience, they won't know what the main story is about for over an hour, which is pretty bad since it's for kids as well. But it's far from being a bad movie and it really is worthwhile movie that is really worth seeing it with the whole family. In another words it's sort of a visceral experience, except leaning more to the visual elements than emotions. It's a good movie but if the environment was used more effectively for the plot it would have been better. So overall, disappointing yes, but still watchable.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I enjoyed this film very much - but -, Why on earth was the train at the end going so fast THROUGH THE STATION? Are they telling me that if they hadn't put on the brakes to avoid running over Hugo that, instead, it would have plunged through the wall AND jumped all the way across the street?? But otherwise, though the story is simple, the film is very engaging visually. The station interiors, Hugo's secret spaces and crawl ways are all revealed slowly enough along with his past to give the film the sense of mystery that works so well here. The toyshop Méliès owns is always lonely and still, a reflection of his now almost shuttered existence. His past is told by way of a museum curator played by 'Boardwalk Empire' star Michael Stuhlbarg."

","Slow paced, from time to time touching and overall deep movie. The story of an orphan kid, who lives in the Paris train station and craves to understand the purpose of his life, is more like an excerpt from cinematography's history, but presented in a charming fairytale setup.<br/><br/>The first 3D movie from Scorsese... the benefit from using the trendy technology is controversial. The film does not have strong visuals to boast, but 3D, indeed, helps to detach the actors from the background and bring more attention to them. Upon the whole acting is solid, but sometimes the emotions are misplaced (or at least non clear to the common user).<br/><br/>It's worth to watch the movie just to get to know the way Cinema has passed in the beginning, especially when it's created with noticeable production-value and love."

","""Maybe that's why a broken machine always makes me a little sad, because it isn't able to do what it was meant to do... Maybe it's the same with people. If you lose your purpose... it's like you're broken."" Based off of Brian Selznick's 2007 novel 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret', 'Hugo' is a historical adventure drama directed by Martin Scorsese (his first shot in 3D) and adapted for the screen by John Logan. The seasoned filmmaker and cinephile remarked: ""I found 3D to be really interesting, because the actors were more upfront emotionally. Their slightest move, their slightest intention is picked up much more precisely."" Known for his mobster movies about gang violence and organized crime, Scorsese wanted to make a film that his twelve-year-old daughter could watch. Released in 2011 an grossing $185 million at box office, the film won five Oscars, more than any other picture that year in 2011. Did he succeed in possibly making his first family film? Let's take a look.<br/><br/>The setting is the Parisian Gare Montparnasse train station in 1931. Orphaned and alone twelve-year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives a secret life behind the station's hidden chambers and passageways, maintaining the clocks and avoiding the vindictive Station Inspector Gustave (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his Doberman Maximilian. Before the station, Hugo lived with his widowed but kind and devoted master clockmaker father (Jude Law) of whom took Hugo to see the films of George Méliès only on his birthday. When an unexplained museum fire breaks out, killing the father, Hugo's inebriated uncle takes the boy with him to live at the station working the clocks, of where he has been ever since. Hugo works ambitiously on his father's most devoted project: a broken automaton (a mechanical man) that can illustrate, holding an ink pen in it's right hand of which might give him a message from his father. From the journal he has kept of his deceased parent, he secretly steals parts from an embittered toy shop owner's stand, Papa George, (Ben Kingsley) to fix it. He eventually gains the trust and assistance of his bookish and well-spoken goddaughter Isabelle (Chloë-Grace Moretz) to join him on an adventure in, like the clocks and the automaton, slowly fixing the lives of those around him by his loving ambition and caring demeanor towards the microcosm that is the station in which he lives for the better. He soon discovers the biggest secret from whom Papa George once was many years ago via the automaton before he dismissed his passion and broke down into a cantankerous cogless codger. Like the world itself, it is its own myriad of mechanisms that all mesh into each other as one, thus proving everything and everyone must have a purpose somewhere and aren't just an extra part.<br/><br/>Filled with mystery, dreams, fantasy and sleight of hand, this is a film anyone should see with a sense of adventure and/or a passion for cinema and how this intriguing realm unfolded. 'Hugo' is Scorsese's personal love letter to motion pictures and cinema itself, showing us every now and then clips of the birth of cinema (the last scene of an outlaw shooting point- blank from 'The Great Train Robbery', the majestic sets of Babylon from 'Intolerance', Buster Keaton sitting on the wheels of a moving train in 'The Gerneral', etc.) and how it has truly changed our world and enlighten the senses even to today. It gave us a chance to think, to become creative with new and invigorating ideas in how to tell a story with memorable characters and exotic lands. It showed us that we can be more than ourselves in reaching out to someone in who may just need fixing of their own only to discover something more than we could ever have possibly imagined. 'Hugo' entrances and and stirs the imagination with its warm atmosphere and colorful world in which in creates for the viewer. For the movie makers and those of whom enjoy films, 'Hugo' is truly a perfect opens secret passageways of its own, turning the mechanisms and gears in the viewer's minds to unleash the power within to create and inspire."

","*THIS REVIEW IS OF THE 2D VERSION*<br/><br/>Scorsese's first film for children is absolutely enchanting, and proves he really is a great filmmaker. Part of being a great filmmaker, of course, is being able to put the right team around you (hence why Ridley Scott's work, as brilliant as he is, is so patchy), which in this case included cinematographer Robert Richardson and erstwhile editor Thelma ""The Mothercutter"" Schoonmaker.<br/><br/>Hugo really feels like two films in one. On one hand it's a magical children's story, and on the other it's a(n) homage to the life and work of Georges Méliès. Rather than being wrapped up in his own world, Scorsese is a true student of cinema, and his genuine love and admiration of Méliès shines through.<br/><br/>Chloë Grace Moretz's English accent is very good, though her usually excellent acting borders a little on the gushing here, while Asa Butterfield manages to be sweet and sympathetic but not sickly. I've also warmed to Jude Law's acting in recent years, and his is one of several delightful cameo performances by a host of class acts, rather like people you know in your everyday life popping up in a pleasant dream.<br/><br/>Verdict: A proper family film that doesn't patronise kids or nauseate adults.

"bob the moo","Null","1","1","15 December 2013"," Meandering but charming family film
","With Scorsese as director and it being a big adoption of 3D by a ""proper"" director, this film made quite a stir when it came out and I always meant to watch it but somehow never did get to it. I finally did this weekend, although of course watched it in 2D and, to be honest, didn't see that I was missing too much by doing so. The film seems to have been a personal one for Scorsese as I remember him talking about wanting to make something that his grandchildren could enjoy while they were still children and in addition to this it is about a love of cinema, a love of wonder and making something that has this effect.<br/><br/>Hugo doesn't quite produce the emotions that we see drawn from the characters within the film, but it is still a warm and charming film. The plot has the theme of making things work and things having a purpose and this is well enough laid out to have an impact and work within the narrative. The pace is sometimes a little bit too slow and the film could have been a bit shorter and tighter with a tad more ruthlessness with the editing, because it does occasionally feel like it is meandering a bit as opposed to getting where it needs to go. I did not mind this so much as I was enjoying the tone of it, but it was still an issue. Given the subject matter, I really appreciated that it never gave way to easy sentiment nor got soapy – it was honest in this way and I think a better film for it.<br/><br/>The direction is good in the shots and movement of the camera, while the film feels like it has real passion and excitement for what it is doing, which comes over. Performances are engaging. Butterfield is really good in the title role and he works well with Kingsley in a delicate performance. Moretz was solid but left the detail to these two leads. Cohen provides some comic relief and I liked his wandering accent, while Winstone, Lee, de la Tour (!), Griffiths, Law, Eldon and others are all there to provide good small turns and add presence.<br/><br/>Generally Hugo is a bit too slow and long for its own good but even with this it has a warm, consistent heart which makes for a charming film with good performances. It may not fill you with awe and wonder as the characters in the film are, but it is still a charming and cheering family film without a mean bone or a sentimental bone in its body."
"Spondonman","7","1","1","24 March 2013"," One in the eye for Scorsese
","My, how movies have progressed since Georges Melies time. In his age he composed and filmed good hearted nonsense in days, while Martin Scorsese takes an age with a long film to pay homage to the great man and his works with his own film nonsense. It's tremendously stylish and even lavish but mainly cgi cartoonery and with 3D made redundant on an ordinary TV set, coupled with a tortuously inane plot. Great for kids over 10 though!<br/><br/>Young boy living in gargantuan cartoon railway terminal winding the clocks is fixated on fixing an automaton which he is apparently convinced could send him a message from his dead father. When it comes it sends the film and us in a new (old) direction and makes one wonder if his father was having a laugh. It's very well done although with a few puzzling visuals and very well acted although with a few emotional non-sequiturs, an impressive mix borrowing from Wallace & Gromit, Modern Times, and even Dead Of Night where the automaton's name was Hugo. This is a film for youngsters who might appreciate the history but mainly for adults who think they know the history. Does it work? Well, I enjoyed it as a one off, a harmless expense of two hours time but probably never to be repeated. It helps to have an appreciation not only of the history but of his works too – sadly something along with the reading of Noddy books I was never able to accomplish or miss. For me, the clock had always ticked too long.<br/><br/>A two minute Melies or a two hour Scorsese? That is the question."

The main star - Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret - is not so impressive as his coeval Thomas Horn in the role of Thomas Schell in the movie from the same year Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (moreover, the two movies have many common topics and values). And Inspector Gustave (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) resembles officer Crabtee from the cult series 'Allo 'Allo! - perhaps too much.<br/><br/>With regards to Scorsese, he has made better movies, and it not very credible to long for history and ""real"" cinematography with the help of digital tricks and state-of-the-art technology.

","It seems almost impossible to me that all these people seem to have enjoyed this movie. I have tried getting into the storyline for about an hour and then gave up due to the intensely bad over-acting and annoyingly bad dialogue. The music, scenery, art-direction and storyline are all mindblowingly perfect. But the directing and acting are equally terrible. The characters don't pull you in, even though the music and setting are brilliant. It's the perfect example of how important the right cast and script is, even with a big budget.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I walked out on a movie. Certainly not while I was half way in anyway. But I had to do something to prevent death by overacting."

","Thanks to Spielberg who could so well carry it with his amazing technique of motion capturing rather action capturing where he moves the camera along with the protagonist on the screen. Beautifully manifested Hugo couldn't have received a warmer welcome to the film industry.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Hugo comics and of course the animated series as well, especially the unrelenting Uncle Claude and who could forget the amazing duos Thompson and Thomson with their clumsy behavior who always managed to giggle me every now and then. Hugo and Uncle Claude however used to be my heroes solving mysteries and defying danger at every step. When I found out that there was going to be a movie and none other than Martin eScorses was gonna direct it, I was more than elated and wanted to tear my teeth out.<br/><br/>A perfect 3D fest right from the inception of the movie till the end, the movie has taken CGI to the next level with Scorsese's classic method of action capturing and boy I must say I was amazed as I kept on pointing how beautiful the effects appeared with every scene. Everything seemed so real, right from their countenances to the environment – the beautiful sea, the vast Parisian suburbs and every tiny detail. The story took us to one hell of a ride with Hugo solving the mystery and connecting the dots for us. Monsieur Labisse had never been portrayed that brilliantly, keeping in mind every tiny details and facial expressions. Isabelle appeared ditto as it used to be in the cartoons and equally cute too.<br/><br/>Hugo, superbly portrayed by Asa Butterfield, concerns a 12-year-old orphan who lives in the walls of a Paris train station in an alternate 1930 and a parallel universe where they spoke British English in France (?) Hugo however smells the foul play and since then takes us on a joy ride connecting the pieces together with the assistance of Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee – A perfect choice for the role .. He has gone so much better .. Christopher Lee for president !) who has been kidnapped by Monsieur Labisse.<br/><br/>The movie gives you a unique experience of 3D and motion capturing which I think is a must watch. Martin knows how to impeccably exploit technology. Go watch this one if you want to witness awesomeness in 3D and get what you paid for."

","Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo' tells a rare story in cinema - a plot grounded in our own reality that establishes a concept of 'magic' that is wholly believable (within the context of the plot) without transcending our laws of physics. Like the hidden landscapes of 'The Secret Garden', eponymous hero Hugo Cabret's world is a fantasy unto itself.<br/><br/>Marketed somewhat misleadingly as a children's fantasy movie, the film unfolds according to this very formula before gradually branching off on a wondrous and unexpected tangent that allows the characters to develop across some of the most beautiful arcs I've ever seen in any film. Hugo's endeavour to fix a broken clockwork man, in the hope of receiving a message from his absent father, takes place within the marvellous confines of a Parisian railway station, accommodating a diverse ensemble cast including Sacha Baron Cohen's excellent turn as a handicapped station master reminiscent of 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang''s child catcher. Child stars Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz demonstrate exceptional clout in their demanding roles, the latter further illustrating her renowned acting prowess.<br/><br/>'Hugo' is visually astounding in its intricately detailed display of grinding gears and lavish decor, recalling 'steampunk' imagery as the camera sweeps through steaming machinery and clockwork. Regardless of divisive opinions regarding its credibility, I personally feel I have no choice but to review the film as it is presented in the medium of 3D. Scorsese crafts shot after shot of beautiful, three-dimensional imagery - if 'Avatar' promoted the technical feats of the latest iteration of the technology, then 'Hugo' promotes how it can be used to serve a story as well as it does visuals. Hugo's world is fully immersive, rich and detailed with an astounding depth provided by filming in the format, as Scorsese displays an excellent discipline with the effects despite this been his first foray into 3D. <br/><br/>To delve into any further detail regarding Hugo's world or story would be to spoil the sheer delight in watching this heartfelt tale unfold through all its touching twists and turns. Sumptuously shot, incredibly well-written and expertly realised, 'Hugo' is rewarding cinema in every aspect.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Rollum","3","4","9","1 April 2012"," All looks no substance
","The most memorable thing about Hugo is the way it looks. Martin Scorcese has i think, created a visually beautiful motion picture and on that level, it entertains. As far as the underlying story, it is long and worn out by the time it ends, to the point where i no longer cared. There is no doubt that the story of Georges Jean Méliès, is an immensely interesting one. As the man who pioneered special effects in cinema,Méliès early life and career was surely more worthy of telling in some detail. Instead Hugo buries an interesting story in a convoluted one about a boy grieving his deceased father looking for key (sound familiar)in a train station with a carry on inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen)who was terrible in this role. The automaton was intriguing but i cant help feeling that it was just a ruse to keep me in my seat to the end of the picture.i believe there was a far more interesting story to tell that was buried in vague metaphoric double meanings that you really needed to care about to get. Overall a pretty picture but nothing memorable."

","Beautiful. Exquisite. Magical.<br/><br/>You'd be forgiven for mistaking seeing these words on a review for a Martin Scorsese film. When it was announced that the Academy-Award winning director was going to direct an adaptation of Brian Selznick's children's picture-novel, it left filmgoers wondering why on Earth would the masterful director of such brutal classics as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, GoodFellas and The Departed turn his talents to a film for children. <br/><br/>However, when Hugo was released to the world and an entrancing love letter to the history of cinema emerged, the only question on anyone's lips was why on Earth wouldn't he.<br/><br/>Even from the opening shot of the film, as the intricate mechanics of a clock fade into the stunning night streets of Paris, it becomes very obvious that Hugo is far from a career misfire for Scorsese. As the film progresses, it becomes arguable that Hugo might be just be Martin Scorsese's best film yet. <br/><br/>Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas) is a 12-year-old orphan with a love for cinema, who secretly operates the clocks of a Paris train station by day and lives between the walls of the station by night. His late father (Jude Law, Cold Mountain) left behind a broken automaton for the two of them to fix. To complete the puzzle, Hugo needs a heart- shaped key to unlock its message. Unfortunately, that very key is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>As Robert Richardson's stunning cinematography glides through the platforms, we are introduced to an eclectic group of people, ranging from a sweet flower girl (Emily Mortimer, Shutter Island) to the quiet owner of a bookshop (Christopher Lee, The Lord of the Rings) to Salvador Dali himself (a brief cameo from Ben Addis). Keeping these colourful characters in order is the stern Inspector Gustave (Sacha Baron Cohnen, Borat). <br/><br/>As the story advances, Hugo meets avid book reader Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz, Kick Ass) and her mysterious grandfather (Ben Kingsley, Gandhi). No sensible film reviewer would reveal any further details of the adventures of Hugo as he befriends Isabelle and begins his search, but it can be said that their discoveries are enough to bring a tear of joy to the eyes of any true cinephile. <br/><br/>It has been said that, so far in his career, Martin Scorsese has directed. at least one masterpiece per decade. In Hugo, he continues that tradition is perfect style and re- establishes himself as one of cinema's greatest living directors. Bravo.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Both an enthralling mystery and a beautiful love letter to cinema, Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" is a visually stunning and emotionally satisfying nostalgia experience for young and old. Simply magic."

","This movie featured beautiful sets, nice cinematography, and good acting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it was also monumentally boring. The movie is supposed to be a ""family movie"" and Scorsese's first movie for kids, but I find it hard to imagine that many children would have the patience to enjoy a movie so dull that even the climax seemed bland and monotonous.<br/><br/>The adolescent girl in the film, Isabelle, remarks that what she really wants is to have an adventure. Unfortunately for her, there is none to be found.<br/><br/>If you watch movies in appreciation of technical achievement, then perhaps Hugo will appeal to you.

You did your imagination proud and sharing it with everyone makes the Great Dreamer pleased.<br/><br/>I did not see this in 3D which isn't a requirement to do that - but someday I will see it in 3D. I understand that this medium is only handled well by you. So I will make a point to. The casting of some of my favorite people - and Christopher Lee was there.<br/><br/>Everything must have been ready to shoot the characters because the children did not age as would have shown had they labored months to complete their parts. My hats off to the sets and imagery makers - the prop people and costumers. My hat is off to the silent movie sequencers - and the energy throughout that sequence.

Congratulations to Asa Butterfield, such a very talented, young actor whom I could only hope to one day work with.

"newidforme","10","4","9","25 February 2012"," Scorsese fixing things!
","The film is very touching. IMO, it inspires at many levels and all the characters themselves draw inspiration from the events of the film. I found it very emotional from all of the character's viewpoint.<br/><br/>The characters were well developed. It has clearly but in a subtle way portrayed:<br/><br/>1) Hugo's great connection with his father 2) Isabelle has read a lot about adventures and all but never had any. She likes many things but doesn't know her purpose and in the end, she does find one. 3) the station inspector had a great feeling for the flower lady but couldn't take a step forward on account of his fears and getting adept to not needing/having a family. 4) Christopher Lee's character and his approach to the world via books<br/><br/>... and many more things that if I start counting will capture every part of the film really. Everyone was a dreamer.<br/><br/>I really like the sequence where Hugo's dream is followed up by another one. That is first of a kind I have seen ever. I may be ignorant if its shown elsewhere, however. But its portrayed in a way that dreams are bizarre but still very much linked to what occupies our mind.<br/><br/>It also showed how the war not only changed the lives of the soldiers and everyone directly involved but also affected may people indirectly. In this case, a film-maker and his entire passion/business and everyone else involved. What a great point the film has made on this front, short but simply brilliant!<br/><br/>Looking at the film made me feel that it would have sounded more befitting if one told me that it was made by Tim Burton and immediately made me recall Edward Scissorhands. But it was Martin Scorsese and when I come to think of it, it is more befitting to him considering the context of the film and history of films more importantly.<br/><br/>The way he feels about the history of cinema, contributions of various film-makers and his encyclopedic knowledge of that, I just could not resist thinking that may be, Scorsese is ""Hugo"" and the child in him is trying to fix things for the forgotten dreamers. I take it as a tribute to all the people who dreamed, loved telling stories via this media and created a magnificent escape from reality, or even show the reality, developed this medium, who are easily forgotten and broken. It mends their hearts with devotion and probably that is why the key to the working of the automaton is also heart shaped which is thing Hugo keeps looking for to fix it.<br/><br/>Ed Wood was my previous favorite trying to attempt that, but this has surpassed it. It doesn't mean Ed Wood isn't brilliant. Of course, in the vast sea of cinema there can be 2 or more ""best"".<br/><br/>Try to see it from Scorsese's eyes as he is the story-teller, try to understand what's said and left unsaid, try to understand the expressions. This film gets a purpose and meaning, many may be. Suit yourself with whatever way you are able to connect with it.<br/><br/>The least it can do for you is inspire you to do something, because machines never come with any extra parts, you know. They always come with the exact amount they need. So, if the entire world was one big machine, you and I couldn't be an extra part. We had to be here for some reason! In the times of deepest troubles, we can still be useful for someone. Someone who may need us."
"nickmesafilms","10","4","9","25 February 2012"," Hugo (2011) - What an Imaginative Rebirth of the Wonders of Cinema!
","After a life-long career of directing bad-ass gangster flicks, and bloody gang films, director Martin Scorsese makes his first ever family film with the use of the newest 3-D technology, and makes one of the most enchanting films in his career, or one of the best motion pictures in cinema history. ""Hugo"" tells the story of a young boy named Hugo Cabret, portrayed wonderfully by Asa Butterfield, who lives in the clock towers of a Paris train station in the 1930s. He tries to find the ingredient needed to help fix a mechanical design, found by his deceased father, portrayed brilliantly in short cameo flashbacks by Jude Law. He then finds a key that might unlock a message from his father. Hugo then goes on a life-changing quest to find the secrets of his father's device, and learn the secrets of one man's wonderful but horrid past. I absolutely loved this brilliant masterpiece, and Scorsese succeeds once again. I've never been amazed by a movie that contained those nostalgic elements. The directing by Martin Scorsese is pure gold, and he makes sure that the audience is along for the ride. Also, the cast is just pure brilliant, from the tall to the small. Asa Butterfield is the scene-stealing performance in the title role, and he delivers the right acting that the audience can relate to. Chloe Grace Moretz is great playing Hugo's only friend, Emily Mortimer is charming as the flower girl, Christopher Lee is terrific as the librarian, Sacha Baron Cohen is excellent as the inspector obsessed with rounding up orphans, but Ben Kingsley delivered most of the credit for playing a tragic toy shop owner, with a beautiful past that he tends to forget. ""Hugo"" is a technological wonder that helps bring this magical world come to life, in front of our eyes. The visual effects are top-notch beautiful, the sound is breathtaking, the 3-D puts you right in the middle of the action, and the art direction feels like stepping into a storybook. I will always remember ""Hugo"" as a wonderful tribute to why movies are being made today. This is a movie that is an homage to the many amazing wonders of going to the movies, and making them. Just like ""The Artist"", this is a love letter to cinema, and it will live on for many cinema lovers to see. ""Hugo"", in my review, ""technologically brilliant, a nostalgic cinema tribute""."

Scorsese with this film, and Woody Allen with ""Midnight in Paris"", have taught us how books and films can melt together to get us lost into this magical world only great directors can describe. There's no doubt that the French are cocky, but the world would not be the same without them. They really are a writer's haven; the place where great minds can express themselves freely without judgments and political demise. The greatest writer of the modern era from my country (Ismail Kadare); a writer and revolutionary nonetheless; found refuge and bloomed in beautiful Paris. And this film; for me; reincarnates how a beautiful minds can bloom in this great country. Thank you Paris. Thank You Scrosese.

","The clocks are wound up. Things are fixed: first a toy mouse, then a robotand then people (""We must fix Papa George!"" decide Hugo and Isabel). Scorsese's film is an enormous mechanical toy. Even those who, in the beginning, appear evil, become good in the end. And everyone revolves, as if they were wound up, within one small space (the train station and Melies' home near that same train station) because a wound-up toy's path also has a constricted space. The purpose of toys, unless they are made by some sort of Scrooge-like Dickens character, is, after all, happiness. This film is made with the same purpose. We can be happy for the old movie director whose becomes lighter once he is rid of the desire to hide his past in a dresser. We can be happy for the orphan boy who finally finds his home. We can be happy for the film historian-professor who had long ago buried his idol but now meets him alive and well. We can be happy for the two comical but very joyful pairs of lovers.<br/><br/>It is so easy to be happy for all of them and for some time to feel the happiness within yourself as well! You can then proceed further in your life, smiling, as long as the key within you is still turning and winding."

","If any film maker in the history of films can get best picture of the year for a 3D film, this will be it. I can say that I don't feel the same way as other critics do about this film, though, where as they say it is a kids film. Sure this is something that can be enjoyed by anyone, and is appropriate for any age, but I can't see little kids being fully engaged throughout this film, especially if they would rather see a penguin dance on screen and just see something simple to the mind. There is plenty of scenes here where it is partly just visuals without dialogue, and then others with a lot of talking that is actually quite brilliant and rare in any family film. This movie is not something simple to take in. In a lot of ways, it is a piece of art that captures what has been lost in film throughout the years from it's climb from the start of when films became films. It captures everything that a great film from decades ago had and yet feels totally fresh. This is something to cherish, and can honestly be called one of the greatest achievements in film history. It makes every other 3D film (including Avatar) looks like amateur work. The performances here are also flawless, and well all in all this is one film I can say IS indeed entirely flawless.

","After seeing the trailers, reading positive reviews and acknowledging the hype, I had high expectations for 'Hugo'. I wasn't disappointed. Martin Scorsese has truly made a masterpiece, and I was thoroughly impressed and delighted by it. Everything about it is just perfect. The subtle understated story, the jaw-dropping setting and special effects are wonderful. The film is the most visually appealing I've seen in a long time. But the best thing by far is the acting. Asa Butterfield (Hugo) is destined to be a star. His performance was extraordinary, as he had to portray many different emotions and every one of them was convincing. The most memorable thing about him are his eyes, as they are so deep and soulful, and really got to me in the sad parts of the film. He was very appealing as Hugo, and I'm sure we will see more of him in the future. Chloe Moretz (Isabelle) was good as well, although her accent faltered slightly, and there were moments where she was a bit OTT. But she complimented Asa nicely as the companion. Ben Kingsley was very touching as the unappreciated film maker, and Sascha Baron Cohen gave a good comedic turn as the station master, though he was a bit scary in parts. I really liked the little clips of old films as well, because this gave the movie a nostalgic feel. One of the only problems I have is the fact it's made out to be a kids film, and I think it's too long for a child to sit through comfortably. In a way it starts off as a child's movie, what with the chase and everything. But then it descends into a more interesting and mature plot in the second half,and this was the point where I was satisfied my 3D ticket had been well worth the price. Best film of 2011; go see it."

His father was a museum curator and watchmaker. Before his death, Hugo's father had found an automaton (mechanical man) which he and Hugo were attempting to fix. <br/><br/>By night, Hugo keeps the clocks in the railway station running. Hugo steals parts from a toymaker (Ben Kingsley) who catches on to Hugo and mentors him. The toymaker is godfather to young orphan Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz, ""Kick-Ass"") who befriends Hugo and insists on seeing his home. Hugo agrees and shows her the automaton and together they get it to work. The first thing it draws is a picture from a movie that Hugo used to watch with his father. And we're off. . .<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Every detail of this film has been made with the utmost care and love. Even the snowflakes are amazing. I saw it in 3D and it is the first 3D movie I have seen that uses 3D artistically, not as a gimmick. There are scenes where the camera runs us through a crowd, and we feel as if we are there, brushing past bystanders. The sets look and sound real. The clockworks within the tower clock and automaton are as real as any wind up clock you know. If director Martin Scorsese had intended to create a masterpiece, then he has succeeded.<br/><br/>The children (Butterfield, Moretz) are heartbreakingly beautiful. They give performances that exude the innocence of youth and a constant sense of urgency. Butterfield in particular plays Hugo as a tortured youngster with a passion for fixing things. In Hollywood movies it is so easy to play young people as wise beyond their years and / or smart- alecky. Instead, these children are three-dimensional with purpose and wonder.<br/><br/>It turns out that this film is not so much the story of an orphan boy, but a wonderful homage to one of film's great pioneers. We get a retrospective of the early days of film and a film history lesson without even knowing it. Scorsese takes up the gauntlet of film innovators who came before and makes his mark in film history by crafting a 3-D movie others will aspire to match. This is clearly an Academy Award winner and instant classic.<br/><br/>So for wonderful acting, amazing effects, beautiful set design, creative storytelling, and a loving tribute to a historical film legend, you must ""see it in the theater."""

One can not help but get chills seeing the characters filled with awe by silent black and white films, especially while gazing upon the visual masterpiece in front of you. <br/><br/>Hugo is about how beautiful movies can be, in more ways than one. The visuals are astounding and take the work of James Cameron to a whole other level. <br/><br/>All these things combined make Hugo a movie miracle, possibly the movie of the year. The dialogue written by the always talented John Logan and the amazing set direction combined with the best use of 3D I have seen yet, causes Hugo to be a touchingly realistic and wonderfully charming fairy tale."

","Grab a croissant and take a seat cause I'm gonna tell you how bad Hugo is just like how bad that introduction was and a little bit of Bad movie This movie was so bad it was like another Sharknado movie Sharknado return of the Sharknado The Sharknado movies at least had something to laugh about but Hugo wasn't as good as the Sharknado movie The only thing good in the movie was the doggies and I think that there was a dog in Sharknado. Sharknado you just can't hate it but Hugo you can hate it how can't you hate it's like the newer Sharknado but worse. Now I've got to make ten lines so I'm just going to add some gibberish the best way to the next day you're there is a very good at the end of the day I have no idea how I feel so good to me that I can see the it is the only way I can want a new song and I love it and I love the way you can get it right up in there"
"christiaanhannes","1","3","6","12 August 2012"," I tried, I really did.
","Like many, I decided to watch Hugo because of the name Scorsese and, additionally, the 5 Oscars. The trailer didn't really work for me, but I thought, hey, it's Scorsese and it won 5 Oscars, it can't be bad. Oh yes it can, apparently. I have literally just finished the film and am now on the IMDb to vent my frustration.<br/><br/>How much do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways: <br/><br/>1. Not one single character spoke to me in any way. That's quite an achievement, I must say.<br/><br/>2. It has somehow become the mark of film-making greatness to 'take your time', or as I would call it, to insert unnecessarily long scenes to 'set the mood'. The start was promising (and by start I mean literally the first few minutes): we see the microcosm of a Paris train station (Gare du Nord, I suppose) through the slightly otherworldly eyes of a young boy. After too many minutes of that, I was out of the film and I never got back in again. This film could've been half as long without losing any of its impact. Everything about it was slow and dragged out, every single dialogue, chase and travel shot. E-very-thing about this film was too long and too slow.<br/><br/>3. The Cohen character was a caricature of itself... but not a funny one. Ouch. No points there. Same goes for the bookseller, the flower lady, the drunk uncle etc. How do you people a universe with characters nobody cares about or is likely to identify with? Must take an Oscar-winning directing legend.<br/><br/>4. Masturbation. That's my word for this type of film: a film director musing on the wonder that is his livelihood, and the academy looking on approvingly. The whole meta-fiction angle can be the starting point of something amazing and genuinely eye-opening, but it sure wasn't this time. The question in my mind every single minute of this film was: what's the point? What are you trying to tell me? What am I invited to share here? No answer in the whole 120 minutes of it. Then it struck me: I'm invited to share in the wonder that is Scorsese! This is 2 hours of the man patting himself on the back. Masturbation. And I paid to watch. Thanks for that.<br/><br/>5. There's only one thing worse in cinematic entertainment than crap, and that's crap you have to like. It's Scorsese! It won 5 Oscars! Note to self: never EVER pick up a film again for any of those two reasons."
"ssvikas","8","3","6","6 May 2012"," A poignant tale worthy of a dream bordering on fantasy!
","At the Academy awards this February, Hugo had 11 nominations (most for that evening) and five wins, including art, cinematography, visual effects and sound. The first scene where the camera swoops over Paris, a train station & to the boy in the clock is in itself spellbinding. But behold, it's not just about special effects and 3D, the story has a heart too, told in with a fairy-tale charm from 1930's Paris. <br/><br/>Hugo Cabret is a young orphaned boy living with his uncle who winds clocks at Montparnasse station in Paris. As long as the clocks work, nobody notices him, but Hugo has to constantly escape the watchful eye of the station inspector Gustave.<br/><br/>In the vast maze of clocks, Hugo hides a broken automaton, which he believes carries a message from his deceased father. To fix it, he steals parts from a toy shop owned by Papa Georges till he gets caught one day. But thereafter, things change between them as Hugo starts to work for Georges and befriends his goddaughter Isabelle who is about Hugo's age. The rest of the tale is better left to be watched on screen.<br/><br/>The film is somewhat based on the real life of yesteryear French film maker Georges Méliès who made around 400 movies. During the WW-II, his studio went into losses and Méliès had destroyed most of his prints in despair while some of the negatives were melted down to recover celluloid and silver. Sadly, only a few of those films remain! As in the film, he spent his later years on meager income from toy store.<br/><br/>The film has some moments that seem unreal, like the automatons; but those actually exist in real life. And then there are repeated shots of the rocket hitting the moon in the eye which is from the silent film ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" meaning ""A Voyage to the Moon"" in a surreal style. Méliès can be considered a pioneer in science fiction movies, although they have a lot to do with fantasy, but nevertheless path breaking!<br/><br/>Among actors, Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliès is touching, other performances are worthy too. Sacha Baron Cohen as the Station Master is probably the best of the rest with Asa Butterfield as Hugo and Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle do well. Although titled 'Hugo' the film has more about Méliès than about Hugo.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Hugo' comes across as a well made film on all quarters. Remember, it's been directed by the acclaimed Martin Scorsese. The film was a worthy Oscar nominee for other categories such as Best Picture, Director, Adapted screenplay, costume, score & editing but bagged no acting nominations.<br/><br/>Although in 3D, this isn't a movie with action figures flying in your way. Told more like a fairy-tale, it goes on at its own slow pace as it takes you through the characters' minds and situations. There are times when one finds like a fantasy movie too. So, if you love movies, this one is absolutely worth your time. Go for it!"
"arginnon","9","3","6","4 May 2012"," 3D or not, a great movie!
","So I decided to go and check out Hugo. For its Oscar nomination and wins, of course, because I'm not very fond of 3D family movies. As it turns out, Martin Scorsese is still Martin Scorsese, even when it comes to directing non-gangster films. He is famous for his movies like Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed, which are the cream of gangster flicks and I understand Scorsese for wanting to try something new. It's not a good thing to be trapped in a genre. Just ask Michael Bay. First I didn't like the idea of 3D Scorsese film, especially a family film, but oh boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>The film reminded me, why I fell in love with movies in the first place. The magic of cinema lingers all around this title, thanks to the amazing skills of Martin Scorsese. Mystery, lovable characters, interesting settings and excitement.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, so I can't compare the movie to that, but I gotta say Hugo is worthy of all its Oscars (best cinematography, best art direction, best sound design and best sound editing), except one: best special effects. That should've went to Harry Potter, hands down. I mean what's so special about some flying papers? The dream- train scene was very well done, but it's nothing more than we already saw in Inception.<br/><br/>The directing is stunning and the cinematography (especially in eye-popping 3D) is spectacular. The story sometimes gets slow, although it's entertaining throughout, the delightful performances of all the actors spice up the film, it's inspirational, it's wonderfully done, charming and touching. Though if the story doesn't grab you, you can always entertain yourself with the amazing visuals, the lovely music and the fantastic directing.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to all, all ages will like it, except, maybe, rebellious teens."
"Laakbaar","9","3","6","20 April 2012"," Artistry and craftsmanship
","""Hugo"" consists of three movies really. The first movie is the story of the orphan Hugo, his automaton and his mechanical secret world behind the clock. The second movie is the story of a Parisian train station ca. 1930, and its immediate environs, an impossibly charming and romantic place richly filled amusing Parisian characters and human interaction. The third movie is the story of Georges Méliès, apparently all true.<br/><br/>Stripped to its bare essentials, the movie's theme is artistry and craftsmanship: the love of clockwork, the love of romantic places and the love of film. Each of these movies and themes has its own characters, plot and pace, but they are interwoven into a single movie. The movie is so rich I'm sure I missed much of it in my single viewing. <br/><br/>""Hugo"" is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. It's not a realistic adult world. There are no politics, no violence, no sex. There is a touch of slapstick, two dimensional characterisation. You'll enjoy this film more if you're at least a little in touch with your inner child. Hugo is a brave and precocious hero, having great adventures in a precarious world. Asa Butterfield played the role beautifully.<br/><br/>But nor is it completely a children's movie. We come out of it with a much better understanding of early film-making. And the visual imagery is at times jaw-droppingly beautiful. And of course it makes you fall in love with Paris all over again, even if Scorsese's Paris is one of the imagination.<br/><br/>This is an unusual and visually beautiful movie, something I wasn't expecting. It's more of an experience than a movie. Go see it. Go."
"Craig_su","9","3","6","10 April 2012"," What a Refreshing Adventure Film, ... wait, cross Adventure out. Simply refreshing.
","Why 3D?<br/><br/>I am not a 3D movie fan, basically. It's a fancy way of filming, with little value to the content of the movie. (I mean, would it hurt if I watch Titanic in 2D? It won't. That's what we did dated back in 10 years. It changes nothing when the studio re-releasing its reedited 3D version.) Not to mention those movies in 3D are almost summer flicks. Although I am not a Sanjay's father in Modern Family, I am sure I'm not a Phil, not a Crocotopus in 3D movie goer. What's more, all the promotions provided by theaters are gone if you are to watch a movie in 3D in Taiwan. And the annoying add-on to your nose for 2 hours and more.<br/><br/>Maybe, just maybe, this 3D feature could be mainstream someday, just like filming in color and voice retiring monologues. But before that,<br/><br/>Let's welcome Hugo, the movie that transcends the past and future. The movie that holds dreams dear.<br/><br/>The angle of filming has focused on Hugo. From a little boy's eyes, Paris seemed so saturated with colors. The cinematography is so delicate that makes me think of crystal balls with snows in it. Of course this is not a reflection of Hugo's life, not a reflection on how miserable Hugo is. It's a reflection of Hugo's character. He is positive, and he has a will. He is so devoted to this broken robot saved by his unfortunate father. He believed that after fixing this robot, he will find something related to him and his dad. Besides that, and the crappy job of maintaining the clock at train station, that is all he got.<br/><br/>But this is not the only storyline in the movie. Martin cleverly blended Georges Méliès's real (and fictional) life here. With a boy's point of view, George has transformed from a grumpy old mechanic store owner, into a former pioneer in the film industry crashed by his own dream. I tasted the bitterness, George's bitterness. The boy unconsciously teared up everything George wanted to hide away for so long, because of the search of the mystery his dad left to him. This grumpy old man had to face everything went through his eyes, all over again. I see the pain, also the trace of his dreams, reviving awaited.<br/><br/>And this is why the film should be praised. What Martin just did is to retrace everything deemed pioneer to this film industry into this boy's fantasy film (wait this is a weird phrasing). Some ""special effects"" dated back may be ridiculous at present time, but without these, you will not have your Lord of the Rings Triloigy now. And the best part is, these reminiscing scenes are in 3D. You don't get to experience the first time that showing a video with a train driving towards the camera. But you get to watch the crowd shocked by the video, in 3D. To me, Martin has successfully incorporate technologies with fantastic story, not just a carrier of a film.<br/><br/>The portrait of the relationship between George and the Jeanne is stunning. The love between them is significantly related to their career, filming. She's his brightest star, after all. After the war destroying every bit of his dream, hers can't be existed alone for sure. When the excitement of making films gone, the flicker of the passion in their eyes were gone, as well. That became a serious taboo in the household, then fear. Thank God it isn't gone forever. When Hugo brought back the remaining film preserved by a historian, I see the excitement lights up her eyes. Then my eyes misted.<br/><br/>I won't categorize Hugo as an adventure movie, if this category can only be available to Caribbean-like flicks. You won't get an adrenaline- overdosed body after watching this. It's a breath of fresh air, with fulfillment.<br/><br/>http://morissett.pixnet.net/blog/post/30597186 Also review in Chinese."
"gkeith_1","10","3","6","25 March 2012"," Good, interesting movie
","Atmosphere in trailer reminded me of Harry Potter-Hogwarts movies because of the train. That's one reason I wanted to see this movie. Johnny Depp's company making this movie made sense when I consider all the fantasy roles played by Depp. Scorsese excellent, teaching us more about the early silent movies. I thought the era was 1920s, judging by some of the clothes in this movie, but later I read that it was 1931. World War One also apparently killed Broadway, not just movies. After that period - WWI, IMO, lots of stage actors went Hollywood, including the Barrymores - John, Ethel and Lionel. There was more money to be made in Hollywood than on the NY boards.<br/><br/>This movie supposed to be in Paris I thought, but lots of actors had British accents. This is not good, but as the movie wore on I forgot all about that.<br/><br/>Loved all the dogs in this movie. Were the small brown dogs supposed to be male and female? If so, I expected them to start co-mingling and making a litter of little brown puppies any second now.<br/><br/>Reading about Melies' life, Jeanne was his second wife and not in his early movies as depicted in this movie. Still, the actress here did a splendid job.<br/><br/>I feel that Tabard was really Scorsese, being a movie historian and doing everything he could to preserve early cinema.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Hugo - Go and dream with Martin Scorsese!!<br/><br/>Hugo – the latest movie by Martin Scorsese brought us the magical cinematic experience that we first felt when we had just begun understanding what movies were all about and the insatiable happiness that followed. This work by Scorsese is his first attempt at 3 D and saying that Hugo's very good is a gross understatement. Exceptional cinematography, marvelous acting, dynamic screenplay and the maximum Oscar nominations (11) do explain just a fleck about the preeminence of Hugo. Hugo in fact won 5 of them.<br/><br/>Set in 1930s, Hugo's inspired by the life of a French illusionist and filmmaker Georges Méliès played by Sir Ben Kingsley. The main protagonist is Hugo played by 14 year old Asa Butterfield who awed people with his brilliance in the holocaust movie The Boy in the striped pyjamas. Hugo also boasts off a highly noteworthy supporting cast including Sir Christopher Lee, Sacha Baron Cohen, Chloe Moretz , Emily Mortimer and Jude Law. Scorsese draws emotions from situations and not just characters and Butterfield and Kingsley did more than justice to their characters. Sacha as a shy and conscientious station master stood out as well.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the essence and rich freshness of the movie, Hugo's an incredibly lovely work of art to be enjoyed by everyone. If you want to fall in love with movies once again, Hugo may not be such a bad idea. Its a 9 for me."

","If I were to describe this film in one word it would be: beautiful. For once, here is a movie that fills you with a sense of child-like wonder and awe. The cinematography is simply brilliant and the actors are spot-on in their roles.<br/><br/>Now the story: A little boy by the name of Hugo lives in a train station in Paris. During the day, he sneaks around and repairs the clocks. However when he's not working, Hugo spends his days stealing from an elderly toymaker and using the parts to put together an automaton. After being caught by the toymaker, Hugo is forced to work fixing his toys. Eventually, He finds a friend in the toymaker's grand-daughter, Isabelle, and together they set out for a series of adventures. And discover the toymaker's history. For you see, the toymaker is none other than Georges Melies, an early filmmaking pioneer. And from that point on, I won't tell the rest.<br/><br/>You simply must see the movie to appreciate and enjoy its rich story and wonderful characters. Speaking personally, I loved learning about Melies in college, and was more than thrilled when this movie came out. This justifiably won quite a few Academy Awards.

"dhaufrect-1","10","3","6","13 March 2012"," A delightful piece of Museum quality artwork is ""Hugo""
","Martin Scorcese has directed another museum quality piece of artwork in his cinema, ""Hugo"". It is written by John Logan with screenplay by Brian Selznick and it is a must see film. My only regret is waiting for the Blu Ray since I do not have the 3D enhancement that really must have made a huge difference in the actual theaters. It is set in the 1930's in Paris, and the depth of field and fading perspectives are spectacular even without glasses. The colors are brilliant, and the acting is especially well due in part to Scorceses perfect casting. The boy is very intense yet innocent. His intrigue with the past as well as his interaction with the other characters brings tears to ones eyes. Ben Kingsley emotes a fine performance as an artist with emotion that permeates the screen. Sacha Baron Cohen is superbly cast as the station inspector who has humor, discipline and finally a delicate heart that matches his empathy for Hugo. Even the former Vampire character, Christopher Lee, plays Monsieur Labisse and he too has a heart as good a gold. ""Hugo"" is a film to be seen by all ages. It entangles the soul in a very compelling manner, and I recommend to see it in the original 3D if you can find it in such projection. Don't miss it even if you see it on the Blu Ray Disc, it is a treat to be relished and treasured for a very long time to come."
"ayoreinf","10","3","6","11 March 2012"," What 3D is supposed to be like
","Just saw the film - and it's as good as everybody says it is but not only for the reasons specified. I mean it is a love song to old cinema and its sources. It's superbly acted by all the actors involved, and it does carry the signature of Scorsese's genius with every frame. But the aspect I want to speak about is his magnificent use of the 3D technique.- Every picture is multi-layered, both visually and thematically, which means that the visual aspect of the film always reflects its intentions, its ideas - the way that truly good films are supposed to be. I've seen the 3D technique wasted in so many films of the last three years or so. Used for one or two scenes in a film with the real purpose of charging extra at the box office, not this time. Ever since Cameron revived the technique it was mostly misused go and see Hugo in 3D, and you'll see what it's supposed to look like. And also see how it serves the movie and not the producers wish to cash in. All else has already been said but for me this aspect of the film brilliance can never be stressed enough."

He is trying to restore an automaton left to him by his dead father. Every day he winds the clocks and hides from the inspector who will send him to an orphanage if he catches him.<br/><br/>The story unfolds seamlessly and includes just enough surprises to make the viewer never lose interest. The back story which depicts the early pre World War I film making lends texture and believability to the ephemeral plot.<br/><br/>Highly recommended to the discerning movie goer; although, it is not strictly for children."

","When I first heard about Martin Scorsese was going to direct a family adventure movie, I said to myself I had to check thiz out! As we know before, Scorsese is a Director who is widely known for most of his gangster and violent movies such as ""Casino"" (1995), ""The Departed"" (2006) and ""Shutter Island"" (2010). Since the opening sequence, we are spoiled with such fantastic panoramic scenery. Dynamic camera movements effectively draw you into the story in a split second, where we follow the daily life of an orphan named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) in 1930s France. Hugo lives inside the tower clock of a crowded train station. By his curiosity, Hugo has been trying to fix an automaton in human form that his father (played by Jude Law) left him. Not long after, it takes him to Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley) with his toy booth. The premise is about the mystery behind it. Asa Butterfield, the boy who played in ""The Boy in Striped Pajamas"" in 2008, seems to be a proper choice for Hugo. His sad blue eyes tell everything. Ben Kingsley also delivers a firm and attractive performance. Only after about an hour, the things become more clearly. Apparently, thiz movie tells about the magical world of movie-making. I have to underline thiz, the whole package is visually stunning! I'm amazed by its remarkable setting, the exotic lighting schemes and the exquisite cinematography. Everything at its best, everyone can tell. The story is filled with various unique characters which are played by well-known Actors, there are the adventuress Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who is Papa Georges's goddaughter, the grumpy station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), the flower girl Lisette (Emily Mortimer), the kind-hearted librarian Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee) and still many more to mention. But if you want to be objective, most of these characters can be pushed away easily without too much ruining the main plot. I mean everyone! They are only here to become unimportant extras. Except for the station inspector, he is the only antagonist, we still need him! The character is played comically well by Sacha Baron Cohen. Without him, there will be no chasing scene and nail-biting suspense. Clearly, the main frame of the story is not that complicated at all. In fact, it's kind of flat and anticlimax. To tell you the truth, I didn't have ""The Wow Factor"" for the ending. Well, I never read the book before, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" by Brian Selznick. So I cannot tell you whether or not, disadvantage of the story is derived from basic material. However, thiz is an award winning book, it has won Caldecott Medal in 2008. In that case, if it's true that is the whole story. What we can say Scorsese has already done one hell of a job. Hugo said, ""Movie had the power to capture dream"" and Scorsese has definitely captured one perfectly.

Hugo had found a lot of unwanted bolts and with all of the bolts he made an automaton which is a little metal robot that could right how it was feeling.

"zaciogeribello","9","3","6","21 February 2012"," There's Something About Movies
","A simple story, a boy and a girl, both orphans, meet each other and together they try to fix a mysterious automaton. The boy lives alone hidden behind the big watches of a train station in Paris. The girl lives with her godparents, an average old couple, she is a housekeeper and he owns a toy booth at the station. The boy Hugo and the old man George are in permanent conflict, because Hugo is always trying to thieve little pieces from mechanisms in the store, so he could fix the automaton. They actually have an ambiguous relationship, because George also seems to be a little curious about that boy, it seems they have something in common, some affinity or something to share. The antagonism between them is therefore surrounded by a strange affection or even it is a seed of friendship, a fight that could work in benefit of them two, but gradually involves everyone in the movie.<br/><br/>Well, that was just the basic. Things get complicated; everything starts to get tied with each other, forming a mechanism itself, the ""big watch"". Making this microcosm function perfectly again demands a series of complicated tasks, dealing with relationships, feelings and the rules of the world that sooner or later will imply big changes in the life of each character. But this will only happen if Hugo, Isabelle and George manage to solve their own problems. The automaton remains in the center of the plot all the time. The train station is full of people, it has an intense movement and there is a lot of activities going on, as Scorsese said, everybody is searching for something about their lives.<br/><br/>This movie is so rich of meanings, languages and images; it's like a growing concert, a little bit like Ravel's Bolero, most of the time. I'd dare say that it is not just about the magic of movies - imagination, dream, adventure, magic, drama, entertainment, feelings..., although it's already so much, and it's not limited to the story of these specific characters, and those already work as a big stream of signs and facts being released, but it is kind of a legacy or testimony of Scorsese's career. These three perspectives interact; they work together, one reinforcing the other, all under the director's baton. Scorsese's work is this diverse and wide knowledge about making movies, an experience through decades exploring all kinds of possibilities.<br/><br/>We have then a simple story but an intense dancing of signs, images and languages, through a timeless and endless story, if you wish. It is eventually about movies today also, and not only about the memory of movie making. These eras are all contained in the movie, somehow, but there is an outcome, which is Hugo's Invention. That is a metalanguage, there is a little trick in here, because Hugo didn't actually invent the automaton, he just had it under his care, to try to fix it, he had his reasons. So, if he did invent something in this story, and it is highly suggested that he did, what was it? Hugo invented the story itself, meaning, he produced it, together with the movie makers. The fact is that it's very hard to trace a boundary among the main lines of the plot, because they are all interlaced. Hugo works somewhere in between fiction and reality. That is the magic of the movies, enhanced in this one. But, there would be any place like that in the real world? Yes, of course: the imagination.<br/><br/>This richness of meanings was also present in the book that originated the movie - I saw after writing this review. Brian Selznick, the author of the book, had said before that his work was a combination of medias and languages. Well, but Scorsese did it in the big screen, with amazing results.<br/><br/>The final result is this big interaction that happens when you watch a movie, and the several impacts and consequences that movies really have in our lives. They help us in our searches; help us find a purpose, a place, something to do with our life, to find the happy endings of it, in everything we do. These ""external"" effects are also present in Hugo."

This is very possibly the best I've seen in the past 9-12 months.<br/><br/>The 3-D was the VERY BEST use of that technology I've ever seen. Most of the time, 3-D is just used as an excuse to throw crap out of the screen at you. It usually just reminds you of just how very TWO-DIMENSIONAL the movie you're viewing IS. The best 3-D is used to make you feel like you're there--IN the movie. This is just such an excellent example of that.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent--Even Sacha Baron Cohen's over-the-top train-station inspector was good. Mind you, I wouldn't usually credit Cohen with any acting skill.<br/><br/>An homage to the work of Georges Méliès is long-overdue, too. I'm a huge fan of silent cinema, and was pleased to learn more about Méliès and to feel the wonder that he must have inspired in a youngster of that era.<br/><br/>The only thing I would fault the film on is the fact that this is a film set in Paris--yet everybody except Cohen has some manner of English accent. Why is it that so many English-language films set in countries in which English is not the primary language give the characters some sort of British accent? Small peeve, sure, but this still so often rankles.<br/><br/>This is a must-see, and I do hope it reaps a raft of Oscars."
"dfranzen70","9","3","6","6 February 2012"," Dazzling not-kiddie fare from Scorsese makes great use of 3D for once
","This imaginative movie about movies is charming, sentimental, and quaint. It is not really for kids (they'll get bored by the plot), although it sustains a level of wonder and joy you don't expect from a Martin Scorsese film. Hugo will rekindle a love for the movies for some and open up an entirely new universe to others. Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who lives in a train station, making sure the giant clocks all run on time. He's been deserted by his soused uncle (Ray Winstone), and his parents are long gone. Hugo is alone with his clock machinery and some various doodads from his father, including an old automaton that had been programmed to write and draw. The automaton requires a special key to be activated, and once Hugo locates said key, the real mystery, involving the proverbial wheels within wheels, just like clockwork, is afoot.<br/><br/>As an orphan, Hugo must steal food in order to live. He also takes tools so he can work on the automaton, and he's caught by a toymaker named Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley). Méliès has a granddaughter, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, who takes pity on the poor Hugo and helps him in his quest to solve the riddle of the automaton. When Isabelle and Hugo finally do get the automaton working, they find their plans shifting from a connection between the automaton and Hugo's late father and to the previous owner of the automaton, who identity shall remain a mystery here.<br/><br/>I'm not a paid reviewer, so I figure it's okay if I take the cheap route and offer up a bad pun. The movie is timely. More than 100 years have passed since the invention of motion pictures, and there are so many people who have no idea what those early films were like. Scorsese, a longtime movie historian, knows all too well his audience, and he gradually allows them to assimilate within the friendly confines of a boy-with-a-mysterious-past story before inviting them into the early world of movies.<br/><br/>This is a 3D movie, by the way, and it's the rarest of birds – the kind in which the 3D doesn't attack you like you owe it even more money but rather the kind you don't notice until you need to notice it. Scorsese, ever the perfectionist, uses the medium to its utmost, with a terrific sense of when to hold back and when to hold forth. Not bad at all for his first foray into the new hip way of shooting movies. So, for me, the 3D version of this film is definitely worthwhile.<br/><br/>By the final 20 minutes or so of the movie, I was absolutely entranced by what had by then become an homage to older films, to the very dawn of cinema. Scorsese takes great pains to show how difficult it was for fledgling filmmakers to make a movie look so easy. No special effects, no budget, handmade costumes – it was like working with a small grammar school. At one point we are shown an early reel, from the nineteen- aughts, and it's in color. A character explains that although the movie was shot in black and white, the crew painstakingly hand-colored various scenes to add a touch of tint. It's a beautiful detail that I assume is true, as Scorsese, in the framework of a lost-child plot, seeks to educate those of us who are not film historians.<br/><br/>And by the end of the movie, the wonderful, poignant performances by Kingsley, Butterfield, Moretz, and Helen McCrory dissolved my senses. There are several touching moments in the waning minutes of the film, and the cast hits all of the right notes. Hugo would serve as a poetic coda if this were the end of the great director's career, but even so it's a love note to the world of movies, translated for a wide, new audience."

","When I saw the original trailer for Hugo, I really didn't think much about it. However, I recognised a few of the cast members and such. A few days later, I came across the trailer again and promised myself I'd keep an eye on the film and be sure to check it out. Come opening day, I'm watching the movie and falling in love with it.<br/><br/>Let me just say that the first trailer is extremely misleading. It tells absolutely nothing about the movie, and you'd never know what it was really about. It's not just some goofy movie about a train and a ridiculous Doberman; it's an emotional story that'll play with your heartstrings and pretty much every emotion possible. I was crying throughout, but I was laughing, smiling, and feeling completely awestruck at the same time.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese was correct to refer to Asa Butterfield (Hugo Cabret) as ""the heart of the film."" He's an incredibly talented actor and that really showed during this movie. He had me tearing up a lot. Other fantastic cast members include Chloë Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer, and Helen McCrory.<br/><br/>Another wonderful part about this movie is Howard Shore's score. Everything fit perfectly with each moment and really tied the film together. The music is magical, wondrous, and Academy Award-worthy. In fact, there are several things in this movie that are ""Academy Award- worthy""; cinematography, art direction, score, sound, screenplay, etc. <br/><br/>In a movie that shows us about an old master of cinema, who better to put it together than a master of cinema himself? Martin Scorsese does an excellent job with the material and it just blew me away. Every object is part of the story, from the hands on the clock to the dust particles in the station. See it in 3D if you can.<br/><br/>Hugo teaches us more than just the importance of cinema, but also that there are no extra parts in the world... everything has a purpose.<br/><br/>This is the best movie of the year, and that's not an exaggeration in the slightest. I've yet to meet someone who wasn't left completely awestruck by this movie. The entire audience broke into﻿ applause and tears after every time I've seen it. Inspiring, magical, unforgettable, beautiful, heartfelt... that is Hugo."
"Likes_Ninjas90","9","3","6","22 January 2012"," Hugo is dark, sometimes sad but eventually uplifting; a family film built on the oldest and newest techniques of storytelling
","There is no such thing as a kids film anymore. More accurately, as the quality of animation has steadily risen, major studios like Pixar have matched their technical achievements with narratives that are emotionally and humanly complex. Pixar has openly stated that they don't make films for children, they make films for everyone. Although Hugo is not an animated film, it reminded me pleasantly of this rather old fashioned attitude to cinema. This is a return to traditional family entertainment at its most charming, intelligent and beautiful. It is also one of Martin Scorsese's most unique and personal films, one that speaks to multiple generations and reminds us that he is still a master craftsman. It is important to consider some of the autobiographical details that attracted Scorsese to the film. As a child in the early 1940s, Scorsese was often kept in isolation because he suffered from terrible asthma. The only accessible activity for him was to be taken to the cinema to watch movies. These are important staples in Hugo's narrative and its formal composition. <br/><br/>The opening establishment shots of the film are sumptuous, overlooking the Parisian rooftops littered with snowflakes. The ice is symbolic because in conjunction with Scorsese's subtle blue colour filters and dark shadows, he constructs a lonely vision of an isolated childhood, one that is spent in dark, steamy tunnels. By contrast, the station is filmed with brighter tones and is more spacious to accommodate the mass number of bodies pouring through. Many of these characters are dressed with muted, grey and brown costumes to reflect the sombre tone of the period. Scorsese is a director of great experience and one who continually associates stylisation with purpose and effect. This extends from his fine attention to detail for the period and into the third dimension. The 3D technology is not an afterthought but employed to accentuate the height and the depth of rooms. It enhances not only the shape and the character of the architecture but it also increases our involvement with these spaces too. <br/><br/>With a screenplay by John Logan, adapted from Brian Selznick's novel, the narrative strikes a perfect balance for both adults and children, further blurring the lines between what is a kids film and pure family entertainment. The film is classically told, meaning that it unfolds at a very leisurely pace. This will be a testing element for small children (and some adults) but it is also highlights one of the most satisfying elements of the narrative: its patience. Scorsese takes such care with what is essentially a mystery but an extremely comprehensible one. We are hooked by who these fascinating characters are and then with each act their stories and motives unfold with utter clarity. It really makes each piece of the puzzle more rewarding and it is further aided by strong levels of continuity between each thread. Although the film is pegged as a family film, it is one concerned by loss, failure and repressed memories. Yet it is also a celebration of our artistic sensibilities that make us human. The film argues, quite rightly, that humans are systematic and mechanical in their habits and flaws. Yet unlike machines, humans have personal thoughts and there is often a desire to not only change our lives but to celebrate and share our experiences through modern inventions, like cinema. Is there a more beautiful, life-affirming message than that? Scorsese's love for cinema and the way that it unites people is to me a deeply moving quality, one that comes out most poignantly through his seamless mixture of silent films and 3D technology. The combination of the two is further evidence of cinema's irrefutable sustainability. <br/><br/>The humanity, crucial to the film's messages, is provided by a cast of distinct, colourful characters and faultless performances. Butterfield is a revelation as Hugo, a completely natural little boy, with such fierce determination and backbone. Yet it is the sense of vulnerability, loss and emotion that makes him a sympathetic and compelling lead of great conviction. His partner in crime Chloë Grace Moretz is entirely different but no less appealing. Her warmth and her enthusiasm for adventure, courtesy of her expressive face, are infectious and irresistible qualities. She's a wonderful pint-sized sidekick. Kingsley is once again all class. The strength of his performance is that he is so cold early on and yet by the end of the film, as we come to understand his existence, he moves us more than we could ever expect through his heartfelt transformation. Sasha Baron Cohen and the delightful Emily Mortimer, playing a florist, share a sweet subplot together and he's surprisingly restrained for once. Although I could have done with perhaps one less chase scene and a few more moments with her character as she has the most endearing presence with almost any film she is in. These performances are collectively linked together by loss, meaning that Hugo is dark, sometimes sad but eventually uplifting; a family film built on the oldest and newest techniques of storytelling. It is in every sense a film for everyone."

","This visually dazzling film is Martin Scorsese's tribute to the history of cinema. The film celebrates the escapist roots and pioneers of the art form that quickly became the most popular and influential of the modern era. The wide-eyed title character, Hugo Cabret, is drawn unlike most child characters in the movies. He has real integrity and curiosity; features contributed mainly by John Logan's warm script and Asa Butterfield's performance. The film also doesn't talk down to it's audience even though it's a family film. It still remains both elegant and innocent giving children and adults two different film experiences. For kids (I wouldn't recommend the film to very young children) the film is an adventure full of eye-popping visuals. For adults however, the film is a tale of redemption and second chances.<br/><br/>In the last act of the film, the characters frequently reference the magic of cinema and it's transportive quality. It's at this point in the film that we realise that Scorsese has been working that very same magic established by filmmakers such as Melies, Keaton and Lloyd on us."

","i was expecting a passionately crafted visual spectacle of a lighthearted, lovely story. the film pretty much excels in all fronts. much has been said about the cinematic virtues, from the indeed jaw- dropping tracking shot early on (a completely crazy camera traveling. an occupation of space that marvelously defines the geography and imposes Scorsese's singular vision of this universe) to the animated recreation of the silent films, through the enhancing atmospheric use of 3D (this is the first 3D film i see. and the fact is i never bothered much with 3D. but the 3D here serves as a toy, or rather a tool, allowing Marty to exercise his art, embracing the most advanced technology of the moment to pay tribute to his ancestor, who had grasped that film could not be dissociated from technology and that it should be nourished from it) and all of it looks as gorgeous as one could hope for.<br/><br/>throughout his years, Martin Scorsese never ceased to scream his love for cinema, which transpires references indirectly inside of his work, apparitions and implications in restoration of heritage films. yet he never really attacked it from the front, to make it the heart of his films, his cinephilia. with Hugo, he had the opportunity and through the adventures of this young orphan, he finally introduces one of cinema's great magicians George Méliès. nevertheless, this should not limit Hugo to a simple homage. this story is so huge, modern and nostalgic all at once, it takes everything in its path.<br/><br/>i find a lot of merit in the story-telling approach. without skimping on a burlesque humor that sparingly distills it, the film delivers a tale not as cruel as tradition demands but very sad. this sadness doesn't appear immediately, it is gradually established as the figure of George Méliès gradually emerges. we then switch through gigantic mechanical workings, to get to something very human. touchingly symbolized by the repair of the automaton. and as Hugo said, everything has a reason for being. this film is magical in a raw sense, and sometimes, it doesn't shy away from being literally magical, adventurously spirited<br/><br/>surprisingly for a Scorsese picture, i found the editing to be a bit rushed on the chase scenes.. but for a film that aspires to represents a timeless ideal, i'm willing to forgive every little detail, should i feel like nitpicking on"
"Vezon123","9","3","6","5 January 2012"," About the movie magic
","The film was concerned more with the first news. Still, the family of Martin Scorsese's film - it's a little unusual, but it is tempting - especially with such actors. In the end, ""Keeper of Time"" does not confirm the fears and exceeds all expectations - with Scorsese got something that does not always work out in the cinema itself, not to mention the individual directors. In front of us - Magic straight from childhood, and it does not matter when it was his childhood - you feel it, not as a modest retrospective. But in order ...<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese in fact - a living classic of cinema, without which it is difficult to imagine the genre of crime films, besides, he was always very talented stylist, and his films were full of very interesting mounting solutions. Does he use this experience in ""Keepers of Time""? Yes, but very selectively. It is encouraging that being on unfamiliar territory, Martin Scorsese did not cling to what he knew numbers and techniques. ""Keeper ..."" looks fresh and at the same time, so it seems that love this movie for a long time. Directed exactly what is honest with his audience, it does not work on some kind of target audience: the film is not lisp, but we do not like regular dark realism, a favorite in modern cinema.<br/><br/>And the movie itself - it's a film about magic movie, which is now made to bury under the gloomy scenarios and effects tones. Yes, in the ""Guardian ..."" is not so simple. The protagonist - Hugo Cabra (young, but very entertaining Asa Butterfield) lost his father and forced to live at the train station, watching the clock, and around him, at first glance, it is not friendly people in more accidents and broken - the same as Toys, which sells old magician (Sir Kingsley ene) or leg cruel, but a lone inspector (mustached Sacha Baron Cohen) ... all - like broken clockwork, which never have enough gear, so that they could go further. Thus, the magician will be a real magician - though from the world of cinema, just stopped believing in magic, and evil is not evil inspector, just such a life.<br/><br/>The characters here are classic and the film does without surprises. But as he presents them - through the whole picture is not so much a story of growing up, but simply finding yourself. Asa Butterfield played as such can only play so children - clean and quite technical, but with talent. Chloe Moretz, the young, but the star, it looks much more natural than in the same ""Let me in"" or ""Piptse."" Sound terribly old-fashioned role of a girl who dreams of adventure, Chloe looked better than in the roles of girls coming off limbs for people. It was nice to see the big actors - such as Kingsley (as very important for the movie rights), or Christopher Lee. Living legends, they are people usual, but with tremendous spark. Ben Kingsley has turned terribly vulnerable, and bereguschim themselves from large shocks - unlike his other books. Christopher Lee plays the one his monumental charisma, singing - only then - the owner of a bookshop. Sacha Baron Cohen has shown himself not as a chief mocker and troll movie, but as an actor. Yes, its inspector - is a collective image of the employees of all law enforcement agencies, and the stage with delivery of orphans and Doberman explicitly mocked the Nazis, but throughout the film are left covered by this story, these characters do not notice a dirty trick. Especially as Cohen demonstrates really cool game - not only funny but also touching. As for Jude Law and Ray Winston, they are treacherous enough. But Lowe's is charming and sweet as his father Hugo and Winston is the image of the watchmaker-drinkers.<br/><br/>In fact, Scorsese filmed a movie about all - and of themselves, and many of the spectators, even the very young. In a world of endless sequels, gloomy and serious restarts no longer believe in the magic of cinema, which it had once granted the. It is significant that the director in whose films reflect the worst vices of men, took the wise but not preachy film. Even in the most vivid and dramatic moments ""Hraniel time"" is kept straight with his audience. He does not need to surprise the beauty of these Paris 30s (and they are great!) Or lecture. After all, a movie - it's magic, which is sometimes not necessary to have a double bottom, and let it remain a focus, but it gives people pleasure. In this respect, ""The Guardian of Time"" - Cinema with a capital letter, not intended for a specific age or age group. The film is beautiful inside and outside of his ideas - a panorama of Paris and the railway station were worth every dollar 170,000,000th budget, and embodied it with great talent and surprisingly gently, carefully.<br/><br/>Best story of the year! I am glad that the movie recently lifted from the abyss mrachnyaka - Project Master ""Super 8"", ""The Adventures of Tintin"" and now ""Guardian of time"" once again make Cinema what he must be - a place where dreams are happening!<br/><br/>P.S. Could not find the place to describe Howard Shore soundtrack. Well you can not make the entire tip of the words ""magic"" and ""great""! Music turned out to Shore atypical - all very gently and easily, with a great deal of French sounds. In the movie sound track Camille St-Seyesa and Erik Satie - Howard Shore is clearly inspired by the works of these classics ..."

","Martin Scorsese doing a family movie? Really? After a spew of some of the most violent gangster movies ever made, one could possibly think that Scorsese has gone daffy for taking such a vast turn in another film genre. I eventually overcame this bafflement and went to see ""Hugo"" this morning. Having the entire theater to myself, I found myself having an ultimate experience in movie magic.<br/><br/>I had the assumption that this movie is about an orphan named Hugo (Asa Butterfield) who wanders endlessly in a train station and finds something magical about it. I'm only partially correct, there is an orphan and he lives in a train station, but there is no actual magic per se in this movie. Rather the focus is on the orphan's late father (Jude Law) and a toyshop owner (Ben Kingsley). Somehow there is a connection between the two. All the while he meets some friends and desperately avoids a dimwitted, yet cruel train station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). The plot in it of itself is relatively simple, but the level mystery that Hugo uncovers about the toyshop owner keeps the film interesting. The movie does not fly by; it feels like a two-hour movie. Yet not one single minute is dull.<br/><br/>The cast is very good, especially Sacha Baron Cohen. I can't help but compare him to the child catcher in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."" He's well groomed, has a whip, and even has a vicious dog. All he needed was a net to catch children in. Ben Kingsley at first comes off as a grumbling, cranky old man, but as the story progresses, he becomes a thoroughly likable character. I am also very pleased that Christopher Lee plays a significant part in this film. The actor is going on 90 years old and he is still in movies—simply outstanding! The child actors though are what keep the movie together. Asa Butterfield does not have many lines, but he delivers them with the appropriate emotion with each scene. Much of his acting talent comes from his facial expressions, for he is able to portray sorrow and despair very well. Chloe Grace Moretz outshines Asa though as the more outgoing and steadfast Isabelle. What I enjoy most about this movie is the production quality that the filmmakers put into it. <br/><br/>The set and costume designs are some of, if not the best I have ever seen in a movie (leave it to the imaginative geniuses of Dante Ferretti and Sandy Powell). They certainly help shape the film's time period. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is stunning and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is flawless. Howard Shore's mystical score adds another dimension to the film. It's nice that he created an entirely different sound for ""Hugo"" and did plagiarize off of himself, unlike some more prominent film composers. I imagine this must have been hard for Shore to pull off, after doing such inspiring work for ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy."" ""Hugo"" is a well-crafted, well-acted, enjoyable movie that is both humorous and sad, and it pays a wonderful homage to the silent film era. As Hugo says in the feature, ""Movies are our special place."""
"thesar-2","6","3","6","15 December 2011"," A Hugo Spectacular
","One of my favorite movies-going experiences is to go into the theatre barely knowing ANYTHING of the film I'm about to see. It's a rare occasion, since I've studied film since I was probably 10ish. With Hugo, I CHOOSE not to read too much about it and the one trailer I saw was months ago, I believe. All I heard from critics I admire, was I needed to see it in the theatre and with Real 3D. So, I went with almost zero knowledge of what I was about to see. Heck, from the preview I slightly remembered, I thought it was another Polar Express-type animated film.<br/><br/>Wrong. On the Polar Express part, of course. Though, the opening segment confirmed what I thought I remembered – it did sure as Hades look like a CGI'd/digital world. Then we see little Hugo, all real-life like and the movie continues in the real world.<br/><br/>Oh, and what an opening it was! Exciting, fun, adventurous, thrilling and inventive. I knew the movie was over two hours – only because I was trying to coordinate a double feature of this and The Descendants, but alas this went on far too long – and I truly believed the rest of the movie would be an amazing spectacle of lights, sounds and wondrous adventure.<br/><br/>And then the plots sank in. Yes, I meant to pluralize that.<br/><br/>The movie started on Plot A and that was fine, but then Plot B overlapped with Plot C, followed by D-G. I'm aware this is based on a novel, but it felt like 3 novels rolled into this one.<br/><br/>Please don't take this as a complaint, per se, but I thought the movie worked much smoother when you have the awe of the spectacular graphics and grand sets with a simple even-kids-can-follow peaceful and harmonizing story. And because there's too much going on, too many subplots, the movie's pacing slowed to an almost halt and I started to feel every bit of the over two-hour run time.<br/><br/>Sad, I was really getting invested and would have been more alert if they saved some ideas for a potential sequel and kept it to a quaint 90 or so minutes.<br/><br/>That all said, if you're interested, you really should see this on the big screen. It's a marvel of ingenuity and it's fully worthy of a Best Cinematography Award. The performances are outstanding at times and the touching transformations (in some of the plots I favored more) were nice and heartfelt. And finally, there was some pretty good comedy that made me laugh out loud, mostly from Sacha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>If you are ever interested in seeing this, see it now. In the theatres, in Real 3D. You wont regret the experience."
"howard.schumann","7","3","6","2 December 2011"," A perfect wind-up toy that lacks the button to bring it to life
","Before we judge an old cynic too quickly, perhaps we should stop and think whether there is a human story behind their bitter exterior, perhaps a lifetime of lost dreams. Such is the case in for Georges, the cranky toy store owner (Ben Kingsley), in Martin Scorsese's Hugo, who turns out to have a secret that he has been hiding for many years. Set in Paris in 1931 and based on the children's novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, Hugo is the story of an orphan boy who lives in the walls of the train station, the Gare Montparnasse, and spends his time winding clocks, a skill taught to him by his alcoholic uncle (Ray Winstone) after his father (Jude Law) died in a fire.<br/><br/>Shot in 3-D by cinematographer Robert Richardson, the depiction of the train station is perfectly realized, especially its feverish activity and imposing Roman statues and figures in the piazza. The boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), survives by stealing food from the station's kiosks while trying to avoid the threatening Station Inspector, Gustav (Sacha Baron Cohen). It seems that Gustav, having been raised in an orphanage himself, thinks that all boys without parents belong there. Hugo of course has a different opinion and spends his days observing people at the station.<br/><br/>These include Lisette (Emily Mortimer), a flower seller and scholarly librarian Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee) among others. Gustav and Lisette develop a relationship, but a leg injury suffered during the war makes him a reluctant suitor, though more of his human qualities begin to surface. Hugo likes to fix things that are broken and steals parts to repair a discarded automaton with a sad face that his father retrieved from a museum's trash bin. Hugo believes that once the automaton is repaired, the machine will be able to write a coded message to him from his father. He steals one too many mechanical parts from the toy store owner, however, who keeps the boy's notebook that provides crucial instructions on how to fix the automaton.<br/><br/>Begging for the cantankerous Georges to return his treasured notebook, he develops a friendship with Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), the George's goddaughter and his wife (Helen McCrory). Isabelle loves adventure and finds a suitable partner in Hugo who likes movies and they both sneak into the cinema where a Harold Lloyd film is playing until they are thrown out. Hugo tells Isabelle that ""broken machines make me sad,"" and ponders the idea that if every part in a machine has a purpose, then he must also have a purpose in life, a wise observation. The film ""switches gears"" in its second half and becomes a plea for film preservation and a tribute to the beginning of cinema and to those pioneer directors who created an industry that no one thought would last.<br/><br/>Film historians will marvel at the showing of silent classics such as ""A Trip to the Moon"" and the work of such luminaries as the Lumière brothers, Edwin S. Porter, D. W. Griffith, and others, though the films have been recreated in 3-D rather than restored. Through the efforts of Hugo, Isabelle and Monsieur Labisse, however, the story of Georges' secret life is revealed and his bitterness is transformed into gratitude with radiant results. Hugo is by and large a family film and, since the majority of Scorsese's films have been R-rated, this is probably his first film that has been accessible to a wider audience.<br/><br/>Although the film is designed for children, much of the material is too adult for them and the presence of Gustav's huge Doberman Pinscher coming directly at the audience in 3-D is enough to scare even adults half to death. Perhaps Scorsese thinks that it's a good thing for children to have nightmares. While Hugo is undoubtedly a technical marvel, it feels to me like a perfect wind-up toy that has all its parts functioning perfectly but lacks the button that would bring it to life. While the performance of Asa Butterfield is certainly adequate, he is not particularly captivating and there is little dramatic tension in the film once the mystery is solved, except for a few dreams and an obligatory chase scene.<br/><br/>Unlike such classics as The Black Stallion or National Velvet, there is little here that reminds us of childhood. Hugo and Isabelle talk and act like little adults not children. A film such as Hugo might have been better in a simple and straightforward manner, not bloated with extraneous conversations, an over-abundance of characters, and dazzling 3-D effects that ultimately do not add much to the viewer's overall satisfaction. I think, however, Hugo may become a classic but for all the wrong reasons. It will be studied mainly for its stunning technical achievements, its excellent use of the 3-D medium, and its colorful lessons in film history. When children are looking for magic, however, they may turn elsewhere."
"estreet-eva","6","3","6","27 November 2011"," Best Picture Bait
","Martin Scorsese would like to preemptively thank the Academy for what will likely be at least four nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Ben Kingsley), and Best Supporting Actress (Helen McCrory). Given most of the movie serves as a celebration of movie-making as an art and movie directors as artists, they don't have much choice. Also it gives the Academy a chance to dole out a lifetime achievement award to Scorsese and Kingsley (although he has done a fair bit of schlock such as ""Species""). Wrapped around the brief history of the earliest beginnings of movie-making and the self-reverential celebration of film-making is the plot from the book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"". In this story, an orphan subsists in the Paris train station by stealing and spends most of his time running from the station's dedicated constable. Somehow we are lead to believe this is preferable to be sent to the local orphanage. In an interesting casting move lunatic Sasha Baron Cohen plays the socially awkward policeman. Unlike most prior roles we don't see him naked but we are invited to laugh at a physical deformity resulting from an injury sustained in World War II so he does retain some of his trademark offense. While the casting decision mixed things up in what is a very staid and stately film, Cohen's maniacal vibe is largely wasted here and the part could have been played by any number of actors. Certainly a gorgeous film and a good use of 3-D; however, even here the 3-D medium feels gimmicky. Scorsese swings for the fences with the technology and it is its breadth and Merchant Ivory grand, sweeping feel that leads to some of the problems with the movie. The chief among these lies with the slow, stately pacing which is simply dull in a number of particularly slow spots. The intrusive soundtrack often offers some bouncing bit of orchestral shenanigans during these times when not much is happening on the screen further highlighting the yawn-worthy scenes. A second major problem comes from a jarring break between the main Hugo plot and the academic salute to movie-making which starts about three-fifths into the film. By the time the history lesson ends, the return to the Hugo's battle against Cohen almost could use a recap for those who had forgotten the earlier story. In short, not a great film but with too many of the elements needed to a Best Picture nom and probably win unless the Weinsteins come up with another historical period drama."

","""As if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen . . . T.S. Eliot<br/><br/>Georges Melies for many movie buffs represents the love affair with imaginative filmmaking at its earliest. Inspired by the Lumiere brothers' short film, Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat (1897), Melies went on in the early years of the 20th century to create such flights of fancy as A Trip to the Moon (1902) with a rocket ship hitting the eye of the Man in the Moon. Martin Scorsese loves movies and their celluloid preservation, so Hugo is no surprise as a fantasy of an early '30's orphan living in the walls of a French train station restoring an automaton invented by Melies (Sir Ben Kingsley), who now owns a toy store in the station. Young Hugo (Asa Butterfiled) and his friend Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) adventure into the world of artifice and romance called movies.<br/><br/>In the discovery of Melies' extant footage, Scorsese makes a strong case for preservation of the old combustible celluloid, a lifelong crusade of his. Yet the heart of the film is the boy's emerging love of cinema, like Scorsese's, reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso and Super 8. I think of Woody Allen's reverie about the '20's, Midnight in Paris, for the nostalgic recreation of a romantic era in the arts. For both auteurs, movies are an artistic expression and a way to meet the past.<br/><br/>Although Scorsese uses ample CGI and 3-D, the opening alone is a marvel of swooping in on the train, its station, digital crowds, and ultimately the hidden boy, like our secret selves descending on a movie set. It reminds me of Mike Nichols' opening sequence to Working Girl, where his camera flies down like a god on and into the Staten Island ferry. In this case Scorsese uses 3-D in a way I have rarely seen—the right way. It's all magical.<br/><br/>Melies began as a magician, and Hugo's father made a living in his shop for mechanical wonderments, both no doubt a paean to special effects. It's how modern Martin continues the fantasy by smoothly creating another world, as he did in The Age of Innocence, this time a world he knows intimately: the paradise of cinema."

","Hugo is a homage to movie makers. And as such can probably only be appreciated by those. <br/><br/>I saw the trailers and thought: BOOOOORING. But then Hugo won and Oscar and I thought: Well it must be good then."" WRONG!! If this thing won an Oscar, it was a very, very bad year for movies. It is beautifully shot, lovely colours and scenes, but that's it. And frankly they are so computer animated that they are too much. I seriously sat through this wondering if it would get better. It doesn't. Not only is the story line flat and uninspired. It also with out any surprises. <br/><br/>Spare yourself. Do not watch this. And if you do, don't complain to me that you lost two valuable hours of your life to nothing."
"Aloz1991","10","4","10","24 November 2011"," Hugo: A triumph (NO SPOILERS)
","Last night, after much waiting and anticipation for Martin Scorsese's new picture, ""Hugo,"" I must say the film not only met my expectations, but very thoroughly surpassed them. I fell in love with this film, and haven't been able to stop thinking about it, so I had to write a review.<br/><br/>I must stress, that this will be a SHORT, and very simple review, for the sake of avoiding spoilers and not rambling on too much about the film. (and it is also my first review)<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the film is excellent. As usual, Scorsese's eye behind the camera is marvelous,as he guides you through the movie's story with much expertise. From the start of the film, you feel as if you are in a new world as the camera takes you through the walls of a Paris train station, as you are introduced to the home and life of our lead character, Hugo Cabret. The movie looks and feels amazing! It truly does feel like a different world. It is amazing to think that something as simple as a train station, can be transformed into something so magical and beautiful. The look of this busy train station that we are given is quite compelling, and extremely well fabricated.<br/><br/>The films splendid use of colors and lighting is also very crucial to the tone that the film creates.<br/><br/>(*NOTE*: for anyone who is debating whether or not to watch the film in 3D, I wouldn't spend the extra money. There were some creative shots that really stood out with the 3D, but other than just a FEW, select moments, it really is not necessary to watch in 3D) <br/><br/>The characters in the film are also a work all their own. Each of them serve an important purpose to the movie's story, and all the characters are genuine and deep, which is necessary for the film to work.<br/><br/>The movie simply took hold of my imagination, and reminded me about the importance of never forgetting who you are, what you love, and to never let go of your dreams.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this picture to anyone, I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed. Overall, I give Hugo a perfect 10, and it is by far my favorite movie of the year."

","This may well be the most overrated movie of the year, or ages. I consider it a very personal tribute from Martin Scorsese to the pioneers of cinema but for me it was two hours of sheer frustration, boredom and disappointment. It was supposed to be entertaining but I had to entertain myself with cellphone games 1 hour into the movie as nothing happened after a lot of waiting. I actually wanted to leave the cinema but had to wait for my friends who really wanted to see if anything worthwhile is going to happen by the end. The answer is no. We all walked out feeling ripped off although we had paid for half priced tickets on a Tuesday. The plot was more appropriate for a 20minute short film."

","The use of 3D was wasted on this film. So many opportunities were presented that could have been enhanced by the 3D but were not, such as the train scenes. I did not appreciate the 3D effect being used to make the characters ""get in my face"" . Nausea would describe my feeling as I watched this movie in 3D.<br/><br/>Most scenes were disconnected from each other and I felt no sympathy for the characters. I was lulled to sleep by the first 30 minutes of the film by the slow motion and lack of character/plot development. Scenes seemed to repeat for no apparent reason and I just never understood the plot or story line. It was a long, long 2 hours."
"brycehoogland","10","3","7","21 March 2012"," This is truly cinema magic
","Hugo is about an orphan who lives in the walls of a train station is wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton. Hugo also has a back story about Georges Méliès life. The master of cinema, Martin Scorsese, takes on a beautiful adventure that makes you feel like a kid and at the same time showing you movie magic. After I watched Hugo I just sat on my couch in amazement and thinking to myself this is why I love filmmaking. Scorsese is one of the best directors of our time and will go down in history as on of the best filmmakers. Hugo is Scorsese's most unique work because it's his first family film and the way he grabs the audience into this adventure is remarkable. The camera work in this film is beautiful. The way Scorsese shoots the train station and the secret corridors of the station is jaw-dropping, along with the shots of Paris. The best part of Hugo is the way Scorsese re-creates the life of Méliès, a filmmaker who crafted over hundreds of films from 1896 to 1913. It is beautiful to be able to watch old cinema in Hugo and just fall in love with it. The visual-effects in Hugo are superb. Everything looks realistic and magical at the same time. This film deserved the Oscars it won for visual-effects. The script for Hugo is written flawlessly. A story about two kids adventure and tying in a backstory of Méliès life fascinating. I was really grabbed into this story. Hugo has a flawless cast with: Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Asa Butterfield, Chloe Moretz, Jude Law, & Christopher Lee. Everyone gives perfect performances, but the ones I want to talk about are: Cohen's, Butterfield's, and Moretz's. Sacha Baron Cohen is one of those actors whose talents are like no one else's. He is a unique actor and when he acts it feels like he has become his character. His performance in Hugo is hilarious and quite enjoyable. Asa Butterfield the lead actor in Hugo and has one of the best performances I have seen from a kid actor. The emotion in his face and the dedication you see from his performance is remarkable. You will find yourself rooting for his character throughout Hugo, due to his engaging performance. Another young actress, Chloe Moretz, never disappoints me in the films I have seen her in. She is one of my favorite young actress's. Moretz's performance in Hugo is seems so natural and sweet. She delivers one of her best performances of her career so far. Hugo is one of those films that if you respect and love filmmaking you will fall in love with it. Martin Scorsese's heart is truly in this film and Hugo is the reason why I love filmmaking."
"Doylenf","8","3","7","7 March 2012"," In a word: Magical, especially for film buffs...
","HUGO is a magical treat from start to finish, beginning with its marvelous open tracking shot of a Paris railroad station in the '30s. From then on, there's a treasure of masterful photography involved in the telling of a boy who lives in a train station and, in the eventive tradition of his father, keeps the huge clock and its machinery working.<br/><br/>The boy is played with great sensitivity by Asa Butterfield in what has to be one of the best child performances ever. He carries the film and never lets the momentum stop as he scurries around the train station trying to avoid the overzealous clutches of a crippled station master (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his fearsome dog. It's reminiscent of the innocent Olivier Twist and David Copperfield trying to avoid the clutches of the laws that rule orphans.<br/><br/>All of the behind-the-scenes glimpses of the whirling machinery inside the clock are an added visual treat, creating the illusion of suspense and danger whenever the plot demands it. As the girl whom Hugo befriends and shares his knowledge of the automaton with, Chlore Grace Moretz is equally charming and natural. Their chemistry helps the film's most pivotal moments work beautifully.<br/><br/>A much needed sense of humor is helped enormously by the contribution of Sacha Baron Cohen, whose station master emerges as one of the story's most interesting characters. Emily Mortimer is touching as a woman he admires and Christopher Lee does a standout job as the librarian who takes an interest in furthering Hugo's education.<br/><br/>The story's thread is slight, but the film is full of such complex images and turbulent events surrounding the boy's precarious situation that it remains an absorbing tale of an orphan who proves to be a most resourceful lad in keeping one step ahead of the authorities. <br/><br/>Then too, it's a backstory of the famous cinema inventor Georges Melies, who had the imagination to become one of film's most inventive craftsmen in the early 1900s. Glimpses of his work are seen throughout the film and Ben Kingsley is a perfect choice to play this complex man. His scenes with Hugo are extremely touching.<br/><br/>And finally, I must end with a word of high praise for Martin Scorsese who lends his own magical touch to the proceedings to create one of the year's best films for the child in all of us with all of its wonders underscored by Howard Shore's lovely background score."
"myungjahigh","10","3","7","7 March 2012"," masterpiece
","Tribute to Georges Melies, who opened the door to the world of imagination <br/><br/>A few months ago, I mean, before Hugo and The Artist were released, it seemed very common that people just looked for more special effects or more provocative films and the film industry supported it. Meanwhile, The Artist and Hugo were shown to the public. Both the two are very special at this moment, because they are dealing with the film industry of the past which was not like these days at all. no special effect, no spectacle, not even voice nor color. And both of them did splendid jobs at Academy awards.<br/><br/>Hugo, which is made with terrific 3D technology, impresses the audiences as the first movie of human history did. The reason why Hugo is such brilliant is not only because of its technology, but also its imagination and reminisce that it supplies. I think Hugo is dedicated to people who still believe that every imagination and film could be realized... just like the old days of 'A Trip to the Moon.'<br/><br/>Lumière said that there is no future for films, but actually films have developed brightly. I would say that the development was possible because of various imagination and ideas of people. Of course technology and money also have had powers. The question is, will there be future for films anymore? What Lumière mentioned about film and technology was not totally wrong, because it was the era before A Trip to the Moon, the new film era of imagination. It is probably not coincidence that The Artist and Hugo came up at this time. I am sure there will be future for movies if they have own imaginative powers. and if they don't only depend on technology and capital.<br/><br/>Hugo says that every single person, every single thing has its own purpose. And through the movie Hugo, it seems fixed where films must go, and what purposes they are supposed to keep."

","Hugo Cabret is a wonderful story about the history of cinema mainly for those ones who are not familiar to it and believe that its history began in America. Centainly an amazing tribute to french cinema from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me a lot of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro movies, their visuals, the importance of daily life segments, uncommon characters and the using of fantasy to tell an ordinary story. That happens maybe for the fact that Jeunet is one of the most important contemporary french directors and also clear inspired by George Meliés and his fantastic and colorful misé en scene.<br/><br/>Scorcese truly offers to the audience a heartfelt and inspired journey that only an experienced director would be able to give, mixing the old school cinema with what is the most modern in filming technology showing a fully emotional trajectory from the old to the new in a perfect balance.<br/><br/>Amazing. The movie is not only a nostalgic way back to the roots, but also what George Meliés exactly expected from cinema: an opportunity to dream again."

Watching this allowed my imagination to see a young Scorsese completely engulfed in a magical world that would become his future.

"moviexclusive","10","3","7","22 February 2012"," A work of pure magic, pure wonder and pure exuberance, this is a winning delight for all ages- and an even more astounding visual spectacle in 3D
","If there is one genre that Martin Scorcese has not explored over the course of his expansive four decades in film, it is that of the 'families', often considered as lightweight and therefore ill-fitting for the director's proclivity for mature fare. But though cloaked within the look and feel of a family film, 'Hugo' ultimately proves to be so much more, and there is no doubt by the end of it why Scorcese was attracted to this adaptation of Brian Selznick's celebrated novel.<br/><br/>This is the Dickensian story of a 12-year-old orphan named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) who lives inside the walls of the Gare Montmartre train station in 1930s Paris and turns to the occasional thieving to survive. Hugo's been left with an automaton which his father rescued from the attic of a nearby museum, and over the years, he's been nicking what he needs to get it repaired- it's Hugo's last remaining connection to his father whom he misses dearly. <br/><br/>One day, Hugo runs afoul of a grumpy toy seller Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley) and loses possession of a precious notebook with the drawings and calculations essential for his pet project. Desperate, he follows the seller home and pleads with his precocious goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) to retrieve it for him.<br/><br/>Thus begins their mutual journey of adventure, as Hugo brings Isabelle, who's never seen a motion picture, to a showing of 'Safety Last' where the silent comedian Harold Lloyd dangles from the hands of a giant clock. Isabelle too introduces Hugo to the world of books, the bright lass an avid reader with a penchant for big words. But Hugo is more interested in the heart-shaped key around Isabelle's neck he believes will unlock the secret of the automaton.<br/><br/>True enough- the key fits the hole- and the automaton sketches out a key scene from filmmaker Georges Melies' landmark 1902 sci-fi fantasy 'A Trip to the Moon' where a rocket crashes into face of the man in the moon. Turns out Papa Georges is indeed the lost filmmaker Georges Melies, and screenwriter John Logan uses the second half of the movie to make a heartfelt argument for the preservation of film. It isn't just about protecting the legacy of the filmmaker- though the rehabilitation of Melies is equally pivotal to the story- but also about safeguarding the collective memories of an audience built upon the extraordinary power of cinema to inspire.<br/><br/>So deftly around a tale of childhood intrigue, Scorcese has conveyed the importance of a cause that's so close to his heart. 'Hugo' isn't only his plea for the cause, but his tribute to his peers from the past who have left an indelible contribution to the advancement of cinema- and besides a brief but illuminating tour of the history of early cinema close to the end of the film, Scorcese also does a lovely restaging of the classic Lumiere brothers' 1897 presentation of the 'Arrival of a Train at Le Ciotat'.<br/><br/>In 'Hugo', Scorcese has also fashioned an opulent epic as lavish and rapturous as the classic films that have captured our imagination since the beginning of the celluloid medium, employing his usual ace team to transport his audience straight into the heart of a storybook Paris. Trust us when we say that you'll be wowed from the get-go- the opening shot a breathtaking one that begins with the camera swooping over the rooftops of Paris towards the Montmartre station and continuing seamlessly above the tracks inside the station before entering the main hall where young Hugo is making his way through the crowd of commuters. Together with Scorcese, d.p Robert Richardson ensures that this 3D-shot film brims with beautifully crafted shots that bring to life the world of fantasy and mystery within the film in a most visually vivid manner.<br/><br/>Besides its technical mastery, 'Hugo' also boasts delightful performances from its cast of all ages. Butterfield emerges from a breakout performance from 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' to deliver an equally nuanced portrayal of a boy adrift in the world and longing for the people and things that will connect him to the rest of humanity. Moretz effuses warmth and radiance in every frame, while Kingsley's supporting act is a masterful one that conveys keenly the wounded pride of an artist who watches with despair as his works once so beloved by the world are now quickly forgotten.<br/><br/>If there is one gripe about the movie, it is that the vignettes involving some of the station's regulars end up too lightweight to matter. Still, that little triviality in no way diminishes the sheer feeling of wonder and magic that Scorcese brings to his first film meant for all ages, a film that also so persuasively and winningly echoes his lifelong passion of cinema preservation. It's a film of pure enchantment, even more so when viewed in 3D, and once again reiterates why Scorcese is simply one of the best directors of all time."

","I'm really not a film's critic, but as a viewer and an old movies aficionado, all I can say is this one made me dream, which is exactly what a movie should do. On the other hand, this is maybe one of the more mixed reviews movie I've seen lately, from pseudo-intellectuals giving it a one star to people giving it 10 stars (I'm the latter, really, not because the movie deserves 10 stars in its essence but because the sum of it all is mind-blowing).<br/><br/>So, and instead of being a lame movie critic wannabe and flame the movie with pearls like ""the actor portraying Hugo is naught but has sad eyes so he was picked"" and some other of little note, I'll explain why a 10 is a (maybe fan-boyish but) fair rate:<br/><br/>-as far as 3d goes, this is THE ONE per se. Have you thought that the train arriving at a station movie is, though limited, PERFECT for this tech? Of course the train station itself where the movie develops is filled with precious details that make 3d shine too. Just watch some other movies in 3d (so en vogue these days, for worse than for better) and you'll probably see what I mean;<br/><br/>-the precious details I mentioned above, from Django Reinhardt to Christopher Lee (isn't it subtle that an old movies legend like Mr. Lee appears in a movie that talks about movie legends?), the Fantomas poster, the parisian boulevards reminding us of cogs and complications... I wasn't expecting so much from Martin Scorcese, which only proves the man is an erudite regarding cinema, let alone directing;<br/><br/>-I really lamented when I read so many wannabe critics label the movie for children, which is pathetic; this is a movie for everyone, from grandchildren to grandparents, from cinema student to movie critic, and that's the real gimmick in my opinion, as Martin Scorcese DEFINITELY payed attention to detail in order to make this a family friendly movie that could interest any other viewer, even if for CULTURE itself. I'll see it again tomorrow for the third time, in search for more detail.<br/><br/>The movie has a major flaw in my honest opinion: it was directed by an American instead of an European, and I guess that it loses some of its innocence and naiveté because of this alone, but on the other hand, it's so very well conceived (the European details, the atmosphere, the cultural history, etc...) that it's an insignificant detail.<br/><br/>Bravo."

This film had all the magic of the cinema, including the magic that comes from being slightly enigmatic. Best of all, The audience was not spoon-fed tidy endings; we had to spot them for ourselves and still wonder exactly when and how this or that was resolved. Scorsese avoided the cliché of telling us what each character's future would be. <br/><br/>Not a film for children- one for adults who still believe that cinema can be magic."

","The movie is set in Paris in 1930s and closely follows the storyline of ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" by Brian Selznick and tells the story about a boy who lives on the train station, his father, a robot called automaton and dreams which never really leave us.<br/><br/>This is the work of well-known director Martin Scorsese, which is notably different from his other works. The Departed, The Shutter Island, The Aviator, Bands of New-York: those are the most famous ones and they have one feature in common, they are not movies for kids or fairy tales. Scorsese's choice of genre for the next movie, Hugo, caught me by surprise; I definitely didn't expect him to take on the Christmas tale. I had a bad feeling about it (I am a great fan of the 3 movies mentioned above), and I am so glad that I turned out to be wrong. The genius of Scorsese shines in whatever movie he decides to make.<br/><br/>Straight to the verdict: I have watched this movie twice, and I found it to be the best movie I have seen in 2011. However, I believe that Hugo is the victim of bad PR and marketing campaign. On one hand, whenever a casual film goer hears ""Scorsese's film"", he or she will almost immediately think of action or thriller. On the other hand, the film trailer presents Hugo as the bedtime story for children 5-12, nice and cuddly Christmas story, during which the parents of a child can take a quick nap in the theatre.<br/><br/>Well, the movie is neither, and these two considerations might have actually scared away those people who might love the movie most: people who love multi-layered movies that make you look at yourself and to project some of the ideas seen on your own life. On the outer layer, Hugo is pretty simple: little easy story, the boy named Hugo Cabret tries to fix the automaton, and in the process finds its creator. If you dig a little bit deeper, you will find a story about a man who cannot find his place in the world and who suffers in denial because of it. If you dig even deeper, you will see that Scorsese made the ode to entire cinematograph and its first visionaries in particular. Scorsese sympathizes with the main idea of the book: movies are made to carry people away to other, usually imaginary worlds; they are made to bring your dreams into real world; they are magic in essence! Only film-loving Scorsese could deliver this message powerfully, and he is up to expectations. Needless to say that people who expected light fairytale or action movie are disappointed.<br/><br/>The work of Scorsese is difficult to overestimate. Every single bit in this movie is necessary and fits into the bigger picture perfectly, creating the right atmosphere of magic and wizardry. To prove the idea that movies are made to carry us away, Scorsese simply creates another world, the world that feels like comfortable and enjoyable to live in. Huge clock mechanisms that Hugo winds up, shining Paris outside the train station, small toy shop – everything works to create this magical feeling. Even 3D, which I generally don't like, does not feel alien to the movie but rather works for the same purpose – to deliver the idea. As I mentioned in my Best of 2011 post, 3D in Hugo makes me think that Scorsese was watching all the tasteless films which rely on 3D for their success (Transformers 3 being the No1 tasteless film of those) and decided to show how it should be done. By the way, he featured in the movie as the photographer: Even if I stop praising the genius of Scorsese, there is still a lot to talk about. The cast, for example. The biggest discovery for me was the brilliant work of Sasha Baron Cohen as Station Inspector, the villain of the show. Fantastic accent, jokes, his smile, after all – he proved to everyone that he is a great actor (just in time before his Dictator). Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle is memorable mainly because of her phrase ""Don't you like books?!"", spelled out with conviction and passion, making you a bit nervous, forcing to remember when was the last time you opened a book. Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliès, Asa Butterfield as Hugo, Jude Law as Hugo's father – everybody performed to their best, delivering stunning and breathtaking show.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Masterpiece by Martin Scorsese starring Ben Kingsley and Sasha Baron Cohen, serious multi-layered reflection on the purpose and the history of cinematograph. The best movie I have seen in 2011.<br/><br/>WATCH: if you love cinema just as I do.<br/><br/>m-picturegoer.blogspot.com"
"Coventry","9","3","7","26 December 2011"," Every reason why we love cinema
","features here in this bona fide masterpiece by the downright genius filmmaker Martin Scorsese! Usually I don't write user comments for popular high-budget blockbusters, but I specifically wanted to write about this movie because this is Scorsese's very own and personal ode to cinema and that urged me to write an ode to him and his work. Through using the most modern techniques and hypes – including 3D effects – Scorsese brings a deeply respectable homage to the pioneers and earliest basic techniques of the medium that loves so much and has been working for nearly half a century now. ""Hugo"" is a magical fantasy/fairy-tale, filled with absorbing characters, earnest emotional story lines, dream- like decors and hi-tech special effects that actually emphasize the plot details rather than diverting your attention from the plot holes. The titular character is a shy and introvert young orphan who lives inside the walls of a Paris' train station in the late 1920's. Hugo makes sure that the station clocks keeps running on time without being noticed by the strict station inspector, and at night he desperately tries to repair a broken automaton. The device is the only thing that still connects Hugo with his deceased father and the young boy strongly believes that it carries a hidden message. And is he ever right! When Hugo and his new friend Isabelle discover the automaton's hidden message, they embark on an adventure that will uncover some secrets on people that are very close and dear to them. I don't want to reveal too much, but cinema connoisseurs can more or less predict what the adventure's about based on Ben Kingsley's character name and the Paris setting. The acting performances are stupendous, from the young and clearly over-talented child actors to the ageing but still vastly honorable veterans in the supportive cast, like Richard Griffiths and of course the almighty Christopher Lee. The 3D effects are never bothersome or overly exploited, like so often the case in these movies, and pretty much every piece of scenery and technical aspect is a joy to behold. Everything is perfect to the tiniest detail. The entire finale and the sub plots happening inside the trains station hall are, albeit clichéd and rather predictable, genuinely heartwarming and moving. We had to wait until the end of 2011 to see the best film of the whole year, but it was definitely worth it. Martin Scorsese, I sincerely hope you win an Oscar for directing this movie  It'll even be more deserved than winning for ""The Departed""."

For the movie Hugo, it will be hard to express criticism. I am truly sorry if my critique offends anyone and I hope that this review will not prevent anyone from seeing the production as it would be unfortunate to miss this truly unique experience. I viewed the movie Hugo in 2-D, not in 3-D experience or 3-D IMAX and this review is based on this version.<br/><br/>The story is told through the eyes of Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) who lives and works at a train station. He lives alone and fixes the clocks in the train station. The time period is long ago. Something happened to Hugo's father (Jude Law) before Hugo went to live at the station. He mentored Hugo in mechanics while attempting to repair a mechanical human being, however before the repairs were finished his father parishes, leaving him with his alcoholic uncle Claude (the reliable character actor Ray Winstone), who taught Hugo the trade of working mechanically with clocks. When Hugo went to live with his uncle he brought with him the last fond remaining memorabilia of his father, the unfinished mechanical human figure. Hugo felt obligated to finish the work on the human figure. Completing his father's work gave Hugo a sense of purpose and also a desire to understand the figures purpose. Curiosity motivates Hugo to undertake an adventure as he investigates the history of the mechanical human figure. In this quest Hugo enlists the help of a young girl named Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz). Along the way, Hugo unfolds the mysteries of the creation of the mechanical human figure, and of the lives many individuals who may have lost their way. Through his involvement, Hugo makes it possible for them to recapture what had mattered to them most. <br/><br/>What is interesting about Hugo's character is his interaction with other people. As important, is his observation of other people. A very powerful part of the action occurs when significant character development takes place as Hugo watches an older couple from a distance. As he observes the two older people, very little dialogue is heard, as they are engaged in their interaction, however their emotion is obvious. As he watches this scene unfold, the effect on Hugo is apparent. This has significant impact on him and on our understanding of him. These scenes gave a sense of the silent picture era, and possibly some homage is owed to Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window as this device was used extensively in that production.<br/><br/>Hugo encounters a cold, sad man named George Melis (Ben Kingsley) who is bitterly mean. George presents some obstacles that result in some setbacks of Hugo's investigation of the figure. Ben Kingsley's portrayal of George Melis is a truly convincing performance. This character engages the audience by generating interest and a desire to understand how and why he became the way he is. <br/><br/>The Train Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) has a goal, to bring homeless children to orphanages. His character is well developed. A sense of his human qualities is further advanced through his obvious longing of family and his humility towards the flower girl. He has many impediments in his social interactions including a faulty leg brace. A range of emotions are generated toward this character as the story unfolds. <br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, the result is a well-crafted, fine, beautiful and engaging motion picture. The success of this motion picture is an artistic expression of his obvious love for movies. He successfully created a living environment in which I at least partially resided along with the living characters through the duration of the showing and beyond.<br/><br/>Most of the activities take place within an engrossing location in Paris and is mostly confined to a train station which symbolizes the importance of the confinement that is experienced within the some of the characters' lives. Dante Ferretti as production designer accomplishes this realism through the selection of color, richness and elegant design. <br/><br/>The musical score from Howard Shore amplified the emotional actions and adventurous moments; giving a greater effect, enhancing the action, mood and impact of the production. Without a doubt Scorsese's often collaborator, director of photography Robert Richardson sizzles with smooth, graceful camera work, often flowing seamlessly, creating dramatic, powerful, and sometimes hypnotic effects.<br/><br/>In conclusion it may be appropriate to end with the following statement of summary. Throughout one's life many people are encountered, some will bring out the best and some will bring out the worst, and some will do both. Judging the overall impact is at best often not a possibility. <br/><br/>Rating: **** out of ****"

"musanna-ahmed","8","3","7","21 December 2011"," Marty's once-a-decennial masterpiece already?
","Martin Scorsese is back. This time the director has taken a new direction by bringing The Invention of Hugo Cabret to life, making a film for all ages instead of the usual adult target demographic. So if you're under 18 and have been looking forward to his next project for a while, fearing it may fall into the 18-rated category, like his previous masterpieces have, so you cannot get into the cinema, well there's no need to. But after looking to have been accustomed to creating brilliant gangster flicks, does Scorsese's attempt at making a kid's film succeed?<br/><br/>Well to begin with, his recreation of a 30's Paris is an ambitious and a realistic one, with the inspiration clearly coming from classic French comedy Under the Roofs of Paris. This Paris is a wonderful sight to see straight from the beginning of the film as Scorsese utilises his signature long tracking shot to take the audience through the subject train station and finish on a focus of our lead character Hugo's face. On a further note, Scorsese noticeably uses the long tracking shot in the film twice more, once subsequent to the one aforementioned where it follows Hugo travelling down the clock (effective because Scorsese is taking the audience on the adventure with Hugo) and once near the end, taking the audience around one room (I won't spoil by describing what happens, because this shot is the conclusion of everyone's story in the film) – this timelessly impressive technique and the cinematography in general is beautiful, it's part of why Hugo is enjoyable. Back to where I was - the bonus of the opening shot is the glorious 3D.<br/><br/>And the glory of the 3D isn't just in the opening shot. Continuously throughout the film Scorsese reminds us that he has literally already mastered the use of 3D in just only one motion picture – if it is not exactly perfect, it is certainly the best since Avatar. Look out for the amazing shot of Sacha Baron Cohen's station inspector's face peering towards the left of the frame, leaning towards the frame as he questions Hugo when the boy is questioned about the trouble caused at the beginning of the narrative. I believe Scorsese has a more than likely chance of succeeding in future attempts at using 3D. I mean, he's arguably America's greatest filmmaker right now and has been for a long time.<br/><br/>Going back to Sacha Baron Cohen – as well as placing us spectators in an uncomfortable position by leaning his face towards us (a nod to the uncomfortable finale of The Great Train Robbery), he provides plenty of humour in the film, like he would be expected to. He does an amazing job performing as the Station Inspector, breaking his comedy barrier by displaying heart in this role too. Joining him is a wonderful cast featuring Asa Butterfield as Hugo, turning in fantastically; Chloë Grace Moretz as Hugo's new-found friend Isabella, utilising the talent in acting she has been blessed with at a young age; Ben Kingsley as the legendary Georges Méliès, entirely convincing and three-dimensional, this is possibly one of the year's Supporting Actor nominees.<br/><br/>It is an ideology of the film that Georges Méliès is a forgotten legend. A large part of the story revolves around him and his movie-making past (this film is set at a time where his filmmaking career is over, financially he is out of his luck and resorting to running a toy store). This film tells us that his revolutionary filmmaking techniques are responsible for the magic we see on the big screen today – he discovered substitution, multiple exposures, cross fading and dissolves.<br/><br/>I'm going to stop analysing further now and conclude that Hugo is a masterpiece, without a doubt, it excels in every aspect of filmmaking and even though it is completely different to almost any children's film you will see this year, Scorsese has created something marvellous for all the ages. It is also Scorsese's (very fitting) tribute to cinema and the reason I've concluded abruptly is because I believe this fascinating article should be read – thefilmstage.com/features/10-classic-films-you- must-watch-before-seeing-martin-scorseses-hugo/. This article explains how Scorsese's Hugo is a fitting tribute to cinema, in particular Méliès, who changed cinema forever. Watching the ten films on the list will enhance your viewing experience and make Hugo more enjoyable to watch as you point out the classic film references to the person next to you<br/><br/>Verdict: Scorsese has made a masterpiece every decade: 70's - Taxi Driver, 80's - Raging Bull, 90's - Goodfellas, 00's - The Departed. Hugo may already just be his masterpiece for this decade."

","A wonderful story beautifully told. The film gathers pace gradually and though at times you're left with unanswered questions it all unravels in the last 30 minutes of the film in an emotional and satisfying finale. The imagery is stunning and the use of the 3D technology is handled perfectly. The scenic views of Paris through the clack face are the most stunning use of 3D I've yet to see. Sacha Baron Cohen's character (train station policeman) adds a nice touch of humour which helps to relieve the tension from time to time and Ben Kingsley is brilliant! So if you want a heart warming family film with a 'proper' story to tell... go and see it!"
"comicman117","10","3","7","21 December 2011"," This isn't just a movie (Maybe Spoilers!!!
","Hugo 2011, directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Asa Butterfield, Chloë Grace Moretz, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer and Christopher Lee.<br/><br/>Hugo is a special kind of movie, a kind of movie that makes you realize how you love the movies.<br/><br/>The basic plot follows Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) a orphaned boy living in Paris in 1931. His father raised him when he was younger, but ended up dying in a museum fire, leaving behind a broken-down Automaton for Hugo to look after. Hugo is taken away by his uncle, an alcoholic watchmaker who is responsible for maintaining the clocks in a railway station. His uncle teaches him to take care of the clocks and then vanishes.<br/><br/>Hugo lives between the walls of the train station, working on the clocks, stealing food and attempting to fix the Automation Hugo steals some mechanical parts in the station's toy store, hoping to use them to repair the automation, but is caught by the owner, who takes Hugo's blueprints that he used for the automation.<br/><br/>Hugo's quest to fix the automation, leads him to meet a girl named Isabelle (Chloe-Grace Moretz, who I must admit I felt a sorry for, because she was the only major cast-member who was American). Isabelle turns out to be the Godfather of the person who owns the Toy-Store. She helps him with fixing the automation, and along the way he shares his love of movies to her, something she has never seen, because her Godfather has forbid her from ever seeing one.<br/><br/>Hugo is a brilliant film, one of the best I've seen all year. Scorsese directing is spot on, and France is brilliantly recreated to look like the 30's. The screenplay by John Logan (adapting Brian Selznick's the Invention of Hugo Cabaret) is excellent, with dialogue that is memorable.<br/><br/>The acting is extremely good. I never let the non-french speakers (most of the actors in the movie were from the UK, not France) distract me from enjoying the film, but I wanna credit to Sacha Baron Cohen who is excellent as Inspector Gustav. A sort of buffoonish French Inspector (his voice reminds me a lot of Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau) who looks for orphaned child so he can send them off to the orphanage. His performance is assuming and brilliant at the same time. If I had my way, he would get an Oscar Nomination for his performance. Ben Kingsley (another person deserving of a Academy Award nomination) is also excellent in his role as the Toy Store Owner (known as Papa Georges), who has a secret to hide. Asa Butterfield is impressive as the title character, and shows promise to became a great actor in the future. Jude Law does well playing Hugo's Father, but he doesn't have much screened time, and he only appears near the beginning. The rest of the cast is good, especially the immortal Christopher Lee as the Bookshop Owner.<br/><br/>You'd think from the trailer and advertisements, this be another family film, but the truth is, it's not. Hugo is more than just a family film, it's a film for film lovers. Scorsese really shows how much he loves film. I left the theater feeling really satisfied.<br/><br/>10/10, nearly flawless."
"SHAWFAN","10","3","7","19 December 2011"," Astonishingly wonderful
","It's amazing how great the movies have become in recent years. And Hugo is certainly one of the great ones. Some of your critics showed disappointment with the movie. I guess they were expecting something else. What I saw was a highly successful combination of biopic and documentary about a great film pioneer. We saw it only in normal vision without 3D so I can't comment on that. But all the sets and visuals were of course stunning and incomparable.<br/><br/>After all of Melies' talk in the movie about how he had to sell his films (about 500 of them) into destruction for making shoe heels, on the IMDb site we see the same 500 films going back even as far as 1896 when Melies started. So these films must be accessible in some fashion even today if only to have their credits listed. I remember back 20 years ago when I was residing in New Zealand the big news broke that one of Melies' films had been found in a local film archive and the discovery was all over the papers.<br/><br/>It was piquant to see portrayed on the screen real live contemporary to their time artistic figures like guitarist Django Reinhardt, painter Salvador Dali, and author James Joyce. My wife and I commented that one of the actors certainly resembled James Joyce and that's who he turned out actually to be in the film. When I saw the guitarist I said he reminded me of Django Reinhardt and that's exactly who he was supposed to be.<br/><br/>We were delighted to observe Scorsese's ""Hitchcock moment"" when he cast himself as a photographer taking Melies' picture in front of his studio.<br/><br/>What a precious way to become wrapped up in the early history of cinema through this extraordinary film! It reminded me of the movie The Road to Wellville (1994) which similarly immersed the audience in another time and period through its visual fineness and its portraying of genuine historical figures like the Kellogg brothers of Battle Creek circa 1900-1910,about the same turn of the century time as Hugo.<br/><br/>Astonishing film!"
"mbamford123","10","3","7","19 December 2011"," Visually Stunning
","The 3-D composition was woven into the beauty of film itself. The movement through industrial clocks, small passages or even across the Parisian cityscape, made the movie a visual event. If this is the future of 3-D movies, those claiming the end of cinema will be proved wrong again. <br/><br/>The cast and casting is marvelous. <br/><br/>The plot -even though 'family' oriented- remained interesting throughout. <br/><br/>One can only hope that such a brilliant movie launched during a 'moundane' of movies near Christmas, shines longer than a shooting star."
"chapy004","9","3","7","27 November 2011"," I'll be honest with you...
","I'll be honest with you, Hugo is not a ""movie"". It is a piece of art that holds a meaning, and heart. It will inspire you to be the best you can be, and it will remind you that you are important, and were placed on the planet for a purpose. The cinematography is beyond brilliant, and when seen in 3D, it spirals into an awesome 4D feel. I myself couldn't help but grin when I was showered in glass, bombarded with rubble, and covered in splintered wood as the train crashed off the track and plowed through the train station.<br/><br/>Asa Butterfield couldn't be better as Hugo. His eyes are so expressive, and he gives a great performance that draws you into his story, and gives you sympathy for him. To me, he's like the new Harry Potter, if you know what I mean. Not just Asa, but all of the cast gives there best performance to bring this film to life.<br/><br/>Another thing I like about this film, is that, while it is so entertaining, it is also very informative about the history of film, giving the story a feel of purpose.<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 out of 10, because not every film is perfect, and doesn't offer something for EVERYONE. I would have like the movie to shed more light on Hugo's father, but over all, ""HUGO"" is AWESOME. Get to your nearest movie theater, and see this movie in 3D! That's right, I said 3D. You won't regret it!"

","Tonight I saw Hugo for the second time in 3-D. My wife dragged me to it the first time and I was thoroughly blown away and moved. But I really didn't need to see it again. She did. So with little reluctance, I saw it again and it was even better the second time. This time you could appreciate the art and lyricism of this film ever more than the first time. The second time you're just blown away by not only the beauty of the opening scene, but also by the structure and art of it as the breathtaking tracking shot focuses on nearly every major and minor character in the film. And then they show the opening credits! While Hugo isn't my favorite film of the year (that was Midnight In Paris, which I'd see for a third time in a flash), I am convinced it's the ""best"" film. I've seen ""The Artist"" and it's not even in the same league as ""Hugo."" ""Hugo"" has great direction, ensemble acting (seriously, why isn't there an Oscar for best acting ensemble?), cinematography, music, special effects, sound, use of 3-D, and heart of any film my wife and I have seen all year. It's an amazing homage to the early film makers without ever getting cloying or worshipful. It's a wonderful story on so many levels and it's impossible not to shed a tear or two among all the laughs and emotion. I realize Hugo isn't everybody's cup of tea, but taking into account its wonderful storytelling, direction, etc. it strikes me as the best of all the films nominated for ""Best Picture."""

","Reading some of the comments here, it appears the advertising for this was somewhat misleading, so people left the theater disappointed. I don't remember any advertising so I had no idea what to expect.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" from 2011 is a Martin Scorsese film based on the Brian Selznick book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret. Set in 1931, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in Paris with his father (Jude Law), a widowed clockmaker who also works at a museum. He finds a broken automaton, a mechanical man designed to write with a pen, at the museum, and Hugo and he try to repair it, his father writing down various steps in his notebook. When his father is killed in a fire, Hugo goes to live with an alcoholic uncle (Ray Winstone) who maintains the clocks at the railway station of Gare Montparnase. <br/><br/>His uncle disappears one day, but Hugo stays on living in the clockworks and maintaining the clocks and steals items to repair the automaton. He also tries to avoid the Station Inspector Gustave (Sacha Baron Cohen) who will send him to an orphanage if he finds out his uncle is gone. <br/><br/>When Hugo is caught stealing from the toy store, the owner, Georges (Ben Kingsley) confiscates Hugo's notebook. Hugo enlists the help of Georges' goddaughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) to retrieve it. It turns out that her godfather is the famous Georges Melies, a magician and film director who was responsible for many technical developments in the early days of film, including special effects and time-lapse photography. And the automaton was his invention. When his films went out of style after World War I, he dropped out of sight and sold toys.<br/><br/>People went into this film expecting Hugo to have a great adventure, when in fact this is the story of George Melies and the very early days of film. <br/><br/>I can't describe how beautiful and astonishing this film is, a true awe-inspiring feast for the eyes in 3D. Scenes from early silent films shown in the movie are Méliès's actual works, such as Le voyage dans la lune (1902), and they are stunning. We also see Harold Lloyd hanging from the clock in Safety Last, and Hugo having to do this later. The film also depicts the Montparnasse derailment of 1895. <br/><br/>The acting is excellent, and though Butterfield's casting was criticized as being just because he was a beautiful child, I disagree. I think he was wonderful, as was Moretz. Ben Kingsley as the stern toy owner Georges who reveals himself as the heartbroken and brilliant Georges, is fantastic, and Helen McCrory is a standout as Georges' beautiful wife.<br/><br/>A true masterpiece, told in storybook fashion, not to be missed."

For me, the movie cinematography part is a 8/10 and direction wise it is a 7. This is my opinion ,rest everything is up-to you.

"darosslfc","9","2","4","17 July 2015"," Scorsese for the Children
","Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull, Goodfellas) was critiqued by his daughter about how nothing he's made is something that his grandkids could go see. Scorsese then went on to direct Hugo. <br/><br/>John Logan (Gladiator, Skyfall) pens the script about an orphan who lives in the walls of a Paris train station, and how that boy searches for a message from his late father in the form of an automaton the pair embarked to fix. <br/><br/>Hugo's (Asa Butterfield) escapade begins when a shopkeeper, Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) catches Hugo stealing parts for the automaton from his toy shop. Georges takes a notebook from Hugo and is disturbed by the drawings of the automaton by Hugo's father. He tells Hugo that he shall burn the notebook and Hugo becomes distraught himself.<br/><br/>Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), Georges' goddaughter, pairs up with Hugo for an adventure and promises not to let anything happen to his notebook. The tale goes on to tell the story of how Hugo and Isabelle try to find out the automaton's purpose, and how Isabelle's Papa Geroges is connected to it. They have to watch out for the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who determinedly rounds up any trespassing, stealing orphan to send off to the orphanage while they try to solve the mystery. <br/><br/>This story tells the spectacular narrative of Hugo and has a backdrop of the history of the first films interwoven it. It is a wonderful film that was made in mind for children, but is one that both kids and adults can enjoy. Scorsese has added another work of art to his list. One that is unlike any of his other films. I advise you, if you haven't seen it, to add it to yours."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","2","4","30 December 2014"," Scorsese's tribute to Méliès
","You will not find too many movies in Martin Scorsese's recent filmography as a director that won't include Leonardo DiCaprio. ""Hugo"" is one of them. And even with his poster boy missing, Scorsese sticks to what has worked in the past. There is 64 shared cast and crew members between ""Hugo"" and ""Shutter Island"", Scorsese's previous film, including Emily Mortimer and Ben Kingsley. The closing credits start pretty much exactly after 2 hours and it is two hours very much worth watching. The two child actors Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Moretz don't play characters who require an incredible range, but they both do a very solid job with what they were given and are among the main reasons this turned out so well. Ben Kingsley is the heart and soul of the film playing film pioneer Georges Méliès and he did not receive half the awards attention he deserved for his portrayal. Sacha Baron Cohen plays the main antagonist (if you can call him that given he saves the boy's life at one point) of the film always on the lookout with his dog for little Hugo to put him in an orphanage. If you know SBC, you will also know that he always brings some weird comedy to his portrayals. Same here. Little fun fact: One year later, he played another strangely French slightly antagonistic character in ""Les Misérables"". Christopher Lee, Emily Mortimer and Richard Griffiths in one of his last performances played smaller parts that did not add a lot really. Michael Stuhlbarg and Helen McCrory, however, did.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" is a brilliant tribute to the early days of movie making. The transitions from what Scorsese filmed to what the real Méliès filmed are as flawless as all the other technical factors in this movie. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it and I am not surprised at all, the film won 5 Oscars in the visual and technical categories. Very deserving. Paris in winter is just as breathtakingly beautiful as the dream sequence with the derailing train was edge-of-seat stuff. Maybe the next dream sequence was one too many. The costumes are top-notch as well. Ironically, the movie ""Hugo"" came in second or third to in the ""Best Picture"" race at the Oscars (Michel Hazanavicius' ""The Artist"") is not entirely different in terms of the plot. Scorsese is possibly the best director right now when it comes to making film on film. A large part of ""The Aviator"" already dealt with movie making and here it is almost the entire movie if you ignore the nonetheless fascinating subplots.<br/><br/>This movie is worth seeing alone for all the film references, for example how people ran away from the train. The film also references ""The Great Train Robbery"" and the reaction of audiences was the same back then being worried about actually getting shot by the bandits in the movie. What I also found interesting was the thought (by the Lumière brothers among others) that movies could just be a temporary trend and would quickly become uninteresting to general audiences again. Well, more than 100 years later, they are more popular than ever. ""Hugo"" is a wonderful film and I urge everybody to see it. The bigger the screen you watch it on, the better. It's a feast. If you have never heard of Méliès, that is not a problem at all. This film will make you curious about his work and you can find pretty much all the surviving films from this most prolific filmmaker online."
"scramcat-1","3","2","4","29 December 2013"," Cluttered, overbearing, and bloated with its own muchness
","I didn't like the movie ""Hugo"". I can see why many people said Scorsese lost his talent.<br/><br/>After watching it all the way through, I could see the story elements and concepts that conveyed the point of the story. And it was a good point: Life is like a complex machine whose purpose isn't necessarily obvious at any isolated moment, and how we all have a function but sometimes that function is to facilitate someone else's purpose and sometimes it's to pass our purpose onto another person. And even after a set of functions becomes apparent and a bigger purpose is accomplished, the machine keeps rolling forward and we shift into new functions for new purposes, sometimes reawakening previous purposes in a new context.<br/><br/>Except Scorsese really f'ed it up.<br/><br/>The movie was visually ugly. It may have worked on a big theater screen but on TV it was cluttered, overbearing, and bloated with its own muchness. Perhaps in 3D it worked but in 2D it looked gimmicky.<br/><br/>The digital effects were heavy-handed and obvious, poorly matching grain and contrast of the film plates. Old school matte paintings on glass would have fit the period better. Gears and machinery were excessive and gratuitous, other than in the clock towers why were there insane amounts of gigantic gears inside the train station walls? And There was no harmony or flow to how the people and trains moved, for a story about the machinery of life everything should have moved like an intricate dance, instead it was a hodge-podge of random collisions.<br/><br/>The faux red/blue Technicolor effect was gratuitous and botched. Besides being an anachronism relative to the period of the story, the lighting and contrast were all wrong. In 2-color Technicolor, did you ever see anything back-lit or with intense contrast or white glare? No, you did not. 2-color Technicolor had low to medium contrast at best, lighting was even, and white was avoided because it looked sickly.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley's make-up was an embarrassment. In the flashbacks to when his character Méliès was a movie maker, I couldn't tell if it was a look-alike younger actor under an ill-fitting foam latex mask or a low-res digital overlay on the real Kingsley. And that awful bulbous nose... Yes, Kingsley has a larger nose but between make-up, lighting, and camera positioning it looked like 5 pounds of foam latex covered with Spackle to eliminate every pore or other hint that it might be living flesh. And too often he was shot head-on (for 3D maybe?), making his face look like a lumpfish.<br/><br/>Another big problem was that the Hugo character was unlikeable from the start. In the very first shot when we see him peering through the cut-out clock numbers, he looks like he has fetal alcohol syndrome, dim-witted and clueless. It's hard to shake that first impression. The only time he shows any skill or cleverness is when he fixes the broken clockwork mouse (and even then, the digital effect of the toy mouse in action is annoyingly fake). Other than that, Hugo is clumsy, obvious, and lacks any guile or finesse... the opposite of what you would think an child would become when forced to survive alone hiding in the train station walls.<br/><br/>The story was propelled by a fragile conceit and the movie would have been over in 5 minutes if the principal characters had a lick of common sense. Imagine the former movie maker confronting Hugo at the toy shop this way:<br/><br/>MELIES: Why do you have a notebook full of notes about my automaton? HUGO: It was my father's notebook, we were repairing the automaton together. MELIES: What? You have my automaton? Let's you and I repair it together! (roll end credits)<br/><br/>Too many characters keep secrets that aren't secret at all, or evade answering the simplest of questions for no particular reason. I lost count of the number of times Hugo said ""You don't understand!"" but never explained anything that would have made sense of his actions.<br/><br/>So many stupid unanswered questions. Why didn't Hugo's drunkard uncle tell the station management that he had to take in his orphaned nephew? Why didn't Hugo tell the Station Master that his uncle, a station employee, had disappeared? Why did the story make it seem as if Hugo had been alone for years when, as we find out later, it was only 2 months? Why didn't the station management notice when the uncle didn't collect his pay for 2 months? Why was Hugo so secretive about the automaton when all he had to say was that it was special to his father and he wanted to keep that memory? Why did the girl refuse to tell Hugo where she got the heart-shaped key? Why did the Méliès' wife freak out over the automaton's drawing and give Hugo the bum's rush when all she had to do was say that it would have brought back painful memories for her husband? Why was it so easy for the wife to say just that after the film historian flattered her looks? Why would a giant glass clock face in a high tower have hinged panes just big enough for a child to squirm through? Why didn't Hugo bring the automaton along with the film historian and the projector when they all visited Méliès' home? Why did no one give Hugo a decent meal or at least a healthy snack?<br/><br/>I could go on all day.<br/><br/>The elements of a very good movie were in there amongst the nonsensical vanity, but the script, director, and designer ruined it. I look forward to the black-and-white real film remake in 10 years by someone who understands that style must never overshadow substance."

","Due to high IMDb ratings, I thought it'd be a good movie. A hell boring movie, ran for 2 hours and what happened at the last? As expected. No entertainment at all. Though, Ben Kingsley's performance led it to a 5 from my side. It'd have been struggling to get 2 otherwise.<br/><br/>It starts from a boy who loves fixing things. He tries to find the purpose of his life. According to him, everybody comes with a particular purpose. His father died accidentally and left an automaton for him. It starts boring henceforth. Watch it at your own risk. Or may be you have no purpose in your life other than watching such a lackluster movie with no head no tail!! 5 for Ben Kingsley."
"DubhDoo","6","2","4","2 January 2013"," Technically marvellous, yet unfortunately disappointing
","Maybe I missed something, but this should have been a truly great. Yes, I'm well aware that many have proclaimed it to be exactly that, with numerous critics placing it on their 'top 10 of 2011' lists, however, I cannot say that I was so taken with the 22nd film from Martin Scorsese. The book, by Brian Selznick, upon which this film was based was quite wonderful, an inventive mixture of the graphic novel and the children's book with flourishes no doubt indebted to early cinema. Once it was announced that Scorsese (a favourite of mine) would be adapting it and making what was essentially his first children's film, I was rather excited. <br/><br/>It follows a young orphan named Hugo (Asa Butterfield) who lives alone in a Parisian train station. In his possession lies a mysterious automaton, which arouses the curiosity of the bitter old toymaker Georges (Ben Kingsley) and results in our hero going on an adventure of sorts with Georges' granddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), whilst simultaneously trying to avoid the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen).<br/><br/>It is clear to see that the great director poured his heart and soul into this film, most notably through its exploration of silent films. We see Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd et al, in fantastic clips from old classics. Then we have Georges Melies, who Ben Kingsley's character is revealed to be. He delivers quite possibly the film's best and most touching scene, where he takes Hugo and his granddaughter through his history as filmmaker, making countless silent pictures including his best known work 'A Trip to the Moon'. With all this, Scorsese is paying deep respect to these filmmakers and stars, and subsequently acknowledging the lasting influence they've had on his work. It's just a shame then that film feels so, well, emotionless. Sure, it was a joy to see such classics of the silent era once more, but what does that matter when the main characters aren't engaging on an emotional level? I only found myself longing to watch those films as opposed to the one at hand. Did I care for Hugo? No, not really, and that's what ruined it for me. I knew I was supposed to like these characters and connect with them, but I just didn't.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the film looks absolutely beautiful, as Robert Richardson's cinematography has a consistent majestic elegance throughout, seen no better than in a sweeping opening shot which takes us on a brief trip through the station concluding in a nice introduction to the titular character. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is as reliable as ever, while the similarly reliable Howard Shore adds another impressive score to his repertoire and John Logan delivers a more-than-solid screenplay. The acting is all fairly consistent also, whether it's Sacha Baron Cohen's moustache-twirling Inspector, Ben Kingsley reflective turn as the brilliant French filmmaker or even Asa Butterfield who successfully holds his own as the lead. It also had a lovely level of innocence, something unfortunately missing from so many children's films today.<br/><br/>So with all aspects of the film so well done, why don't I think it's great? Because it feels as if something is missing, some vital ingredient to give that extra oomph. Similar to a functioning automaton, all its parts work very well and competently, but in the end it's just a bit too mechanical. As I stated earlier, it is clear that this is a movie which means a lot to Scorsese, with it essentially being a well- crafted love letter to early cinema. Unfortunately, he has delivered an odd beast: a deeply personal yet impersonal movie."
"listofnames","5","2","4","23 December 2012"," beautiful
","On the plus side this film's set design is quite stunning. The backdrops of Paris are also impressively beautiful and almost dream like. It would make you fall in love with Paris and want to visit purely from the visuals (really). The film starts off well enough and maintains some sort of magical allure for the first hour but then becomes decidedly convoluted and less magical. Adult and real-world problems intrude and the fantastical illusion is rather shattered. I was under the impression this was a borderline kid's film, perhaps I got that wrong. No kid would have the patience for this 2hr+ film that begins to drag around half way. The film becomes hijacked by a plot line based on the famous french film director Georges Méliès. I don't enjoy a huge slap of real life in my fantasy films! Kind of takes away from the point."
"dougpc","3","2","4","10 September 2012"," The 3D Effect is Somewhat Diffuse
","I'm a cinema buff and a big fan of Martin Scorsese, so on paper this would appear to be a lock as a great movie. So what happened? The English seem to make these kinds of movies with ease — a film about young people or old people that doesn't talk down or pander to kids or adults. Something like Billy Elliot or Another Year. But despite a uniformly excellent, mostly Brit cast the result is a sappy American film. It seems like Scorsese was channeling Steven Spielberg at his most infantile, prelapsarian, sappy best. And like a good Spielberg movie, Hugo is exceedingly well crafted, it's just too slow, too predictable and not very entertaining. It's like watching a glacier melt.<br/><br/>Most of all it's so sappy, it should come with vial of Insulin. The only two characters who manage a scintilla of interest are Sacha Baron Cohen, whose Station Inspector is a gratifying mixture of Inspector Clousseau and Colonel Klink and Christopher Lee's subtly nuanced Monsieur Labisse. I watched it in 2D so the sequences staged for 3D effect looked dumb, sort of like Dr. Tong's 3D House of Cats on Second City's Monster Chiller Horror Theatre. Now if only Christopher had bared his fangs and drained those two annoying kids of all their blood."

","I loved this movie. The cast, characters and acting are so good. Thank you Martin Scorsese. It deserves the awards that it won, in my eyes. I have seen it twice. Totally delightful, enchanting. In every aspect it was stellar, story was layered and complex with casting and performances hitting every possible correct note exquisitely. Its set is absolutely stunning, cinematography is just gorgeous, sound tracks are perfect match. <br/><br/>While the artist is charming, novel, and well done, the story is utterly simplistic and predictable, it was too long and became a bit tedious and for me, like most not worthy of a second viewing. The help is a lovely story with strong performances but does not approach the extraordinary complexity of magnificence on every level that is Hugo.<br/><br/>It is a movie that needs to be appreciated for its finer aspects and deeper meaning if it is to be appreciated properly, which is noble enough but could feel exclusive to some. Hugo was one of those movies that you don't mind watching year after year. You'll hear something you missed or see something new each time. Brilliant acting, directing and overall inspiring. The movie with all it's inherent magic has won every honor that I as an artist can present to it."
"todesbroiler-379-608363","9","2","4","25 May 2012"," Wonderful but not for everyone
","So I went to see the movie after the Academy Awards fame here in Germany with some friends. And I must say that this movie really bedazzled me.<br/><br/>The setting is taking place in Paris in the fifties i believe, where in the main train station young Hugo secretly lives and checks the local mechanical clocks. Always in fear of the strict station overseer played very well by Sasha Baron Cohen. One day he gets caught stealing supplies from an old toy maker, because he wants to finish an mechanical human which his dead father tried to repair. Being forced to redeem himself by working for the toy maker he gets to know his adopted daughter, which he introduces into his magical world behind the clockworks. As the story unfolds you get to know of the connection between the mechanical human, the toy maker and his past, not wanting to spoil it here.<br/><br/>When I say its not for everyone, that is because you got to have a good sake of your childish imagination and the ability to get very enthusiastic over certain scenery and magic moments. My friends didn't like it so much in the end because they lack the enthusiasm and found the acting too childish. For me as a steam punk/clockwork punk fan it was just heaven and the deepened look into the movie making of the twenties was just heart warming. I watched it 3D and found that the effect was OK but not overused because its more of a story telling film not aiming for visual effects all day long.<br/><br/>The ending was very well and gave you that warm fuzzy feeling that everything in the world can turn out nice, and even the station overseer has a soft core, without being corny or cheesy.<br/><br/>The actors did a good job, kids just being kids, with a little bit of a stereotype though going for the cheeky little girl that can be a bit annoying. Ben Kingsley one of my favorites in this one just gives a very believable performance and Sasha Baron Cohen proofs that he can play other roles then Borat/Ali G./Bruno stereotypes. The rest of the crew was also spot on with Jude Law as the caring father, and Christopher Lee as a book shop owner (what can that guy play without fitting?)"
"kosmasp","8","2","4","11 May 2012"," Stunning
","Story-wise this might not be as flawless as some had hoped for (difficult to tell sometimes), but the cinematography, the love and care with which Scorsese handled a ""kids"" film (from the man that brought you movies aimed at an adult crowd that is saying something) is just astonishing. Very careful framing, great effects and Scorsese (known) love for cinema shines through in every frame of it.<br/><br/>Even just watching the trailer (which I had the pleasure of doing a couple of times recently again), before or after you watch the movie gives you just a good feeling overall. The boy has been cast good, Chloe shows she can be in serious and mellow roles too. Sascha Baron Cohens story might be a bit of a stretch for some, though I think they enjoy his comic relief moments as much as everyone else did."
"xtcsnowman","5","2","4","14 April 2012"," An OK film that could have been so much better !
","I waited a while before i watched Hugo and I must say overall I was disappointed. I had seen all the written plaudits beforehand, the Oscar and BAFTA nominations etc and the premise seemed to be a good one. However, when it came to the film itself, I had to wonder at times if I was watching the same film as everybody else. Throwing together a great director, some good special effects and a good story, does not a great movie make ! OK so the story was OK, the effects were pretty good, but thats where the plus points really have to end. Some incredibly poor 'stage school' children 'acting' and an incredibly annoying, hammy and over the top 'performance' from Sasha Baron Cohen left me feeling that the chance to make a really great film here had been wasted.<br/><br/>Brilliant acting talent like Richard Griffiths, Ray Winstone and Frances De La Tour seem to have been given nondescript parts simply to try and make the film play more credible to the British movie going public. The one acting highlight being Ben Kingsley, as always and in a way the better subject and focus for the movie. What a pity his character wasn't the focal point, with a few tweaks of the story the children could easily have been dispensed with.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, there were some nice moments, some clever little touches and some nice inter meshing of truth and fairy tale. And with that all important 'feel good' factor at the end, I can sort of see why some people thought this was a 10 out of 10 film. Sadly however, not me."

","Trying with restrain to maintain a neutral look upon this outstanding film it might be running a little longer that the subject matter invites to, however it is a brilliant piece of cinematographic artwork. This comes from the obvious unity between form and content. We get introduced to the first filmmaker who was fascinated by the magic and illusion the new medium made possible. This clearly shows in the surviving examples from his old movies. They are filled with the naive charm and childlike fascination we still appreciate today. The ingenious concept in HUGO is to present this story in the same way but now of course with all the modern magic and illusion that the CGE technique provides. We also note, that humans tend to appear to be presented in a stiffer and simplified form being put through the CGE process, but in this particular context it does not matter. This is a true fairy tale told in an impressive and convincing way. Hats off to the director and his fine staff of modern magicians as well as to the old master Meliés himself, who is well worth the tribute."
"lee_eisenberg","9","2","4","25 March 2012"," France wins
","Knowing that Martin Scorsese directed movies like ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"", it would seem inconceivable that a movie targeted at a younger audience. But not only did Marty accomplish that, he did a masterful job. This combination of early cinema with a child's quest to right the wrongs is an impressive one. More than a series of special effects, it's the perfect balance of fantasy and history. The appearance of the Robin Hood book is significant since Hugo Cabret's existence mirrors that of Robin Hood.<br/><br/>All in all, I really liked ""Hugo"". I now have an urge to watch all of Georges Méliès's surviving movies, and maybe also the ones by the Lumière brothers. Having not seen any of the other Best Picture nominees, I can't judge whether it should have won, but it's still one that I recommend. And more than anything, the Oscars that went to ""Hugo"" and ""The Artist"" - both associated with France - are a real slap in the face to all the idiots who came up with ""freedom fries"" (and similar things) nine years ago.

Hugo is not that.<br/><br/>Hugo is magical and has a fantastic tone and somewhat nice pacing. A lot of the pictures displayed are amazing and astonishing, yet not over doing it. In that perspective the movie is fantastic. You can't really create better movie magic. <br/><br/>Anyhow, this is not the whole truth. Even though the cinematic, all the camera angles, the music, the pacing, everything is perfectly executed the movie sometime lacks in several other dimensions.<br/><br/>For example, the actors are sometimes a little bit tense and the dialogue feels thick and unrealistic. Especially the dialogue between the children. Sometimes the story feels disjointed and a little bit rushed. Also the editing sometimes seemed a little bit accelerated. Also, the story lacks surprises and are mostly very predictive which is boring for movie regulars.<br/><br/>They should have ""fin-tuned"" some pieces in this movie if they wanted to create a ""masterpiece"". The story is also not what I expected even though I liked the movie-history lesson, but I wanted something bigger and more exciting. <br/><br/>Anyhow I think Scorsese and the movie team are proud over the film. It is one of the best child-movies made in recent years and also very educating. But it does not meet the potential it could have reached and is not something ""out of the ordinary"". But if you're looking for a chance to dream away into another time and experience a storytale with great warmth, magical tone and some laughs it may be just what you're looking for.<br/><br/>7.5 / 10"

I loved Hugo; the reason I read about cinema history, the reason I love movies from all decades is what inspired Scorsese to create this little masterpiece. There is a purity and warmth around the whole film from beginning to end. It's about people who are yearning for inspiration, lovers of beauty and loyalty.

"meeza","8","2","4","14 January 2012"," Scorsese scores again!
","Legendary Director Martin Scorsese likes movies; he really, really likes them. Sorry to start this review with a Sally Field-esque play on words, but I just had to mention that since Scorsese's latest gem ""Hugo"" is Marty's love letter to movies and film preservation. ""Hugo"" stars child actor Asa Butterfield as the title character. Hugo is an orphan who lives in the walls of a Paris train station in the 1930's, and works the station's clock due to the absence of who is supposed to be working the clock that being Hugo's lush uncle who goes missing due to his clockwork drunkenness. Hugo's later father, played by Jude Law, was an inventor who was trying to fix a robot before his unfortunate death in a museum fire. Hugo goes to extremes to find a heart-shaped key to run the automation of the robot that his late father was working on. Hugo befriends Isabelle the goddaughter of George Melies, the cranky toy store owner whose past holds a cinematic secret that that might be the key to Hugo's robotic dreams. Scorsese's illuminating and heartfelt picture is truly movie magic due to the vision of master Marty. John Logan's ""Hugo"" screenplay was solid, but at times it stalled in its narrative progression. But in all, Logan's word-run with ""Hugo"" was worthy. Ben Kingsley was superb (when isn't he?) as Melies, and child actor Butterfield's time has come in the movie business with his impressive debut as Hugo. I have inspected Sacha Baron Cohen's performance as the Hugo-intimated ""Station Inspector"", and I must say that it passed its thespian inspection. Chloe Grace Moretz continues her rise to ""tween actress"" supremacy with another impressive turn, here with her charismatic performance as Isabelle. The art direction of ""Hugo"" is a piece of cinematic beauty with its timeless depiction of 1930's Paris; and in due time it will garner the Best Art Direction Academy Award. I think it's time for me to end my ""Hugo"" review. And the time has also come for you to set your clock for a ""Hugo"" viewing. **** Good"
"paudie","7","2","4","30 December 2011"," Scorsese's children's movie takes an unexpected detour
","Hugo begins as a great kids movie but perhaps Scorsese gets a bit distracted and takes us on a detour involving the birth of the movie industry. Hugo is an orphan who lives in a Parisian railway station and whose job is to wind the clocks in the station. His life story is quite sad and the opening part of the movie explains how he became an orphan.<br/><br/>In his spare time he is rebuilding a metal robot that his father was working on when he died. While looking for spare parts for the robot he has a confrontation with an elderly man who runs a toy shop in the station. The man (played by Ben Kingsley) also seems to have a sad life story that he doesn't want to share. Hugo also meets the godchild of the shop owner (Chloe Sevigny) who introduces him to world of books.<br/><br/>Scorsese's consummate movie making skill is evident from nearly every shot as he brilliantly creates the magical world of the railway station and Hugo's life within its walls.<br/><br/>However towards the end of the movie Scorsese decides to change the main theme of the movie and it becomes an explanation of the early days of European cinema. I think that this part of the movie may not appeal to younger viewers who will be more interested in Hugo's story, which is overshadowed for the last part of the movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie but perhaps children won't appreciate Scorsese's homage to early cinema towards the end."
"slbain9000-871-31776","8","2","4","24 December 2011"," Wonderful, complex, subtle tale from Scorsese/Schoonmaker
","The negative reviews you see here should not dissuade you from seeing this gem. I think a lot of people were expecting something other than they got, and did not accept the film on its own terms.<br/><br/>First, this is not for little kids. It's a story that centers on a child's experience, but it is about deeper themes and the history of cinema. Georges Melies was a genius of the early days of film, and a tragic figure whose career was destroyed by WWI and the thievery of many, including Thomas Edison. Hugo is a story about the redemption of a broken man, told though the eyes of a child who is trying to find his place in the world as a fixer of broken things.<br/><br/>It is a visual masterpiece (in 2D or 3D; I differ with those who say the 3D ""matters"" in this film. It's fine, but not needed) and introduces us to a wonderful young actor in Asa Butterfield. Look for him in the upcoming ""Ender's Game"". The entire cast is superb, with Ben Kingsley at his best, Chloe Grace Moretz shining brightly, and a remarkably controlled performance by Sacha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>See Hugo!

"Hellmant","7","2","4","7 December 2011"," As far as pure eye candy goes the movie is definitely a cinematic joy!
","'HUGO': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese tries his hand at 3D and kids' films with this 1930s adventure. It's an adaptation of the 2007 book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick about an orphan living in the walls of a Paris train station trying to solve a mysterious secret left to him by his deceased father. The screenplay was written by John Logan and the film stars Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer and Jude Law. The movie should captivate most children and the visuals are amazing but it's a little too slow paced and emotionally uninvolving to hold the attention of most moviegoers I'd say.<br/><br/>Butterfield makes an impressive leading man as Hugo Cabret, an orphan who's father (Law, who we see only in flashbacks) left him a notebook and a nonfunctioning automation with a lock with no key. Hugo now lives in the walls of a Paris train station (in the 30s) fixing clocks and gets by through petty theft. One day he's busted trying to steal from the owner of a toy shop, Georges Melies (Kingsley), who in turn steals his notebook from him (along with all his stolen possessions). He befriends the toy shop owner's granddaughter, Isabelle (Moretz), in an attempt to win back his notebook and the two begin an adventure to solve his father's secret. While doing so they also must avoid the station inspector (Cohen) who loves snatching up orphans and sending them away to orphanages.<br/><br/>Scorsese once again masters all the technical aspects of the film (especially the visuals and the 3D is amazing) but the characters and story left me wanting more. The acting is all outstanding but I found the film just a little too emotionally distant and couldn't really relate to any of the characters that much. The heart of the film is in the right place though and Scorsese perfectly captures the look and feel of a classic 1930s kids' film. Like I said I'm sure young children will be more than fascinated by the movie but older teens, as well as adults, will probably be a little bored. It is slow paced but there's always something wonderful to look at; as far as pure eye candy goes the movie is definitely a cinematic joy!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXu8bs0LI9A"
"colinrgeorge","7","2","4","6 December 2011"," Half and Half
","Who's the audience for Hugo? With roots in the fantasy/adventure genres and a comfortable color palette for the Harry Potter and Twilight crowds, ""preteen"" seems a safe bet. But it undergoes a metamorphosis around the midpoint that fixed my posture and put the kids to bed. Not that I'm complaining.<br/><br/>The two halves of Hugo are at odds. In the first hour, we meet Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield – the spitting image of a prepubescent Malcolm MacDowell), an orphan and wee tinkerer living behind the walls of a Parisian train station circa 1930. He lives only to wind the clocks and scavenge parts for his prized automaton – a wrecked robot with sentimental ties to his late father (Jude Law). A chance encounter with a young girl (Chloë Moretz) may be the key to unlocking the secret of his antiquated android.<br/><br/>In the second, Scorsese taps his inner film buff. Enter French silent filmmaker Georges Méliès, whose spectacular oddball A Trip to the Moon features prominently. Hugo posthumously honors the artist's under-appreciated oeuvre, complete with stunning recreations of his avant-garde genre flicks. The also-underrated Michael Stuhlbarg plays film historian Rene Tabard, a champion of Méliès' lost legacy.<br/><br/>Somehow, the story of a boy and his robot and the redemption of a brilliant, misunderstood artist mesh, if reluctantly. I can't feign complete enthusiasm for Hugo's by-the-numbers fantasy beginning, but loved the playful manipulation of art history it preceded. Conversely, I imagine the general audience will go for the ""Once Upon A Time,"" but neither know nor care who Méliès is. Some may walk away none the wiser to the elements of nonfiction.<br/><br/>Unifying Hugo's disparate halves are gorgeous storybook visuals bolstered by inspired use of 3D tech. Action sequences up the gee-whiz factor, but Scorsese's most compelling use of the gimmick is also among his most subtle; touches like adding the effect to Méliès' films has the revelatory effect of making history come alive. And it doesn't carry the stink of desperation that accompanies Disney and Star Wars' conversions. As a magician who embraced every trick in the book, Méliès would have loved 3D.<br/><br/>Another constant is the caliber of the performances. The principals are solid, and Hugo is packed with veteran character actors who breathe vibrant life into their world. Folks like Ray Winstone as Hugo's Drunken Uncle, Ben Kingsley as a shopkeeper with a secret, Christopher Lee as a kindhearted librarian, and Sacha Baron Cohen as the bumbling station inspector help even the one-dimensional roles shine.<br/><br/>Pushing himself while pushing 70, you have to admire Scorsese's dogged tenacity. The director won his long-belated Best Director Oscar in 2007 for The Departed, which seems to have freed him from falling into an Eastwood-esque downward spiral; first with the psychological thriller Shutter Island, and now with the unabashed fantasy, Hugo. That jarring juxtaposition is just one factor in obfuscating who its audience is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Diplomatically, the new Martin Scorsese picture aims to please everyone, but divides more than it unites. Parents may be left twiddling their thumbs during the first drama-lite hour, and kids may nod off during the second half history lesson. However, for a particular breed of cinephile, Hugo is magic – a love letter to film from a master of the medium. Scorsese's adoration is tangible – not for Georges Méliès specifically – but for artists both great and small. It's sublime. It's beautiful. But bring a pillow."

","It's that time of year, where all I do is put the Christmas records on repeat and watch any and all releases of Christmas themed movies (if the trailer has red, snow and Santa, I'll watch it). That entitles movies that have tragic beginnings, heartfelt moments, comedy and falling snow in some past century location. Hugo by Martin Scorsese embodies all of those aspects and more, much ""3D"" more. The setting was dazzling and story line incredible. I saw this movie with my friend and we both had a preconceived notion that anything in 3D was going to be horrible, especially when you wear glasses it's a pain to wear another pair on top, but Scorsese made the film so much worthwhile and the 3D was used incredibly. I felt as if I were one of the passengers walking in the Paris train station and if I reached my hand out I could touch the croissants in the corner and talk to Asa Butterfield who plays Hugo. I was less impressed by his acting but the one who stole the show was definitely Chloe Moretz, she plays with the British accent perfectly. Butterfield as Hugo was alright but I didn't really feel his pain or excitement in some scenes, it was quite bland. Moretz was just amazing to watch, I was a huge fan of her in Kick-ass so when I saw her in this movie I was so excited to see such a huge transformation. Scorsese made a great choice in casting her as the female lead. Overall, Hugo is a fun felt movie for the whole family and the set design and effects were a joy to watch in 3D. This is Scorsese's first 3D movie and already it's the best film of the season. Happy Holidays IMDb!"

","I liked this movie from the start, although I did have issues with it. The basic idea of a kid living in the infrastructure of a train station is really cool, and his home, with a million gears, is extraordinary. At the same time, I was put off by an early chase scene in which a rather cartoonish villain chases after Hugo. It felt very much like something you'd see in a kid's movie, and while Hugo is very kid friendly, for the most part it does not fall into kid movie clichés. But there are a few, and the chase is one of them.<br/><br/>While the whole living in a clock thing is cool, I felt the movie really took off when it started focusing on the second part of the story, which I won't give away. My girlfriend thought this might be where it would lose kids, but I don't think so. The movie becomes better and better, and is really fascinating and touching by the end."

","PROS:
~The movie is a love letter to early cinema. It is for the people who love cinema and their desire to learn the process of how a movie is made. Hugo actually pays homage to the first movies ever created and how these affected the subsequent creators (the train scene from the movie 'Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat' by the Lummiere brothers is an early version of the 3-D technique). It tells the amazing story of pioneer filmmaker Georges Melies (Ben Kinglsey) and the flashback scene about his accomplishments (especially the movie 'A Trip to the Moon') is captivating and magical.
~Asa Butterfield is decent as young Hugo, a curious young boy determined to survive in a hard and cold world. Chloe Grace Moretz brilliantly portrays a bright, energetic Isabelle. Both of them makes you feel like a kid again when your thoughts were more imaginative and you always looked for an adventure. The movie is actually a reflection of Scorsese's childhood.
~The film points out that creative people sometimes need a push in the back from someone else in order to realise what they're worth. Ben Kingsley gives the best performance in the whole movie. This push is also obvious through the secondary characters such as the one played Sasha Baron Cohen who has feelings for a certain woman (played by Emily Mortimer) but his insecurities keeps him away.
~Martin Scorsese shines as always from the chair of the director. The opening track shot with the camera panning over Paris and ending to the train station is breathtaking. The production design is monumental and especially the detail in the clock tower with the metallic gears and the clockwork is remarkable. Furthermore, the costumes and the music capture perfectly the era of 1930s.<br/><br/>CONS:
~It isn't clear where the film is aimed at. It is supposed to be a child's adventure but eventually this adventure is quickly pushed to the background for more educational themes. As a result, elements like the slapstick humor -mostly in the beginning- are totally unfitting.
~The subplots of the movie aren't interesting enough. The secondary characters are entertaining but the overall film feels incoherent at times because of them. For example, what is the point of Hugo's chasing by the Cohen's character?
~There are some moments -the more dramatic ones- where the acting by Butterfield and Moretz is wooden."

And also because Martin Scorsese directed it, not immediately a name known for making bad movies. Those were the only two reasons, otherwise I wouldn't have watched it, as a family movie isn't really the genre I would go for. That's probably the weakest thing about this movie, the story, it looks a bit childish, but credit where credit's due it's visually very well made. For that alone it already deserved an award. I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie because strangely I did, even though it's more for kids than adults, the cinematography is stunning. The cast was good, most of the actors had already a good reputation and even the younger actors have proved by now that they can act.

","I think this video is too beautiful and too romantic. It feels like fairy tales and strange dreams I saw in my childhood, and all the similar, strange and mysterious dreams. It is a world that seems to be true and illusory in childhood. Everything has a certain meaning. Wonderful, but confusing.<br/><br/>The fairy-tale fantasy of the movie is not only the fantasy brought by the sophisticated machinery and rich and beautiful colors in the picture, but also the fantasy in the character setting.<br/><br/>A boy who travels alone in a large and magnificent, mechanically constructed city and in the clock tower, he is like a teenager who ventures alone, exploring and surviving in a strange and strange city. He is precocious and lonely, he keeps a secret, he is persistently working hard for the common wish with his father.<br/><br/>The policeman patrolling the train station admires the girl who sells flowers.

They are like small, moving people in a strange, strange, huge and complicated world, with their own stories. Their existence constitutes this world.<br/><br/>As for the opening of the mystery of the master of the toy store, which is the master of the movie, the Merrière.

The robot is dreamy and mysterious, and as an excellent mechanic, Hugo is also a magician and a dream maker.<br/><br/>Regarding emotions, in addition to love for dreams, there are other places that touch people. At the end, the policeman grabbed Hugo and said, ""A child must have a home,"" Hugo begged the police to let him go, and said, ""I don't understand why my father is dying, why I am alone, and this is my chance, Rebirth ...

","Initially, tonally very different to the book, I balked against it as an adaptation, but now I admire it as a genuinely Heartwarming tale and as very much the perfect choice for Scorsese to express himself in the new medium of the time. The 3D ranks amongst the greatest I've seen and enhances every frame and even the story with its carefully constructed layers, complexity and depth. There's a beautiful staining of the light in some scenes like an old cell of film or a bleached image reproduction from a book. While the film is tonally very mixed, its technical work and its heart is good honest stuff; A touch of magic woven between the reality and sadness of artists forgotten in their time.

Sacha Baron Cohen is the train inspector ho is hilarious and has a thrilling performance. Later on in the film, someone calls the train inspector saying that the older clock-worker had passed away, so now they're trying to figure out who is working them.

"stephaniegmalmgren","6","0","0","9 January 2020"," A movie by a cinema history lover, for the cinema history lover. At least in the last act.
","To start us off on a high note, I will say that the use of 3D was wonderful. Instead of a classic ""dodge"" feeling, the 3D draws you into the screen, pulling you deeper in and exploring a lovely layering. The best part of the film was the flashback to Méliès' work, where lovingly recreated sets showed us exactly why 3D was the right choice, working the actually layered sets masterfully.<br/><br/>Other than that, I will sadly have to join some other reviewers in finding it rather disappointing. The story is confused and reaches out here and there never to fully grab on to something. It isn't until the last act where we see what it's about, and then it left me with a sense of wasted time. Instead of narrowing it down and honing in, a halfhearted attempt was made at portraying a lonely boy's journey into some sort of self discovery, only for it to be cast aside without any notable conflict escalation, tension, or intrigue, to be replaced with the real love letter to Méliès. This love letter turns out to be misused as well, however, since it's overshadowed by the lackluster rest of the film and misplaced focus on our lead character. Méliès' words at his screening, thanking this boy for fixing him, did not come off as well earned. Rather they seem to only be there to be able to justify the rest of the production. Mind you, this has nothing to do with the actor portraying him, there just isn't anything engaging in the story, nor the characters themselves. The love letter deserves to exist on it's own instead.<br/><br/>Hugo, an orphaned boy who runs the clocks at the train station, keeps talking about the connection to his late father, a connection he so longs for and works for through repairing the automaton his father (the three minute cameo by Jude Law) left behind. That's about what we get. Yes, he fixes the automaton, rather easily it seems, yes, he finds the heart shaped key to start it, rather easily it seems, and yes, the machine draws him a picture reminding him of said father (a picture of Méliès' moon, since that was the first film his father saw, and apparently he and Hugo had a huge connection through their shared love for cinema, although we only see this once), but that is literally about it. Not much happens, and what does happen happens far too easily to go on for so long. And this has been going on for ages now. If you think me writing about it is dull, then I don't know what to tell you.<br/><br/>The automaton draws the picture, signs it with ""Georges Méliès"", and then it's only a plot device to discover the filmmaker's identity, and for the sake of Kingsley's character's arc. I wouldn't mind this shift in focus if it happened earlier in the film, but by now we've been here long enough, with a set enough goal, that it leaves a feeling of simply being cheated into watching Sacha Baron Cohen toppling about in stereo images for an hour.<br/><br/>The acting is fine, nothing special to note, dialogue is ok (but rather bland at most to be honest), it looks pretty, and there are fun nods to history. The magic promised wasn't delivered until the very last, and then it felt unrelated to the film as a whole. The automaton was a device, quite literally, and the lacking conflict was resolved quickly. No stakes, no great story to tell, despite the real story of Georges Méliès being interesting, without oddly inserted fiction. I would not call this a straight children's movie, due to how slow moving and frankly boring it is at times (slow moving is lovely done right, I'm no hater), neither is it exclusively a film for adults, given the heavy handed dialogue and humour. As I said, the film feels made for the cinema history lover, as we're constantly ""in on the joke"", but it's too aware of this to feel much more than self-applauding.<br/><br/>To end us on a high note as well, I do appreciate the feeling created at least in some parts, as with the Méliès scenes (although the credit for the real reel magic goes fully to Georges himself). Making this film in top notch 3D takes us a step further into the groundbreaking enchantment one must have felt way back when, marvelling at the early works of our film masters, and it's a charming addition to film history because of this."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","0","0","5 August 2019"," Scorsese's love letter to classic, silent cinema.
","Enchanting. Charming. Magical. After re-watching this film again, I can still confirm Hugo (2011) legitimately earned all its technical Oscars, even if it didn't end up winning Best Picture. Ironically enough, this American movie about the origins of French film lost out to a French movie about the origins of American talking pictures (i.e., The Artist (2011)). Of course, the more surprising aspect of this film was how Martin Scorsese was able to make such an entertaining (and family-friendly) film that didn't involve the mafia at all.<br/><br/>Personally, as an avid lover of classic films, I enjoyed the romanticism related to the earliest of film magicians. Scorsese's love letter to the origins of cinema-and the masters of their craft like Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley)-is a stark reminder of how much we've lost of cinema's heritage due to external events that forced the artistic community to abandon their art. The amount of experimentation and inventive special effects at the turn of the 20th century are still awe-inspiring, and Hugo gives a brief glimpse behind the scenes for how artists like Méliès achieved them.<br/><br/>Of course, the Méliès storyline is only half of this film, as the other half is filled with plenty of amusing sub-plots that swirl around the titular Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield). Inevitably, it's the people of the train station, whose lives intertwine with the numerous passengers just passing through, who gives this movie its heart. All this being said, I'd almost recommend watching this film back-to-back with Méliès' A Trip to the Moon (1902), along with several other classic silent films that make brief appearances like Intolerance (1916), The Kid (1921), Safety Last! (1923), and Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928).<br/><br/>Scorsese's love letter to classic, silent cinema, I give Hugo 5.0 stars out of 5."

","In all humility, Scorsese is one of the best directors of all time. His list of masterpieces includes such films as The Departed, Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver. However, almost all of his movies seem to be very similar in tone: dark and dreary. While almost every one of his films has been its own hallmark of quality, I personally wondered whether he would ever branch out and try to do something different, even if it couldn't match his more adult works. But, skeptics can release their long-held breath, because his first family film, Hugo, is now in theaters. And, even more surprising, it is quite possibly his best film yet. It elevates itself so far above the rank and file ""kiddie film"" that it almost seems a disservice to call it a family-oriented one. Only Pixar has managed to successfully make movies that appeal to so many audiences at once. The story is straightforward enough on the surface: a young boy finds a small robot of sorts and tries to fix it. However, look past the simple trappings, and you will find a movie that effortlessly captures what seems to be Martin Scorsese's persona in a two-hour long bottle. No film I have ever seen manages to distill the innocence of childhood or reverence for filmmaking so delightfully, let alone both at once. The movie has an underlying energy about it that makes it incredibly hard to stop watching. I felt like I would miss something important even if I blinked. I really have to give it up for the three main actors in he film. Asa Butterfield manages to bring such emotion to Hugo's character that you fell something for him before he has even uttered a word. Chloe Moretz is typically terrific as thrill-seeking bookworm Isabelle. Finally, Ben Kingsley perfectly plays the part of the tortured soul, managing to make you feel revulsion, pity, and sympathy towards him as the film goes along. Kingsley has always done a good job of playing villainous roles, but he really steals the spotlight in this case. The one true flaw of this film is, predictably, the 3D. Unlike the current 3D usage standard-setter, Avatar, it really didn't feel necessary. And it made the classic blunder of having things going towards the camera, which just screams laziness. However, it is a testament to the film's overall quality that it was that noticeable, because not many others are so seamlessly brilliant. The best family of the year by a long shot, Hugo is a fun, energetic time that almost anyone can enjoy. And I really do mean anyone. Films like this simply do not come around very often, so enjoy it while it lasts. And chalk up another epic win for the director while you're at it."

","Unique, original, creative, inspired, magical ... Fantastic!
That's my impression of Martin Scorcese's ""Hugo."" It was an exquisite pleasure to stumble upon this movie at a recent television showing on TCM. The reason being that I've only recently viewed my very first George Melies films on a newly -release Bluray of Melies films. What a surprise to discover that ""Hugo"" is a film based at least in part on Melies' life as a film-maker.
Nominated for 11 Academy Awards in 2012 (and picking up 5 Oscars) this movie has it all: set design, costumes, cinematography, visual effects, editing, screenplay, plot - not to mention masterful directing from Scorsese himself. If there's one thing that keeps this film from being a masterpiece, it's the acting, which is certainly adequate but fall short of being outstanding.
I won't go into details about the plot, but anyone familiar with silent films will be delighted to see clips of silent classics interwoven into the plot itself. As well, several well-know silent film motifs are referenced and incorporated into the story line. Of course the focal point in this regard is Melies himself, and we're treated to several clips of Melies' most famous pictures.
""Hugo"" is a meditation on revering the past, family connections, living one's dreams, finding a purpose, never giving up, the passage of time, and the technological wonder of the movies. Well done George Melies, and well done Martin Scorsese!"

","27 November 2011. The 3-D effects of this period movie while not perfect are superior in quality and add to the brilliance and visual impact of the solid, personal and intimate and focused storyline. Whether or not its a technological problem, the most noticeable weakness of the film is the failure to capture the enhanced ambiance of the 3-D potential of the vapor and mist that seemed to be found in many of the scenes in Hugo. Nevertheless the fusion of actual historical characters, the use of 3-D to recall the earliest days of cinema combined with mystery drama of this movie results in a remarkable captivating movie plot that involves the audience on the number of levels - visually, auditory (with notable sound differentials between speakers), clear and singular plot without distracting subplots. The implicit fantasy genre elements of this movie actually are more realized in reality and magic than in sci-fi or fantasy as part of the storyline itself which in some ways makes this movie even more remarkable and involving because of its actual possibilities as an authentic event. The weakness part of the movie occurred toward the end of the movie with the train station's guard who at the last minute makes a decision which appeared to be more based on another character's presence then his own which significantly reduces the emotive and ethical impact of the scene. The two 3-D scenes of the faces of at different times of the station guard and Kingsley are perhaps some of the finest uses of 3-D yet in its achievement of visual clarity and enhancement to cinema since 3-D came into its own. The additional fascinating element of the craftsmanship, the building and fixing and repairing of objects that has seemed to have gone of out fashion in today's contemporary throw away society of printers and consumables makes for both a traditional but enlightening and uplifting moral tale. This is a story of our time using the past, the good parts of it unlike perhaps Charles Dickens. With elements from A.I.

Despite this film having all the right elements to be a masterpiece, it falls short in it's pacing.

The set design is amazing and the special effects will sure to wow you. It also teaches you something more about Melies, and how he became famous. The aspect of Hugo that touched me the most was his curiosity and how he tried so hard to achieve his goal: understand who Melies was This is also one of the first movies in which Scorsese deal with a happy ending and this is strange because usually he always puts in an unexpected conclusion, maybe also sad."

","The film is absolutely beautiful, and appealing to all audiences. One of its most interesting features is the variety of genres such as: adventure, fantasy, action, comedy, romance, drama, science fiction, and even documentary. And all genres work in an impressive harmony. The film is also a great opportunity for people to learn a little more about the ""Invention of the cinema"". Even doing a series of poetic liberties in the construction of the figure of Méliès, the production brings not only recordings of his works, but also images of original classics like ""A Trip to the Moon."" The director - who is passionate about films - chose to run his movie entirely with 3D cameras. The result is stunning and will not disappoint the audience. The notion of depth and accuracy of the objects flying toward him are worthy of applause. ""Hugo"" is basically a letter of thanks from Scorsese to George Méliès, the Lumière brothers and all those who were responsible not only for creating the ""film industry"", but mostly for making it what it is today."

","As soon as the movie starts you immediately understand the great special effects and the excellence integration with 3D.The graphic is awesome!!! The acting was really good and completely convincing. Asa Butterfield delivers a very committed performance as Hugo Cabret, and he shows a lot of promise in his future career. Chloë Grace Moretz, also gives a fine and respectable performance. Sacha Baron Cohen is surprisingly very effective as Station Inspector. Ben Kingsley gives the best performance in the whole movie, he is just superb and deserves some recognition. Overall, the whole cast was top notch. Instead the plot alternates amazing parts with others quite boring, so it hasn't convinced me a lot. However i think it is a movie to watch at least once."
"elsajansson9","7","0","0","1 October 2014"," Hugo, a historical drama about a boy who lives in a train station.
","This film was a true tribute to the silent film era. I loved that the main character Hugo who is a nobody, played such a big part in running the the Paris train station, and that the movie was shown from the point of view of a child. In my opinion thats what makes a perfect children's film, which was adapted from the children's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret. There was great contrast between light and dark scenes. In the lighter scenes there was high exposure which gave it a happier vibe, compare to the darker scene with lower exposure which gave it more of a grim atmosphere. In addition there was great CGI of Paris and the 3D gave the movie some extra depth and made it more realistic. One scene where Isabelle falls in the train station had lots of quick cuts and a worms eye view, it was true to the time period in the film industry. The film makers began to start to play with different camera angles in that era. The angles of the cameras shot the machinery with all the gears, and levers made it look magical. The set design was also magnificent with the intricacies, scope, and industrial look. There were two little thing that bugged me during the film. The first was the constant fog, it seems like they had a fog machine and wanted to use it as much as they could. Secondly it seemed like all the actors had British instead of french accents, it made it feel like I was in London instead of Paris. On the flip side the chemistry between Isabelle and Hugo was sublime and they really played off each other very well. Ben Kingsley also looked perfect for the role of George Méliès, it would be hard to tell the difference if you put Ben and George side by side. My personal favourite part of the film was the dogs, they added a cute touch. Lastly Sacha Baron Cohen who played the station inspector did a great job of presenting slapstick comedy which was relevant during that era. Overall it was a great children's movie that can be thoroughly enjoyed by both children and adults."
"royalewcheese11","7","0","0","1 October 2014"," A solid addition to the oeuvre of a genius.
","Everything, and everyone, has a purpose. Martin Scorsese has spent decades further establishing his purpose, which is to create glorious cinema. He has been infatuated with it for his entire life, and 2011's Hugo is his love letter to the craft in its early ages. Simultaneously, it is somewhat of a fairy tale catering primarily to children - a genre in which the legendary director is well, not exactly known for.<br/><br/>The setting is magical 1930s Paris. A young orphan, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) fixes clocks and such gadgets in a train station, where he also lives. His one goal is to find the missing heart-shaped key that was meant for a mechanical man his father once built. When he meets a shopkeeper with a secret, Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley), and his adventurous young daughter, Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), he may just be able to achieve this goal.<br/><br/>It isn't a particularly compelling story, but when you put a master behind it, you're bound to get something of worth. The film excels in technical departments. With Robert Richardson's seamless cinematography (paired with some CGI) and Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp editing skills, the final product is a wonder to look at. However, the central material at hand is so different from the kind of subject matter Scorsese got into the business for in the first place that the magic he is able to exude from a piece of work is often lost here. He does maintain his signature style, but it isn't quite enough to allow this film to rise into sensational territory for its majority.<br/><br/>But Hugo does provide an inner layer within all of this that does hint at much more. When older-era films become a significant plot point, Scorsese is able to explore the stuff that he truly loves. Not only do these sequences shine over everything else in the film, but they also give off the impression that they are the sole reason Scorsese was interested in making this film at all. Through montages including one that explains the background of Kingsley's character, the core of the film is brought to light and emulated beautifully, sure to please any true fan of the art form. Kingsley gives the best performance in the film by far as a broken man who has lost his strongest passion.<br/><br/>While the film is enjoyable overall, with a lot to admire in the technique, there are only sparks of greatness to be found that nail the higher notes Scorsese is capable of hitting. With hardly adequate child performances and a clumsy Sacha Baron Cohen character thrown into the mix, Hugo is for the most part a rather mild and lesser effort amongst such an amazing filmography. At the end of the film, the cinematic homage storyline is wrapped up in a mesmerizing way, with a potentially unforgettable closing line and a sequence that capsulizes the magic of the medium that Scorsese has conveyed in the past. Then he adds one more scene to close the main storyline involving the children. It is a much less remarkable climax, lacking the grandness of what came before it. Scorsese shoots it in one of his classic long continuous shots, but there isn't a whole lot beyond his technical artistry. Having said that, Hugo is quite a good film with some fantastic individual scenes, and while it may be closer to the bottom tier of the man's work, that is by no means a bad thing considering his brilliance."
"nagsaptarshi","6","0","0","1 October 2014"," Visually brilliant, otherwise average.
","When you get to see that Scorsese is out of his comfort zone and making a movie on the early days of movie making, you got to be curious.The product in the plater is good but certainly not the best of its kind.The poster, the ambiance created by the ace director in the trailers of the movie, the going gaga of the people over it certainly make you thirsty for something outstanding. Unfortunately the thirst remains unquenched.The story is bit too tad and takes longer than you can wait for to build up.Then gradually you expect a grand finale, an outstanding climax which will make amends for the lost time.Sadly enough, you leave the movie hall without that.The acting by the lead actors is OK to say the most.At times Cohen or even the maestro Kingsley go over OTT. The kids do alright.So do the others.But nothing special which can compensate for the lacunae in the storyline is there.The mystery about the kid's father's ( why on earth did Jude Law accept that role) death remains unanswered.The chemistry between the young boy and the girl was half heartedly built.But the outstanding achievement of the director was in getting a stage which is visually brilliant.The use of lights and shadows, the tinkering sounds, the visual effects, the brilliant photography makes the film look exquisite.The Academy people were judicious enough to give this film 5 Oscars, all for its technical superiority and nothing for any of the mainstream awards.Overall, apart from its technical finesse, its certainly not of Scorsese's best.And for movie on movie making, Cinema Paradiso remains way better than this one."

","I really enjoyed this movie for what it was; a fairy tale that portrays the power of the cinema. It is a film in the spirit of the book ""The Christmas Train"". I did feel that the production was a little too polished, or over produced,in that even dirty Uncle Claude wore ""clean"" dirt, and there wasn't a piece of garbage to be seen on the streets or the train station. That being said, Ben Kingsley really does play the part of Georges impeccably. His make up is fantastic. The actors are somewhat over dramatic, but this is a romantic tale that somewhat reminds me of ""Big Fish"" in that the story is so over the top that as a viewer, you are willing to put up with some (almost) overacting. It was interesting to watch it with a group of teens, because none of them thought it was ""cheesy"", or childish, something I thought they might. I think I was the most cynical viewer in the audience going in, but by the end, I too was taken over by the magic of the film, and the love that Georges has for film. The sub plots of the kindling romance between the station inspector (well played by Sacha Baron Cohen) and the flower girl, amongst others, were a nice touch. What I feel really made this a winner in my books was the way it incorporated so many classic pieces of film (scenes from ""The General"", ""Safety Last"" amongst others.) I teach a high school film and TV class and we will be dissecting this film and referencing all the clips of archival footage to gain a better understanding of how films such as ""Modern Times""are still relevant today. I want my students to appreciate how many nods to the classics there are in this film. Should be fun! Did anyone else feel the automaton was a nod to ""Metropolis""?"

Both young actors are superb. These two bright kids are miles apart from the cute little pint-sized child actors in most family pictures. But with 'The Boy In Stripped Pajamas' in Butterfield's CV and movies such as 'Kick Ass' and 'Hick' in Grace Moretz's we should not be surprised. I think both definitely have bright futures as actors if they wish to continue to pursue it.<br/><br/>I can understand why some children complained and found it boring. It's certainly a long movie, and its more about relationships than the trailer suggests. There are scenes where not a lot happens other than deepening the relationship between Hugo and whoever he is sharing the screen with. But that is fine for me, I'd much rather have a longer character driven movie than a 90 minute one, where I'm not so invested in the characters.<br/><br/>Despite critical praise and eleven Oscar nominations (winning 5 of them) this movie was a Box Office flop. I think if it was sold differently, Hugo might have done differently.<br/><br/>I only caught this on TV yesterday, and now regret not going to the cinema to see it in 3-D.

","The film Hugo released in 2011 directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Brian Selznick and the cinematography by Robert Richardson. The film main characters are Hugo (Asa Butterfield), Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley), and Isabella (Chloe Grace Moretz). Hugo (Asa Butterfield) a boy who's an orphan spends most of his time alone fixing things. Hugo lives in a train station inside of clock. One morning Hugo decides to steal from Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley) both, and gets caught in the process by Georges. Georges (Ben Kingsley) takes a notebook from Hugo (Asa Butterfield) that contains a drawing. Later that day Hugo (Asa Butterfield) follows Georges (Ben Kingsley) home where he encounters Isabella (Chloe Grace Moretz).<br/><br/>Hugo (Asa Butterfield) asked Isabella (Chloe Grace Moretz) to help him get his notebook from Georges (Ben Kingsley) possession. The two later develop a friendship, in the meanwhile Georges (Ben Kingsley) offers to give back the notebook to Hugo under the condition he works with him in his both. Hugo (Asa Butterfield) recognizes a piece on Isabella (Chloe Grace Moretz) necklace that looks like the right fit on the automaton. The automaton, a robot that Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and his father (Jude Law) before his death had been working on for years. Hugo (Asa Butterfield) finally receives the piece he needed from Isabella (Chloe Grace Moretz). Hugo (Asa Butterfield) thinks the robot contains a message from his father, and if he can get the automaton to work he would no longer be lonely.<br/><br/>The film Hugo plot and story line is similar Willy Wonka in a sense. Hugo (Asa Butterfield) needed a certain piece to get the automaton to work, which led to a wild adventure as the same in Willy Wonka. Little does Hugo (Asa Butterfield) know that the automaton is more than just your ordinary robot. The automaton you can say is the central character in the movie, because everyone had some sort of connection to it. <br/><br/>The film sound effect consisted of the sound of being in a train station with a lot people moving and talking. The lighting in the movie was dark and gloomy I think, because Hugo (Asa Butterfield) was alone and lonely. The automaton symbolized hope for Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and it's somewhat ironic how Georges (Ben Kinsley) started out being Hugo (Asa Butterfield) nemesis. By the end of the movie, the automaton brought Hugo (Asa Butterfield) together with Georges (Ben Kingsley), who in turn ended up providing a home and family for Hugo (Asa Butterfield)."
"gilligan-11","6","0","0","3 June 2012"," A kid's movie for adult kids
","The themes that Martin Scorsese addresses in this film—the thin line between self-recrimination and nostalgia, the effects of advancing technology on thriving art forms, and the lasting effects of a father's love—would seem misguided in a typical children's film. ""Hugo,"" however, a children's film directed by Scorsese—one of the greatest American film directors of all time (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Departed"")—is no typical children's film. Scorsese has made a children's film for adults who still experience the joys, wonders, mysteries, and painful epiphanies of childhood.<br/><br/>First of all, the ""exotic"" setting of a 1930s Parisian train station establishes the wistful tone. The film is beautiful to behold—the colors, the cinematography, the set design, and the art direction are all stunningly beautiful. The plot itself focuses on the titular hero, a young boy who lives in the rafters and bowels of the station and spends his time adjusting the station's numerous clocks, evading the menacing pursuit of the Station Inspector (played by an appropriately surly Sacha Baron Cohen), and searching for parts that animate the automaton left to him by his dead father (played by Jude Law in an unfortunately brief appearance). Through the course of his quest, Hugo encounters an elderly shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley in another masterful performance), the shopkeeper's god-daughter, and a film historian. Through these connections, Hugo begins to piece together not only the mystery of the automaton but also the impact of the beginnings of cinema as an art form.<br/><br/>The film is sumptuous, the plot is charming, the actors are magnificent—yet somehow the film amounts to far less than the sum of its parts. I found myself bored at many points during the film—the story seems to linger a bit too much, allowing the viewer to appreciate (almost excessively so) the aesthetic and nostalgic beauty of the film. Overall, I'm glad I've seen it, but ""Hugo"" is not a film that I plan on ever watching again."

","There's a lot to like about Hugo, but there's also a huge glaring flaw that a lot of people overlook. First the good: each shot of this movie is gorgeous and the cinematographer did a really good job creating this world. The cast is a lot of fun and the scenes paying homage to film's history are really well done and incredibly moving. But they are also this film's main problem. The first half of this movie is about a boy named Hugo who is an orphan living in a train station. He spends his days winding clocks and trying to finish an automaton that he and his father had worked on before his father died. Most of this part of the movie is a mystery as Hugo tries to figure out how to finish the machine and how these different figures in his life are related. This plot is really interesting and engaging, which is why it's promptly dropped in the middle of the movie for a completely different story. Once Hugo discovers that this grumpy man who runs a toy store in the train station is, in fact, George Melies, one the great pioneers in early cinema, the mystery vanishes and the movie becomes How George got his Groove Back. Hugo is now a side character in his own movie and anyone who had any interest in the mystery is given a really slap-dash answer. This does lead to some beautiful and moving scenes for anyone who loves film, but these scenes have virtually nothing to do with Hugo or his father."

","I had high expectations for ""Hugo"" – the movie that earned eleven Oscar nominations and won five of them (mostly technical though), the movie praised by critics and public alike, and, last but not least, the movie directed by the legendary Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>At the same time, I had my share of doubts. My intuition was persistently telling me that something might not be right about ""Hugo"". The underwhelming trailer, the story based on the recently published unconventional book for tweens ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", the very large budget combined with the poor box office performance – all these signs were subtly indicating that ""Hugo"" possibly might turn out to be a disappointment.<br/><br/>After having finally seen the movie, I could confirm that despite all the ""Hugo""'s impressive strengths and solid redeeming qualities, disappointment was definitely the strongest of the mixed emotions that I felt during and after the viewing. <br/><br/>Definitely not a masterpiece and not among the best Martin Scorsese's works either, ""Hugo"" strangely resembled a slightly improved variation of a typical Steven Spielberg movie, only a little smarter, a little deeper, and a little sharper, but still mostly one-dimensional, simplistic, and almost irritably superficial. In addition, ""Hugo"" turned out to be a little slow, elitist, and bookish that did not bring any additional charm to its already struggling story (John Logan). <br/><br/>Yes, ""Hugo"" is a tale, but it is more a superficially entertaining, unoriginal tale a-la Spielberg than a visionary, thought provoking tale with a deep meaning. While emotional, touching, and cute on the surface, ""Hugo"" does not have enough substance and depth to make us feel genuine interest or true compassion. <br/><br/>The movie does quite poorly in comparison to some recent influential tales made into movies. While the wise ""Charlotte's Web"" successfully tackles the topics of life and death and true friendship, ""Hugo"" just barely scratches the surface of these subjects so important for children and adult audiences alike. While the mesmerizing, and captivating ""Coraline"" is full of thought-provoking dark symbolism, ""Hugo"" is glossy but bland, visually imaginative but substantially unoriginal. The movie looks like a perfectly assembled, but lifeless and uninspiring mechanism used to animate the story of life of the French pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès.<br/><br/>It also does not help that throughout the movie we see almost no character development except maybe for one character, skillfully played by the amazing as usual Ben Kingsley. In addition, many of the characters in ""Hugo"" are one-dimensional stereotypes: a cute courting elderly couple, a wise enthusiastic professor, a gentle loving father, a hard drinking wretched uncle, and more. <br/><br/>It was sad to see the solid Martin Scorsese's directing as well as all the Oscar winning qualities of the movie: the beautiful cinematography (Robert Richardson), the worthy visual effects, and the outstanding art direction (Francesca Lo Schiavo, Dante Ferretti) wasted on the undeserving at the end story.<br/><br/>It was disappointing to watch the great Ben Kingsley and the rest of the talented, well-balanced cast desperately trying to breathe life into this mostly artificial gimmick. <br/><br/>Sacha Baron Coen proved once again, just as he did in ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" that he is a talented, unique gifted actor capable of a memorable, multifaceted performance as long as he plays in a well-directed decent movie and not in the sickening garbage that he usually stars in.<br/><br/>Ray Winstone and Emily Mortimer were convincing in their supporting roles. Jude Law had one small, but memorable scene. Christopher Lee was perfect as a mysterious librarian, although his whole character seemed to be one of the unnecessary additions to the already lengthy and slowly moving story.<br/><br/>Both children characters – the overly cute, but uncharismatic Asa Butterfield's Hugo and the pretty, but woodenly inexpressive Chloë Grace Moretz's Isabelle - were less than impressive.<br/><br/>Overall, despite all the hype, ""Hugo"" is definitely not a movie I would classify as a ""must see"".

I tried a lot but one second I was inside and the other not. When I first saw the poster of the movie, I thought it was going to be like ""Polar Express"" ,that is, a boy having fantastic adventures. I think it is because there were more than one leading actor in the film. An instant it is about an orphan boy, but later it turns to be the story of the shopkeeper who has very annoying attitudes. The station guard was cool, but all these stories were short and interrupted. As one of them is developing, it is cut in the middle and the other begins. In addition to these, those long scenes about Melies'es old movies are a little boring. After I got home, I searched about Melies and found that he really existed:) Now I am definitely sure that the movie was just a homage to Melies and nothing more.<br/><br/>Another thing is that the movie was in English that came to me a bit strange because I lived in France for 2 years and never saw local people speaking English with each other.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","12","5 December 2011"," Scorsese's Most Magical Film to Date
","Hugo (2011) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese doing a kids movie? Well, not really. HUGO is being advertised as a ""kids"" movie but even though it's rated PG I think it's unfair to say that this is a movie for kids. I mean, are they really doing to be interesting in uncovering the secrets of a silent film star? Are they really going to be caught up in this story, which is fairly dark at times? I certainly hope so because this is one of the most magical movies I've ever seen but it's doubtful because the appeal of this is sadly going to be very limited, which is a real shame. The story is a fairly simple one as the orphan Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in a French train station where he's trying to unlock the mystery of a robot that he and his father (Jude Law) where working on before his death. The young boy gets help from a young Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) and the two try to find out what her grandfather, Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley) has to do with the mystery.<br/><br/>HUGO isn't in the same league as TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS but I think I'd call it the most magical film Scorsese has ever made and I'd probably say it would have to be one the closest to his heart. This is a remarkable love story to not only a child's fantasy but the dreams that came come out of the movies. There's several sequences where Scorsese pays tribute to a wide range of silent stars including D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Keystone Cops and of course Melies. Scorsese's love for the cinema is clearly on the screen here because each scene you can just see all the love bleeding over it and this is especially true in one magical moment that ranks right up there with anything the director has done. About the mid-point of the film is when Hugo takes Isabelle to see her first movie. They end up watching Harold Lloyd's SAFETY LAST, which features the famous scene of him walking up the side of a building. The reaction of the girl witnessing these is so priceless that you can't help but feel as if Scorsese captured everyone's first taste of what is cinema. There's a longer sequence later in the film where we get to see clips from countless silent films and the passion on display was so incredibly moving that you can't help but hope this film does for Melies and silent movies just what ED WOOD did for Wood and Bela Lugosi.<br/><br/>The mystery/adventure side of the film is also perfectly brought to life with an incredible journey. The screenplay perfectly captures this alternate world of living behind the walls of a train station and the design is just so eye-dropping that you can't help but feel as if you've never seen anything like it before. Even more memorable is an incredible tracking shot early in the picture where we follow Hugo as he goes through the station. Most people are going to think of the tracking shot in GOODFELLAS but for the life of me I couldn't figure out how on Earth they managed to get such a breathtaking shot here. The story itself really makes one believe in hope, happy endings and of just trying to do what you can to reach not only your dreams but those of the people around you. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz give two of the greatest performances you're going to see from any young actors. Both of them fit their roles so perfectly that you can't help but feel as if you're watching real characters coming to life on the screen. Jude Law only appears in a few scenes but he too brings magic. Sacha Baron Cohen, playing what would have been done by the Keystone Cops, brings some terrific laughs including a hilarious scene involving a piece of his leg on the side of a train. We even get a nice bit by Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone and Helen McCrory. Kingsley turns in one of the strongest performances of his career playing Melies. He must go through so many emotions throughout the film but the actor perfectly nails all of them.<br/><br/>HUGO also uses the 3-D to perfection as Scorsese makes sure to drag you into this fabulous world he's created. Most 3-D films are just a gimmick but there are ways it can be perfectly used and this is a great example. Just check out a wonderful bit where the Cohen character is lecturing Hugo and we get a shot of him leaning towards the child. The effect it creates is wonderful as is another scene towards the end when Melies is addressing a crowd. Heck, there's even one of the silent films that gets a 3-D effect that is very memorable.<br/><br/>HUGO isn't going to appeal to everyone and to be honest I'm really shocked to see how well it's already done is just a couple weeks. The movie is certainly one of the most magical I've seen in terms of being a love letter to cinema and the dreams that they create. The movie is fast, funny, dramatic, sad and incredibly touching. I guess a lot of people were shocked to see Scorsese doing a movie like this but it's about the cinema and ones love for it so I really can't think of a better person for the material."

","Being and admirer of Mr. Scorcese's work, I still can not explain how can he sometimes fail so badly. Among all his legendary movies, from time to time he delivers something not worth his reputation. I guess he is a better producer than a director.<br/><br/>Hugo is a fiction tale with so many elements seen so many times before (and done better) - a ""boy-wonder"", an automaton, French Policeman (Allo, Allo) and so on. Yawn. I've watched this movie until the end purely out of a courtesy for Mr. Scorcese, but this is light years away from any award (especially Academy). There is definitely something rotten in the Academy lately (probably old and nostalgic, possibly demented, people, covered with mold).<br/><br/>Recommended for children and people who are not into movies so much to recognize all ""borrowed"" elements. Light entertainment, so to say."

","I was looking forward to seeing Hugo. It started, as most movies do, promisingly enough but by the time the end credits rolled, I was left with an empty, unsatisfied feeling. I couldn't put it exactly into words at first but I stumbled across another review that pretty much summed it up: the entire ""mystery"" of Hugo isn't really that big of a deal. I didn't read the book, but it seems that Hugo is really two movies awkwardly stitched together - one of a mechanically-inclined orphan searching for a final message from his late father and another of a forgotten cinema pioneer whose life has descended into bitterness. Frustratingly, the boy's storyline is conveniently dropped somewhere along the line. The Scorsese touch is absent here. Let's face it, this film could've been made by any Hollywood vet with an army of CGI effects people behind him (or her). At certain moments I thought I was watching a Spielberg picture despite the overacting from the film's youthful protagonists (speaking in ridiculous British accents in lieu of French) -- clearly not the work of the director of E.T. A sorry script that telegraphs it's resolutions from a million miles away (again, this could be the fault of the original source material), poor casting and an almost mechanical - pun intended - devotion to cinematic clichés left me cold. Technically polished and full of a generous amount of eye-candy, Hugo will most certainly have it's fans. But when we're dealing with a filmmaker of Scorsese's caliber, I think it's easy to understand that Hugo just doesn't measure up to a Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore or Taxi Driver."

In addition to this, the film had a wonderful charm throughout that kept me positive throughout viewing and made me want to ignore the flaws of the movie and just enjoy the journey.<br/><br/>The characters are, generally, brilliant, and Chloe Moretz and Ben Kingsley both give tremendous performances. However, my problem was, unfortunately, with the films protagonist, as although Asa Butterfield takes on the leading role well, the character of Hugo came across, to me, as little more than a sulky, negative kid.<br/><br/>The plot and pacing of the film is fairly good; there is enough unpredictability and room for guessing, as well as a few unexpected twists and secrets to keep the story engaging, however there is a lack of any real significance or importance and the scenario's the characters are placed in seem slightly too trivial to be as entertaining as they could have been.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel that despite Hugo being an irritating character at times, and the plot of his film perhaps lacking the sense of real peril it could have done with, the charming, original and enjoyable style of this movie, portrayed by some strong performances and fantastic visual treats, render Scorcese's first family film a success, that is well worth a couple of hours of anybody's time."

","Martin Scorsese is a legendary filmmaker that has given audiences many terrific films such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York and The Departed and has more recently given audiences the mind-bending thriller Shutter Island. The interesting thing about the director is that his films have traditionally been very violent, vulgar, and overall more adult in their nature and content. Needless to say, when I heard that Scorsese was doing a family friendly film(in 3D no less) I was very intrigued to see how he would handle this new territory.

"estebangonzalez10","10","3","8","5 March 2012"," Scorsese has found his purpose in life: Making beautiful films
","¨Maybe that's why a broken machine always makes me a little sad, because it isn't able to do what it was meant to do... Maybe it's the same with people. If you lose your purpose... it's like you're broken. ¨<br/><br/>Hugo is a beautiful film that works really well as a love letter from Martin Scorsese to all movie buffs, especially those who are fascinated with its history and origins. Hugo is a family film, but Martin introduces a bit of history so that everyone can become familiar with how it began. It's like a film history lesson made in a very entertaining way. There are several funny scenes that kids will enjoy (mostly the scenes with the inspector chasing after Hugo), while there are also several serious and beautiful moments which serve as a homage to film history. Hugo works as sort of a poem and it is just marvelous to look at and listen to. I loved every second of this movie and every scene was so rich in meaning and just beautiful to look at. The use of 3D in this movie is just spectacular and I think Scorsese has used it better than any other film to date (including Avatar). This is Scorsese's first film in 18 years that gets a PG rating, it's his first time working with 3D, and it also is the first time in twelve years that he's worked without Leonardo Di Caprio. That is a lot of firsts for a film that is done in such a marvelous matter. This is one of the best films of the year and it deserves every single one of its five Oscar wins. The visuals, the sound, the story, and the cast are all excellent in this wonderful movie and it's really worth the price of admission. By all means pay the extra fee to see this film in 3D because it is well worth it. Scorsese knows his film history lesson and he really pays a beautiful homage to those early films which he has worked so hard to make sure get restored and saved. <br/><br/>The story takes place in a train station in Paris where twelve year old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives on his own hiding and running from the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) while making sure all the clocks in the station work. Hugo is on his own because his father (Jude Law) who was a clock maker and worked at a Museum died in a fire. All Hugo has left is a broken automaton that he was trying to fix with his father. Hugo believes that this automata holds a message from his dead father, therefore he works endlessly to try to find the right pieces to fix it. Hugo survives by stealing from the different shoppers in the station. One day he is caught stealing by a toymaker named Georges (Ben Kingsley) who orders him to give him everything he has in his pockets. Georges takes a notepad that Hugo's father had given him, so Hugo decides to follow the grumpy old man home in order to retrieve his notepad. This is where Hugo meets Georges's goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), who befriends Hugo and the two begin to have adventures together. Isabelle promises to get Hugo's notepad back and helps him finding the missing pieces needed to fix the automaton. Isabelle also introduces Hugo to the world of literature, while Hugo teaches her about cinema. Together they discover the truth about Georges and decide it is about time he stops hiding from the past.<br/><br/>Hugo is based on Brian Selznick's children book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, and the screenplay was beautifully adapted by John Logan (who previously worked with Scorsese in The Aviator). Besides being a love letter to the origins of film, the movie also has a very powerful message about finding purpose and meaning in life. Like machines, people can be broken if they don't know what their true purpose in life is. Every piece in a machine has a specific function that makes everything work, and in the same way every person has a purpose that allows life to continue functioning as planned. I really loved the performance from the two kids in this movie: Butterfield and Grace Moretz. They looked lovely together. Grace Moretz is my favorite young actress and she just has the screen presence and charisma that other actresses don't have. Ben Kingsley was magnificent in his key role, and so was Christopher Lee. Sacha Baron Cohen was funny as always, and his character served as the comic relief because I imagine many kids getting bored if the film only focused on the Georges character. This is really a great family film and one you should see, especially if you are interesting in the history of films and how it all began. There are several scenes from early films, and I can't imagine how any true film lover wouldn't like this wonderful movie. It's a masterpiece.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","Hugo is a great adventure. Really, story makes up a great adventure. But in the meantime; it has amazing depth and great amount of emotion. You should watch it for everything you can think of. For visuals, audio, story, emotions, acting etc. It also makes you love cinema more and more. Martin Scorsese made it for me this time. To be honest, his other legendary movies like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas do not interest me at all. But i always knew he is a director to watch. Hugo was love at first sight in my case, watched in the theater immediately. Then watched it in my computer couple of times again. Performances of child actors are also stunning. Chloë Grace Moretz impressed me again with this movie. Asa Butterfield, watched him for the first time and i liked what i saw. <br/><br/>I mean, i can't even talk about this movie.

","Another great example of why I trust reviews, award shows and hype less and less every year. Here's a film that's been hyped and hyped and won tons of awards; a movie everyone is talking about, but which has almost no redeeming value.<br/><br/>Sure, it's visually stunning and beautifully made, but the story and characters are dimensionless and empty. It was almost unwatchable. I kept holding out hope that something compelling or meaningful or interesting would happen, but it never did. The fact that the movie was so long only made matters worse.<br/><br/>The mechanics and clockworks they plastered all over the ads created a sense of excitement, mystery and adventure that is never realized in the film. What seems really exciting and inviting in the posters and ads is cold and dull in the actual film. It felt monochromatic and alienating when I was actually watching it.<br/><br/>One last nitpick - a pet peeve of mine is movies where the character's accents don't match the location. In this case, a movie set in France, where all the characters have English accents. A bit annoying."

","I thought this movie was amazing. However, some people will not like it. As always, some movies require long attention spans like this one. I felt my attention wonder and I got bored once or twice, but I do have a naturally long attention span and was soon hooked with no hope of escaping. Not that I minded. Asa Butterfield is an amazing actor, making me cry several times throughout the film and admire his eyes every time I saw him, even though I believe his real eye color is green. Basically, if you like fantasy and have a nice attention span, you'll love this. It's heartfelt and really tweaked my heartstrings. However, as I stated, some are always going to complain. Science fiction lovers might enjoy this as well. My father watched this. He loves cars and action. He liked this, though I easily saw he would prefer to watch a movie about cars. However, I watched it, and was enthralled. I love fantasy, angst, science, and poetry. I adored this movie and plan to watch it again soon. Basically, it deserves praise. It really made me think.

"TimWagner3","10","3","8","3 March 2012"," Evocative Cinematography, a Passionate Cast, and Good Direction Add Up To a Modern Classic
","Everyone is probably familiar with the plot so I will waste no time and explain why this has become one of my favorite films. I can easily see why HUGO won an Oscar for best cinematography. Every bit of detail from the interiors of the train station to the crowded streets of Paris conveys a world of wonder. The movie simply looks beautiful and I was left captivated as I digested every carefully planned shot. While I focused on the actors in the foreground, there was plenty of detail in the background. Hugo's view of 1931 Paris from on top of the clock tower truly is breathtaking.<br/><br/>The passionate cast was well chosen by Scorsese and company. Ben Kingsley never fails to amaze me and does justice to the role of Georges Méliès. At first, Méliès appears to be a bitter old man with a mysterious past. As the film progresses, he slowly opens up. Even when he would yell at Hugo I could tell that he was not sincere in his harsh words but only a ""broken wound up toy"" that needed healing. The scene where he hands Hugo the burnt notebook was played to perfection by both actors. You could tell that Méliès feels upset and ashamed for what he put Hugo through; however, he tries to conceal this with his hostile exterior. Not many actors would be able to pull off such a nuanced performance. I was not familiar with Asa Butterfield (Hugo) and Chloë Grace Mortez (Isabelle) before watching this film, but I found them to be very charismatic. This is a good thing because they carry the film. Sacha Baron Cohen is also good as the station inspector. He is the comedic villain and while his performance is somewhat campy, his character perfectly blends into this fictional world. Instead of being a one-dimensional character, the film makes him sympathetic at times and gradually reveals more about his past. I also have to give a shout out to Christopher Lee, who is one of my favorite actors. Even though he has a small role as the bookshop owner, I was pleased to see him in this film. He turns 90 this year and is still going strong.<br/><br/>As a fan of the early silent films, I give Scorsese credit for paying homage to an art that does not receive enough attention today. I sincerely hope that this film and THE ARTIST (2011) will rekindle the public's interest in silent films. They are a fading art that deserves more study. The only time you will find a silent film on TV today is if you watch TCM. As a Harold Lloyd fan, I especially liked how the film pays respect to the comic genius in two ways. During the early portion of the film, Hugo and Isabelle sneak into a movie theater to watch SAFETY LAST (1923), which shows Lloyd's character hanging from the hands of a clock on a high building. Later in the film, Hugo will face a similar predicament as he hides from the Station Inspector in the clock tower. The clips from the Georges Méliès films are also a treat. These films are the origins of cinematic magic.<br/><br/>This is a perfect film in every way and I would recommend this marvel to fans of all ages. Unlike most films today that use CGI as a crutch, HUGO uses CGI to complement a strong plot."

I don't mind slow movies if the premise is intriguing, but for the first hour not much happens, and I found I didn't care what happened to the main character at all. You keep thinking the plot itself is going to get deep and interesting, but it just remains shallow and somewhat predictable (even for a kids movie).<br/><br/>If they edited it down to 90 minutes, the movie would be more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Pre-teens may enjoy it, but I don't think it will hold the attention of younger ones."

Okay I must admit...I'm a movie fan, I'd love to see some really old movies made hundred years ago....But if that was my intention I wouldn't go and see HUGO.

","Words cannot explain the extent to which I enjoyed this movie. I was truly transported to a different world. It was beautiful, breathtaking, marvelous,exhilarating, and above all magical. Just magical. I laughed, I cried, and I did everything in between. It is a masterpiece. Never have I walked out of a theatre with such a silly gigantic grin on my face. I still have it as i'm typing this.<br/><br/>I won't bother going into a plot synopsis, as I'm sure there are already a million. This movie has a bit of everything. Effects, comedy, tragedy etc... you name it, it has it. Every emotion. It puts you on a roller-coaster of a journey, not necessarily through action, but through heart. The 3D effects were used perfectly, to a great advantage. 3D is often pointless on most movies, but with this one, it does it a duty. The visuals are already there, but the 3D enhances them. After I while, I forgot I was even watching 3D. It was just... wow. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this film.<br/><br/>The only problem with, not the film, but what goes on behind the scenes, is the way that it was presented in theatres This is not just a kids film. It's nothing like the normal kids film. It is a film for all ages, and, honestly, I think adults would enjoy it more than kids. I'm a teenager, but I have a keen eye on film, stage, and other performing arts. I have seen many a good film, but this one just blew me away. The marketing was the large error. I simply can't see how anyone could dislike this film, at least anyone who enjoys art.<br/><br/>The acting was great all around, but Asa Butterfield MADE this film. He is a phenomenal young actor. I have yet to see many adult actors act with the truthfulness that he has. His character portrays an enormously large range of emotions; anger, pity, heartbreak, betrayal, joy, confusion, frustration, you name it. Asa nails them all. He has such a subtle, yet effective, style. It's something you don't see much nowadays. The audience is able to see, just through those piercing blue eyes, every emotion he emits. The eyes are the window to the actors soul, and with Asa zoomed shots on his eyes are equally effective as full body shots. It takes skill to be able to portray emotion powerful enough to be read through the eyes alone, and I applaud young Asa for that, as well as his performance as a whole. Bravo.<br/><br/>It is a shame that more people haven't seen this film. Hopefully, the Academy Awards will give it the publicity needed to make it a hit. However, in my eyes, it is already a hit."

However, sitting in my chair in the cinema, I found myself completely enchanted by this beautiful, passionate and utterly lovely piece of cinema. I didn't care that I was watching a ""childrens'"" film; I didn't care that the people behind me seemed to be taking part in some kind of drunken ritual; I didn't even care that my chair was about as comfortable as a sack full of bricks. I just sat there for two hours with a grin on my face that I'm still wearing now. Brilliant acting, wonderful writing, beautiful cinematography and some of Scorcese's most inventive direction are all tied together by a general feeling of enchanting lovelyness and a passion for cinema that should evoke the inner child in anyone (and tickle the fancy of film fanatics especially). The film is funny but not in a spiteful or cruel manner. There are no villains - simply damaged, melancholy people, most of whom are happy by the end.

"deadbunny28","10","3","8","12 December 2011"," My night with Hugo
","I viewed Martin Scorsese's latest film in 3D at a light night showing on a mildly precipitating night. On the surface this movie seems to be about a boy longing for the memory of his late father. However, deeper in we see that it is about the power and magic of movies, which we come to see to move us. Furthermore this movie has a soul, and that soul shows us a yearning for life, and all of its thrill, bewilderment, and wonder.<br/><br/>This was marketed as a family movie, but at 126 minutes and with each scene set so grandly and intricately, it may be a bit too grand for very young audiences. For anyone in the double digits though there is much joy to be found here. Every scene is layered with detail and you can tell that Scorsese put great effort into caring for each and every detail that you experience. From the ""splendiferous"" grand scale of detail to the ""splendorous"" visuals this movie delivers on an awe-inspiring family adventure.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" stars two precocious young children, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Moretz, whom both deliver some of the finest work from child actors. Ben Kingsley delivers as per usual and Sacha Baron Cohen has a breakout performance as a serious actor here as the Station Inspector. This movie also offers some positive messages that are seemingly being lost these days, acknowledging to children the joy of reading and dreams and how movies can be an enrichment of that. Another great thing about this movie is it shows us a story, which seems to only be able to be told best in a movie.<br/><br/>In a movie market that is being inundated with special effects and 3D, it feels very noble for Scorsese to pay homage to the very man who is known as the creator of special effects, Georges Melies , in this movie. While the movie can seem almost too much like a homage sometimes, it still maintains its focus for the most part and delivers a thrilling, inspired, and positive adventure. Also I know 3D is a big deal right, but while I am glad I witnessed this in 3D I don't think I would want to revisit it that way in the future. When I purchase this on Blu-Ray I definitely will be watching it on a standard television and not 3D. Mentioning this I must state even still, this was my best experience with 3D yet. If one of the greatest directors alive can't convince me it is a necessity I doubt I will be ever truly a fan of it. By the end of the movie the glasses made my eyes hurt a bit. Despite those couple of flaws they were nothing on the amazement and enjoyment I got from this movie and it made my rainy night quite romantic. All I know is that after watching this movie, all the way to walking to my doorstep and wiping my shoes off on my doormat from the muddy puddles just after the night's noon, life felt magical and worth enjoying. 9.6/10"

","Here's a film that looks great. Outstanding Art Direction and Set Design.<br/><br/>The pre-title sequence is a wonderful race through the train station. The other chases through the station are pale and redundant compared to the first romp.<br/><br/>While the movie is appropriate for children, how long is too long? Seems like in this case more is less. It seemed like at least thirty minutes could be trimmed and the movie going experience improved.<br/><br/>The cast serves the material well. Ben Kingsley may be too big a star and hard to get past and accept him as his character. The real theme is film preservation with plenty of interesting silent era classic clips.<br/><br/>Except for the opening and a few good dog shots it's not worth the 3D up-charge. Two plus hours viewing through smudged glasses and projection equipment that doesn't put out enough light hurts the format. There is no reason to watch classic silent clips in 3D.<br/><br/>Look for the movie to receive plenty of technical nominations as it gets lost in the holiday box office derby. Pass this Hugo."

His father died in a fire, and left Hugo on his own. Hugo has the job of keeping the station clocks running on time. Hugo meets a girl, played by Chloe Grace Moretz. Together they go on an adventure that involves a sad old toymaker that was once a great filmmaker, a station inspector with a strange leg brace, and ultimately, the importance of film preservation.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful. Some of the shots of Paris, they just resonate with a great magical beauty. The sets, and costumes and special effects all contribute to the overall look of this movie. The performances by Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz and Ben Kingsley are perfection.

However, about an hour into the movie I was thinking how amazing this movie was, but when I looked over at my family they were all sleeping. No wonder they didn't get it. For some reason they didn't understand what was happening even though I found it quite simple. That being said THIS IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE. They will not comprehend any of it. Actually, probably the majority of America will not understand it after watching all those mindless Hollywood Blockbuster's. Although, if you are one of those few people like myself that can sit through Intolerance without getting bored then go see this movie. It is amazing for those that can understand it, and you will love it. I promise."

","Hugo a small kid lives in the walls of a busy Paris train station, where his survival depends on secrets and anonymity. But when his world suddenly interlocks with an eccentric girl and the owner of a small toy booth in the train station, Hugo's undercover life, and his most precious secret, are put in jeopardy.<br/><br/>this 3D family-friendly Movie, kid-oriented fantasy film, Martin Scorsese has executed one of his periodic 180-degree about turns: comparable to his 19th-century costume drama The Age of Innocence, or Kundun, his encomium to the Dalai Lama. In Hugo, nobody gets called a ""fuckin"", no one's head gets crushed in a vice, no one's body gets buried in the desert outside Las Vegas. Instead, Scorsese has gone all Harry Potter on us, creating an intricately designed and beautifully rendered story aimed squarely at that fabled (and commercially invaluable) point at which childlike fantasy intersects with adult yearning.<br/><br/>I don't want to give spoilers, for that I highly recommend this movie for everyone, want to see a good piece of cinema.<br/><br/>To download this film or others immediately Blueray or DVD<br/><br/>just Google: ""real-steel-mediafire"" and look for a website which starts with: hot<br/><br/>Have a nice watching!"
"patrickwigington","10","3","8","27 November 2011"," One of the Best
","Martin Scorsese's most recent film is touching, exciting, and remarkably beautiful. Although the famed director is known for such gangster movies as Goodfellas and The Departed, he may have achieved his greatest moment with this family film.<br/><br/>Based on Brian Selznick's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, the film follows the life of the title character: an orphan living in the walls of a Paris train station. Hugo's father was a clock maker, and one day found an old, rusted mechanical man in the attic of a museum. The father and son decide to repair this automaton together, trying to discover what message it will write when cranked. But before they can finish, Hugo's father dies, and the boy must live with his drunken Uncle at the train station—at least until he disappears, too. Now Hugo spends his time stealing parts from a toy maker to fix the automaton, and constantly avoiding the station inspector.<br/><br/>The film, however, is about much more than just this young boy. The subject of the birth of film is a major theme, focusing on the marvelous and dream-like work of George Melies, who practically invented the way modern movies are made. Scorsese is right at home in discussing and paying tribute to these classic and bizarre films.<br/><br/>The dream quality of Melies' work spills over into Hugo. The film is so involving and engrossing that this reviewer became completely entranced, forgetting the outside world in favor of Scorsese's take on a majestic 1930's Paris. Scorsese does a particularly good job of making every shot absolutely breathtaking. The snowy Paris nights and the reproductions of old films are nothing short of enchanting.<br/><br/>Asa Butterfield plays Hugo, giving sincerity in his performance, something that is rarely seen in actors. Chloe Grace Moretz is great as the girl that enters Hugo's life, filled with worldly knowledge beyond her years. Ben Kingsley is fantastic as the bitter old toy maker, and Sacha Baron Cohen gives a surprising amount of big laughs as the station inspector.<br/><br/>While the 3D is nice, it certainly isn't necessary. In fact, the 3D was so good because for the most part it remained unobtrusive. There are some very nice moments inside the walls of the train station and with the clockwork, but nothing really worth the extra cash.<br/><br/>Hugo is a masterpiece, and one of Scorsese's all time best. Filled with allegory and fable, the film is enjoyable on a multitude of levels, and is a fun, glorious adventure for people of all ages.<br/><br/>http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/"

","The cinematography and music were great. The plot? Confusing. Boring. Inconsistent. I almost fell asleep once. The movie dragged on and in different directions. It was about the boy trying to ""solve a mystery his father left for him,"" then it went on to be about the toy store guy and his past as a film giant. It was like a big film history lesson. I kept expecting Hugo and his friend to go on some cool adventure uncovering a secret or mystery about his father or that automaton. Man, I really wish they went on a cool adventure. And honestly, they could have left out the bit about his father. In my opinion, his role or even existence was unnecessary. Not to mention, I feel like Jude Law was too young to play his dad; it should have been an old, white-haired man with a curled up moustache and some spectacles, but that's all besides the point. <br/><br/>So yes, the plot honestly did not go anywhere. Nothing was interesting about it, but at least the actors held up on on their end. I have no complaints about the casting - except the part about Jude Law above. Well, at least the look of the movie & scores caught and kept my attention throughout - except through the bit that had me near snoring."
"Stealth_Ninja_Kitty","10","3","9","26 November 2011"," Best movie of the year?
","I went into this movie for pure entertainment, I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it was...<br/><br/>The acting was excellent, especially from Sir Ben Kingsley (which is the reason I saw this movie). The kid actors were surprisingly good too. Sacha Baron Cohen was hilarious as the Inspector. Back to Kingsley, he was the highlight of the movie even though he wasn't the main star. I just can't get how he made his emotions so real and believable. Another minor actor that did well was Jude Law. Even though he had less than twenty minutes of screen time, he made that time count. Chloë was amazing along with the kid star Asa, even though he didn't steal the show, he was the second best actor behind Kingsley. Christopher Lee also has a small part and he made his screen time count just like Jude Law. I applaud the great acting.<br/><br/>The plot of the film was very interesting. The movie was almost like a mystery, some would argue it was a mystery. There was also humor (most of it came from Sacha). There were times during the movie where I was literally was at the end of my seat. Sometimes I was thinking to myself, ""you're being loud, they might hear you!"" or ""look out!"" The movie definitely engaged me.<br/><br/>The direction and 3D of the film was magnificent! Martin Scorsese knew what to do with the script and he did it well. The angles of the camera and the shots he did were very extraordinary. The 3D was used the right way. Forget about the useless 3D films, Thor, Captain America, etc. The 3D isn't used to make things pop out, it's used to add more depth to the film. It's also used for art for some certain scenes. People who thoroughly enjoyed the 3D for Avatar, will love the 3D for this film. I don't know why they marketed this movie for kids, some kids may enjoy, but it's mostly for adults, because there are some adult elements that little ones may not understand.<br/><br/>I had an amazing experience with this film, you won't regret it. I really hope this movie breaks budget, that's the least this movie deserves. See this movie, for your own good."

","This movie is set in 1930 Paris and is about a boy named Hugo. He lives in the walls of a train station and fixes the clocks here. Hugo gets sucked in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton, which he wants to fix, but in order to do so he needs to find a special key.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and I found myself falling in love with it as I was watching. First of all, the performances are great, especially the ones from Ben Kingsley and Asa Butterfield. This movie is beautifully shot; the beginning scene alone is spectacular and from that moment on you watch a beautiful depiction of 1930 Paris. It's of course very well directed by the awesome Martin Scorsese, who did a fantastic job translating the book to a movie screen (yes, this was based on a book!). The score also is beautiful and really suits the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, I really enjoyed the story of this movie. It is a very engaging one and you are really sucked into this story and I found myself really caring for different characters in this movie. There is a mystery in this movie and watching this mystery slowly get more and more revealed is engaging, interesting, exciting and fun. I won't spoil it, but the life story of one character in this movie was so interesting that after the movie I looked up this person to find out more about his life. What I also like in this movie, was the little throwback or history lesson as one could name it about old movies, as if it was a love letter from Scorsese to these older movies.<br/><br/>My only complaint would be that I didn't really cared about some of the minor characters in the movie, but that is me just nitpicking. Besides that, to summarize, I really loved this movie and everything about it: the performances, the story, the cinematography and so on. I would highly recommend you checking out this movie and be as surprised as I was."

The cinematography was spectacular, especially if you're into mechanics and technical photography.<br/><br/>Was the movie trailer misleading? You betcha!

Admittedly, I had reservations about Scorsese being able to do a family film; A well-known and respected director of organized crime films deciding to do a family-friendly film? Sounds a bit too close to Francis Ford Coppola's Jack. I have, subsequently, begged forgiveness for thinking such nonsense.<br/><br/>Every aspect of this movie, from the camera angles to the editing to the acting to the writing, is just another word in Scorsese's 2 hour long love letter to the art of filmmaking, and the entire production sparkles with it. It is heart-warming, it is funny, it is touching, it is intelligent on various levels; in short, it is everything a family film is meant to be, done not only right but brilliantly right at that.<br/><br/>For all those cinephiles out there, both old and new school, I highly recommend you check this movie out."

","When I first saw the previews of Hugo, I was met with mixed expectations. It was that sort of thing that makes you half interesting, half ""meh."" It seemed like just another film to me, albeit the director Martin Scorsese. My expectations further went down when I kept scrolling through the forums, seeing the mainstream viewers outraged about how bored they were. And I consider myself a mainstream viewer, so this goes for me. When people review something, I have a 70% that I agree with them as well. But Hugo was way different than I would ever think.. It was, and I say this with all seriousness, a masterpiece...<br/><br/>The movie has a slow-pace, and there's no doubt about that. But it was no reason to call it ""boring."" The movie had me laughing, enjoying, and grinning throughout the entire film. And even viewers are calling the movie too long? Really? Dark Knight had a two hour and thirty minute run time. Avengers had a two hour and thirty minute run time. All the Transformers movies had a two hour and thirty minute run time. And yet people call this ""long"" because they weren't met with action-packed nonsense and cheesy one-liners. I loved this film, there's no way around that one.<br/><br/>The only thing I absolutely adored was this thing right here. People called this film a homage to this old French director. But the movie has far more to that. This movie is a homage to movies themselves. It's an entire two hour epic expressing it's appreciation and love for the power of film making. And it was meant for viewers like us, to appreciate how great movies are. But you're probably taking this as a bad thing, the movie has way more to that. Great acting, great story, and great lush directing. It's everything you would want a more. But maybe the film was too much for people to take. Maybe they expected way too much...<br/><br/>Side-note: The 3D! In 2D, I could already see this movie as good as it was, and the 3D is no enhancer. But adding onto the fantastic cinematography, the fantastic directing, and the fantastic environments: the 3D adds everything you want. And it's not that type of 3D that uses the old ""pop-out"" gimmick that makes us jump out of our seats. It's the kind that adds depth to the entire experience and appreciate how great the film was itself. And the 3D reaches heights films like Avatar had, maybe even surpassing it...<br/><br/>I loved this film. You read all these bad reviews, but Hugo is to be watched with an open-mind, and not exactly what you are getting from the previews. It contains everything you want and need from a movie: heart, depth, and the love and appreciation of movies themselves. Is that not enough? <br/><br/>10/10."

Its a masterpiece where every scene is skillfully crafted and thoughtfully executed. The characters so beautifully express everything with their emotions that you don't need many words. Martin Scorsese, the director guides you and gives you a perspective to look at the movie from angles only great directors can think of. The opening sequences and the many that follow has a rhythmic dance of the camera work that takes you along a magnificent journey where the elemental story background of machines is fantastically brought to foreground with the use of 3D. You can experience layers in the film, that leaves a lasting impression of the movie even after it is over. Hugo played by Asa Butterfield, portrays a child with a purpose. The pain in his eyes does emote a reaction in the audience, so does the enthusiasm in the eyes of Isabelle, played by Chloë Grace Moretz. Ben Kingsley gives a superlative performance of a man who has lost purpose in life and has become a bitter old man. The other supporting stories are perfectly interwoven in the main story to provide some comic relief. Though the movie could have been more crispier in terms of the storyline but it provides you visuals that compensates for the slow pace."

","Hugo is beautifully made with some fabulous shots that show the complexity of CGI and imagination - and reconstruct in beautiful details the interior of a Paris railway station in 1930. It is a film that should be about cinema and our love of cinema, but, excepting the final twenty minutes never really engages us in that love.<br/><br/>We sensed a lost opportunity here to create some real magic that was lost in its determination to tell the story of Hugo and not to tell the really interesting story that lies behind it. We really like the two child stars and Ben Kingsley is excellent - the fault lies in frankly spreading an idea too thin.<br/><br/>All in all, this should be a film about why we love cinema, the art form of the 20th century so much, about how it takes us to other worlds so wonderfully, but Hugo never quite captures that sense of wonder and instead we are stuck at the station waiting for a train that never arrives."

","To begin with, Scorsese was NOT the ideal talent to bring this slight (if charming) pastry to the screen. His direct driving touch is far from the only reason that it does not gel....but it is the most important reason....(for an example of what a lighter, defter touch might have done...check out the whimsy and genuine magic of ""Midnight In Paris""...Woody Allen might also have done something with some of the actors who seem to be totally beyond Scorsese's control. I am talking of Sacha Baron Cohen in particular whose characterization is so bizarrely misguided that it robs most of the film of genuine tension (I could begin by asking about the horrid cockney accent...and the beyond asinine moment when he is depicted as sharing a bathtub with his dog WHILE WEARING LONG UNDERWEAR...((if it was meant to be funny ha ha ...it ain't))...and the attempt to humanize him with a wishy-washy romance only adds to the films prodigious length).<br/><br/>There are also severe problems with pacing and narrative drive...and most of the big final chase sequence seems quite shockingly amateurish and slip-shod.<br/><br/>Despite the obvious mega-bucks thrown at this (or possibly partially because it it was so grossly over decked out) much of this seems as heavy as a lead balloon...despite some appealing work from the two young stars (though Chloe is a bit too hip, mod and American)...and some of the supporting actors...<br/><br/>My final assessment is that no matter how many awards are thrown at it...it flopped for several good reasons...including the simple fact that it was ill conceived and over produced....things that are almost always detrimental to such light pieces...<br/><br/>It might have made a nice 90 minute animated feature...the heavy (and not too convincing) over use of CGI makes it feel like it is half animated anyway."
"bell-benn","8","2","5","3 March 2012"," Serendipity
","Serendipity and synchronicity are the watchwords of my life. I love it when two elegant events come together in a single moment of time. The latest of these happenings occurred to me recently at the second viewing of the magnificent motion picture, Hugo, directed by Master filmmaker Martin Scorsese. I went to see this film the first time right after it came out at the AMC Multiplex in Hamilton, New Jersey with my partner Mary Lopez. <br/><br/>Hugo is a wonderful story taking place in a Parisian railway station in the early 20th century. Hugo's job is to keep all the clocks running in the station. He had taken over this job from his dipsomaniacal uncle who has disappeared. As a child, he has no business being in the railway station and but he secretly lives there and is constantly on the lookout for the railway inspector played with perfectly pitched panache by the brilliant Sacha Baron Cohen. <br/><br/>Hugo's quest is to repair an automaton which was found by his late father in a Parisian Museum. Hugo is constantly scavenging for parts for the automaton and searching for a heart shaped key that holds the answer to the inner workings of the automaton. Pursuing this quest, Hugo strikes up an acquaintance with the daughter a toy store owner in the railway station, Isabelle. During one of their little adventures together they are caught by the railway inspector who wants to nab Hugo and send him to an orphanage. <br/><br/>To distract the inspector's attention, Isabelle spouts off a bit of poetry:<br/><br/>My heart is like s singing bird<br/><br/>whose nest is in a watered shoot;<br/><br/>My heart is like an apple tree<br/><br/>Whose boughs are hung with thick set fruit;<br/><br/>My heart is like a rainbow shell <br/><br/>That paddles in a halcyon sea;<br/><br/>My hear is gladder than all these<br/><br/>Because my love is come back to me. The station inspector says that he likes poetry as much as the next fellow, but that poetry has no place in a railway station where his job is to see that the trains arrive and depart on time. I too like poetry as much as the next fellow, and while I thought the words to be lovely indeed, I did not attach any special significance to them. The movie continued on and I soon forgot about the bit of poetry that Isabelle recited. <br/><br/>Several weeks later while browsing through my favorite Princeton bookstore, The Labyrinth, I came across a lovely tome by written by Virginia Woolf entitled, ""A Room of One's Own."" I had never read this book and thought this would be an excellent opportunity to do so. Therefore, I purchased the book and took it home to read. <br/><br/>""If by chance there had been an ash tray handy, if one had not knocked the ash out the window. If things had been a little different from what they were, one would not have seen a cat without a tail,"" or a book in a bin, with the title, ""A Room of One's Own."" In chapter one, Ms. Woolf mused about the murmurings people made before the war and could these humming sounds be set to words? She chanced to browse through a book and found these words by Tennyson:<br/><br/>There has fallen a splendid tear<br/><br/>From the passion flower at the gate. <br/><br/>She is coming, my life, my fate;<br/><br/>The red rose cries, ""She is near, she is near;""<br/><br/>And the white rose weeps, ""She is late;""<br/><br/>The larkspur listens, ""I hear, I hear;"" <br/><br/>And the lily whispers, ""I wait."" "" Was this what men hummed at luncheon parties before the war?"" she mused. ""And what of the women?"" <br/><br/>Here it is, wait for it:<br/><br/>My heart is like s singing bird<br/><br/>whose nest is in a watered shoot;<br/><br/>My heart is like an apple tree<br/><br/>Whose boughs are hung with thick set fruit;<br/><br/>My heart is like a rainbow shell <br/><br/>That paddles in a halcyon sea;<br/><br/>My hear is gladder than all these<br/><br/>Because my love is come back to me.<br/><br/>By now the reader may recognize these words written by Christina Rossetti spoken by the young heroine Isabelle in the movie, Hugo. However, at that time, I still had not made the connection between one and the other, thinking this was my first encounter with this precious piece of poetry. <br/><br/>Fast forward a few weeks into the future, now the past, while on a trip to my native land of Kentucky to visit my grandchildren, I took two of them to the movies where we went to see Hugo, which I thought they would enjoy. So we were sitting there in the dark wearing our special spectacles enjoying the 3-D effects when lo and behold we come to selfsame scene in the movie that I described before to the gentle reader about the poem declaimed by the girl Isabelle. My heart is like s singing bird<br/><br/>whose nest is in a watered shoot;<br/><br/>My heart is like an apple tree<br/><br/>Whose boughs are hung with thick set fruit;<br/><br/>My heart is like a rainbow shell <br/><br/>That paddles in a halcyon sea;<br/><br/>My hear is gladder than all these<br/><br/>Because my love is come back to me. Wow! Zing! Bing! Bang! It all came together in a clang. The first view of the movie, Hugo, the reading of the Virginia Woolf book, A Room of One's Own, and the second viewing of the Movie, Hugo, separated by time and space, crystallized in a frozen moment of synchronicity and serendipity, the universes suddenly came together in clarion call of harmonic vibration."
"Jonathon_Natsis","9","2","5","15 January 2012"," Hugo Boss
","Why the awful headline? Because it is surely impossible to come up with a punnier title that still describes how good this film was, that's why. <br/><br/>Through the eyes of a child, it's the story of a couple of kids embarking on an adventure to solve a mystery that might just bring some happiness back into a sad old man's life. For the film buffs and adults, or rather, bigger kids among us, Martin Scorsese's Hugo is a visual feast of cinematic iconography; a Tarantino-esque shrine to the films of the past that shaped the director's lifetime of inspiration. It should be enough that one of the world's greatest living filmmakers has taken to using the playbook of the director most respected among us younger cinephiles, but there is much more than simply a ton of film references that denote the quality of 'Marty's love letter to cinema', as so many have taken to calling it.<br/><br/>Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan living inside of a Paris train station. He gets by on keeping the station's clocks running and stealing whatever he can get his hands on, while avoiding the watchful eye of the station inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen), who would love nothing more than to throw Hugo back in the orphanage. Hugo is also the thorn in the side of an elderly toyshop owner (Ben Kingsley). When the old man catches Hugo red-handed and forces him to work off the items he stole, the boy meets Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) and together they discover the connection between Hugo's automaton (left to him by his late father) and cranky old Papa Georges.<br/><br/>As if to address the most obvious point first, the film looks incredible. The 3D, which has typically been a letdown since its admittedly impressive resurrection by James Cameron, compliments the extravagant set and adds a kind of visual sharpness and depth to expansive scenes not yet mastered by most filmmakers. Expect Hugo to feature prominently in the 'art direction' branches at most upcoming awards shows, because its impressive combination of costume design, set construction and cinematography will make it hard to beat.<br/><br/>The film draws a lot of heart from a colourful cast of secondary characters who fill their role the way those of Rear Window or Amelie did before them. While very few of them are at all central to the film, each one makes brief interjections into the story at certain points just to show what's happening in their day at the station. The most endearing of these is the pretty florist who catches the eye of the bashful inspector. Where this burgeoning relationship allows Cohen to ham it up with some comedy of his own, it also acts as yet another small detail that supports Hugo's well-rounded narrative, leaving the viewer richer for the experience.<br/><br/>Because it is aimed at children as well as adults, the script can sound a little trite to matured ears. This comes from the need to explain everything in clear terms, rather than simply implying it, so that absolutely everyone can follow where the story is heading. It is also because of this that the first third of the movie moves somewhat too slowly for personal liking in its attempt to lay a solid foundation before delving into the actual story.<br/><br/>With this film, Scorsese has crafted the sheer definition of 'all-ages entertainment.' Certainly, the film's ability to keep my fellow patrons (three patience- starved loudmouths all aged ten or below) enthralled by the events on screen shows that something is being done right. But more than that, the movie delivers varying messages depending on the individual responding to them. It teaches young viewers the value of appreciating those who love us, as well as the importance of knowing what came before and to keep expanding our horizons, never faltering in our thirst for knowledge.<br/><br/>The film preaches this kind of ambition and selflessness to the older target market too, as well as encouraging one to live life so as to not only have fun from start to finish, but leave an enviable legacy along the way. These themes are particularly powerful during the third act when, after discovering the true identity of Papa Georges, the audience is treated to a concise, albeit misty-eyed, history of film itself- a set piece so touching we might as well be sitting next to Toto as he watches the lost archives at the end of Cinema Paradiso.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

","After hearing about Scorsese's huge flop, 100 million dollar loss, and knowing how much of a King Midas that Martin is, I decided to check it out.

It is set in France, early 1900s, and Hugo is an orphaned boy keeping the train station clockwork going.<br/><br/>Each character has a very distinct personality (pro or anti to the main character), yet still manages to become likable to the viewer without being cheesy.

","We just saw the movie 'Hugo'. The cinematography was stunning. The 3D wasn't over done just for effect but was smartly used to make you feel as though you were in the middle of the scene. Like an observer off to the side, watching the action unfold. If you are a movie buff and know the history of motion pictures, you wont want to miss this film. It showed a bit of the early production of movies and brought to life some of the scenes you only see in books or snippets of in documentaries on beginning cinema. The casting of Georges Melies was brilliant. Ben Kingsley did a great job. This movie may bring to light the history of film to those that may not have ever thought about it's humble origins and the imagination, innovation and determination that was needed to capture an audiences attention and hold it as well as it has all these years."

"rjc722","10","2","5","1 January 2012"," Hugo is Boss!
","If there is one filmmaker that should have a feeling of accomplishment this year it's Martin Scorcese. With Hugo he's killed three birds with one stone. Firstly, he's entered the realm of 3-D filmmaking, secondly, he's indulged his lifelong passion of silent film and silent filmmakers and thirdlyhe's made a GREAT MOVIE! There's not one wasted piece of footage in this masterpiece that combines a great & classic story with new and cutting edge technology.<br/><br/>The story of a young orphaned boy who lives in the walls of a Paris train station is taken from the book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" by Brian Selznick. Via flashback we learn that Asa Butterfield's Hugo finds himself in this situation after his tinkering father (Jude Law in a very nice cameo) dies in a fire. He is then taken to the train station by his Uncle, who dies not soon after from alcohol consumption, but not before instilling upon Hugo the importance of setting the station's clocks. Through vents and peep holes Hugo observes the station regulars such as cute flower girl played by Emily Mortimer, an elderly bookseller played by Christopher Lee, a bitter station inspector played by Sasha Baron Cohen and an elderly toy shop owner played by Ben Kingsley. To obtain parts for a robotic invention left by his father Hugo steals various little toys from Kingsley's shop until he is finally caught. The two work out a deal allowing Hugo to work at the shop to pay off the items he's pilfered. Along the way he is soon befriended by Kingsley's goddaughter Isabelle played by Chloe Grace Moretz. Through Hugo's invention the two learn that Kingsley is actually the acclaimed filmmaker Georges Melies who directed the 1902 classic A Trip To The Moon. Thanks to Hugo, Melies, who believed himself a has-been after World War I, is now given a new legion of fans and Hugo is given a home.<br/><br/>The fact that such a story can be told, let alone in 3-D, by the same director that gave us Goodfellas and Casino is proof that Martin Scorcese may be the most versatile filmmaker of his time. In fact, you would never know this was first attempt at 3-D as he knows exactly which shots work best for the process. In addition to interesting looking peopledogs, clock parts, luggage, snowflakes, ashes and even dust enter the viewer's frame with realistic results.<br/><br/>Kingsley's performance is class all the way and he is supported nicely by Mortimer, Lee and Cohen. While Butterfield's performance as ""Hugo"" could garner the first child star Oscar since Anna Paquin won for The Piano. Of course the real star of the movie is the person who extracted those great performancesScorcese. What's ingenious about how he unfolds his tale is the combination of his love for the actual process of movie making. For instance, in a 3-D film where images come at the audience we see a shot of the first film where a train enters a train station which scares the audience who, not being use to movie magic, believes the train is coming at them. We see a shot of Hugo and Isabelle watching the classic Harold Lloyd film Safety Last where he dangles above the city from a clock, than we later see Hugo himself in the same position trying to escape Cohen and his dog. The call backs to classic and silent film as well as the subliminal messages here and there toward film preservation (a topic very near and dear to Scorcese) flow easily. Instead of obvious exposition or a hidden agenda Scorcese uses these devices to help tell the story. In my opinion, he could soon have a matching bookend to match the one he received for The Departed. Of course unlike the latter, this film has no blood, violence or offensive languagejust fun for anyone who wants to do what Kingsley's Melies character suggests""Watch the magic""."
"FilmPhreeks","10","2","5","1 January 2012"," Martin Scorcese delivers a wonderful family film
","Well, I finally had a chance to see Hugo in 3D. I have a lot of wonderful things to say about this movie. Back when I heard this movie was coming out when I saw the trailer of it, I just assumed that it would just be one of those average whimsical family movies that come out during the holidays and I was also really surprised that Martin Scorsese directed it as well, because I'm really used to watching his other movies that are about the mob or a character study of someone's life. But, much to my thoughts going into it, this movie really left a huge smile on my face from the beginning to end. The movie is about a boy named Hugo who is an orphan who lives in a train station in Paris, France and he starts to uncover a great big mystery about his father who was a very great inventor. During the course of the movie, the boy tries to build this machine that his father worked on called an automaton, which is basically a mechanical man that can write messages and decrypt hidden meanings. I really loved where this story was going with Hugo learning the secrets his father left behind for him. I wont spoil what happens, but, all I can say is that watching this movie really kept me invested the whole time with it's characters with a very perfectly cast of actors in these roles. You've got Ben Kingsley who plays Papa Georges who was once a very talented filmmaker during the height of the early movie making days. I love this back story they give him later on in the movie and it feels very meta in a way because there's a part where Hugo and George's goddaughter Isabelle are watching one of the first movies ever made on a projector that shows a train coming and she says, ""When the audience watched it, they thought the train was really coming toward them"". :). Gosh, I have so much to talk about with this movie. From the beautiful cinematography and atmosphere of the train station and outside of it, to the really spectacular 3D that I really did enjoy. It felt like I was really there inside this world and it reminded me of the way Avatar looked in 3D. It's very in depth and gorgeously crafted the way it's filmed. And in the movie when they talked about the way the early films were made really got me really intrigued on how much work was done for the kinds of movies that this character had made. As for the rest of the film, I really also enjoyed the performances of the main character of Hugo, played by a newcomer named Asa Butterfield and he really pulled this part off. He showed a lot of great emotion in his scenes and he's really smart on building things such as this mechanical mouse and finishing the automaton for his father played by Jude Law. And then there's other characters in the movie too that I enjoyed, but I thought could of been better developed such as Sacha Baron Cohen's quirky role as Inspector Gustav, who had some funny lines of dialog and he did a good job playing this smarmy train station inspector and as the movie goes on, he does actually become a 3 dimensional character. Overall, I really loved this movie for everything that Martin Scorsese did with it's coming of age story of a boy who did everything he could to make his father proud and learn more secrets about his life and I give props as well to the music. It's very orchestral and melodic and worked so well in tone with the film. At first I was little skeptical about Martin Scorsese making a children's film, but, much to my surprise, this movie felt more than that. This movie is in the same league as Super 8 with terrific performances, wonderful cinematography, a well put together story, and leaving a huge smile on my face from beginning to end. This movie has been one of the best films I've seen of 2011 and It's on my list of Top 12 of movies I've seen for 2011."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","5","30 December 2011"," Despite risky new (and 3D) territory, Scorsese emerges all the more masterful
","Never underestimate Martin Scorsese. Just because ""Hugo"" lacks in F-words doesn't mean the master filmmaker is so out of his element that he couldn't possibly put his stamp on this family-friendly film. In fact, ""Hugo"" might be the most personal of the director's catalog. <br/><br/>Based on the novel ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" by Brian Selznick, ""Hugo"" begins as a period piece fairy tale mystery and blossoms into a love letter to cinema in unexpected yet charming ways. Brilliant 14-year-old actor Asa Butterfield stars as Hugo, an orphaned boy who lives in the walls of a Paris train station in the 1930s. Scorsese portrays this world as a living painting brimming with potential for adventure, and though what awaits behind the door comes grounded in fact more than fantasy, it's not less magical.<br/><br/>The blue-eyed Butterfield wins hearts instantly as the lonely Hugo, a boy who lost his father (Jude Law), a clockmaker whose only legacy to his son ended up being a wind-up automaton that the two were working on putting back together. With the hope that the automaton will reveal a final message from his father (or psychiatrically speaking, give him closure), Hugo steals mechanical pieces from a toy-shop owner (Ben Kingsley) to fix the broken machine. But when the toy-shop owner seizes a notebook from Hugo containing detailed diagrams of the automaton, Hugo begins a quest that will bring him closer to solving the mystery than he ever imagined.<br/><br/>Hugo befriends and teams up with the toy-shop owners goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), a wide-eyed bookworm with a self-proclaimed love of adventure and secrets. Considering this is the same girl that swore up a storm in the action-comedy ""Kick-Ass,"" the fact that she's so convincingly pure and innocent is a true triumph. Scorsese chooses to show her and Butterfield as angels only faulted by their unguarded optimism. <br/><br/>The entire film ends up as a successful exercise in sweeping the audience into a heart-driven story and diverting attention from issues with some of the film's more practical components such as plot cohesion and character motivation. To elaborate would spoil the film, but those unfamiliar with the source material would be interested to know that the story connects to the birth of film at the turn of the 20th Century, which in large part explains the interest of an auteur such as Scorsese.<br/><br/>Ironically or perhaps beautifully, ""Hugo"" also comes in 3D, and stunning 3D no less. Filmed in (not converted to) the extra dimension, not only does the film avoid issues of blurriness, but Scorsese also uses it to enhance the experience on numerous levels. Considering ""Hugo"" is far from an action film, the 3D must be utilized more creatively, and who better to experiment with this than Scorsese? <br/><br/>The depth of field that 3D enhances allows him to focus on certain objects in certain ways and do tracking shots that feel as if they're literally moving somewhere. In one scene, Sacha Baron Cohen, who plays the train station's inspector, leans over slowly as he verbally reprimands Hugo, and though slow and subtle, the way he inches slightly toward the audiences magnifies the anxiety we are to feel in that scene. As easy as it is to bash 3D for its gimmicky origins, ""Hugo"" proves that in the right hands, no film technique should ever be shunned.<br/><br/>The story's picturesque innocence and more importantly heart drive the rest of the film. Hugo's quest for purpose in life amidst his personal loneliness and tragedy lead him to discover others who in turn prove he's not alone in these struggles. As he and Isabelle get closer and closer to their discovery, the film also asks us to recall the essence of motion picture filmmaking and reflect on its vitality. Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan beautifully emphasize this through the use of side characters in the train station, including Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>So although the number of physical high jinks as well as dogs and cats might be disproportionate compared to vintage Scorsese, he elevates this simple tale of friendship, discovery, movies and the reinvigoration of the human spirit to a place few can.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"khfan250","9","2","5","30 December 2011"," An experience!
","Well, I finally got around to seeing Hugo, after weeks of anticipation. Was it worth it? Yes. Hugo is not only a great movie, but, as the title of this review states, an experience. It's got enough wonder to take you back to a simpler time, filled with macabre wonder and awe.<br/><br/>With that said, there are a few minor problems with this movie. Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret and Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle are very uninteresting and bland. I'm sure they're nice kids, but the delivery of some of their lines is, for lack of a better term, wretched. However, they are saved by a strong supporting cast made up of Ben Kingsley, Helen McCrory, Jude Law, and Sacha Baron Cohen. These characters are far more interesting than the two leads, but that's very much a personal preference.<br/><br/>Even small roles are all far more engaging, even though they aren't really relevant to the plot. For instance, the character of Monsieur Labisse serves no real point to the overall story, but because he's played by Christopher Lee, the character leaves much more of an impact. Even Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour, as entirely irrelevant as their characters were, gave such a weight to their parts that you can't help but notice them.<br/><br/>The story starts off very slow, with no real direction or initiative. But, as time goes on, you see why the beginning started off slow. The film takes its time and, in return for your patience, gives you a heart warming throwback to...well, a lot of things. The main focus is that every person has a role to play, but it's up to that person to determine his or her own fate. That's a very deep message for a kid's movie. But it's also a throwback to old entertainment. Watching the scenes where Ben Kingsley's character reveals his past is indescribable. You just have to watch it.<br/><br/>Final verdict: Though I acknowledge the problems with this movie, I can easily overlook them because there's too many great things about it. This is the best movie I've seen all year, and I highly recommend it. Even the 3D isn't that bad; it's very atmospheric and impressive. This is Martin Scorsese first family flick, and it's a real gem."
"alisonc-1","10","2","5","28 December 2011"," Magical!
","""Hugo"" is director Martin Scorsese's foray into family film and 3D film both at once, but it is also his most direct ode to the history of cinema, the medium that creates the stuff of dreams. We meet young Hugo Cabret (the amazing Asa Butterfield), an orphan of perhaps 10 or 12 years who is living by himself behind the walls and in the clockwork of the great Montparnasse train station in Paris in the early 1930s. His father (Jude Law, shown in flashbacks) was a clock-maker, operated a shop and also worked in a museum, but when he is killed by a fire in the museum, Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), the unkempt drunk who keeps the clocks in the train station running, takes Hugo in and teaches him the trade, only to disappear soon after. So Hugo is on his own, relying on his wits and quick manoeuvres in the busy train station to keep out of the hands of the Station Inspector (the very funny and also terrifically poignant Sasha Baron Cohen); he keeps the clocks working, so that nobody knows that Uncle Claude is gone, and in his spare time he works at repairing an old automaton that his father had rescued from obscurity in the museum before his death. The automaton, when working properly, can actually write on its own! But Hugo can't quite get the repairs done because there's an odd heart-shaped keyhole in the back of the machine for which the only key must also be heart-shaped, and he has no such key. He steals little clockwork springs and other devices from the station's toy shop, run by Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), but one day he is caught by Georges and forced to give up the notebook of his father, which held countless drawings to help him repair the automaton; without it he is lost. Fortunately, Georges has a god-daughter, Isabelle (the marvelous Chloe Grace Moretz), who befriends Hugo and helps him reconcile with Georges and, in time, repair the machine. But that's only the beginning of the story....<br/><br/>This is truly a magical movie, and the 3D aspect of it is, for once, an integral part of the magic. Scorsese of course knows his stuff, and he never overplays the 3D effects or jars you with them, they just add depth to what's already an entrancing landscape. Although ostensibly about Hugo's search for a new home, the film is really about one of the very early pioneers of film, Georges Melies, who was working I believe starting around the 1890s and who suddenly stopped working in film after the First World War. One of my current favourite actors, Michael Stuhlbarg (you loved him in the Coen Brothers' ""A Serious Man,"" or perhaps still adore him in ""Boardwalk Empire""), has an amazing turn as a film historian, Rene Tabard, who tells Hugo and Isabelle about this great director, almost all of whose films are apparently lost. You may have seen Melies' ""A Trip to the Moon"" film, if you've ever seen early cinema - Melies was to early film what Tolkein was to fantasy literature, in the sense that when other early experimenters in film were bringing real life to the reels in cinema houses, Melies brought fantastical stories to the screen, as far as I know the first to do so. ""Hugo"" is really his story, and as it happens, the story of Georges Melies as told in ""Hugo"" is actually what really happened to the man.<br/><br/>Along with everybody else I've mentioned, there are also lovely moments from some other favourite actors: Christopher Lee is just perfect as the train station's bookseller, Monsieur Labisse (and one thing I love about his small role is that when he addresses someone using the French titles and last names, his pronunciation is such that you know he speaks the language in real life, which is not necessarily true of the other actors in this film, great as they are); Emily Mortimer is both wistful and strong as Lisette, the flower seller whom the Station Inspector secretly loves; Frances de la Tour and Richard Griffiths are coffee-shop habitués and dachshund lovers who eventually get together; and Helen McCrory is quite luminous as Mama Jeanne, Papa Georges' wife. The cinematography is brilliant, the dialogue is completely real, and the entire film is utterly magical. And we even get a Scorsese cameo! Even if you don't think you like ""family"" films or ""children's"" movies, or especially if you don't like 3D (I generally don't), do yourself a tremendous favour and go to see this movie, yes in 3D if possible. It will easily become one of those beloved seasonal films (even though it's not set at any particular time except winter), and although I'm sure I'm going to love it again and again on BluRay at home in years to come, I am most happy to have seen it, first, as it was meant to be seen - on a large screen in a cinema, in 3D. I'm not sure that it's possible to recommend it more highly; I *am* sure that it's my favourite film of 2011."
"cinegnostic","10","2","5","27 December 2011"," A film that defines film-making
","What is film-making? At its most basic, it is creating something -- a reality -- that exists only within the boundaries of the film In Hugo, Scorsese does that. He creates a reality that visually is beautiful. A story that is both touching and educational. A reality within a film that sets a stage, develops a story, resolves a conflict, and teaches us something about the very origin of film; all within beautiful images and a storyline that is more than plaintive. Instead, it reveals the power of the human spirit when it refuses to be subdued.<br/><br/>I never have been prouder to pay admission to a film than to see this film."

This little boy who acts the lead is an amazing actor. The young girl who befriends him is equally up to the task and the superb Ben Kingsley has made one of his best movies in years. I loved this film. It is mysterious, magical, mystical, glorious, and possesses such wonderment of how things work and why we exist. Setting the movie in the 1930's is apt since it is about an early filmmaker. In childlike fashion this story is told through the eyes of a young orphan and he makes dreams come true. He believes in a world adults can't fathom. They are caught up in what they consider the ""real"" world so it takes a young lad to make this movie a reality in many ways. Not for Scorcese as much as for the characters so well played in the story. Go see this movie. It should be making millions and not the piddling amount is has to date. What is this anyway, the season of the holidays and old Christmas movies or children's movies that come out for those children out of school soon? Although this is about children and their beliefs in a better world and the magic and excitement of the depth of meaning and how things work and why, children want Chipmunks, I guess. This is a movie of great depth and feeling. It deserves to be seen and appreciated. Scorsese has a hit. He still believes in the wonderment of children. This is a must-see."

","A resplendently sweeping opening shot that promised of an exceptional film with complex themes completely took unexpected turns for the worse.<br/><br/>Scorsese expresses his love for his profession of film and film making and reminds us of how cinema has shaped us and our dreams in the past century. However, he chose to tell this amazing story within a lame over used and formulated context. The film was slow and at times seemed uninspired, the film's one dimensional characters and many pointless subplots didn't help bring it back to life.<br/><br/>But I left the theater thinking of similarities with Cinema Paradiso - the clips of film so lovingly edited out and then reconstituted by Alfredo the projectionist shown to Salvatore in CP, and those of Melies in Hugo... and what a wonderful medium film is when it is placed in the hands of an artist. Scorsese should've only focused on the story of Melies.. A good film that had a HUGE potential to be exceptional but failed to do so..."

It is very convincing that this is what really happened, so I offer caution to all of mankind that this story is pretend. Historical fiction must be recognized as fiction. This is a wonderful attempt to make the past more beautiful. I am certain that in reality there were a lot more body lice and hunger, sick orphans, and ruined lives as a result of WWI.

","I am astonished at the praise this film is receiving. While I am very pleased that this is bringing much needed attention to the Great George Melies and his oeuvre, I wonder if I saw the same film others seem to have. <br/><br/>Yes, the film employs the best use of 3D to date though I wish there had been more scenes relating to Melies' cinematic work. The problems with this film is that the story takes forever to unfold and then really goes nowhere. Every moment that should have been heart tugging was really quite void of emotional buildup and anti-climatic. <br/><br/>I appreciate the fact that this is an ode not only to Melies, but to early cinema and all its wondrous melodramatic story lines. The poor orphaned boy. The bitter old man who finally opens up his heart and home. The villain who could ruin everything for the boy. All this and more are situations that should cause anticipation, longing, and hope in an audience but due to Scorsese's mechanical approach to these plot elements they are rendered emptily. Perhaps I expected too much. A story about George Melies. The Great Martin Scorsese who not only is a gifted auteur but a great cinephile whose childhood imagination must have been rife with vivid cinematic inspirations. It truly is not a classic but a grand footnote to what cinema once was and still should be.<br/><br/>The acting is quite uneven. The gifted Sacha Baron Cohen is off key throughout. Ben Kingsley is a great actor but somehow is not convincing as Melies. Perhaps this is due to the fact that these characters really belong in a silent film from decades past, acted by those used to methods employed due to the constraints of early filmmaking. As we venture more rapidly into our future, we seem to be continually trying to hold on to the past more and more rather than finding new frontiers to explore."
"StevePulaski","10","2","5","4 December 2011"," A cinematic achievement that embraces the medium and spills intelligence everywhere
","I don't think Martin Scorsese really cares if Hugo does well with audiences and at the box office. I think he's pleased with the end product and has successfully made an ode to cinema. Here's a man who has made one amazing film after another, and now he wants to pay tribute to a form of entertainment through the same form of entertainment. To put it simply; Hugo is a movie that loves movies.<br/><br/>I did in fact read the novel, The Many Inventions of Hugo Cabret, by Brian Selznick which is why I was so worried about a film adaptation of the book. I knew it was coming, but how would they erect a film that is made up of mostly stunning pencil illustrations. Thankfully, the film fell into the hands of a director who knows the game of cinema inside and out and because of that he gives Hugo the stunning treatment it deserves. During the course of the film, we begin to see that this is clearly Scorsese's most personal film. Growing up in Little Italy, he was sheltered in his house because of his asthma. His mother would take him to the local movie theater, which lead to Scorsese's increasing fondness for cinema early on and eventually he made movies of all sorts.<br/><br/>Hugo is a landmark for Scorsese for three reasons; the personal qualities, the 3D, and the target audience. This is Scorsese's first family film, and he shows that just like his traditional films, Hugo will appeal to some people, but not all. Reception will be divided amongst youngsters, but parents will be astounded when they see the milestone the film achieves.<br/><br/>Set in 1930's Paris, Hugo (Butterfield) is a young boy who literally lives in the clocks of a hectic train station. On the ground floor are a number of regular people with hefty baggage. Emily Mortimer is the flower girl, Christopher Lee is the bookshop owner, and Frances de la Tour as Madame Emile is the cafe owner. Hugo's father died recently, and since then, his uncle has taken him to live at the train station.<br/><br/>Hugo's uncle teaches him to take care of the clocks all around the station, winding them up, and keeping them in great shape before he disappears. Hugo must now stay out of trouble, and out of Inspector Gustav (Baron Cohen), the station manager's sight.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, since Hugo's father died he has been trying to repair an old automaton which he believes has a message from his father. An automaton is a crafty machine, built to resemble a human being, that is programmed to write down a message if all the parts are in place. Hugo has stolen parts from a toy store in order to rebuild the automaton, but is caught one day by the owner Papa Georges (played exquisitely by Ben Kingsley) who burns his notebook containing instructions on rebuilding the figure. Hugo teams up with Georges' goddaughter Isabelle (Moretz) and the two go through an adventure trying to repair the figure, while Hugo shows Isabelle the beauty of cinema.<br/><br/>That is another place where Scorsese's love for film comes into play and further cements the personal element of the film. Hugo shows Isabelle why cinema is so spellbinding and teaches her to appreciate it, like Scorsese has taught us with many of his films.<br/><br/>This is a visually intelligent piece, and is one of cinema's greatest achievements of, not only the year, but of the new decade. The plot won't concern people who come for the brilliant visuals and the intelligent filmmaking. I will also go as far as to call this the best 3D film I have yet to see. Scorsese doesn't incorporate the medium as a gimmick, but as an enhancement to the world we are submersed in for two hours. Hugo is lit beautifully and astonishingly by glasses that usually drone out vibrant colors.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is the professional camera-work, with Scorsese that shouldn't be a surprise, but it let it be said that when we talk about motions and camera-movement that Hugo handles it in such a way that needs to be seen to be believed. The opening shot glides us along the train station floor where we soon arc upwards, in a smooth as silk manner, to the big clock that occupies Hugo behind it. A similar shot can also be seen in the restaurant scene in Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, again, the film scores big. We have a cast of elders, youngsters, and people of middle age. Everyone gives a performance worthy of recognition, especially young Asa Butterfield who looks like a miniature movie star.<br/><br/>There are many shots of silent films, including a history lesson in very early filmmaking dating back to the early 1890's. This is where Hugo shines; resurrecting the past to give us, not just a rehash, but an unobtrusive look at the art form we're so well acquainted with in modern day society.<br/><br/>Scorsese has yet made another masterpiece, without any conceivable flaws in sight. The camera-work is smooth, the visuals are intelligent, the dialog perfectly executed, the performances beautiful, and the 3D amazing. Hugo is a landmark for every field it sinks it steps on.<br/><br/>Starring: Asa Butterfield, Chloë Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, and Jude Law. Directed by: Martin Scorsese."

","This is visually one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It is definitely worth it to pay the few extra dollars to see it in 3D.The use of the 3D technology in this film is nothing like I have ever seen. There isn't a single scene that has that feeling that it was added for the sake of something ""jumping out at you"", just a rich, warm visual feast of an environment that serves to enhance an already very good, very watchable movie. Hugo is as much for adults as it is for children. It has a well thought out story line with charming characters. The acting is never overdone and although it may be a bit slow for younger children, it is enjoyable from start to finish. We took my mother, teenagers, and two nine year olds and they all loved it."
"agniva_pro","9","3","11","5 March 2012"," Scorsese's Tribute to Film-Makers
","Martin Charles Scorsese, now at 70, definitely felt the urge to delve deep into the history of cinema and bring out a story (which also happens to be partly true) that so wonderfully conveys both the power of imagination and the joy of film making. Marie-Georges-Jean Méliès is not a very popular name these days, but his contribution to cinema in the early days of its inception is worth a movie. And Brian Selznick penned a novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, which elevates this tribute to an altogether higher orbit of fantasy and adventure. <br/><br/>The story revolves around an orphaned boy, Hugo, who lives in the ducts and vents of a train station in 1930s Paris and employs himself by fixing and maintaining the station clocks. As an heirloom of his deceased father, Hugo tries to mend a broken automaton that is supposed to write a message on a paper. A chance encounter with a toy store owner, Georges Méliès, and his eccentric daughter unravels a way to make the automaton work. And this takes him on a journey down the past life of Méliès and he re-discovers the genius of the man who had suffered a long and silent agony of neglect and deprivation. Glory gets restored to Méliès in the most strangest of ways. <br/><br/>In spite of the stellar star cast, this is not an actor oriented movie. Chloë Grace Moretz and Asa Butterfield deserves applaud since they manage to convey the nuances of their characters with a maturity which is beyond their age. Ben Kingsley is great, but who expects anything less than that from him! Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal of the station inspector was noteworthy. Wonderfully restrained! But, I must say again, Hugo will not be remembered for these acting performances. It will be remembered for what transcends the actors.<br/><br/>The cinematography, special effects, editing, art direction etc. are all clearly visible entities that must appeal to all viewers. The Oscars were well deserved, mostly. (Ok I agree, the 'Transformers bots' were wicked cool and Harry Potter's final installation was not bad either, but come on! These movies were not 'oscar material'). Hugo is a winner when it comes to 'look & feel'. Scorsese rules. He proves his mettle, once again, by bridging the special effects with the screenplay, the actors with their costumes, the light with the clock work and what not.<br/><br/>When analyzing works of Scorsese, Hugo might not reign over classics like Taxi Driver or Raging Bull but I believe this film is going to age nicely. It has all the ingredients of a classic and in the right proportion. (The only downside is a slight overdose of sentimentality in the last 30 minutes of the movie.) If you haven't seen it already, go dream with Hugo."

","Four Academy Awards? Or was that five? And a nomination for Best Director? Did I watch the same film the critics watched? The ""Hugo"" which I saw had 1) bad acting 2) inappropriate music 3) plot holes big enough to drive a semi through.<br/><br/>Yes, the cinematography was lovely. The editing was competent. The lighting/color/ costumes created a steam punk paradise. However, the lead actor was so bad that I found myself cheering on the train. Most of the male actors (with the exception of Christopher Lee and Jude Law) appeared to have been coached by someone with Asperger's. What on earth was Ray Winstone doing in this movie? For that matter, what kind of drug did they feed Ben Kingsley? Here is a suggestion for those who are thinking about watching ""Hugo."" Watch ""Sexy Beast"" instead.<br/><br/>About halfway through the movie I considered turning down the volume and watching it as a silent film. That is how bad the Howard Shore score was. No, the music itself was not bad. It was the way the music was used to create dramatic tension thick enough to choke a bull moose--when the action on the screen called for something light, whimsical, comedic. Note to the director. If you are going to use solemn, ominous, LOUD music, you need to be prepared to deliver a punch line that is solemn and ominous.<br/><br/>And then there is the Joseph Campbell problem. As in if the screenwriters had read their Joseph Campbell, they would have done a better job of creating an epic fantasy, which is what I think this wanted to be (based upon the Howard Shore score). Basically, this story is the Fisher King---except Kingsley's motivation is all wrong. (Here comes the spoiler). The Fisher King becomes ill, because his kingdom is ill. Kingsley throws away his art and career and every shred of humanity he possesses---because the critics no longer like his work???? Where was the extended footage of the horrors of WWI---mustard gas and trench warfare? Where was the son killed in battle? THAT is Fisher King material. I guess Scorsese did not want to scare the kids. Except, if he did not want to scare them, why the scary soundtrack? Make up your mind, please.<br/><br/>By film's end, I found myself indulging in a fantasy of my own. What would the movie have been like if someone who actually knows how to do dark children's fantasy, like Tim Burton had directed it? Three stars for being absolutely lovely to watch. Now I am going to go watch ""Sexy Beast"" so I can remind myself what good acting is."
"Degree7","3","2","6","16 March 2012"," Scorsese on Auto-Pilot
","As an avid follower of Scorsese films, I was eager to see his recent film ""Hugo"". Surely it wouldn't be a bad way to spend two hours, as he is considered to be America's greatest living director. Unfortunately, that claim may be refuted after having witnessed his latest decrepit blunder that is The Invention of Hugo Cabret.<br/><br/>A film revolving around the mystery of an orphaned boy in a 1930s Parisian train station and an old toy shop owner who works there (Ben Kingsley), along with an automaton, has very little in the way of inspiration. What little plot there is could have been told in about five minutes, resulting in a slow-paced drama that ground my interest to a halt less than halfway into the film. What was marketed as an adventure film has almost no elements of excitement either. Most of the action comes from cringe-worthy, slapstick gags that involve a bumbling station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) chasing Hugo. Much of the scenes with this character are rather daft, and I would have considered the child-pleasing antics here to be above that of Scorsese's usual movie-making fare.<br/><br/>During his quest, Hugo is aided by the toy maker's daughter, Isabelle (Chloë Moretz). The chemistry between the two is almost non-existent, with Ms. Moretz' acting being considerably below-par. Every time she uttered a clunky line in her stilted accent caused the inner-viewer within me to wince. Indeed I was unable to find much in the way of redeeming acting here. Just about everyone is shoeing in their performance here, and why a Paris train station is filled with cockney-speaking English people puzzled me.<br/><br/>The art direction in Hugo is nothing to write home about either. The depiction of Paris is nothing you haven't seen before, with much of the imagery revolving around clockwork inventions and old snapshots of early films. The Paris train station predictably has plenty of computer generated smoke and steam to add the required mystical aura to the proceedings. The colour scheme is embossed in Hollywood's usual churn out of teal and orange, and much of the film's visuals are derivative of previous Scorsese works, such as the scenes in ""The Aviator"" (2004) set in pre-1930.<br/><br/>Thelma Schoonmaker's editing leaves much to be desired as well, and this aspect was the most disappointing for me. Much of the editing lacks any real flow, and causes a disconnect between some scenes. I was confused during some moments as to what was happening and why. The clumsy editing is most apparent in a convoluted dream sequence that makes little to no sense in the context of the story. At times I find it hard to believe this is the same work as that of the wizards who won an Oscar for their editing in ""Raging Bull"".<br/><br/>Perhaps my main issue with Hugo is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. As a children's film, it is undoubtedly going to bore anyone under the age of 10, and anyone over that age is going to have a tough time having their imagination hooked by the bland visuals and overbearing computer effects that permeate the screen. Indeed, the problem with almost all 3D films sans Avatar is their reliance on the three dimensional medium to bring any sort of merit to watching them. When stripped of this, the lack of interest in the characters, the story, or this world they inhabit causes the film to become a pastiche of what it is supposed to be celebrating. There is little in the way of magic or adventure to be found in here, but if you're looking for a by the numbers trivia on early film history, then ""Hugo"" might peak your interest."

","This review is only a spoiler if you're indoctrinated into praising the pedantic pace of Martin Scorcese. This is not a children's movie. Not because there's violence, nudity, coarse language or an adult theme. It' isn't for children because they have short attention spans. By the time Hugo and Isabel find the key to the automaton (that starts the story), any normal child would have quit caring why he was in the theater, long ago, and started some annoying tactic to ensure his removal. Sparse flashbacks to early film making might interest someone old enough to remember how special effects were set up prior to universal CGI, but a kid expects to see the results and let those who attempt to entertain him worry about how it was done. George Melies was a magician who used the new phenomenon of film to synergize his shows. He was brilliant, and so were his movies. That's what you can try telling an eight year old who thinks he's going to see a young boy outsmart the adults who are trying to send him off to an orphanage. But that won't work long enough to allow you to see where this film is going. But remember this is Martin Scorcese! (What gave you the idea that it was going somewhere?) ""Will the clock-robot become a friend of Hugo, like E.T, and help him with supernatural uncanniness (because he's taken on the consciousness of Hugo's departed father)?"" If you're determined to stay in the theater, suggestions like that might string your child along until he falls asleep. But then there's the question of you staying awake, amidst the ticking and talking and waiting for the tedious details of the premise to show some pay-off for having been so exacting.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley's character goes to great lengths to stop Hugo from making a well-kept secret well-known. For what he's willing to do to Hugo, it must be an ugly, ugly story - one would think. In terms of ""what really happened to George Melius?"", one answer might be that he was heartbroken because his great efforts were no longer appreciated by the public. And if that was true n the 1930s, then Scorcese has a pay-off that can that generate enough bang for your buck to warrant an interest now. But to go into that would constitute a spoiler. Don't take a child to this movie. Adults can argue the artistic merits of Martin Scorcese in the same way they argue the merits of Jackson Pollack, but don't do that to a kid."

","This movie might be good in its 3D effect, but loses its appeal solely as a story after the first 15 minutes. I can imagine people start seeing this movie with great expectations and this feeling of: OK, story builds up- I bet I will be shocked soon or amazed, or taken into a beautiful imaginary world. Sadly it seems to be only a huge marketing campaign, which made me go see it, but it did not satisfy me at all as an adult. I would say it is a nice movie for children, but does not have that kind of magic touch as proclaimed in the trailer and the advertising of the film.<br/><br/>Acting is of course brilliant as always by Ben Kingsley. Sacha Baron Cohen fits perfectly for his role as the Station Inspector. The two Kids played by Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Moretz did also very well, but no good acting can make up for this weak script, sorry. I give 6 points ONLY for the 3D version!"
"sddavis63","4","2","6","26 February 2012"," If You Can Get Past A Dull And Slow Paced First Hour This Becomes Fairly Interesting
","My first reaction when this came to an end was that no matter its quality, it was tailor made for an Oscar nomination. Let's be honest. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is nothing if not a little bit self-serving, and much of the last half of this movie - once Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley) is revealed to be the early French film-maker Georges Melies (who is probably most famous for ""A Trip To The Moon,"" which he made in 1902) - is essentially set aside as a celebration of the early days of movie-making. So, to me, that explains the Oscar nomination for Best Picture, because to be perfectly honest I didn't think this movie was that great. In fact, I'd sum up the first half, which revolves around young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) as confusing at best, with a direction and purpose that was mystifying - at least to me.<br/><br/>Hugo is an orphan who lives in the clock tower of a Paris train station (unknown to the authorities.) He steals to survive, desperately tries to stay out of the reach of the authorities, who are represented by the Station Inspector (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) and the only thing he has left from his father is an ""automaton"" - a sort of robot that doesn't work anymore, but that Hugo wants to fix, because he's convinced that it bears a message from his father. Together with Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) - whose parents have also died and who lives with her godparents (the aforementioned Papa Georges and Mama Jeanne, played by Helen McCrory) - he manages to fix the automaton, which proceeds to draw him a picture from ""A Trip To The Moon"" - the first movie he ever saw with his father. This finally leads them to the realization that Papa Georges is Georges Melies, and the story becomes an attempt to help Georges overcome his own demons from the past.<br/><br/>Bluntly, I found this confusing and poorly paced. It has very much a fantasy feel about it at times, and I thought for a while (because I didn't know who the director was) that this may have been directed by Tim Burton - it has a very Burton-esque style to it in places (particularly the depiction of the inner workings of the clock.) I was surprised at the closing credits to discover that the movie was actually directed by Martin Scorsese, but as I watched the credits, some of that style finally made sense to me. One of the co-producers of the movie is Johnny Depp - who is, of course, a frequent collaborator as an actor with Tim Burton. OK. The pieces began to fit together. Give the movie credit for some effective special effects (in particular Hugo's two dream scenes revolving around the train and as he sees himself as an automaton), and for a heartwarming ending, as Melies is finally honoured for his film-making achievements. It was also nice to see (not enough, unfortunately) some clips from some of his movies. Some of the memories Melies shares also provide a tantalizing glimpse of early film-making techniques. <br/><br/>Yes, there are some good things to be found here. I still found it very difficult to get through the first hour, which was slow-paced and confusing to say the least. It picks up steam after that, and becomes more interesting, but it's still hard to get past that first hour. (4/10)"
"DICK STEEL","10","2","6","25 February 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Hugo
","With 11 Academy Award nominations under its belt, common sense prevailed with the local distributors in pushing for a release to tie in with the anticipated Oscar hype, rather than to hedge its bets in March should the film with the most nominations this year go back empty handed. But regardless of the nods and awards it probably may garner, this Martin Scorsese film is one of his best, if not possible amongst his most personal films, where he has the opportunity to pay tribute to one of French cinema's earliest visionaries Georges Méliès, as well as to touch upon a topic that close to his heart, that of film preservation.<br/><br/>Hugo, based upon the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, is Scorsese's first 3D effort, and a proper one at that I may add, with many filmmakers or production companies choosing the cop out way of making a 3D film through post-production conversion. If you want to do something you have got to do it right, and Scorsese's film is blessed with countless of scenes that provide that depth of field, exploiting its 3D tool well as how it is supposed to be, rather than providing cheap toward-the-screen gimmicks to distract. And it's pretty amazing too in meta sort of way with Scorsese's use of the 3D tool, since Hugo contains a major plot about the story of Georges Méliès, who is recognized as one of the innovators of effects on film in his days.<br/><br/>Biographies aren't sometihng new to Scorsese having done a number of films based on real people, but Hugo had wrapped a fictional narrative that's fit for the family, with broad based entertainment value and themes that make it appealing to a general audience across all ages, and best of all, being able to be a film about film history, introducing a great cinema master to the man on the street, perhaps sparking renewed interest amongst a generation that may not have heard of him, but likely to have been exposed or remember what would be one of the most enduring, iconic images seen at one point or another with the man on the moon being poked in the eye by a rocket, from his film A Trip to the Moon.<br/><br/>In all honesty I wasn't too impressed by Hugo Cabret's story, about the titular boy (Asa Butterfield) who lives in the Parisian train station of Gare Montparnasse, winding the clocks around the premises and spending his time evading the station inspector Gustave (Sacha Baron Cohen) who is on a warpath looking for misbehaving orphans. Hugo himself is made one with the demise of his dad (Jude Law in a small support role) who had left him under the care of drunken uncle Claude (Ray Winstone) and leaving behind an automation. Believing the automation contains a secret message left behind by dad, Hugo goes about scouring the station for knick knacks, trinkets and gears to get it going again, and often does so by stealing items off Georges Méliès the toymaker who has a small shop in the station.<br/><br/>That forms the gist of Hugo's initial interaction with Georges, and the story revolves around his friendship with Méliès goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), where together they find themselves embarking on an adventure involving various people such as those in the station like the florist Lisette (Emily Mortimer) whom the station inspector has the hots for, the dog loving cafe owner Emile (Frances de la Tour) and the newspaper seller Frick (Richard Griffiths) as well as those who would point them toward the discovery of film and its early years, such as bookstore owner Labisse (Christopher Lee), and film historian Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg). Chloe Moretz pairs up very nicely opposite Asa Butterfield who made a very endearing Hugo, with Sacha Baron Cohen nicely ditching his downright outrageously (and sometimes offensive) comical style for something a lot more family friendly, even as Hugo's prime nemesis.<br/><br/>While the acting here are all top notch with the cast being so incredibly comfortable in their roles no matter how big or small, I thought Ben Kingsley provided a masterclass for everyone in his role as the real character in history Georges Méliès, along with Helen McCrory who plays his wife Jeanne and is in almost all of Méliès' films. And of course digital effects make them look a lot younger when the story flashes back to their heydays, which was the last half hour that made Hugo an absolute winner as we deep dived into the early years of cinema, and French cinema at that too, about their life and times, and celebration even, together with a poignant reminder that many films are lost over the years if not for deliberate efforts to scour, source, and save prints that have been unceremoniously lost through the ravages of time.<br/><br/>It's a tough fight going into the Oscars this weekend, especially for those who have money put down for that office bet. Two of the strongest contenders in my opinion, Hugo and The Artist, contain that nostalgic look back at cinema's past, with the filmmakers paying homage to eras, personalities and systems that have been long gone, at a time when it was brimming with innovation and artistry. Martin Scorsese has once again shown that he's amongst the top of the game, and Hugo will be one of his iconic stamps in his decades long filmmaking career. Definitely highly recommended fare for everyone itching for an intelligent, heart- warming and entertaining adventure ride."

","With a family-friendly vibe prominent in its appearance and marketing, 'Hugo' was (possibly deliberately) misleading in how it presented itself to viewers. This is not the epic fantasy-adventure the trailers may have led you to believe it was; what it is, however, is a confident character endeavour brimming with charm.<br/><br/>Title character Hugo, a young orphan boy, lives in a bustling Paris train station where he routinely works the intricate clockwork which features heavily in its architecture. When he isn't tinkering with the timepieces, Hugo secretly tries to fix a mysterious mechanical being left behind by his deceased father, all the while trying to hide his presence from the ruthless station manager (a subtle Sacha Baron Cohen). Dramatic developments occur, however, when Hugo befriends the daughter of the toy shop owner and discovers that she holds the key to unlocking the machine's secrets.<br/><br/>Despite primarily taking place within one location, the train station does not limit the scope of the movie. Policing it endlessly is Baron Cohen, his character reminiscent of the Child Catcher from 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', exuding the same hilarious fear factor. Scorsese plays with the film's steampunk vibe like a child plays with a new wind-up toy, panning across billows of smoke and detailed machinery. It bestows the film with tremendous character and a unique identity that will make it recognisable for years to come, as will be the performances by the incredible child stars that lead the roster. Chloe Grace Moretz hardly needed to prove herself, but alongside Asa Butterfield she outshines even her elder co-stars.<br/><br/>In reviewing the film I feel I have no choice but to judge the 3D experience also, something I would normally avoid. Audiences may have grown tired of it, film enthusiasts may still dismiss it as a gimmick, but 'Hugo' proves it is a medium worth investing in. Without the extra dimension, Scorsese would not have been able to effectively compare the extremes of technology found in his own film with those in the movies of yesteryear. In a particularly impressive sequence, a train rolls through a crowded station straight into the eyes of the audience, referring to a previous scene that explored how audiences reacted to one of the earliest examples of cinema. In the current industry there has been a varying quality of 3D that has drawn attention to its potential longevity; 'Hugo' is an example of a director really thinking outside of the box, giving the technology a great amount of credibility. I would go as far as to say I would refuse to watch the film in anything less than three dimensions.<br/><br/>A deserving contender for awards season, Scorsese's latest effort is big-budget art posing as family fare, pulling off both in equal measure. Make sure Hugo see it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"ElMaruecan82","7","2","6","17 January 2012"," Lacked precisely what it was paying tribute to
","Maybe I got fooled by the ratings and the film's place in IMDb Top 250, but no matter what, I never miss a Scorsese film and I was really eager to discover ""Hugo"".<br/><br/>Scorsese is one of the most defining and consistent filmmakers of his generation but he is also one of these privileged filmmakers so adored that no matter what they do, it's always 'gold' for the fans, Quentin Tarantino is another blatant example... Whenever I read a review of a Scorsese film by Roger Ebert, probably his fan number one, it's a sort of admiration that almost confines to fetishism, with always the same stuff written in different formulas. Scorsese as –I paraphrase- 'the tormented genius with the greatest talent to depict sinning hearts in quest for redemption', this is so overused that it deliberately neglects the fact that many filmmakers explored these themes lately even better than him, Abel Ferrara, to name one.<br/><br/>Now to ""Hugo"", which is not a 'bad movie'; in fact, it's even far from being a bad movie ... but when you read all the ecstatic reviews, they all make it sound as if the non-fans didn't get it was a tribute to Silent films. We all got that it's a film that reminds us of the most glorious days of filmmaking, the Golden Age of creativity, with a bonus from Ebert: it's also the expression of Scorsese's own existential grieves through the portrayal of George Meliès. The problem with these reviews is that they focus on many elements of 'greatness' forgetting that, as I often say, their combination doesn't make a movie necessarily great. When you take ""Hugo"" as a whole, I don't know, but you realize that many parts indeed drag too long, that the pacing is slow and not 'Kubrick' slow, it's slow as we're always ahead of the characters, especially the two kids.<br/><br/>Indeed, we know that it's only a matter of time since the boy and the girl would get together and try to solve the mystery, so all we have to do is wait for the script to cement their complicity in the most believable way, and when it finally happens, you think 'it was about time', no pun intended. There are some parts where the dialog sounded forced and stereotypical to a degree that even Spielberg wouldn't have dared to reach, the boy who lost her father, the girl whose parents are dead, loneliness, sadness  granted that being an orphan makes a kid more interesting story-wise but why drowning this in an ocean of pathos? The movie overuses depth as the convenient excuse for slow pacing like the epic ""Benjamin Button"" bore did, and sometimes, I really waited for something to happen, and it has nothing to do with violence, explosion, 'kiss kiss' or 'bang, bang'  just some action, drama, and I'm not counting the subplot with the buffoonish police officer (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his dog, probably the most embarrassing moments of the film.<br/><br/>Anyway, it took time for the plot to take off and it became more interesting when the movie revealed what it wanted to be: a homage to cinema and Silent classics, and I reckon the story of George Meliès was very poignant and Kingsley is extremely convincing as the grumpy old guy. But seriously, what's that ever got to do with the beginning? The movie started like a Family Adventure film and ended as a tribute to an artist who simply needed to know that he wasn't forgotten. I'm sorry but as much as I appreciate the fact that younger audience should know more about Meliès, this is still adult material, the whole existential aspect contradicts the initial tone of the film. The film tries to be so many things, ""Harry Potter"" and ""Amelie Poulain"" with the slapstick of a Disney film but at the end, it just feels like an assemblage of parallel stories (the policeman with the girl, the automaton, the librarian ) with unequally satisfying conclusions for each of them.<br/><br/>Talking of the policeman, the script tries to fill the gaps by adding peripheral characters like him -after all, movies like this need a villain- but the other characters are so one-dimensional and sterile that it made the whole thing look artificial. Take simply the way the extras walk, it's all mechanical, they see a kid running and carrying a weird automaton, and they don't even pay attention, they're just here to recreate a crowd and bump on Hugo or the girl when they're running. The film and its recreation of a 30's Paris is visually dazzling but it had something very lifeless as if the population was made of automatons. And if it wasn't for the beautiful score, some scenes would have been quite dull because the kids' dialogs really felt written, especially Chloe Moretz' line (too mature, even from a girl who loves to read). There's something cruelly lacking in the film, I guess it's simply called entertainment. The film lacked precisely what it was paying a tribute to: this zaniness, flamboyance, creativity of early cinema, it lacked the very spirit of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, and even the cheers at the end had some very dark and depressing undertones.<br/><br/>There were two movies making tribute to Silent films in 2011, ""The Artist"" and ""Hugo"", I thought ""The Artist"" was great precisely because it managed to tell an endearing romance with the homage aspect as an implicit back-story. Although ""Hugo"" has an interesting pedagogic value, there's a feeling of underachievement from the adventure aspect. Spielberg's ""Tintin"" didn't have much depth, but I had a better time watching it.<br/><br/>I respect Scorsese for exploring other themes and cinematic techniques, but I think the movie is a little bit over-praised and just because Scorsese made it -again- that doesn't prevent from pointing out some weaknesses."

","After seeing Hugo, I am 17 films away from seeing all of the top 250 IMDb films. Perhaps I should have saved it for last, since Hugo is a celebration of great films. There is both a snippet and a homage to Safety Last! (1923), for example. The entire early history of film is given.<br/><br/>But it's ""great"" 3D, so I thought I should catch it in the theater. I'm very glad that I did, because the 3D effects are spectacular. Gears, steam, pendulums, and crowds are everywhere, making the film a delight to the eyes as the camera swoops around all over the place.<br/><br/>Georges Méliès is worth looking up here at IMDb, as he is the star of the film, played wonderfully by Ben Kingsley. Buster Keaton, Charles Chaplin, and other greats also get to star through the snippets.<br/><br/>I did not like the trailer for the film. Seemed too slapstickish. Part of it showed Baron Sasha Cohen as the Station Inspector about to run into a huge cake. The trailer is rife with trickery -- he doesn't run into the cake. Don't be put off by trailers you've seen.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the top 250 IMDb films, you'll love this movie."
"freemantle_uk","8","2","6","11 January 2012"," A family film for adults
","Ever since Martin Scorsese won his long overdue Oscar with The Departed he could anything he wants as a filmmaker. After his homage to B-Horror films with Shutter Island film fans were taken aback when he announced he was going to a 3D Family film. But of course Scorsese impressed critics and fans the world over once again.<br/><br/>In a train station in Paris in the 1930 Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan boy who maintains the clocks in the station. He has to steal to survive and he has to avoid the Station Inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen). His only link to his dead father (Jude Law) is a broken automata robot which he was fixing and believes that if he gets it to work he would get a message from his father from beyond the grave. He meets a girl, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) who has a key to unlock the automata so it can work and relieve it secrets. It turns out that it leads to a bigger secret involving Isabelle's godfather and surrogate parent, Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley).<br/><br/>Many people were very hesitant towards Hugo, partly because it was something very different from Scorsese's previous films, but mainly because of its very slapstick heavy trailer. But of course Scorsese is one of the best directors ever and he delivers with his family film for adults. Hugo is a mystery that is for most part is serious, with a few moments of comedy. The whole story about the automata is solved pretty quickly and the film then turns into a love letter to early cinema and how very inventive early filmmakers were with set design and scope of story. All the characters have all their issues and problems they need to overcome, Hugo himself is lonely and suffering from grief, trying to find that one connection to his father who died in a tragic accident. Georges is a man wants to forget the past and whilst on the surface a seemingly bitter man there is a lot issues and character behind it. Isabelle is a young girl who lived a shuttered life, escaping into a world of adventure and longs for one herself and ask what her purpose in life (despite the fact she is only 11/12). Even the minor characters have mini-arcs, like The Station Inspector who needs to gain the courage to ask out the flower girl (Emily Mortimer) and the newspaper seller (Richard Griffiths) wanting to get to know the café (Frances de la Tour) but her dachshund keeps attacking him. Hugo has an pleasant old fashion feel to through, a good natured mystery about children working together to solve a mystery and showing they are mature enough to handle secret and that it works as a coming of age story. If anything it might be a little too pleasant because there is no real scene of danger or peril.<br/><br/>Scorsese uses the train station setting to great effect, bring us into this little world. The 3D was great for most of the film, Scorsese knew how to use the technology, putting items in the foreground to enhance the effect and the wintry weather added to 3D, showing things in the distance. Scorsese knows how to move the camera, to show us this world and brings us a depth of feel like looking down a letter. The use of clock towers and a mechanical automata really are perfect for 3D films just because of the different layers of cogs and mechanical parts. Scorsese also brings has some excellent set pieces involving a sequence involving a train crashing through the station and Hugo dream that he turns into the automata. The 3D and editing compliment the sequences.<br/><br/>The acting is great. We know that Butterfield and Mortez are great child actors, having shown their talents in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and Kick-Ass. They have a great chemistry together and work together. Despite an initial animosity they become friends very quickly. Hugo is a character with a talent for fixing things, working with his hands, but is sad, lonely and at times angry. He longs to have one last connection with his father, the person he loved the most. Mortez performance reminded me of a young Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, but not as obnoxious: a book smart character who has a sense of adventure. Mortez is a better actress then Watson and she does an excellent English accent for such a young American actress. Of course the adult cast is strong, Kingsley actually playing a good guy for once as a man trying to suppress the past because it hurts too much, even if it affects the rest of his family. Cohen is a funny as the comic foil character whilst a villain, not an evil man, just someone doing his job. It also shows Cohen can be funny in a family friendly way.<br/><br/>The theme of Hugo is the celebration of how filmmakers were inventive, how they turned this new media which was written off as a fad and show its potential as a form of storytelling, art and basically allowing people to see and fulfil their dreams and fantasy. Scorsese does this using the newest tool to film making, though 3D is properly on the way because producers see it as a way to make a extra money. 3D as a tool that should be used when there is a real reason, when the director actually envisions how to use it and it needs to be done using 3D cameras and on set.<br/><br/>Howard Shore also shows that he is a talented composer, giving Hugo a filling score, using typical French movie to music that would have been used in silent films.<br/><br/>I do not believe Hugo is Martin Scorsese's best film and as a family film I think it is more geared to adults, but Hugo is a very good film."
"SouthSideChgo","10","2","6","27 December 2011"," Best Cinematic Feature of 2011
","****CONTAINS NO SPOILERS**** SouthSide's faith in Hollywood was somewhat restored this afternoon when she saw Martin Scorsese's latest cinematic achievement delightfully titled - Hugo. This movie had everything she could ever want from a movie - a heartwarming story, romance, suspense, comedy, thrills and chills, a sense of wonderment and imagination and more - wrapped inside its nearly 3 hour running time. And if you're a vintage cinema aficionado like Scorsese, then you will very much appreciate the attention to cinematic detail from the vividness of Robert Richardson's cinematography to the Parisan period music of the 1930s as well as the homage to the early filmmakers and actors/actresses which include the works of Georges Melies within this movie's storyline.<br/><br/>Hugo, based on a book - The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, tells the story of an orphaned boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield in his most powerful role thus far in his young career since The Boy In The Striped Pajamas), an automaton, its inventive creator Georges Melies (Sir Ben Kingsley - fine performance for this character actor) and a mystery that connects them together. Since the tragic death of his father (cameo by Jude Law), Hugo has lived and worked in keeping the clock of a Paris train station running on time with his drunkard Uncle Claude (Ray Winestone). Yet he mostly spends his time stealing food to survive while avoiding the ever watchful eye of the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen, a light comedic but dramatic role specially tailored for him) who's always on the hunt for orphans like Hugo with his sidekick, a dog named Maxilliman. He also spends the other half of his time hiding inside the clock observing the people whose daily lives encompass the station itself. This reviewer enjoyed how Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan delicately interwove the minor plot sequences (such as the budding romance between Lisette the flower woman by Emily Mortimer and Station Inspector) without overshadowing or overwhelming the entire main story itself even though majority of the movie's plot does take place inside this one particular station. We also meet other colorful characters who lives are part of this station directly or indirectly - like Isabelle (Chloe Grace Mortez), George Melies and Madame Jeanne's goddaughter who lives for adventure but only through the books she reads from Monsieur Labrisse's (Christopher Lee) bookshop/library until taken to see her first cinematic feature by Hugo, the Parisan band that wonderfully provides the backdrop music for not only the train café but the entire movie itself and of course the mysterious Georges Melies who run a tiny toy shop where Hugo steals his gears and workings to fix the automaton safely hidden inside the clock tower. The automaton and the mystery surrounding it does bring all of the major and minor characters gradually closer together especially during the film's conclusion - SORRY NO SPOILER ON HOW IT ENDS.<br/><br/>This reviewer fell absolutely in love with Hugo. It's beautiful imagery ...the splendid view of Paris in the 1930s (especially at night when you see it run like a fast moving clock) ...the splendor or this train station as well as the detailed gears and workings of the clocks - everything was simply breathtaking. She enjoyed the touch of history about silent filmmaking and how the early filmmakers created and at times invented the tools for filmmaking (still used today though by computer) ...plus seeing the vintage classic clips by Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks Sr to silent war footage and the masterpiece itself - Georges Melies' The Trip To The Moon (ah, still a cinematic achievement in its own right after nearly 100 years). If there's a moral within this movie, then Scorsese has said it loud and clear - preserve and treasure our vintage movies for future generations to come. SouthSide highly advises that you sit through the ending credits to view the list of silent movies (including nearly 80 of Georges Melies' works) used for Hugo. Director Martin Scorsese has truly re-invented the movie-going experience for this reviewer ...she was delightfully entertained with the sense of that she had taken an extraordinary adventure. And with screenwriter John Logan, they both created a story full of imagination and wonderment for SouthSide instilling in her a deep appreciation for the early filmmakers, directors, actors/actresses and etc than before.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's music told a better story and left a far better memorable impression than the Reznor-Ross composition for The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Shore's music not only enhanced each scene but was also a character in itself throughout Hugo. You could say it was the only non-speaking silent character that vividly expressed the mood of a particular scene or enlightened the audience to dream along with Georges Melies while watching The Trip To The Moon. SouthSide cannot stop raving about Sacha Baron Cohen's role after seeing this movie. It was utterly amazing to see this actor in a serious/dramatic role instead of his outlandish over the top comedic stuff like Bruno and Borat. Though having a few comedic moments within Hugo (i.e. like when his leg brace would lock whenever approaching the fair Lisette), he wonderfully demonstrates a softer side to him in which this reviewer hopes to see more of. And Jude Law's and Asa Butterfield's characters during their short scenes together had this natural loving interaction as if they were truly father and son and not just playing one on the screen. The same could be said between Sir Ben Kingsley and Asa Butterfield during their screen time together. Also, try spotting Brian Selznick (not credited in the movie) for his cameo as well as other famous Paris residents like Salvador Dali (Ben Addis) and James Joyce (Robert Gill).<br/><br/>SouthSide highly recommends seeing this heartwarming Scorsese cinematic feature on the big screen before it hits the DVD/Blu-Ray sales. One of the VERY best of 2011."
"itzzarun","6","2","6","13 December 2011"," Great effects, but nothing special in the story.
","I shall try to keep this review as concise and short as possible.<br/><br/>1. The visual effects are simply stunning. Simply wonderful . I liked it more than i liked Avatar special effects. 2. The characters are complex and emotions are displayed wonderfully. 3. But... , the story is quite unconvincing, in fact i would say its disappointing. 4. Nothing really happens in the story, its the same pace right from beginning till the end. 5. There is no connection why the boy is so interested in the metal robot, or why the old man wasn't recognized even though he had directed so many movies. 6. The movie really failed to capture my attention. and the story really doesn't add up to make any sense.<br/><br/>Watch the movie for the special effects, but a fair warning that the pace is very slow. <br/><br/>All my starts are for the visual effects."
"peeedeee-94281","3","1","2","2 December 2019"," A Good Half-Movie
","I wanted to like Hugo when I saw it in theaters years ago, but was sorely disappointed. I remember thinking when watching the trailers that it was some CGI animated film. So when watching it, I was surprised it was live action lol
And that is a huge part of the problem I have with this movie. It is artificial and inauthentic, except for a very small part.
People talk about how amazing the visuals were. Yes, they were, when they were real. Otherwise, it was some of the weakest CGI I've seen on film.
And let's not even get into the humor or children's movie approach. Scorsese CANNOT make a humorous movie. Okay, some of his movies have had dark, humorous moments. But the comedy in Hugo is horrible, very amateurish. And he can't direct a Children's movie to save his life. Usually films like this need to have a sense of wonder, and you need to feel something for the kids. But this was really the weakest part of the film.
And what was with every French person speaking in a British accent? Really? This movie was set in Paris, not London.
The only good parts were the Georges Melies reminiscing parts. Those were well-done, and interesting. But that is only a fraction of the movie. Framing that around a children's story was a misfire for Scorsese.
Perhaps this should have been a good 1 hour TV drama? The extraneous stuff, like Sacha Baron Cohen's station security guard, and the relationships between the various workers in the station, could be left out. But most of all, Scorsese should not have used so much CGI. Horribly done, and really takes you out of the film."

Because of that, I could watch it.<br/><br/>For normal condition, I don't usually watch biography films as I find they are very boring and I don't interest in other people's lives. So, I always avoid them. But I watched this one anyway. Mostly because of Asa Butterfield. He's so cute and Chloe is also cute. I'm glad that I watch this one because this film is very different from some films that I watched.<br/><br/>What I love is that we could see the first film that was ever made. Seeing it, it makes me feel warm. 😁<br/><br/>All in all is that Hugo is one of the best films that I watched and I believe that this one is the very beginning of the film industry.

"cinephile-27690","10","1","2","22 April 2019"," Martin Scorsese....for kids!
","Attention parents: from the director of Taxi Driver, The Departed, Casino, Good-fellas,and even THE WOLF OF WALL STREET comes one of the most fascinating works of cinematic art for families!<br/><br/>On Quora, I have asked for input on my reviews, and some people think I give out too many 10s. I have explained in reviews that 10s are not the same to me. I don't think Citizen Kane and Billy Madison are equal, but both work in their respective genres-drama and mindless fun comedy.<br/><br/>I love Fargo and like Detmerius the Gladiators, but they both work for me so I give them both 10s. That's why Hugo is my 173rd 10/10 as of now, while 97 movies are less than a 10. I love movies, and my passion shines through with 10s.<br/><br/>They may not be perfect(let's be honest, there's really no such thing as a ""perfect"" movie, one man's trash is another man's treasure),but they are entertaining and work on a fair level for me, and I am willing to suggest them to others.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's Hugo, a movie he made at his wife's request so his daughter could see one of his movies, will explain much further explain my passion for movies.<br/><br/>It stars Asa Butterfield as Hugo, an orphan who lives in a clock tower and befriends a girl named Isabel(Chole Grace Moretz), whose grandfather was the first filmmaker, George Melies(Ben Kingsley). (He did not invent film, to be clear, but he was the first to tell stories with the medium.)<br/><br/>Hugo is also Marty's first movie to be shot in 3D and HOLY COW did that make this look so glamorous! This ranks up with My Fair Lady as a perfection in cinematography! I hope more movies are filmed in this 3D style, because it looks spectacular! I can't even describe it, you just have to see it for yourself!<br/><br/>Many complain that this is a family movie, and not like a regular Scorsese movie with excessive profanity, violence, and sometimes nudity(like Casino or The Wolf of Wall Street). If hundreds of F words is your idea of a good movie, I'm sorry, but you have no taste in film.<br/><br/>While some profane movies are great(Pulp Fiction, for instance), that's not what can MAKE a movie great. Citizen Kane never utters a curse word! Martin Scorsese has made other movies that are less intense as well, let us not forget that!(E.g.: The Last Temptation of Christ, Silence, The King of Comedy, and from what I've heard The Age Of Innocence).<br/><br/>And kid movies can be fantastic as well, haven't you heard of, I don't know: Willy Wonka, The Wizard of Oz, anything from Disney, The Yearling, ET, Home Alone, or The Sound of Music? And also, the director of ET directed Saving Private Ryan AND Schindler's List!<br/><br/>Even the director of Good-fellas can make a movie of such quality(And why not? He's MARTIN SCORSESE!), and he does it to perfection!<br/><br/>Hugo is one of the finest family movies ever made, and people of all ages should cherish it! Too bad The Wolf of Wall Street came next.(I'm sorry but I can't help but trash that one, I can't believe so many people find it enjoyable.)<br/><br/>May 29th 2019 addition: If you look at my old reviews, such as The Ten Commandments or Mommie Dearest, they are super short because I put my basic thoughts in and that's it. I have repaired that with some old ones, but I hope my love for movies is shown better now with my more in-depth reviews now, and I intend to improve more in the future. Please look at my old reviews and see my (hopefully apparent) progress!"

"samuellickiss","9","1","2","22 December 2018"," There are a lot of cynical reviews here, because this is a truly lovely film
","Hugo is an odd film. It's a children's film directed by the same talent that brought us the very non-child friendly The Wolf of Wall Street, Gangs of New York and Goodfellas (among others).<br/><br/>It's a film that, on the surface, appears to be a fantasy adventure, but in reality is a mystery drama. A lot of people were sorely disappointed by this, but this isn't the film's fault. We can blame the marketing department here, because the trailers and PR more generally made it look like a very different film.<br/><br/>This is a children's film about the history of cinema, not exactly the most child-friendly of topics, but my goodness is Hugo beautifully made. It's hard to articulate the appeal, because so many children and family films feel the need to stuff themselves full of fart jokes and action - you'll find none of this in Hugo.<br/><br/>Instead, you'll see a lovingly recreated Paris train station with a steampunk aesthetic (but not overdone). The attention to detail is extraordinary. It's packed filled with references to classic cinema that adults will appreciate, and captivating performances. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Moretz are fantastic leads here and are supported by a capable host of well-known actors, including the eminent Ben Kingsley.<br/><br/>At its heart, Hugo is simply a heart-warming story with a beautiful script and sophisticated direction. You do not need to be a film buff to enjoy it, but I would hope filmgoers (adults and children) leave with an appreciation of the silent era and cinematic heritage - it's unique charm and magic.<br/><br/>It's a niche-interest film to be sure, and if you or your children need fart jokes and explosions to enjoy a film then you'll be dissatisfied, but I saw Hugo with my niece and nephew and they were enchanted throughout. So much so, that we ended up watching A Trip to the Moon when we got home.<br/><br/>I've knocked a start off because I felt Sasha Baron-Cohen's character was in poor taste. He's largely relegated to comic relief, and while he does get his own character arc, there was something a little off about making humour out of a disabled war veteran's struggles (and what is implied to be PTSD).<br/><br/>Perhaps Hugo was just too unusual and unexpected to do well at the box office. Perhaps the subject matter was too adult and mature for a film aimed at children. I disagree. There's something in Hugo for everyone."

","1930s Paris: A movie so engaging that revolves around the magical premise of connecting with a loved one who has died, but imparted part of their soul in a lifeless, mechanical puppet. The characters feel like they have been living on the canvas of a Antoine Blanchard (Marcel Masson) painting. Rich scenery that immerses us in a world of 30s Paris replete with coal, the cosmopolitan hub of a train station, the wonder and mystery of silent movie-making (yes movie making), and the untold story of people we take for granted everyday in our daily lives. This is as close to a perfect movie as it comes. This movie actually reminds me of the movie Dunkirk. The lost craft of movie-making and the simplicity of motion pictures is revelled making the story more capable of connecting with its characters without fantastical CGI or the aid of gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>This is also incomparably Scorsese's best movie."
"christophershobris","10","1","2","16 August 2017"," Beautiful Job by Scorsese
","A true masterpiece by a master filmmaker, Martin Scorsese. By far this the best film I've seen from him. And that's saying a lot considering I've seen Wolf of Wall Street, The Departed, and The Aviator. What makes this work for me? The performances, the visual effects, and the story. Firstly, the master actor Ben Kingsley was the perfect choice to play Georges Melies as a defeated and broken man. Asa Butterfield proves to be the best child actor working today, he gives a very mature performance that I think Kingsley would approve of. Chloe Grace Moretz was more than just a typical love interest, but has a complex situation with her grandfather. The visual effects are astounding. The story I love most of all, it respectively pays tribute to the birth of cinema while also telling a touching, complex story. Overall, the film is very satisfying in all the right ways. The only negative I'd have to say is not much, I struggle to think of any gripes. So go see it, its worth a look."

","'Hugo' obviously isn't a traditional Scorsese experience, bereft of any tones from Goodfellas or Casino. Scorsese is poetically breaking new ground, directing his first 3D film about the man who effectively invented special effects. In a sense, the film is reflective of Scorsese's childhood and life as a filmmaker with the story being told through the eyes of a child tinkering with his toys, trying to obtain something special - the immediate parallel that comes to mind is Scorsese discovering 3D, and making this movie. 'Hugo' is how a family film should be made, albeit some minor miscasts and perhaps the first half suffered from slow pacing, it has both the imagination and visual stimulation for children with a simple yet layered story told through sympathetic characters and quirky gags. Also appealing to the adult audience with its complex themes, and references to cinema particularly in the second half whereby most people will enjoy the utter ingenuity in the film."

"gthombos","5","1","2","27 January 2017"," Spielsese or Scorberg?
","Hugo is directed by either Spielberg or Scorsese. I think it's Scorsese, but it felt like Spielberg. The film even had some John Williams-style BIG music, composed by Canadian Howard Shore. Yeah, that's right, the Canadian saxophone player from the Canadian band Lighthouse! (I had to get in some Canadian content there)<br/><br/>This fantasy is about a boy who lives in the walls of a Paris train station. Not since The Legend of 1900 have I heard of anything this screwy. Inside these walls are the guts of the station's clocks. The guts consist of cogs, gears, counterweights, pinions, springs, and - inexplicably - steam.<br/><br/>During the course of the film, we learn that Hugo is the dude that built C3PO (or some C3PO prototype). C3PO reveals to Hugo that the local old grump (played by Ben Kingsley) is in fact a forerunner to movie wizards like Spielsese or Scorberg.<br/><br/>Anyway, I saw this movie in regular old boring 2D at a local theatre which hasn't changed much since its days as a Nickelodeon. I didn't realize it was a 3D film until the scene where some pages with drawings go flying from the kids' hands and drift all over the screen. At first I was thinking, ""What the hell is this all about? Am I supposed to be mesmerized by fluttering stationery?"" Then I realized that this was intended to be seen in super-duper 3D. ""Ahh,"" I thought, ""Now I see. Ooooh, that would have been so cool to see all that paper flying around in 3D."" We haven't witnessed anything like this in cinematic history since the famous bolo-bat scene in the 1953 film House of Wax.<br/><br/>Hugo does a lot of hiding and running, primarily from a train station cop played by Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen's character is an amalgam of Inspectors Javert and Clouseau. He and his trusty Doberman Pinscher cannot seem to track down the elusive boy who knows the station and its walls like the inner workings of an automaton. During one climactic scene, Hugo gives the Inspector the slip by doing a Harold Lloyd impression from a clock tower.<br/><br/>Once the Inspector catches up with Hugo, they have a talk. During the conversation, the little urchin makes the Inspector laugh. The Inspector tells him that he's funny. Hugo then says, ""I'm funny how? I mean funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh, I'm here to ******' amuse you? What do you mean funny? Funny how? How am I funny? What the **** is so funny about me? Tell me, tell me what's funny!""<br/><br/>Wait a minute. I might me confused. That dialog might be from a different movie - a real Scorcese film."

For the next half hour, I became a bit bored, but still hoped for a satisfying payoff. When it finally came, I was massively disappointed. Maybe I missed something. But I'm pretty sure I didn't. I realize I'm in the minority of people who seriously dislike this movie, but I just don't understand what's so great about it. I gave it 4 stars due to gorgeous sets and cinematography, and pretty damn good acting. Too bad these potentially interesting characters had an immensely uninteresting story to work with. If you're not familiar with the plot, it centers around a boy who lives in and around a train station, set in days past, who dodges various surly types (Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen), while trying to unlock a mystery involving an automaton left behind by his deceased father.

","I was expecting to be a little enchanted. It just didn't seem plausible the whole thing could be based on this man's horror at having ended up a failure. The obstacles seemed manufactured. Why couldn't he have just told the man he got the book from his father, and it was all he had left of him? Why couldn't he have just told the guard he was keeping the clock running? There seems to be more truth behind this story than with even many historical movies – at least the sci-fi film part. And I don't think I would call it Steampunk; everything that happened seemed to be in keeping with the time period. The acting didn't thrill me, either. A lot of sustained shots of people's faces quivering. which is hard. The station and camera work were pretty."

","Hugo is visually stunning piece, even for someone like me, who has no stereopsis and therefore can't appreciate the 3D effects.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it's one people either love or hate. I fall into the former camp: it's a film I can watch over again, each time being drawn into the dark yet fairytale fantasy of Hugo's world. Asa Butterfield is perfect in the pivotal role, portraying a contrasting depth of naive wonder and knowing street-wisdom that haunts me long after the final credits have rolled. Ably supported by Chloë Grace Moretz under Scorsese's skillful direction, the pair put the schmaltz of the Harry Potter flicks to shame. True magic.<br/><br/>But they are decidedly Harry and Hermione for grownups. There's nothing supernatural here and, despite much talk of adventure, it's true that not a lot actually happens story-wise. This boy wizard's talents are rooted in the mundane art of clockwork and Voldemort is a peg-legged station inspector (with an excellent low-key performance from the wonderful Sacha Baron Cohen). Some more discerning older teens might enjoy it, but this is not stuff for the kiddies.<br/><br/>If you love cinema and enjoy movies that rely on visuals and symbolism rather than fast-paced action, then this is a film for you. It's a masterpiece that I believe will stand the test of time and come to be regarded as a classic by film historians of the future."

"eyc-74643","4","1","2","1 June 2015"," NOT a fantastical imaginative adventure film
","The trailers and the wonderful cartoon-like shots of the city of Paris may have misled you into thinking this film would be a children's magical adventure-type film. The film is not that at all. This film should be called ""Why is everybody so cruel to Hugo?"" This poor orphaned boy who's drunk uncle forces him to abandon school and work the clocks of a train station in Paris is all alone in the world except for a mysterious automaton that he and his father were rebuilding until his father's untimely death in a freak fire at the museum where he moonlighted. He and his father were clockmakers, so presumably they could fix the abandoned automaton, a machine of such complexity that it could write. However there were several missing parts and also a heart-shaped hole where obviously a key fits nicely into. Of course the drunk uncle also abandons Hugo, so this 9-ish year old kid lives by himself in the clock towers, running the clocks, stealing food, and stealing little parts from the old man who runs the toy shop (Ben Kingsley). He gets caught trying to steal a wind-up mouse when Papa Georges (BK) catches him and basically manhandles him until Hugo gives up his life's possessions kept in his coat pockets- some tiny clock parts and a notebook of the automaton drawn by Hugo's dad. Papa Georges gets all weird about the notebook and keeps it, even though it's one of Hugo's prized possessions from his late father. The kid is obviously distressed, and you figure there is a reason for Papa Georges' overreaction to a drawing, but the actual reason is NOT REASON ENOUGH. So then the kid meets Chloe Grace Moretz, the godchild of Papa George and the two embark on an 'adventure' to find the meaning behind the automaton. They must recover the notebook in order the fix the automaton which will reveal the hidden message left by Hugo's late father. However they don't recover the notebook and Hugo fixes it anyway, and CGM's character happens to have the heart-shaped key which fits perfectly into the heart-shaped hole which gets the automaton moving and it draws a picture of a scene from a film. The ""secret"" message is that the film was the first film Hugo's dad ever saw, and they used to go watch movies together. Not the most heart-warming message from beyond... this was obviously not a secret message from the father. It turns out that Papa Georges was that filmmaker and he was so upset with Hugo from stirring up failed memories of his film career. Also Papa Georges was a magician. Also Papa Georges built the automaton, so he's also a master robot builder. But he was really upset that his film studio crashed, so even though Hugo had no idea wth was going on, Papa Georges yells at him ""this is how you repay me?"" Look, old man- there are a lot of emotions stirred up, the kid is curious, digs up some old pictures, he has no idea wtf is going on, and you cruelly kick him out with basically no information even though he thinks you hold the key to some small bit of information about his dead father? Anyway it all turns out okay because some crazy movie buff who is a huge fan of George Melies (aka Papa Georges) happens to have the only one of hundreds of films that Papa Georges had made back in the day before he had sold or destroyed the rest of his movie things. They set up a surprise screening at Papa George's house, where the wife at first is also really mean because she wants to spare Papa Georges' hurt feelings, but then allows them to show the film and gets super happy and into it because she used to be the star actress and it's bringing back nice memories. Anyway Papa Georges wakes up and sees the end of his movie and all of a sudden is talked into forgiving Hugo for drudging up bad memories of his failed movie career and acknowledges his failure and starts talking about the automaton. Hugo, being the super kind kid that he is, immediately runs back to his ""house"" to retrieve the automaton but is caught by the crippled Station Inspector (Sacha Baren Cohen) who really really hates orphans for some reason and they run around and Hugo hangs off the minute hand of a clock (!) and also jumps into the train tracks to save the automaton. The Station Inspector saves him from an oncoming train and says almost kindly ""what were you thinking?"" Well obviously he's trying to get away from you, you giant man who's been chasing this kid all over the train station with your snarling Doberman. Anyway, Papa Georges comes just in time to ""claim"" Hugo, which means adopt in 1900 Paris. Then there is a big revival of George Melies films where the crazy film buff somehow procures several films thought to be lost or destroyed. Papa Georges is so happy and credits Hugo for fixing the automaton and getting the ball rolling. Everyone is happy. Except for me. So where is the magic? What is the message from the dead father? Don't say that it's ""Hugo finds a family!"" because that's crazy. Those people were mean and awful to that poor orphan and all of a sudden they adopt him? I think I'm mostly disappointed that this film didn't live up to the magical adventure hype the trailers seemed to promise. I finished the movie thinking ""that poor kid,"" all the way to the end. Also, how does he shower and brush his teeth? The cinematography is amazing, and the film wins Oscars for cinematography and visual effects, and the actors are pretty great, just the story falls short for me."
"jonah-marchanlart","6","1","2","23 February 2015"," Interesting...
","In all honesty, I wish they never made this movie. Hugo is such a good book, that no movie could compare with it. If you think of it separately from the book, you will very likely enjoy this movie a lot more. Another problem is that most of the book takes place in Hugo mind, which can be hard to portray in a movie.<br/><br/>The movie of Hugo does not have as much depth as the original book, but it definitely had some. The special effects were great. Hugo is such a hard book to turn into a movie, and although it wasn't spectacular, they made it into a pretty good movie that is interesting to watch. Over all i give this film a 7 out of 10. The acting was passable. Asa butterfield was the best i've ever seen him, however i wan not impressed with chloe grace moretz."

","In 1931, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in Paris with his father, a widowed, but kind and devoted master clockmaker. Hugo's father takes him to see films and loves those of Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) best of all.<br/><br/>It is no secret that Scorsese loves film. As a director, you have to, but some just go above and beyond devouring every aspect of it. Scorsese is one of those, and this is his love letter to cinema, harking all the way back to its beginnings with Georges Melies.<br/><br/>The cast is incredible, with Chloe Moretz, Ben Kingsley and Sacha Baron Cohen. Heck, we even have Ray Winstone and Jude Law. Quite a lineup.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars saying ""Hugo is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life.

"williampsamuel","8","1","2","7 December 2014"," A magical tale from a master director
","It's not often that a film manages to appeal to the twin demographics of children and film buffs. And yet this is exactly what Hugo does. Nor would you normally use words like 'innocent' and 'magical' to describe one of the works of Martin Scorsese, of Taxi Driver and Goodfellows fame. And yet these are the words that best describe it. For as crazy as the very idea of Scorsese making a children's movie may seem, he has created one of the most magical and innocent in years. And in doing so he has also written a heartfelt lover letter to cinema itself.<br/><br/>Hugo, the title character, has lived within the walls of Paris's largest train station, stealing food and spare parts and winding the clocks since being orphaned years before. His only link to his father is a mysterious humanoid automaton that he has spent years trying to repair. But when he befriends ---, the daughter of a elderly toymaker, they discover that her father is none other than legendary silent film director George Melies*. And in his quest to uncover the old man's secret and remind him of his purpose, Hugo may find a place and a purpose of his own.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed about this film was its childlike, old fashioned innocence and curiosity. There is no language, crude humor, or double ententes. Despite being an orphan and a thief, Hugo is unfailingly polite and displays none of the jaded cynicism one might expect. His status as an orphan may be a reason for sympathy, occasionally pity, but the movie doesn't allow itself to dwell on his misfortunes. The only maudlin touch is that if he's caught by the bumbling, child hating station master (played by Sacha Baron Cohan of Borat fame) he'll be sent to the dreaded orphanage, where he'll presumably have to scrub floors and live a hard knocks life. Sorry, I couldn't resist.<br/><br/>And everything that he and *what's her name* do has the air of a grand quest about it. As they climb through the innards of massive clocks, dodge the inspector, and sneak past her godfather, you can't help but smile at their wide eyed curiosity and sense of adventure. Even something as simple as meeting an elderly bookseller feels like something special, especially for those old enough to recognize him. And when the automaton is repaired and carries out the task for which it was built, things start to become truly magical as the story delves into the director's first love- film.<br/><br/>Our protagonists, and by extension the audience, delve into the history of motion pictures beginning with the *Lumiere* brothers first showing of Train Arriving at the Station. Then come firsthand accounts of Melies's exploits, of the hundreds of silent films he produced, directed, and starred in. Adults, even those familiar with the subject, will likely find much they didn't know. And children will be delighted by the bright colors and strange costumes, the mermaids, aliens, and knights. And best of all is the actual footage from Melies's films. They may not have the same impact now as when they were first released, but they still hold a captivating whimsy and otherworldliness.<br/><br/>Hugo is indeed a magical and powerful film. In telling the story of one orphan boy, it explores the power of human dreams and imagination, our need for purpose, and the origins of the medium through which it is told. Few grown up films go so deeply into so many themes, and for a children's film to do so is simply astounding. This is one movie that I highly recommend to viewers of all ages."

","Hugo is a great film with potential. Personally its one of my favourite films, I could watch it over and over. The main reason of why this film is good is because of its technology like the visual effects, cinematography, art direction, etc, and a really good story. I think its message is the best part of it. Martin Scorsese gives you the image to open your imagination with this adventure, go out, escape and discover new things and to not be afraid. The characters like Hugo and Isabelle act strongly and they show courage. <br/><br/>This film tells an amazing story about life, imagination and people who have left a mark like Georges Melies and his films. I strongly recommend this film to everyone!"
"GeoPierpont","4","1","2","1 October 2014"," Fantastic for Five Minutes!
","I decided to watch this for several reasons: Jude Law, Martin Scorcese, Sir Ben, and superlative reviews. At onset, I had great enthusiasm with the opening scene phasing into reality with sumptuous visuals and engaging, intricate set composition. This led me to believe wondrous adventure lies beneath, ala Harry Potter style. However, after a very short time, I was supremely disappointed in the plot, acting, and dialogue. Being long on patience for exposition, there was limited reward at film's end.<br/><br/>I actually fell asleep waiting for something interesting to happen. If only the Automaton could liven up more than once, I would have been pleased. Literally too much smoke and mirrors to my great annoyance.<br/><br/>Cohen's performance, a Peter Sellers wannabe, was exceedingly bad. Marty typically hires phenomenal talent, but this hack was the height of horror, scene after scene. Disheartening when I recall the very first home made Scorcese movie and loved even that simple effort.<br/><br/>I could not fathom a child being able to sit through this drivel although I found the history of film fascinating. This was the only redeeming feature of this effort which piqued my interest. I recently viewed a documentary on the debate of digital vs celluloid and appreciated Marty's input as very thoughtful and honest. It is unclear if that production was filmed prior to this project, but I highly recommend that he stick with his previous formula which has satisfied billions to date.<br/><br/>High recommend for introduction of pioneer George Melies' films, rich visual context, and to complete the catalog of Scorcese projects."

"EUyeshima","7","1","2","18 March 2012"," A Tribute to Scorsese's Cinematic Virtuosity Despite Clear Flaws
","If a movie was judged solely by its cinematic dazzle and sheer appreciation of the wonders of the medium, then Martin Scorsese's virtuosic 2011 adventure drama should have taken home the Best Picture Oscar hands down. However, there is something overly meticulous and dramatically inert in the execution that somehow makes the film miss its mark for me emotionally. As much as I admired all the technical achievements presented here, I felt a bit of a chill when it came to the emotional elements. Adapted by John Logan (""The Aviator"") from Brian Selznick's historic fiction novel, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" (2007), the fanciful story centers on Hugo, a twelve-year-old urchin who lives within the walls of Paris' Gare Montparnasse railway station in 1931. His father was a master clockmaker who took Hugo to see the early films of cinematic pioneer Georges Méliès (1902's ""A Trip to the Moon) and was working on his most ambitious project, repairing a mechanical robot who could write with a pen, when he died suddenly in a fire.<br/><br/>Hugo is taken away by his drunkard uncle, who took care of the main railway clock until he disappeared one night. All the while, the boy obsesses over finishing his father's project by pilfering gears and other parts he finds in the station toy shop run by none other than Méliès who has fallen on hard times. Now an embittered man, he take's Hugo's prized notebook with all his father's notes and threatens to burn it as punishment. However, Méliès decides to let the boy earn back the parts he stole by working in the shop. Hugo also meets Méliès' precocious goddaughter, an orphan named Isabelle who is a bit older than him. They bond immediately with he taking her to the movies for the first time and she leading him to the key that unlocks the mechanical man's programmed capabilities. Through quite a few convolutions in the plot, including an elaborate dream sequence, the connection between Méliès and his earlier groundbreaking work is finally recognized and celebrated.<br/><br/>Finally back in a top-grade production, Ben Kingsley plays the gruff and mysterious filmmaker-turned-toyshop owner with the ideal mix of austerity and frustration. Chloë Grace Moretz (""Kick-Ass"") is also winning and immensely likable as Isabelle. The same can't be quite said about Asa Butterfield's (""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"") sullen performance in the title role. The young actor has the immense weight of the story on his shoulders, but he doesn't provide enough conviction to gravitate the heart to Hugo's plight. The most problematic performance is Sacha Baron Cohen's (""Borat"") slapstick-driven turn as the station inspector. It's not so much the stunt-casting aspect as it is the anomalous approach he takes in making the character strangely menacing with little redeeming value. Much smaller roles are taken by Jude Law as Hugo's father and Emily Mortimer as a flower girl. Scorsese's visual team has done near-flawless work here, starting with production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Robert Richardson, both of whom bring 1930's Paris to vivid life with exacting detail and burnished brushstrokes."

The movie could improve that, but... the only thing right it made was the station inspector that added fun moments while being really fearful to hugo I also did'nt like the acting (Kingsley was good, of course), the editing and the special effects.

"dany_n85","6","1","2","19 February 2012"," An adventure,or not an adventure
","Inadvertent presented as a children's adventure before it was released, also the book itself, all in all gave me a lot of expectations from this movie, and were all contributing to what should have been a great adventure, which is exactly what Isabelle(Chloe Grace Moretz) says and hopes when she first encounters the mysterious and secretive Hugo(Asa Butterfield). But that never happens,the movie has a very slow tempo that never seems to find its pace,and while the two children give very good performances, by the end of it I was left wondering why wasn't I more caring of them.<br/><br/>One of the positives is for certain the cinematography and visual effects,which give splashes across the screen with elegant, visually vibrant flair. Also the way Paris is being portrayed, the view from clock tower from were Hugo stands is quite breathtaking, he train station itself, and the costumes are all Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>This could have been a charming children's movie, that instead of taking more of a spiritual approach,and trying to connect the viewer with the characters, is leaning towards being more of a tribute to the early history of cinema and to one of the movies's key pioneers,the great Georges Melies, performed superbly by Ben Kingsley. This doesn't mean Scorsese has taken the wrong route, just that it could have crafted a better use of the story.<br/><br/>The performances are very good, standing out are Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse who are at their best. Also Sacha Baron Cohen who gives a more comical approach to his character shows that he has some acting skills instead of doing dull movies.<br/><br/>""Films have the power to capture dreams"", Georges Melies says, one thing that this movie fails to do, at least in a more soulful way, not just visually, and instead of trying to do just that, Scorsese pays too much homage to Melies, instead of making use of his citation."
"evanston_dad","7","1","2","20 January 2012"," Can't Argue with Its Message, Even If I Didn't Warm Much to the Movie
","Martin Scorsese takes a stab at making a film children can enjoy, and the results are.....mixed.<br/><br/>If the entire film had been as enchanting as the first five minutes, ""Hugo"" would really have been something special. As it is, it's infused with a love of cinema, and particularly the joy to be found in discovering and preserving the history of the art form. And for that reason alone, I, an avid movie buff myself, am thrilled that this film exists. However, I didn't find myself warming to it all that much in any other regard. It's a bit slow and one-note -- the loneliness of Hugo, the little boy at the film's center, is brought home adequately within the film's first fifteen minutes, but it's another hour or so of movie before the plot progresses past that. Frankly, it's a bit grueling to watch a little boy missing his dead father for an hour. Once the meat of the film begins to develop, and Hugo and his friend discover that they are in the company of none other than film pioneer Geroges Melie (played by Ben Kingsley), the love of cinema comes practically pouring off of the screen and things improve somewhat.<br/><br/>Still, there is a lot of business involving Sacha Baron Cohen and other denizens of the train station in which Hugo lives and which serves as the film's principal setting that is tiresome. Cohen plays his character like he's a villain from an animated Disney movie, which is completely incongruous with the rest of the film, and wonderful actors like Emily Mortimer, Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour are introduced only to torment us with the fact that they are given barely any screen time and nothing to do with the time they're given.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" looks lovely, and if you're going to see a 3-D movie this would be the one. But I've decided I could do without 3-D. The technology supposedly brings a heightened level of realism to the film-going experience, but I always find that it does just the opposite; things looks unnatural and awkwardly placed in relation to one another.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"falettiwdc","10","1","2","24 December 2011"," Challenging theology
","Martin Scorsese does 2 important things in this movie. First, he moves the use of 3D forward by integrating it more fully into the film than any previous film I have seen. He does not use it for cheap theatrics, he merely renders in 3D scenes that would be perceived as 3D in real life. We will see more filmmakers following his lead, and movies will be forever changed by it (like the shift from black-and-white to color).<br/><br/>Second, he gives voice to an important point of theology. Theology addresses a few core issues: Who am I? Why am I here? How shall I live? The character Hugo expresses a clear understanding that all of us are here for a purpose -- that every one of us has a reason for living. He develops this from his understanding that every machine has a purpose -- something it was intended to do -- and he extends it to humans. This is an important insight worth our being reminded of.<br/><br/>The film then takes it a step further, arguing that just as a machine can be broken and become unable to fulfill its purpose, we humans too can become broken and unable to fulfill our purpose. Some of us, like Hugo, have as OUR purpose to be fixers -- to help others to be mended so that they can again fulfill their purpose in life. Again, this is deep theology and well worth pondering. It challenges us to be fixers and/or to be willing to be fixed so that we and the people we go through life with can fulfill our God-given purpose. Yet the message is delivered very subtly -- you are not clubbed over the head with it.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the film is also entertaining (at least for adults), has excellent production values, etc., etc. All in all, a great film."

Mama Jeanne however, is a quiet enabler, allowed to do her best acting with facial expressions mostly. i wanted more, and i believe the movie would have benefited from it. thirdly, the story, while being predominantly Hugo's story, is enhanced by supporting stories of other lonely people such as the inspector, the flower girl, the caf'e's owner... all want love, most still have hope. some develop as predictably as sunrise followed by a sunset. others develop with charm and warmth that add great value to the story. i wish they were ALL treated with the same sensitivity and insight demonstrated for the few. last, some characters are too flat, with an implied hint of depth, that is not delivered on. such is Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse, the bookshop owner. we know there's more, but it's not there. so a good solid 7 - GO of course. GO!"

","This is a good film, as demonstrated by many of the reviews below. But it could have been great. The imagery, core story and 3D features are very well done. But watching the film, I kept getting annoyed by the constant clichés and odd plot choices.<br/><br/>For instances, why in a French setting are most of the actors English and American? The constant mix of accents is annoying. There is even a scene where they are reading a French book, but in English.<br/><br/>There is the drunk uncle, innocent flower girl, mean inspector, odd romance between two completely superfluous characters in the train station. So many of these characters and their roles seemed like add-ons at best.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish they had cast another kid in the lead role. I didn't find the choice to be particularly believable or interesting. I still give this film a 7/10, which tells you how good are some of the other elements, but it could have been a great film."

","After the deaths of his father and uncle, a little boy lives inside a big clock in a train station in 1930s Paris. In this visually opulent film, Scorsese pays homage to early cinema, but it's a case of all dressed up with nowhere to go. It lacks the script to make a compelling narrative out of the basic premise and it goes on much too long. The story of the automaton that the boy's father left to him is supposed to be touching, but it becomes dreary. There are too many shots of the machinery behind the clock. The subplot involving Cohen is supposed to be funny but comes across as lame. Kingsley is pretty good. It's good to see Lee still acting. Mortimer is wasted in a meaningless role."
"3xHCCH","3","3","14","25 January 2012"," This Movie Never Came Alive For Me!
","By this time I had already watched 6 out of the 9 nominees for Oscar Best Picture announced yesterday. ""Hugo"" earned 11 nominations. It has also been named Best Picture of the year by several critics. Martin Scorsese won Best Director in the Golden Globe and other critics awards. <br/><br/>When I saw the robot boy in the trailer, I must admit I already had a bad feeling about this film. However, how could all of these awards and critics be wrong? I should have trusted my instincts! Despite all the awards hype and the promise of ""magic"" by the trailer, this movie never really came alive for me. From the overlong introduction of the orphan Hugo and his life inside the clockworks of the train station to the Scrooge-like character of Ben Kingsley and the annoying station guard character of Sasha Baron Cohen, I found it all a desperate exercise in tedium disguised by ""beautiful"" images and ""special"" effects. All this ""beauty"" were merely of technical or mechanical nature only. For me, there was nothing really heart-warming or inspirational worth identifying with here.<br/><br/>When it came to the climax when the ""fabulous"" secret was revealed, it is of a nature that would appeal and mean something only to a very limited segment of the audience. It is not by any degree magical to me, as this whole film would build it up to be. And I would consider myself a film lover! It was simply a very big disappointment because of the big build-up it had and the expectations it came with. I do not really know how a meandering script like this could even be nominated for Best Writing. I do not think Martin Scorsese is really cut out to make films like this one. His first foray into a film for children is not really interesting for children. I do not expect you to take my word for it, but I do not really recommend this film, despite the accolades it carries with it. It is the worst of the 7 Oscar Best Pic-nominated films I have seen."

","This was a beautiful wrapper with absolutely nothing inside it. I'll give ""Hugo"" this: it's breathtakingly beautiful. Best cinematography, no doubt about this. All the mechanical parts rotating and clicking, views of Paris in winter and the marvelous clocks are spectacular. So is the train-station. However, you can enjoy this beauty for the first 20 minutes and then it gets repetitive, whereas the plot falls apart and never gets back together. So you can turn it off after the 15-20 minutes and you won't miss anything. The trailer for Hugo has to be the most misleading trailer ever made. All the action scenes are in it, all the dull and bizarre rigmarole (which takes the other 140 minutes) is left out. The automaton which you can see in the trailer and expect to be crucial in the plot actually plays only a minor role in the whole thing. If you think that the movie is about finding Hugo's father or his secrets, you're also wrong. That would have been exciting. Scorcese's solution is anything but. Oh, and the trailer had fantastic 30 Seconds to Mars music, why was it not in the movie? On second thoughts, it's fine. 30 Seconds to Mars do not need to play their songs for such humdrum 'masterpieces'. If you haven't seen it, don't bother."
"dharmendrasingh","6","2","9","8 December 2011"," Scorsese's Love Letter
","Martin Scorsese has never, and will never, make a bad film. The worst you could say of his filmography is that some are masterpieces while the rest are merely satisfactory. Having said that, 'Hugo', his first foray into the world of three dimensions, is nothing we haven't seen before by any lesser director. <br/><br/>It's being put about that 'Hugo' is some kind of magical adventure story, full of intrigue and excitement, perfect for children over the festive period. It isn't. It's not even a kids' film. It's actually Scorsese's love letter to film and nothing more. The things we have come to the maestro with – film preservation, explicating the possibility of cinema – are so embedded in the story that anything Hugo and co. say or do is rendered irrelevant. Film itself becomes the adventure.<br/><br/>Using Brian Selznick's story, 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret', Scorsese presents us with a character – the famed Georges Méliès, pioneer of early cinema, maker of more than five hundred shorts – who could easily be Scorsese himself.<br/><br/>Selznick's story is about an orphaned boy named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who is made to work in a Parisian train station after his clockmaker father (Jude Law) dies in a fire. Hugo's drunkard uncle (Ray Winstone), the station's clock operator, becomes his guardian. The uncle goes off to drink while Hugo stays in the walls of the station, clandestinely keeping the clocks working.<br/><br/>Hugo's father died unable to finish fixing an automaton. Completing this project becomes Hugo's mission. In the film, as in the book and in real life, Méliès (Ben Kingsley) lives the last part of his life bitter and depressed as a toy merchant in the train station. His path crosses Hugo's and the two establish themselves as mutual foes. Hugo finds a friend (his only) in Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), goddaughter to Méliès. The two of them set about completing the automaton, to find out what secrets it may hold. Without revealing the plot, the automaton is the thing which brings us back to Méliès.<br/><br/>Although the story is set in Paris (we know this because we see the Eiffel tower every time we're outside), we hear only English voices. Some of the supporting actors seem nothing more than set decoration; I'm not sure why they're there. There's the standard of computer graphics we've come to expect, but youngsters will want more than aerial images of an apocryphal Paris. (I would have asked a youngster what they thought, but everyone in the audience, without exception, was an adult.) <br/><br/>You shouldn't be too tough on kids; they've got adulthood for criticism, but Butterfield is not up to the task of leading a Scorsese picture. The same goes for Moretz (who was terrific in 'Let Me In'). Sacha Baron Cohen is inconsistently funny as the merciless train station inspector hell-bent on capturing and sending Hugo to an orphanage. You can't blame the man. He's created some of the funniest characters of all time, so it's only downhill from now on, I'm afraid. The only sequences which are interesting, if not special, are the montage sequences of film footage from days gone by. <br/><br/>Scorsese isn't just good for giving us gangster flicks; of course he's not. He made 'The King of Comedy', 'Taxi Driver', and 'The Last Temptation of Christ'. Not one of them featured a single Italian (except De Niro), let alone a mobster. All I'm saying is there's a reason why we all want to him to keep it gangster.<br/><br/>www.moseleyb13.com"

","Hugo was one of those cinematic experiences I occasionally have in which I feel a need to pen a letter of apology once it was finished. As a young cinephile just getting my feet wet in film, I did what I thought we all were supposed to do; worship at the altar of Martin Scorsese. During my second Film Studies class, I struck a deal with my professor where he let me complete a career retrospective in place of making a short film for my final project. I was thrilled that my professor agreed to this deal, as writing a 60-page paper seemed like less of a daunting undertaking than operating a camera. I knew I was going to pick Martin Scorsese before I knew if my professor was going to let this happen or not. With his help, I watched every film Scorsese ever made from Who's That Knocking at My Door to Shutter Island. Not only did I see all of his full-length features but I also saw a great deal of his shorts and documentaries. It was supposed to be a cathartic experience of me getting as close as possible to the director I loved until it wasn't. That's not to say I didn't enjoy and appreciate many of Scorsese's films--I did, but I also learned that his enormous contribution to cinema didn't necessitate him being my favorite director. It's unfortunate that this project was one year too early to have Hugo included because once this project was complete, I tended to shy away from Scorsese films that came after, for a spell anyway. I missed seeing Hugo in the theatre, how could I have known I would have loved it so much and it would have been about one of my favorite cinematic subjects? Georges Méliès was one of my first cinematic idols, and he remains one today, as I am finally completely healed from my tattoo immortalizing his iconic image of the moon with a rocket that landed on its eye. I even attempted my own version of a shot-by-shot re-imagining of A Trip to the Moon, achieved by painting 146 individual canvas screens photographed to appear as though they move; an intensive labor of love that has never seen the light of day. Georges Méliès life being portrayed on screen would have been enough to get me to a theatre had I not been in such a Scorsese burn-out that I never even bothered to read what his 2011 film was about when Hugo hit theatres. Starring Ben Kingsley, Asa Butterfield, and Chloë Grace Moretz, Hugo is a brilliant spectacle that would make even the most devout skeptic believe in magic.<br/><br/>Based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, Hugo follows an orphan boy who lives in the clock mechanism of the train station keeping the train clocks running so he can have a place to live undetected avoiding the orphanage. Still reeling from the death of his father, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) painstakingly works to repair an automaton (mechanical man) that his father instructed would only be complete with a unique key. Once Hugo finds the key, he will know what secret it contains and retrieves the last message his father sent him. While attempting to find the key, Hugo crosses paths with a shop owner Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) who believes him to be a thief. When Hugo meets Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who is always looking for an adventure, Hugo learns that their paths were destined to cross in ways he could have never imagined.<br/><br/>Hugo is one of the most beautiful films to look at that I have ever seen. Scorsese's outpouring of love to classic cinema and film preservation couldn't have tugged any harder on my heart strings if that had been the intention. Every single shot is gorgeous, capturing Scorsese's grand production design and exquisite colors. This is a film for us, for cinephiles, for the ones who don't feel the magic in any other setting than a dark theatre. Hugo is for the ones who dream in 16 millimeter and can't imagine a life without cinema. Hugo encompasses everything a cinephile feels in their heart when a film begins to roll, proving that ""the movies are our special place."""

A cinematic wonderland of sterling scenic splendors of Paris, a train station, and Hugo's curiosity that leads to a superb blend of intriguing characters and awe-inspiring discoveries, both for Hugo and the movie audience.

","""Hugo"" is about the titular character who lives in a train-station where he is doing the job that his dad used to do: fixing clocks. He gets to know this old shop owner, where after a chain of mysteries gets put in front of him.<br/><br/>""Hugo"" was directed by the well-known master of cinema Martin Scorsesse. He is one of the best directors working today and all of the films I've seen of him have been good. You'd expect that he would maybe produce something worse with a movie who's target audience is children, but with ""Hugo"" he'll prove you wrong. He used some impressive long takes in this movie, like in the beginning and ending. The beginning scene was very CGI-heavy, which I didn't really like, but I understand why they had to do that. The CGI looked very fake, and I don't really understand why the movie got an Oscar for this part. The scene overall was good (the camera movements etc.), but the CGI was really off-putting, whereby I thought that the whole movie would be like this: CGI filled. Luckily this wasn't the case and was the other uses of CGI more subtle and worked better. Like for example the train sequence, there the CGI was way better than in the beginning, because there wasn't an overflow of it. The end scene was filmed very impressively. I saw a behind the scenes video of it, which only made the scene even better and more surprising that they even were able to pull it of.The score was nicely composed and created by Howard Shore. The movie was also beautifully filmed. Each shot was nicely framed and looked good. This was done by Robert Richardson, who had previously worked with Scorsesse in ""Shutter Island"", where he also proved his talent. The costume design I found to be good. It really helped to create a feel to the movie, and it also made the movie look more like it was set in the early 30'.<br/><br/>The acting was good even from the young actor and actress. Let's first talk about the protagonist of the story: Hugo. Hugo was played by Asa Butterfield. An actor who has showed multiple times that he is a fantastic kid actor. One example Is ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"". In this movie too he gives a good performance, not as good as in the previously named film, but still pretty good, especially for a kid. Sometimes I found that the emotion he showed with his face, didn't match the emotion he put into his voice. Other times he did this perfectly and really showed his full emotion. His Co-star was Chloë Grace Moretz. She was also very good, better than Asa in this movie. Ben Kingsley played her uncle. He gave one of the best performances in the film. He was really able to portray how his character felt and we were able to feel with him, thanks to Kingsley's brilliant performance. Jude Law, for the screen time he got, was excellent. I very much liked him in the film. And last but not least I want to mention Sacha Baron Cohen. He played someone totally different from his other characters, and it worked. He was funny and acted it out very well. He was more of the comic relief for the children, but it really worked, because the jokes that were made were good for all ages and not just stupid fart jokes. <br/><br/>The screenplay was really well written. The story was interesting and not predictable. It sets up a little adventure that reminds you of what it's like to be a child. The story also was well constructed and by the use of flashbacks it also sets up the character of Hugo. I only have one really complaint about the screenplay and this is that at the end of the movie everything gets explained fairly obviously. I liked the twist that they put in there and that they teach the younger audience about film, but I just would've liked a more subtle approach better. I hope that this encourages kids to go watch movies of Georges Méliès, because that's where it all started. You also don't really have to know a lot of movies to understand what they are talking about, which is also a good thing. Like I've said before, the jokes were funny, and that's a good part thanks to the screenplay. There was some slapstick, but also some verbal humor. Sometimes I think that the jokes would go over the heads of children, but I think that that's a good thing, because by this you can keep the more mature audience entertained. I also liked the fact that there were some small side stories going on. Those too were funny and set up in a nice manner, whereby the added to the story and weren't just some useless images to fill up the time span of the movie. <br/><br/>In the end I found ""Hugo"" to be a good movie. It had a mix of things that adults could enjoy and that kids could enjoy, whereby the movie really becomes a good kids movie. The movie also teaches some things about early cinema which I very much enjoyed and also the way it was integrated into the movie fitted very well. 8.4/10"

Although the film seems minutely prepared and staged as a goodbye to an industry model that is configured with D.W.Griffith in the early twentieth century and seems to unravel before our eyes under the hands of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Before the fall of the hegemonic cinema we observe the loss of an aesthetic-colonial legacy, but at the same time the possibility of renewing the film industry with the expansion of voices and views. In a year that Kodak, Hollywood industry icon, entered bankruptcy Scorsese performs a rite of passage between the death of a cinema and the birth of another."
"seguinkid","10","1","3","24 May 2016"," Review and Analysis of Hugo
","Hugo, a Spectacular Masterpiece<br/><br/>Alejandro Inarritu, a Mexican film director and producer once stated that ""To make a film is easy; to make a good film is war. To make a very good film is a miracle."" Martin Scorsese, a cinematic genius, directed the award winning 2011 film, Hugo, which fits the definition of a very good film. Each aspect of making this film proves extraordinary: the accordion French music, the beautiful and smooth cinematography, perfect lighting, and astounding actors. Additionally, Hugo expresses a unique but important message about the role each individual plays in this world. Great films entertain the audience, create miraculous filmmaking, and convey a deeper meaning to the audience, as shown in the award winning Hugo. <br/><br/>""Once upon a time, I met a boy named Hugo Cabret,"" begins Isabelle, ""He lived in a train station. Why did he live in a train station, you might well ask. That's really what this book is going to be about. And about how this singular young man searched hard to find a secret message from his Father, and how that message lead his way, all the way home."" Isabelle begins to retell Hugo's story, providing the viewer with the beginning of a plot summary. As an orphan, Hugo lives in the walls of a train station in 1930's Paris. He works as the clock winder, a job previously held by his deceased father and uncle. Hugo loves everything mechanical, and he strives to fix the automaton, a moving mechanical device made in imitation of a human being, his father left him. Embarking on a miraculous journey, Hugo meets George Méliès, a grumpy shopkeeper, and his goddaughter, Isabelle, who significantly impact his adventure. Surprising results follow as Hugo and Isabelle discover and unlock hidden memories involving the automaton, his only possession from his father. <br/><br/>Robert Richardson's smooth and dramatic cinematography proves the most stunning and extraordinary aspect of the Hugo filmmaking. In 2011, he won the Academy Award for the best cinematography for his work on Hugo. Beginning with the opening scene, Richardson amazes his audience with an impressive aerial, tracking, and close-up shot combined. After an entire year, and the use of one-thousand computers, Richardson masters his shot beginning as an aerial view of Paris and slowly zooming down on the train station. Cameras smoothly transition through a crowd of people, creating an eye-level tracking shot, and then moves above the people and zooms in on Hugo, viewed as a close-up shot through the number four of the clock. After a view of the daily shopkeepers in the train station, the camera travels with Hugo as he climbs down through a series of machines in the tower, employing tracking shots again, particularly as Hugo transits down a ladder and slide. Such shots amaze analytical viewers as the camera moves smoothly down the ladder and around the windy slide, following Hugo all the way. Viewers then receive a close up view of a detailed reflection of the clock in Georges Méliès' eyes. This one scene combines these incredible shots, revealing Robert Richardson's amazing cinematography. <br/><br/>Not only does the film entertain the audience, but it also successfully conveys a deeper meaning and enlightens viewers on filmmaking history, providing audiences with a great movie. As viewers experience flashbacks throughout the movie, glimpses of early filming and stage props appear. Like the viewers, characters also seem amazed at the color amidst a black and white movie. When Isabelle inquires about a scene's color, Mama Jeanne, an actress and Isabelle's godmother, says, ""Of course it is, we tinted them! We painted them by hand, frame by frame."" In addition to history, Hugo makes viewers feel purposeful. Hugo says, I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine. Machines never come with any extra parts, you know. They always come with the exact amount they need. So I figured, if the entire world was one big machine, I couldn't be an extra part. I had to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason, too.<br/><br/>Although he directs this statement towards Isabelle, he also communicates the idea that every person belongs in this world to the viewers. Additionally, the film tells the audience to follow their dreams and fulfill their purpose. When referring to machines, Hugo says, ""If you lose your purpose... it's like you're broken."" Hugo contains such a rich, fulfilling meaning and successfully reaches the audience with a powerful message. Toward the end of the movie, Georges Méliès leaves viewers with a very encouraging quote. ""My friends, I address you all tonight as you truly are: wizards, mermaids, travelers, adventurers, magicians... Come and dream with me."" <br/><br/>Hugo, a spectacular film, successfully entertains the audience, contains great filmmaking aspects, and provides viewers with a meaningful and clear message. Through the eyes of a young boy, viewers learn the importance of doing what they do best and love to do, whether filmmaking, acting, painting, or fixing. After watching this movie people understand that they are a piece of a huge machine that could not function without every individual. Each aspect of filmmaking contributes to this remarkable movie: the acting, cinematography, music, and lighting. Truly a beautiful film, Hugo reaches all audiences and ages and makes a great family movie. If desiring a touching and inspiring masterpiece, this film will satisfy anyone's expectations and more."

","Hugo (2011): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jude Law: A wonderful celebration of old Hollywood. It stars Asa Butterfield as Hugo, whose father died in a fire leaving him as the sole person to keep the clocks at the train station in working order. He resorts to theft in order to live but this causes tension when an elderly shop owner catches him in the act. It is obvious that director Martin Scorsese is displaying his appreciation for early cinema with footage from old short films. Butterfield is very expressive in his sense of loss yet resourceful in maintaining what appears to be massive art direction in a clock tower. Ben Kingsley as the bitter shop owner is discovered to be early filmmaker George Melies whose films were destroyed when the war hit. Kingsley plays him with grief and great loss as he reflects upon a career of dreams and wonder. He was a magician whose amazement at film led to those of his own, including A Trip to the Moon. Chloe Grace Moretz plays Kingsley's granddaughter whose thrill for adventure leads to teaming with Hugo in discovering what the key around her neck does with the robot Hugo has been fixing in the tower. Sacha Baron Cohen plays the police inspector with a leg brace. He chases down children to send to an orphanage, but he also fancies the woman selling flowers on the corner. Jude Law is featured as Hugo's father who is involved in an accident that cost him his life. Scorsese is a master filmmaker bringing his appreciation full circle with this wondrous celebration.

","""Hugo"" is a historical drama set in a 1930s fantasy Paris.The two most influential characters are Hugo and Isabelle who are played by Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz.The story is about Hugo Cabret who lives in the railway station of Gare Montparnasse.His father, a devoted master clock master dies while trying to fix one of the most complex automatons in the world which he found broken in a museum.That automaton being the only memory of his father that he has leads him into a great adventure while he's trying to fix it.The characters of Isabelle and Hugo are interesting because,coming from two different environments they have a similar view on life.For the duration of the film they go from complete strangers to great friends bonded by the love for their fathers.The special effects are absolutely spectacular and the film's soundtrack includes an Oscar- nominated original score composed by Howard Shore.Overall I think that it was a gripping and fast-moving family movie and that it's a must watch for everyone,old or young."
"grantss","8","1","3","27 January 2015"," Movie-history lesson wrapped inside a good drama
","Great movie. A movie-history-lesson wrapped inside a good drama. The central plot is great, and not at all predictable. Scorsese's influences and keen sense of all the great movie innovators that came before him shine through in the story. Scorsese's direction is its usual deft, clever self, and the special effects are great. The 3D effects were great, but not essential to the film (so not a problem if you can only see it in 2D).<br/><br/>Not perfect though. Some of the sub-plots seem unnecessary, and dilute the focus. Asa Butterfield is OK, but not overly convincing, as Hugo. Sacha Baron Cohen is a bit subdued, even dull (by his standards), as the Station Inspector - possibly miscast. <br/><br/>Remaining performances are fine though. Ben Kingsley doesn't do bad performances, and this is no exception. Good support from Emily Mortimer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jude Law, Christopher Lee, Helen McCrory and Ray Winstone."
"ryklinker","9","1","3","18 December 2014"," An orphan living in the clock tower of a Paris train station seeks to find what he is missing in his life.
","It's 1930's Paris in the winter. Smoke puffs out of fireplaces, and the large clock of the train station clicks on. A boy, probably 10 years of age, peeks out of a hole between the 3 and 4 on the clock's face, and he energetically climbs down to the station floor. He steals a piece of bread, and then he sees it. There is an older man sitting at the counter of a small shop, and he's dozing off. The boy sneaks up to the counter, and just as he grasps a mechanical mouse on the counter, the old man's hand descends upon the boy's, and we learn that this is not the first time such an instance has occurred. ""What's is your name, thief?"" the old man asks. With a sob, the young boy replies, ""Hugo Cabret."" As the camera follows young Hugo back to his ""home"", we see that he is a lonely orphan, and his only companion, if one my call it such, is a automaton that is missing a piece from his late father. However, this loneliness all changes when he meets young Isabelle, the goddaughter of the same old man who owns the toyshop. An avid book enthusiast, Isabelle has always wanted to have her own grand adventure, and she seeks to help Hugo not only find the missing piece to his automaton, but the orphan's life as well. Little to the children's knowledge, the automaton will simply be the beginning to the discoveries to come.<br/><br/>Though on the surface this film appears to be a kids' movie about an orphan and his broken automaton, it does not take long for this facade to disperse, and for the real object of interest: the imagination of film. Without giving away any spoilers, the art and magical nature of cinema ends of being a major theme of this film. The story takes us back to the very first films by the Lumiere Brothers in 1895, and it carries us into cinema's deepest roots, back when there were no movie stars, no audible dialogue, and any color was hand-tinted by the director. The art of classic films is explored, and the imaginative nature behind them is displayed for all. In terms of genre, this film was a jump for director Martin Scorsese. As a man whose films usually revolve around the Italian society, primarily the Mob, he has made a few attempts to stray from this preconception, and this is one of his finest in doing so. This film was his first endeavor into completely digital filmmaking, and he brings his signature cinematography to the modern medium. In numerous interviews, Scorsese had said that this was his ""love-letter to film."" As he made this film, the director takes us into his heart that still beats with the joy that he felt as a young boy when he would go to the cinema. As one may assume, this film received quite a bit of critical acclaim. Though nominated for 9 Oscars, most notably Best Picture, Hugo came home with 5 awards: Cinematography, Art Direction, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and Visual Effects. I for one believe that this is only of Scorsese's best films from a cinematography standpoint. My few negative points are quite trifling, yet bear with me. I did not like how the setting is Paris, France, and yet the characters all have British accents. I know that this is trivial, but it did catch my attention. Secondly, I did not like how the story only shows Hugo's father for such a short moment, and the father's death is too quickly shown. I understand that the film was made with children as the audience, yet I still feel that they should have lingered a bit longer. Though it is rated PG, and the titular character is a child, this film can apply to nearly anyone. The art of the moving picture has somewhat lost its credibility, and it takes a film like this to remind us of that. <br/><br/>I fully recommend this film to anyone who is a cinefile like myself, and the negative parts are like single frames in the rolls of film that put together this movie.<br/><br/>www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com"

","What a great movie maker Martin Scorsese is, we all know. But in the past also he has been known to chose most off beat stories to tell and most often people have rewarded him for that, academically and commercially. But a person cannot keep on doing the same again and again hoping that he will get rewarded the same way.<br/><br/>The movie is brilliant in terms of art direction, cinematography, direction and acting performance of the actors. There is the Midas touch of Martin Scorsese in the movie which makes it a must watch for his fans.<br/><br/>But sorry to say once again, as the movie appears to be one for children, I am very sure that children would be very disappointed to watch the film leave aside others.<br/><br/>The movie was not a commercial hit and that is something logically. Using extremely visually appealing effects and art you cannot force the audience to gulp down anything.<br/><br/>A good movie starts with a good script and good script can throw life into otherwise a lifeless movie. Well with this movie the exact opposite happened. A lose and senseless script has made the movie a very average one and as a whole I didn't enjoy watching it."

I thought that the actors and actresses did a really good job with making it look like it was from the 1930s. i think that if i was to watch to watch it in 3d it would make the movie even better than it already is. Part of the reason this was such a good movie is because it is a good for all ages and is really easy to understand what was happening and the story line.

"jboothmillard","7","1","3","21 December 2012"," Hugo
","Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Martin Scorsese (GoodFellas) is more used to adult films, mostly with gangsters, gambling, violence, drugs and other dark subjects, so it was really surprising to many of his fans that he would be directing both a children's film and releasing it in 3D, but it was one that I must see because it swept the awards in technical categories. Basically, set in the 1930's, Hugo Cabret (The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas star Asa Butterfield) is the orphaned boy who lives in a Paris train station, scrounges from vendors for food, and steals mechanical parts from local toy shop owner Georges Méliès (Sir Ben Kingsley), and has a gift for fixing things. One day getting away from persistent Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), he meets Méliès who is unhappy he has been stealing mechanical parts, and he snatches his father's notebook that he needs to help him mend the treasured robotic man called an automaton. Hugo's Father (Jude Law) taught him his mechanical skills for mending clocks and devices, always took him to the movies as they were emerging into the world, and he found the automaton abandoned from the museum he worked in, but he died in a fire before he was able to fix it, and Hugo is sure that it may contain a message for him. Méliès is impressed by the boy's skills to mend his toys and devices, so he makes him a deal to give back his notebook if he fixes things for him, and the boy also meets his adventure loving god-daughter Isabelle (Kick-Ass's Chloë Grace Moretz), who may hold the key, literally, to the automaton's purpose. Hugo borrows the key Isabelle has, and having fixed the automaton's functions turns the key lock to operate it, and eventually it does not write, it draws a famous image, the face in the moon from the famous silent film A Trip to the Moon, aka Voyage to the Moon, and it includes the signature Isabelle's godfather. The two friends take the drawing to Isabelle's godmother Jeanne (Helen McCrory) for an explanation, she refuses to tell them anything because it brings back difficult memories, and when the children hide from Georges they uncover other hidden drawings, the old man feeling betrayed demands the boy leaves. Hugo and Isabelle ask bookshop owner Monsieur Labisse (Sir Christopher Lee) for information about Georges Méliès, they are directed to the filmmaking section, where they meet the author of a book they study, Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg) recognises and highly admires the work Méliès, Tabard is convinced that he died and all his films were destroyed, only one surviving, the one from their drawing. The next day the three of them plan to show the last known copy of A Trip to the Moon, Jeanne is hesitant what the reaction of Georges will be, Tabard recognises her as former actress Jeanne d'Alcy, and they watch the film, unaware after it finishes that Georges was also watching, and he reminisces on his filmmaking career in the early days of the 20th Century. He transformed filmmaking, which started with modest short pictures with no plots by the Lumière Brothers, who saw them as a short-lived fad, but Méliès was one of the pioneers who created imaginative and inspiring stories with genre, but the popularity died when World War I came and most of the films were melted for the chemicals to make him his money back, and he used what he had to create the toy shop. Hugo plans to give Georges the automaton as a surprise, but the Station Inspector catches him, knowing he has been the one snooping in the station clock, stealing things and being an orphan, and after some chasing and near miss moments Georges helps him. The film ends with Tabard introducing Méliès back to the public and showcasing that over eighty of his films thought to be gone have been recovered, Hugo is made part of the family, with Isabelle writing a story on the events, and the automaton sits still in a peaceful room, posed like it will draw more. Also starring Ray Winstone as Uncle Claude, Emily Mortimer as Lisette, Frances De La Tour as Madame Emilie, Richard Griffiths as Monsieur Frick, Dead Set's Kevin Eldon as Policeman, Edmund Kingsley, Ben's son as Camera Technician, Francesca Scorsese, Martin's daughter as Child at Café and Martin Scorsese as Photographer. Butterfield gives a cute and clever performance, Moretz as usual is fantastic with her adventurous and enthusiastic personality, and the supporting cast members, especially Kingsley, play their parts very well, I even liked Cohen as silly comic relief. Almost half of the film sees a boy seeking something from his father, and the rest is a magnificent tribute to the origins of early silent cinema (including clips of Train Pulling into a Station, The Great Train Robbery, Intolerance, The General and The Kid), it makes you feel just like watching Cinema Paradiso, the same message of how cinema makes you escape into a magical world where anything is possible, it also works as a family friendly journey into family with funny and heart-warming moments, a most worthwhile period fantasy adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Editing for Thelma Schoonmaker, Best Music for Howard Shore, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Production Design and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up & Hair, Best Original Music and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Original Score. Very good!"
"wareaglegurl","4","1","3","2 July 2012"," Not at all what it was made out to be, in a bad way
","I had wanted to see this movie for a long time. After getting all these nominations and winning 5 Oscars, beating out The Descendants (which I loved), I figured it had to be good. I was wrong. The only amazing aspect of this movie was the visual. I'll give them that, the costumes, set design, and CGI were really cool to look at, but that's not going to keep me entertained for 2 hours. The plot line was utterly boring and pointless, while the acting from pretty much everyone was over-dramatic and cheesy. I can't seem to understand what all the big fuss is about this movie. From watching the trailers, I got the impression, as did the rest of the world I'm sure, that it was an Action/Adventure movie about an orphan boy in a train station trying to unlock a secret about his father. Sort of like A Series of Unfortunate Events, right? Nope. <br/><br/>Here's a few things that I did not like (the list goes on and on): First, the plot is really boring to begin with. It seems that they spend the first 30 minutes of the movie just setting the scene, with the little boy Hugo just running around the train station. Gets your attention at first, but gets boring really fast. Then, as soon as you think the movie has climaxed and about to get a little better, they completely scrap the already boring plot they had and pursue and even more boring one. If you've seen the movie, then you know that the resolve/ending was just a way for Scorsese to discreetly glorify himself and suck up to the Academy. Definitely don't take the kids to this one. It looks so kid friendly and fun for the whole family, but I promise, you will be asleep within the first hour. And one more thing, why the heck is EVERY character speaking in a British accent when they are in Paris??? Very unrealistic and obnoxious. Easy fix: set it in London! Big picture, I was extremely disappointed in this movie and am still confused as to why it is so critically acclaimed."

"mukava991","Null","1","3","24 April 2012"," too much, yet not enough
","Hugo is an odd hybrid of children's fantasy and adult drama set in Paris around 1930 and based, like so many movies nowadays, on a comic book (or ""illustrated novel"" in this case). Half of it is about the title character, Hugo Cabret, a mechanically gifted boy living and working cockroach-like behind the walls of a grand train station where he maintains the clocks, having been trained in that skill by his alcoholic uncle who adopted him after his father died in a fire. The other half is a fictionalized treatment of the life of pioneering filmmaker Georges Melies who spent most of his later years in relative obscurity and poverty. The two stories are brought together by the device of a broken automaton, along the lines of the ""Maria"" robot in Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis,"" left to Hugo by his father. In his spare time, Hugo meticulously repairs this machine which is designed to write on paper with a pen but the heart-shaped key that activates it is missing and Hugo can never learn what the automaton can write until he can find the key, which, as we learn through various plot meanderings, is owned by the goddaughter of old Melies, who operates a toy concession in the train station and has kept his former fame a secret from the lass. Not only is she unaware that her godfather is one of the inventors of motion pictures, she has never even seen one in her life. It is young Hugo who takes her to the cinema for the first time. And what is playing? Harold Lloyd's ""Safety Last,"" with the famous hanging-from-the-clock sequence. <br/><br/>The title character states that the world is a vast machine and because machines have no unnecessary parts, each person in the world has a purpose in the way that each part of a machine has a purpose. Director Martin Scorsese's way of bringing this notion to life is labor intensive, to say the least, obsessed with busy-ness and maze-like detail. The frames are filled with crowds of people bustling about in all directions; behind the walls of the train station where Hugo lives and works is a network of winding corridors and staircases leading to a succession of rooms populated by turning gears of all sizes. The actors (including Ben Kingsley as Melies, Asa Butterfield in the title role and Jude Law as his father) are adequate but essentially serve as support for the environment, a digital paean to the mechanical age. <br/><br/>Along the way we are treated to a brilliantly surprising dream-within-a dream sequence and interesting reenactments of how Melies created short films in his glass-enclosed studio. The camera-work is sometimes breathtaking and the replication of Paris circa 1930, although artificial in a CGI way, is nonetheless impressive. We do get a sense of the deep sadness felt by an artist who was forced by changing socio-economic conditions and public tastes to abandon his main passion. But overall there are not enough compelling moments to justify the expense and effort of creating the vast, clicking, ticking infrastructure that houses them."
"accountcrapper","6","1","3","8 April 2012"," No Cinema Paradiso
","This film does not have a single relationship of note in it. I have no idea who is the lead character and as an ensemble it completely falls flat. I have no idea who reviews these movies but they have lost they're sense of smell. The acting was one dimensional and this is not the fault of the actors, this is the fault of the script. Actors are only allowed to express a single emotion throughout the entire film. There were also many seemingly useless characters in the film like the bookshop owner, the tea couple, the flower lady - I have no idea why those characters were given any time. There seemed to be three main stories but none of them were convincing or drawn out. They were superficial ham-fisted portrayals and with over 2 hours of this you have to wonder who edits in Hollywood anymore. There was a love scene to early cinema at various points which is absurdly odd as it has only the most tenuous link to the boys story - it goes on for a long time and is nothing more than a gratuitous and frankly tedious lecture - what happened to 'show don't tell' direction.<br/><br/>The sets looked like expensive lush sets and nothing more, no relationships, no lead character but extremely poor ensemble, confusing story arc with sections of what might as well be a documentary on early cinema - all wrapped in a bow with, count them, 4 happy endings.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good movie that inspired this extremely poor knock off then look for Cinema Paradiso and see how it should be done."

","This is one of the most amazingly filmed movies I've seen in a while but lacked story in certain parts. I enjoyed watching the boy Hugo run, jump, and slide is way around that train station were he grew up but they seemed to focus on that rather than the story at times. i would've loved to seen a little more of the boy and is father too rather than Borat limping around the train station after little boys which was funny at times. I absolutely loved the old films in the movie how they painted the film to make it color and the moon it was awesome!

","when i first heard about this movie which is directed by martin Scorsese's, i was pretty interested about it cause MS taking a different genre of movie from here. But when i see the movie my interest vanishes like a balloon. I praises what Scorsese's done with the movie. artistically it is a beautiful movie. Two of the character really shines in this Movie; Ben Kingley as Georges Melies, Sacha Baron Cohen as Staton Inspector. Other wise, i find other character pretty stale. Asa Butterfield as Hugo, Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabella, Emily Mortimer as Lisette all given average Performance.<br/><br/>I was pretty convinced Scorsese made a Awesome adventure movie that gonna blow my mind, with some Oscar worthy performance. The full movie focused on Artistic value and the glory of old age movies. Which is Acceptable but not good enough to give an awesome movie experience. Scorsese's 1930 Paris looked like more as a ""Hugo In Wonderland"". no enough flashback, No good motivation to go on, too much focus on visual rather then movie itself make it a pretty normal movie experience.<br/><br/>I didn't read the book but i know Scorsese's has a habit of make the original source upside down in his movie. SO my presume is that Scorsese's made an awesome book looks like a broken movie which won multiple Oscars. Sad.........<br/><br/>Rating 4/10"

"benighted2005","6","1","3","19 February 2012"," Quite an ordinary plot blown way outta proportion in a boring manner.
","I expected a lot before watching this film but was a bit shocked that I found it sincerely boring. To see a director make a film just to may some sort of a tribute to his own profession, film - making, is just not that overwhelming. I like dramas based on the human emotion, it seems this is specifically based on creating magic out of nothing. Hugo is a primeval film about machines and man at the dawn of the cinema era. I don't blame myself entirely for not curbing my apathy towards this film. It is not a bad film - it is just ordinary and very selective.<br/><br/>Watch this if you don't mind watching a two hour long film based in early 20th century about an orphan.<br/><br/>I have a sinking feeling that Martin Scorsese thinks he nailed crime/drama films after ""The Departed"" and won't be making a film with that bent again. He is starting doing these tributes to film making - Shutter Island for instance, what was that all about?! Yet, that is a much better, more laconic film than Hugo (Which I doubt will figure in my top 15 of last year)"
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","4","1","3","17 February 2012"," Uneven, but still has enough to admire.
","Martin Scorsese crafts a charming love letter to the movies, but unfortunately Hugo has much more on it's mind that just that. At first, this appears to be a relatively simple tale of a young boy named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) trying to finish the work of his father. It's got a lot of the standard pieces that one would expect from such a tale, like the spunky girl he befriends (Chloe Moretz) and the cartoonish villain trying to lock him away (Sacha Baron Cohen). As a narrative, it wasn't doing much for me, but the astonishing technical achievements within the film made it at least appealing to the senses. So while I wasn't compelled by the story, I was at least able to marvel at the visuals of the film and the remarkable sound design.<br/><br/>The stages are exquisite, with some of the most impressive art direction and costume design I've seen from this year, and Scorsese manages to create a fully realized environment here. Hugo lives in a train station, a place of constant activity and daily routines, and Scorsese orchestrates it in such a lively fashion. We are focused on this young boy, but you can always feel a thousand different things happening around him, people walking past and going about their own day. I just wish our focal point had been remotely interesting, which it wasn't for me. I credit a large part of this to the cast, which is primarily lackluster to say the least.<br/><br/>Scoresese isn't able to pull a worthwhile performance out of either of his young stars; Asa Butterfield tries to be very grown up and ends up looking like an untalented child poorly playing pretend, while Chloe Moretz is supposed to be very bright and childlike, but is instead dreadfully rigid and wooden. The worst offender though is Sacha Baron Cohen, and it's the attention given to his character that provides for the most glaring flaw in the film at large. This utterly absurd and cartoonish characters doesn't at all belong within this world and Cohen's embarrassingly hammy portrayal is a real stain on the picture.<br/><br/>Thankfully though the film is quite uneven overall, which means that there is a lot to be admired. The focus isn't precise at all, but when attention shifts to Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley), the film shines bright. In focusing on this man, Scorsese constructs his love letter to cinema and you can certainly feel his own passion pouring off of the screen within these scenes. Helped by the vivid and emotional performance from Kingsley, this aspect of the film is so very alive and beautiful. Combined with those gorgeous technical qualities and some wonderfully edited sequences (such as the depicting the beginnings of cinema), it's almost like a wonderful dream.<br/><br/>Living in the 21st century, I never really think about a time where movies didn't exist, let alone when they weren't relatively available at every corner. Scorsese is able to detail not only his own passion for the cinema, but make the audience understand just how appreciative they should be that it exists in the first place, because there was a time not so long ago when it didn't at all. I just wish that the entire film had been as grand, because everything else certainly didn't come close to the note it built around to. There isn't a proper, organic flow towards this aspect of the film, but I'm still thankful that it went there because it's certainly a step up from the rest of what was going on."
"blacklist-1","8","1","3","25 December 2011"," An interesting and occasionally wonderful film from Scorsese, but it isn't for kids.
","Scorsese's attempts at making his first ""kids"" movie is an admirable one. But the problem is the target demographics for Hugo has been misplaced. Very few young children under the age of ten are likely to enjoy this (though I'm sure there will be a few) because they maybe won't understand the story or wonder what is so interesting about the history of cinema. It just will not appeal to many. At first it does seem to be heading in a magical and mystical direction with the two kids Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and Isabelle (Chloe Moretz) who in the 1930s in Paris are trying to unlock the mystery of an automaton man who has a key shaped hole in his back. It does take a bit of time to build up to that moment and when it did I thought some sort of magical and fantasy world would open up, but it didn't. Not that I'm saying it wasn't interesting it certainly was; as in my first year at university I studied about the origins of cinema and I found the narrative fascinating in Hugo. To be fair there are certain elements of comedy and effects that may attract kids, but it won't be enough I think to keep their attention diverted for over two hours. <br/><br/>Anyway on the whole for me the story was interesting and unfolded well, though I will be honest there were points at the beginning before the mystery of the automaton man was solved where I was getting bored as it did begin a bit too slowly. There were also other points in the structure of the narrative that tended to get bogged down in sub-plots, which though weren't boring, was not necessary for the film. Like the station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) lusting after the flower women Lisette (Emily Mortimer). At the risk of sounding so negative though there was plenty about the film that I really enjoyed. Apart from the great story, the acting was excellent across the whole terrific choice of cast. Newcomer Asa Butterfield gives a wonderful performance as Hugo capturing the essence of his character, an orphan who loved his father and has a joy in building and running the clocks in the station. This gives his character some depth as well. The scenes in particular played between him and his father (Jude Law who gives a great cameo) are quite heartwarming. Chloe Moretz again delivers an excellent performance, building on from her already promising acting career from films like Kick-Ass and Let Me In proving once again she is one of the best up and coming child actresses in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Other members of the cast are equally mesmerising, Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliès probably gives the top performance of the movie as an old man working at a toy store in the station who feels haunted and sad after the end of his glorious film director career, but is transformed back to those days as Hugo and Isabelle solve the mystery. Cohen as the station inspector is surprisingly funny (given I'm not a fan of his more extreme comedy) and shows a vulnerable side with his leg injury from world war 1, which he overcomes with courage. Terrific cameos are also provided by Emily Mortimer, Christopher Lee and Richard Griffiths. With such great acting you do come to care about these characters as well and wish them all the best. <br/><br/>The 3D is also truly spectacular and is used to magnificent effect particularly when it snows in the film, you actually feel like it's snowing in the cinema! It is the best 3D I have seen since the third Transformers movie. The cinematography and scenery are gorgeous visuals with some stunning views and the musical scores throughout are pitch perfect.<br/><br/>In the end though Hugo does have it's flaws and I think the target demographics are slightly misleading. Everyone from teenage years and upwards should find something to enjoy, particularly film enthusiasts who are intrigued by the history of film. Hugo for me wasn't really magical, but it was interesting, touching and an occasionally wonderful spectacle. Scorsese deserves high merit for trying something out of his normal comfort zone and I commend him for that."
"neil-476","7","1","3","4 December 2011"," A game of two halves
","Let me divide my comments into two sections - Content and Execution - and start with the latter.<br/><br/>This is one of the most superbly executed films I have ever seen. Production design is amazing - it evokes its own self-contained universe of time and space unlike any other film I have seen. Scorsese's Gangs Of New York did a similar thing, but Hugo has an air of otherworldliness all of its own. Scorsese's use of the camera is stunning, and his use of 3D is even better - here is the only director other than Cameron (so far) who understands that 3D can be both a tool for storytelling and also an artistic addition to the director's toolbox. The 3D work here truly adds a dimension to what is on screen. It goes without saying that performances are excellent, but the two youngsters who carry the film are top notch. Scorsese's mastery over what appears on screen is total.<br/><br/>Now we come to content, and here is where the film falters. The story of an orphaned boy, surviving in a Paris railway station post WWI by keeping the clocks running (in the face of a hostile security Inspector and also a toy shop proprietor from whom he thieves mechanical parts) so that he can mend an automaton which he hopes will give him a clue about his father, is a promising one. It has the virtue of not heading in any of the anticipated directions. Unfortunately, the direction it does head in - a love letter to the birth of the cinema - doesn't easily sit with the story up to that point. And, while it looks good, it doesn't engage the viewer in the same way - I never really felt there was anything very much at stake.<br/><br/>So Hugo is definitely worth seeing - and I recommend seeing it in 3D - but it falls some way short of being the totally satisfying experience it starts out as."

","This movie got so much hype but it really doesn't deliver.<br/><br/>Although it looks glossy and expensive and has a the sense of being modern classic of vintage style adventure, there's actually very little sense of much at stake. It's the mystery of some toy which leads us to some film makers.<br/><br/>Maybe it's trying to be an homage to cinema which I dig but ultimately it's then a movie about movies. Which is kind of lame. Cinema Paradiso was also an homage to cinema but also made itself about life and love and stuff.<br/><br/>It's also in English when it is set in fricking Paris.<br/><br/>One of those movies polished to perfection but just made of inferior stuff.<br/><br/>At one point Hugo wakes up from a surprise nightmare only to find he wakes up from another one.

","It's hard to put a finger on the problem with this movie. It is watchable but difficult to get through. The pacing is all over the show. Was that the editor or the director? One minute it's a children's fantasy movie, the next it's a history lesson on the birth of cinema reading from a text book, that will go right over the heads of it's child audience. There is some stunning cinematography here, all the shots of the automaton are jaw dropping, the station too, and there's some great acting too , Chloe just oozes vibrancy into her role, conveys a sincerity and believable quality to her performance, and Asa has his moments too. Is it the script that drags them through too much filler to keep it up though, or was that the editor holding too long on that thought shot? Certainly we should expect more from Scorsese, or maybe he can only do violent adult movies, There are some really good ideas in this movie, but they don't fit together very well as a whole. They were trying for 'something' but maybe a simpler approach would have made a more mesmerising result."

There should have been more of that, even though the viewer never really develops any care for the fate of Hugo...In fact has he been sent to a foster home in the first 45 min it would have been a better plot.<br/><br/>What you start to care about most, is when Hugo will just end.

"Turfseer","4","1","4","24 March 2012"," Scorsese's clever but sycophantic tribute to early film pioneer submerged by tangential, plodding children's narrative
","For those who believe that 'Hugo' is all about the title character, think again. Martin Scorsese only uses a fanciful child's tale to arrive at his true intent: a tribute to film pioneer, Georges Méliès. Visually, one can argue that the film is a tour de force, with some fantastic special effects as well as a sumptuous score, but until we arrive at said tribute, Scorsese's tale lacks the requisite tension and charm.<br/><br/>The film starts off rather nicely as Scorsese takes us into the heart of a Paris train station, circa 1930. We meet Hugo, an orphan, who's being raised by his alcoholic uncle, after Hugo's watchmaker father is killed in a fire. The uncle teaches Hugo how to maintain the vast array of clocks, hidden inside the station but their relationship remains completely underdeveloped. The real tension is supposed to be between Hugo and the autocratic station inspector (awkwardly played by Sacha Baron Cohen), who is bent on sending the orphan away to a reform school. Scorsese relies on a series of slapstick chase scenes between Hugo and the inspector to move the plot along, and adults should not find much interest in such shenanigans.<br/><br/>The connection between Hugo and Méliès is made through a keepsake bequeathed to Hugo from his father. It's an 'automaton', a mechanical man which the father could not get to work, and now Hugo has taken to stealing mechanical parts from a toy store owned by Méliès, now a virtual recluse, in the hope that those parts will enable him to start the device up. Méliès ends up confiscating Hugo's notebook, which contains drawings of the Automaton and his efforts to repair it. Eventually, Méliès hires Hugo to work in the toy store, in order to pay off the debt for the mechanical parts he stole from the store.<br/><br/>Hugo finally gets the Automaton to operate when he discovers that Méliès' goddaughter, Isabelle, is wearing the key (that starts the device), around her neck. Wouldn't you know it but the Automaton draws a screen shot from Méliès' most famous film, 'A Trip to the Moon', proving that the ""great man"" is still alive (unbeknownst to an indifferent public). The two kids manage (with the help of a kindly film historian), to bring Méliès back into the public eye, and Méliès ends up getting the recognition he ""deserves"", from the French film society.<br/><br/>In the best part of the film, Scorsese shines, as he offers up a film hagiography of Méliès' career. The flashback, which includes how Méliès actually created 'A Trip to the Moon', features that glass house, where the pioneer's seminal feature film, was made. Nonetheless, one gets the feeling that Scorsese's embrace of the past, has gone too far. The reverence for Méliès has gotten to the point where Scorsese has placed the film pioneer, on a saintly pedestal. Yes, he is an important figure in the history of cinema and he was extremely talented, especially in a day when film was in its infancy and no one had yet grasped the concept of film as spectacle —but Méliès was still a product of his time, and those ancient images belong in the context of the times they were made in. If it was up to Scorsese, Méliès would be placed in the same pantheon as Shakespeare and Dickens; but Méliès' films were not designed to appeal to the intellect. Méliès' appeal to Scorsese is on the technical level and that's why he admires him so much. To a certain extent, there's nothing wrong in that. But for Scorsese to expect the average film goer to worship Méliès as some kind of film 'deity', I would suggest he's gone a little too far out on a limb.<br/><br/>Karina Longworth, in her review of 'Hugo' in the Village Voice, sums it up best by arguing that the 'ticking clocks' are the true antagonist in the film: ""In the story of Méliès's life as recounted by Scorsese—and by extension, the story of the movies—time is the enemy that alters the tastes of audiences, decays film prints, and turns today's fetish objects into tomorrow's relics."" <br/><br/>'Hugo' in many ways, feels more like a documentary in parts than a clever children's story, fraught with conflict. The conflict here is manufactured and the two child actors end up with little to do except act as impresarios for the Méliès main act. Relationships here are never really developed or explored and we're asked by Scorsese, to simply applaud the hagiography. If you were to take out all the spoken dialogue in the film and leave only the musical soundtrack, you wouldn't miss much. Perhaps, ironically, that's what Scorsese was really aiming for: a stunning visual tribute, to the technical wizardry of an early film pioneer."
"mailbob","10","1","4","5 March 2012"," Please see in 3D!
","Pleasantly surprised, in part due to low expectations from some tepid critical reviews, but as always, IMDb viewers know best. The film may appear to move slowly if watched in 2D -- the endless chases, windings in and out of the walls, trips through the Paris neighborhoods, all these so beautifully executed (I use that word with respect), all are devoid of purpose unless watched as they were intended. 3D is a main character, perhaps THE main character, both thematically and technically. I'm somewhat surprised Scorsese released it in 2D format. It's all slight of hand, wonderful magic. If you allow yourself to suspend disbelief for the brief time it takes to watch, it will thrill. I don't know if any other ""regular"" films yet to come (i.e.,Great Gatsby?) will have the same impact, so I'm not sold yet on the 3D medium, believing it will unfortunately be misused or overused. But in this one case, at least, it fits like a glove. I don't give many 10 ratings. A must see for children of all ages, and all lovers of film. Bravo!"

","It's hard to believe this movie is as highly rated as it is. It is, through and through, lacklustre tripe. The fact it won more Oscars than The Artist shows what a complete joke the Oscars are.<br/><br/>The acting is unremarkable. The Hugo character mostly just stares and twitches his nostrils, while his gal pal mainly looks cute and smiles at everything. Baron Sasha Cohen is boring. Ben Kingsley is uninspiring. It's all Disney grade.<br/><br/>The characters are shallow. None of them are fleshed out enough to care about.<br/><br/>The plot is uninteresting. And slow. And full of clichés. And some of the plot transitions are so badly handled it's simultaneously comical and sad.<br/><br/>The visuals are big budget, yet devoid of character. Typical Hollywood conservative aesthetics. Lots of shiny, detailed blandness.<br/><br/>Nothing that stays with me, after watching it, other than a feeling of contempt towards Hollywood, Martin Scorsese, and anyone who thought this movie was actually good.

","I made the mistake of believing the trailers for this movie which made it look like a cross between Harry Potter and the Narnia movies. It's not at all like that. It is a movie for movie buffs to enjoy, who will get all the movie related homages. It's a movie for teenagers definitely, those who have the patience to sit through a ""kids"" movie this long. I would definitely not recommend it for the average kid under 10 years old - it's not violent or anything like some of Scorcese's other movies, it's just not kid friendly. Take the under 10's to Arthur Christmas and leave this one to the teens and adults - they will most likely find it visually stunning, breathtaking in fact, if a bit lacking in concrete plot - and there are some pretty big holes in this plot too.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, as an adult who LOVES movies, I found it to be beautifully crafted, beautifully shot, but I won't watch it again because it was totally lacking in story.<br/><br/>Why do we watch a movie again and again? Because we love to relive the story over and over again, even overlooking the parts that were not that great (I'm thinking ""It's a Wonderful Life""'s talking angel stars - perhaps good SFX at the time, just annoying now!).<br/><br/>Sorry Mr Scorcese - it's beautiful, like a Monet, Picasso etc, but I don't want to own it or re-watch it again.<br/><br/>Honestly, I preferred The Polar Express - similar hype, better story, definitely one to own. This one, not so much!"

"nightcrawlercyp","2","1","5","22 February 2012"," disappointing.
","I will first state the good parts of the movie (because they are few): The images and the visual atmosphere is great. ...that is it...<br/><br/>Now for the bad: Characters: are very cliché and very unrealistic (all of them). The policeman is so stucked up he does not even know how to smile, the lady that teaches him is a crazy old lady in the vision of her mind, the little girl is much to refined for her age, and the list goes on.<br/><br/>Logic: The first thing that bothered me was the automation: we are let to believe that building an automation is easy. It is not. Many automatons we cannot replicate even today. So to be able to fix an automation that draws something is far more complicated than it seems. The kid must be a prodigy , a genius to fix it. But still he does not appear to realize that Mellier build the thing from the fact that he signed the automation... Also at first it seems he needs his father notes to fix it (that would make sense) but he ends up fixing it without them. Also at one time they say they colored all the movies by hand. The person that made this movie does not realize how expensive this thing is. The series VR5 experienced this first had and had to halt production<br/><br/>Emotional effect-none: The movie builds up to a secret that the old man has kept for many years. The thing appears to hurt them deeply. Any normal person would suspect a serious loss (i.e either deserted by a loved one, either death of a loved one)... But when you reach the last 15 minutes you find out the man was upset for so many years just because he lost his business... I was like wtf?! Did we become so materialistic that we care about a business that much? <br/><br/>Subliminal messages: The movie is filled with people that practically squandered their life and now, at the old age are happy. On the other hand all the people that actually worked for a living die in a horrible way. What moral does it have? That being an honest worker only gets you an alcoholised death, and being a total immoral person gets you everything you want?<br/><br/>As one previous reviewer said the movie is just an homage to an historical figure that no one even remembers today or cares about. <br/><br/>Recommendation: DON'T SEE IT! NOT WORTH IT!"

The trailer is misguiding and moreover all the best parts of the cinema are in the trailer. I would give a perfect 10/10 for trailer but the cinema is disappointing. I have watched the whole cinema hoping that something incredible would happen! But nothing has happened at all.<br/><br/>Well it started quite well, but later I felt like the story has been deviated. Not sure why the director has used few actors and things in this one. For example, I am not sure why Jude Law has agreed to act in this film. There is no significance to his role at all. It would pass even if some unknown actor has done that.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, this cinema is definitely not for kids as there is nothing for them to enjoy apart from that 3D effect.

"writers_reign","6","1","12","3 December 2011"," Time Out For Amelie
","I'm about as far away from a Scorcese fan as you can get. In my book he targets the lowest common denominator via a combination of foul language and violence. True, there have been exceptions. I went to see New York, New York, despite antipathy to the two leads, because it was about Jazz in the immediate post-war years; verdict: ho-hum. A little later he made Age Of Innocence and I went because I was almost certain that he would be unable to insert his winning parlay (scatological violence) without radically altering Edith Wharton's stylistic novel. Verdic: slightly less ho-hum. I was sold on Hugo because I read that 1) it was set in Paris which meant it would have to be seriously bad to counteract the City of Light and 2) considerable footage was devoted to Cinema itself. Scorcese is well-documented as both loving and being an expert on movies so it is almost certain that he is familiar with Amelie and it is equally certain that he has, to some extent, remade it with a male protagonist. Amelie, if you recall, was a catalyst surrounded by sad people who needed 1) a nudge to bring them together or 2) some form of healing. Hugo is also a catalyst surrounded by people who need help getting together - Sacha Baron Cohen/Emily Mortimer, Richard Griffiths/Frances de la Tour - and healing - Ben Kingsley. Viewed in these terms it can be said that both catalysts succeed admirably but, it has to be said, when is a rip-off not a rip-off? possibly when it's a sacred cow doing the ripping-off. The 3D is used effectively and Christopher Lee supplies the best performance, counteracting the film's worst performance by Ben Kingsley. The protagonist, alas, Asa Butterfield, is as mechanical as the clock he tends so devotedly and by far the best thing on view is the actual vintage footage."
"skullislandsurferdotcom","6","1","13","24 November 2011"," Professor Scorsese's Silent Film Class for Kids
","If you wonder why Martin Scorsese (delving into Tim Burton territory) chose to direct a ""children's story"" of a young orphan living inside of – and surreptitiously working the clocks of – a tower in a Paris train station just wait for the second half: when the somewhat slow-paced but beautifully shot contained journey turns into a whimsical celebration of one of the greatest innovators of cinema. But that's another story – making this feel like two tales in one.<br/><br/>The first has our young hero, straight out of a Dickens novel, named Hugo Cabret with only the memories of his deceased father, who left behind an automaton robot that needs a heart-shaped key to make it run: perhaps providing a message from beyond. Enter the granddaughter of an old and bitter toy dealer; she has the key needed – but leading to this point is a somewhat thin story stretched out too long.<br/><br/>On the peripheral, and making up the comedy, action, and suspense is the station inspector played by Sacha Baron Cohen, doing a somewhat tongue-in-cheek nod to clumsy silent film antagonists. With a Doberman at his side, the lone keystone cop strives to catch the young tinkerer: whose only goal is to get that automaton working.<br/><br/>Then the second half – after a crucial discovery – is where Scorsese's true aim lies. But with the built-up mystery gone, the youthful awe is only partially replaced by a cinematic history lesson more dreamlike than fact based.<br/><br/>The young star Asa Butterfield, with sad eyes and a curiously insightful expression, while looking the part makes for a somewhat bland title character. But it's Chloë Grace Moretz, as his lovely young sidekick, that not only brightens the film with her tremendous acting but whose bookworm dreamer yearns for adventure more than Scorsese's film delivers it.<br/><br/>Yet despite the flaws, there's enough residual magic for (creative) kids and (patient) adults to enjoy.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: http://cultfilmfreakreviews.blogspot.com"

However, the viewer is soon left confused wondering why they were sucked into such a subpar story.<br/><br/>Another part of what draws viewers in is the anticipation of the adventure about to unfold, and that anticipation is certainly the most misleading, even for those who haven't seen the multitude of trailers and posters that advertised this film as a pure adventure. The first act begins by expertly crafting our sense of anticipation, but then it lulls with redundancy until the second act. The next act is even more confusing than the first because it completely abandons the adventure aspect and turns into a melodrama where no one can react appropriately to any of the drama. The final act presents an ode to early cinema that, for people who aren't early cinema buffs, is just as boring as it sounds. They do try to liven it up with a very brief adventure scene (the poster picture and the scene that takes much of the misleading trailers' time), but immediately after the risk of life is over, it's painfully obvious that there was no need to risk life at all, making a terribly unnecessary attempt at raising tension.<br/><br/>Lastly, the acting was not at a level that's expected from a Scorsese film. The usually above average Grace-Mortez was brought low by the English accent (even though they were supposed to be French). A few of her lines were delivered very strangely or overacted because she was too focused on maintaining the accent. I can't tell if Lee was supposed to be intimidating, kind, or both, but he ended up being neither. In the leading role, Butterfield was droll and emotionless. The only exception was the transition scene between the first and second acts, which had an exceptionally poorly written emotional reaction. Kingsley, McCrorey, and Baron Cohen acted exactly as needed, never over- or underperforming, though each of their character's emotions and motivations were very poorly written in some scenes."

"TheMovieDiorama","9","0","3","9 March 2018"," Hugo is probably Scorsese's most overlooked film.
","In my opinion, this is an absolute joy to watch from start to finish. Whether you are a child or adult, there is definitely something here for you to admire. It's incredibly ambitious and stuffed with sub-plots but the main purpose of the film is to express the adoration of classic cinema by being a partial biopic to Georges Méliès. Also known as the 'Cinemagician', he was a pioneer when it came to the movement of cinema and created many influential pieces such as 1902's famous ""Le Voyage Dans La Lune"" (which I advise all of you to watch and appreciate). On top of this, you have a boy named Hugo who is really trying to find a purpose. Having lost his father, he lives in a train station and observes the employees and their interactions. Each character is animated and charismatic and mimics the expressiveness of classic cinema. Sure this part of the film is aimed towards the younger audiences, but I personally believe it's a homage to earlier films if you look into it further. Incredible cast, Asa Butterfield has that premature innocence and is able to hold the film together. Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helen McCrory are also noteworthy and bring out some superb performances. I adore the mystery that Hugo explores, particularly with an automaton that is left with him...it added a sense of adventure and it had me hooked. Scorsese fantastically directed this and I appreciate him using Méliès' original film reels when showing the footage. The cinematography was stunning, particularly loved the winter tundra aesthetic. The musical score was very...how to put this...frenchy? Or perhaps Parisian? I loved it. One of the best films in 3D by the way, highly recommend you watch it in this format. My only issue with the film is that I wanted some more emotional impact! A few scenes where Butterfield gets emotional but he just doesn't quite reach that height, so close though. All in all, a fantastic film for both families and cinephiles who are interested in classic cinema. It's full of charm!"

","What a wonderful well told story. It covers every emotion and circumstance that a human could face and survive. Starting with the loss of Hugo's father we feel his sense of abandonment, his fear of the orphanage and confusion as to why that had to happen. As the story progresses we see a glimmer of hope as he is forced into his calling of being mechanically inclined by his uncle. But also from a young lady Isabelle who helps him in several ways, with access to books and a real mystery solving adventure. <br/><br/>The back and forth between close calls in the train station melded with dreams and nightmares to actually being captured by the chief make us root for Hugo and feel the goodness in his heart. Love that blooms between supporting actors including dogs adds to the magic, the power that it has, does make changes for the better in everyone.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending because it is too good and must be seen. I will mention the home from the great war scene that took its toll on millions of everyday people. The cinematography is superb along with the set designs. I finished watching it for a 2nd time on DVD after seeing it back when it was originally released. Hugo is a masterpiece and destined to become legendary like The Wizard of Oz. I rated it a solid 10/10 stars."

"TheLittleSongbird","7","0","2","12 January 2017"," Martin Scorse's not quite so but almost magical tribute to Georges Melies and early cinema
","'Hugo' may not be among Martin Scorsese's best, but only because films like 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver', to name a few, are so good and among the best films ever made. Even when Scorsese was not at his best, he was still vastly superior to a lot of directors at their worst.<br/><br/>There is a huge amount to like about 'Hugo', but it is also easy to see why it won't be the cup of tea of some people. For me it was an uneven film, that had many moments where it achieved what it set out to do and others where it didn't, and it is this unevenness that to me that makes 'Hugo' so polarising, loved by some but despised by others.<br/><br/>Starting with the numerous positives, the production values are just exquisite. While my vote for the Best Cinematography Oscar that year would have gone to 'The Tree of Life', 'Hugo's' cinematography is still some of the most beautiful of the year making it one of the year's visually striking films. The set and costume design are both clever and a feast for the eyes, likewise with the 3D effects (some of the best 3D effects personally ever seen in a film, and actually propel the film rather than distracting from), and the lighting also does nothing to hinder that.<br/><br/>Music is haunting, emotive and whimsical in equal measures, and Scorsese shows here how talented a director he is. It is clear that the project meant a lot to him and that he had a lot of love and passion for paying tribute to Melies and early cinema. One also has to give him credit for do something different from the norm, the three big ones being the film being adapted from a children's book (a first for Scorsese), his first use of 3D and having a family that isn't the Mafia.<br/><br/>Along with the visuals, what is also note-worthy is the last thirty minutes. Whatever quibbles can be had with the rest of the film, this part of the film is very nostalgic, thought-provoking and extremely heartfelt. The script doesn't always work but has a lot of philosophical and historical insight, is emotive and does provoke thought in places. There are some good performances in the cast. Asa Butterfield is understated but never cold or a blank in a role that is not as easy as some think, and Chloe Grace Moretz is bright, energetic and charming. Christopher Lee's screen time is limited but it was still a pleasure to see him, a great example of an actor who can do no wrong. Best of all is a superb in every way Ben Kingsley, one of the most experienced and mostly consistent actors who can be relied on to give his all and he does here.<br/><br/>Granted, 'Hugo' is not without its problems. The film is perhaps too long and the pace definitely could have been tightened with a little trimming. That way, some of the storytelling's pacing wouldn't have felt as erratic with the first twenty minutes jumping around to rushed and sprawling effect and while mostly attention-grabbing parts in the middle drag and meander story-wise.<br/><br/>Also could have done without the subplot with Sacha Baron Cohen. That took up too much of the story, and saw some laboured and forced humour (mostly the humour doesn't work) and Baron Cohen overacting so wildly he comes over as more silly and annoying rather than funny and a threat. It may have been an attempt to bridge any gaps but to me it just felt out of place, self-indulgent and jarred too much with everything else. There are numerous cameos from talented actors, but most of them have barely anything to do, so much so you forget that they were even in the film (Jude Law being a prime example).<br/><br/>Concluding this review, less than completely magical but almost. A lot is done right but the film also could have been done better. Not a great film but there was a lot to like and still ended up appreciating it. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

Hugo's father planted in him the seed of desire not to surrender to the dream, thus giving value to every day of his life, forgetting a time of misfortune but sow with gratitude for the gift of life. I've always had the discussion of the question that is better a book or a movie? I think ""Hugo"" shows that both options can create the dreams of a better world. The narrative is a tribute to that thousands of writers who try to sow THROUGH seed Displayand and so exciting and delusional like reading a book and use your imagination as a screen, by the end is to sow in your soul the desire to excel , dream of a better world.

","I read reviews for this movie before turning it on and I was concerned by the number of reviews that said that the story was thin. After having watched it, I now realize that these people simply did not understand, or were not able to fully appreciate the meaning of the film. This film was not made by Martin Scorsese as a filmmaker, but as a film enthusiast. Scorsese has a reputation as one of the most vocal film lovers in Hollywood, and he showcased it in this beautiful movie. His love letter to the origins of cinema, it payed homage to a number of silent films. Though it was based on the life of the influential silent film director Georges Melies, it referenced the original silent film stars such as Chaplin, Keaton, and many others. It also payed homage to some later films that influenced Scorsese including (and most directly) Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows. <br/><br/>I won't beat this to death to much, as it has been said in every review about this movie, but it was also visually incredible. Half life action and half 3D animation, the movie was a work of art just to look at. This was perhaps its most significant tribute to Melies' work as he was so influential in the earliest special effects utilized in film. Overall, I can't say enough great things about this film. It is not typical of Scorsese, but it is amongst his most honest work, and showcases this great director's admiration for his predecessors."
"murtaza_mma","9","0","1","30 May 2015"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: American filmmaker Martin Scorsese's tribute to the unsung heroes of cinema.
","Hugo is an Oscar-winning motion picture directed by veteran American auteur, Martin Scorsese. With Hugo, Scorsese adds a whole new dimension to his oeuvre. Hugo takes a paradigm shift from Scorsese's style of movie-making - usually driven by gore, gangsters and grotesquery - that has been his trademark for over four decades. While the violence and crime has made for subtlety and humor, Scorsese still manages to conjure up an aura of enchanting brilliance in Hugo. Like most of Scorsese's works, Hugo is masterfully crafted, both on technical as well as emotional fronts. In other words, Scorsese once again succeeds in putting a soul into the movie by painting the canvas with colors of his vivid imagination. All this enriches Hugo with an aesthetic feel that greatly enhances its beauty.<br/><br/>In Hugo, Scorsese presents a tale of an orphan boy, Hugo Cabret, who is provided shelter by his drunkard uncle after the accidental death of his father (Jude Law). Hugo assists his uncle in keeping the clocks at the railway station running. Son of a clockmaker, Hugo is adept at fixing clockworks, and his predilection for pilfering mechanical parts in order to mend an automaton - that Hugo's father was trying to repair before his untimely death - brings him face to face with a ruthless proprietor, Monsieur George (Ben Kingsley), who owns a toy store at the station. Monsieur George catches Hugo while the latter was trying to steal a toy from the former's shop, and confiscates his belongings including a notebook - left by Hugo's father - that seems to contain drawings of some mechanical prototypes. On observing the notebook, Monsieur George grows suspicious of Hugo, and inquires him about its source of origin. When Hugo refuses to oblige, Monsieur George threatens to hand him over to the Station Patrol. Hugo pleads to Monsieur George to return his notebook, but the latter threatens to burn it to ashes. Seeing his efforts go in vain, Hugo follows Monsieur George all the way to the latter's home where he gets acquainted with Monsieur George's amiable goddaughter, Isabelle. What ensues is an adventurous journey, which would help unravel the mysteries associated with Monsieur George's obscure, albeit decorated past, and its connection to Hugo's.<br/><br/>Like Woody Allen in Midnight in Paris, Scorsese too chooses the inter-war Paris as the movie's backdrop, but unlike Allen, Scorsese's love for Paris seems rather unbiased, as he chooses to represent the city of love in the microcosm of an ever bustling railway station, occasionally punctuated by quick bursts of joy and sadness. Scorsese uses the movie as a medium to pay tribute to the unsung heroes, the likes of Lumiere Brothers, Georges Melies and numerous other pioneers, who crafted the beautiful world of cinema through their vision, tenacity and hard work. Hugo succeeds in capturing the true beauty and wonder of cinema, as a vicarious medium, which has the power to catapult the viewer into the realm of the unimaginable and the inexpressible. Hugo is a testament to Martin Scorsese's adaptability and versatility as a movie maker, who doesn't leave a single stone unturned in order to conquer the last front: making a foray into a genre that's exactly opposite to his forte. Vintage Scorsese, Hugo simultaneously serves to be an emotional drama as well a visual spectacle.<br/><br/>Almost everyone in the cast gives a memorable performance with special mention of Asa Butterfield who is a treat to watch as Hugo Cabret, and Ben Kingsley who uses his thespian experience to emote with remarkable levels of maturity and panache that's seldom demonstrated by contemporary actors. The movie's background score, cinematography, and editing are all top-notch, and brilliantly complement Scorsese's inspired and imaginative direction. Hugo presents movie making at its absolute best, and is a must watch for everyone across all age groups.<br/><br/>(This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges)"

","(80%) So this is one of the biggest flops of 2011? So what made it big that year? Transformers 2 was a massive hit, Hangover 2, Cars 2, The Smurfs just to name a few. It almost makes one almost give up doesn't it? This really didn't deserve to lose money; although the expense of making it 3D probably didn't help matters, and the fact that it's a 1930's set celebration of very early cinema at a time when general movie goers think movies from around 20 years ago are borderline antique also didn't really help things. But there will always be films that get misunderstood, and this is one of them. First of all it looks great, with its chocolate box style, and keen attention to detail. It also has more than a feel of Tim Burton's better movies to it. The cast is strong, the characters are likable, and of course the direction is always good, and even if the plot isn't exactly water tight, it's still one of the finest family movies of the last few years."

","A captivating movie about an orphan boy who lives day to day in train station. This movie is and easy going, enjoyable movie. It sheds light on the genius known as Georges Melies; a short film master. It is filled with both fantasy ad comedy. This movie had interesting camera angles and a well made set. Although, the train station could be more realistic and fitting to the time period. For example, dirtier. The plot of this film is well made, with the twist of the store owner being Georges. It keeps the audience captivated This film is viewable for all ages. To conclude, this film is well worth watching. I would recommend everyone should see this movie at least once."

","This film was beautifully executed. While the film was semi-realistic, it also had a magic vibe to it which made it much more intriguing. While watching you will never feel bored, it keeps you engaged with its amazing CGI and heartwarming story. The casting was also brilliantly done. Another aspect I particularly liked was how they gave the train station employees and regulars a personality and there own story that Hugo eventually participates in. They act as the comic relief and make the plot feel brighter. The only criticism I would give this is it seem to be lacking character development with the father. Its didn't really give us enough about him and his relationship with Hugo to care about him and since that was the whole reason driving Hugo to fix the robot I feel they could've incorporated more."

","This film was stunning throughout with a lot of scenes that left me wondering how they were accomplished. Although there were a few technical bumps that confused me as well. I believe this film is important for film makers to see due to the beautiful shots and long, fast paced scenes without cuts. The beige-orange colour used in the film created a great feel of the 1930s and each set was compelling, showing that a tremendous amount of energy went into creating the film. <br/><br/>Although I respect this film a great deal for going against the grain and paying tribute to such a great filmmaker, I found that some things took me out of the film. One of these was that at the beginning of the film, we saw that it was set in early day Paris, but all of the actors had British accents, which I spent the entire movie trying to figure out. And I'm still trying to figure it out. Another thing that confused me was the pronunciation of the name 'Georges Méliès'. In the film the actors pronounced the name in a seemingly American way, but the rules of the French language should have an affect. This bothered me because the name was said mostly at the end of the film, so I had trouble concentrating on the most important parts because I was thinking about that.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was beautiful to watch, with some minor technical issues in between, but I would recommend this movie."

","Martin Scorsese writes in 3D a beautiful love letter to the inventors of cinema. The Lumière brothers' invention,the cinema, is a machine and the purpose of this phenomenal and stunning machine is to move our feelings and to amaze us. The world of technological inventions meets the world of dreams and it's like magic. Scorsese shows us the extraordinary story of the man who transformed the machine of the Lumière brothers in art, creating the dream machine. Georges Méliès, the man who sent us to the moon for the first time. Hugo Cabret is an exciting and passionate study on the evolution of narrative through images. An innovative film from the technical point of view (Martin Scorsese for the first time uses the 3D) but that also goes to the rediscovery of the past, to the origins of cinema(with the great tribute to Georges Méliès). The atmosphere of Paris is enveloping, you feel in the gestures, characters and colors, but unfortunately this atmosphere is not reflected in the language, it would have been more authentic speak French. This movie is for everyone because we all dream at least once in our life. This film is for dreamers but also for those who no longer believe in dreams. This film is based on our dreams, on the ruin of them but also on their rebirth. There are a lot of unexpected developments and evolutions in the film. All the characters learn something,there are those who learn things for the first time like the two young adventurers and those who had given up but have also learned to re- open their numb eyes. I like the way the characters get in contact. Hugo doesn't lose hope, he finds and he follows his purpose. He doesn't give up in front of a broken object, he tries to repair it. He understands that we are all here for a reason"
"MilanElliott","7","0","1","3 October 2014"," Hugo was good but slightly disappointing
","Hugo was a decent film with stellar cinematography, great actors and an intriguing, almost, fairy tale story. But the film wasn't amazing. Technically if you broke down each section it should have been but for some reason something was lacking. The movie didn't quite capture my imagination as the book (The Invention of Hugo Cabret) did. The adaptation lacked some parts from the book, both minor and major, that really added to the story. Even something as small as Georges Melies making the comment how he hated Hugo walking behind him because of the sound of his heels against the (Méliès films were melted down and made into shoe heels) Parisian sidewalks saddened him. especially at the end of the book when Hugo has now grown up and made his own automaton which you learn has written the novel you have almost finished. The film missing on these sections that could have greatly added to the movie disappointed me. It had so much more potential for an already good film.<br/><br/>But there were also many things that made this a good film. One that particularly stood out to me was the cinematography and the 3D effects. I would highly recommend watching this in 3D. You can easily tell that this was made to be experienced that way. Scene's like the recreation of L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat really show the creativity of Scorsese. When the short film came out audiences scrambled to get out of the way as they thought they were in danger. In the recreation this part is in 3D so it feels like the train is actually coming at you and for a split second you think that you, too, will be hit. The cinematography also added to Hugo. Scenes that stuck out to me was the camera following Hugo through the station and into the inner workings of the clocks and the overall views of the iconic city Paris. These shots really added to the ""fairy tale"" feel and contributed to a sense of awe that complimented the story.<br/><br/>Overall it was a pretty good movie. I would give it a 7.5 but I can't. It could have been great but it lacked for some parts that would have made the story much better. But it did make up for it in amazing 3D effects and fantastic cinematography.I would highly recommend watching this film but just don't expect it to be as good as the book. But if you have not read the book then you will think this movie is much better."

","Having no knowledge of George Melies' films before watching Hugo, I was quickly hooked into the fictitious mystery of Hugo's automaton. In the outcome, I actually learned a lot from the film. I appreciated how they didn't just turn the fairytale adventure into a life lesson, but they added historical fact to it. Doing this in movies can spark kids interest in various subjects such as film. It's one of those movies where everyone in the family can enjoy it in their own way. The setting that portrays old France although unrealistic, makes the film more fun and interesting to watch than if it had been set in present time. I thought the acting was really fun to watch as well because everybody had such a unique character. Overall I really enjoyed the film."

","A movie that begins notoriously and ends nonchalantly. A trip worth taking. <br/><br/>The name HUGO is the character played by a boy who fixes things. He begins by fixing machines and by the end fixes humans too. It's a simple and yet so well presented. Director Martin Scorcese who is legendary and has a vision of a genius brings this out beautifully right from the very first frame. The scene where the camera traverses all possible things just to give us the glimpse of where the boy is right at the beginning is in itself a statement and the mood has been set for the ride. <br/><br/>This in itself seemed to be a Martin Scorcese biopic as the one who had to find himself in his movies. He was not lost or absent, he was there all these years, yet something was missing, something what I loved in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas was missing and Hugo just brought his touch back. That is, the movie digresses into various subplots and yet the central theme remains a stand out. The whole trip begins with the hint of a girl being avoided for movies. It takes from there on to a different level of discovering a masterpiece and the master behind it.<br/><br/>So in his discovery, there are so many things that unfold and the best part is to know how cinema was made. So I loved this in every way and I wish Scorcese just keeps the film rolling and brings out more adventures like this.<br/><br/>Scorcese made documentaries on great film makers like Kubrick etc.. but this was his greatest tribute to cinema in itself.<br/><br/>A 4/5 for a movie that's a must watch. I wish it was released in India so that I can catch the 3D fun, but I am happy with the blu ray I got for now."

The movie also features a great supporting cast which includes Ben Kingsley who plays as iconic French filmmaker Georges Melies, Chloe Grace-Moretz,Christopher Lee, and Jude Law.Not only that this was an incredible motion picture achievement, it also just as incredible as the book was.The best part of this movie is when Hugo goes with Isabelle to the Melies residence to go to this box where they find drawings from Melies' films most importantly A Trip to the Moon (1902).

","'Hugo' tells the story of young Hugo Cabret; a young orphan who lives in Gare Montparnasse station in 1930s Paris. His father was a watchmaker and together they were repairing an old automaton but when his father was killed in an accident he was taken to the station by his uncle where he keeps the clocks running. In his free time he continues to repair the automaton with parts he steals from the station toy shop. When he is caught the shop owner confiscates his notebook and so begins an adventure as he struggles to get it back. He befriends the shopkeeper's goddaughter, Isabelle, and together they manage to get the automaton working; Hugo had expected it to deliver a message from his father but instead it draws a familiar picture and signs it with the name of the shopkeeper; Georges Méliès a pioneer of early cinema. Georges believes that his work has been lost and forgotten; Hugo and Isabelle must prove otherwise.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese may be better known for fairly violent films but this shows that he has the lightness of touch to make a charming tale with young protagonists that can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. I found it an utter delight and the two hours just flew by. Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Moretz put in fine performances as Hugo and Isabelle. The rest of the cast, which includes many well-known actors also perform well. Watching on television I can't say how good the original 3D effects were but even on the small screen everything looked beautiful; with many scenes referencing famous moments in early cinema. The main story is a delight with moments of sadness and moments of pure joy. Some viewers might be less impressed with the side-story involving Sacha Baron Cohen's Station Inspector who is constantly trying to catch Hugo and have him sent to the orphanage something strange for what is essentially a comic relief character! Initially I thought the character would prove interesting but gradually warmed to him as the story progressed. Overall I'd certainly recommend watching this as I found it utterly delightful."

After World War I, Paris is between wars and struggles to rebuild. Hugo is one of many orphans. Aside from the stunning acting and art direction, I wished he hired more French actors and actresses.

","The atmosphere of the film reminded me very much of that of The Polar Express. I don't know why seeing as I haven't watched that film in probably a decade, but it had a very mystical and magical feel to it. A film about dreams that seemed very dreamlike itself. It was well edited and the effects were fantastical. It was set in the early 20th century and had the feel of it.<br/><br/>The actors were brilliant as well. Asa Butterfield, even at that young age was incredible. He was in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and more recently, Ender's Game. His striking blue eyes really helped convey the emotions of his character well in this film. There are so many rising child actors; where do they get all their talent from?! Chloe Grace as well. I had trouble placing where I'd seen her from until I went on to IMDb to check. I couldn't recognize her without her Hit Girl costume. Plus her character was the total opposite, I guess my brain couldn't connect the dots. That translates to great acting.<br/><br/>I really loved the part where Hugo says: ""I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine. Machines never come with any extra parts, you know. They always come with the exact amount they need. So I figured, if the entire world was one big machine, I couldn't be an extra part. I had to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason too."" Genius.<br/><br/>I don't really have any criticism for this film. Though I think they could've played more with the mechanical man. It was such a big part of the film and is basically what the film is centred on, but it doesn't really do much. After it was fixed, we still see it, but the focus is no longer on it. The focus of the film went from Hugo, the automaton, Georges and finally Isabelle. Not really sure if I liked the many transitions.

","""Hugo,"" the story of a young boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) who lived in the Paris train station and kept the clocks running. He got acquainted with a toy store owner there, Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley) and discovered the man's history as a famous movie maker whose career had been derailed by the War. Melies in real life was famous for his technical advances in movie making, and the story line is the recovery and celebration of his work. Hugo is dogged by the station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) whose main job seems to be apprehending orphans and sending them to the orphanage. He was also injured in the war and has a prosthesis in place of his left leg, which often locks and leaves him unable to move. One of Melies' inventions was an automaton that was able to write and draw. Hugo's father finds the automaton in disrepair and brings it home, and after his death in a fire, Hugo finds himself with the task of completing the repair. He does this and needs only a heart-shaped key to unlock the mechanism so that it will work. This he finds on a chain around the neck of Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) the god-daughter of Melies and his wife Mama Jeanne (Helen McRory) whom Hugo meets when he follows Melies home to retrieve the notebook that came with the automaton that Melies had taken. The mechanical machinations – the train station, the clocks, the automaton, the inspector's leg – become a metaphor for the universe – it's a big machine, and there are no extra pieces. Every one of us has a purpose. And they can all be made to work! The movie ends with a dance scene at the party after the reclamation of Melies' work. The heart-shaped key is required to set the whole machine in motion."

","Set in 1930s France, Hugo, is a film about a 12 year old boy, Hugo Cabret's (played by Asa Butterfield) quest to find answers about the mysterious death of his father. Hugo's father (Jude Law) was a clock repairman who was faced with the task of raising his son alone after the death of his wife. While Hugo was in school, his father still spent time teaching him his trade. Hugo and his father were trying to fix an automaton his father had found abandoned in a museum when he died in a fire accident. After his father's death, Hugo was adopted by his alcoholic uncle, Claude Cabret (Ray Winstone) who also worked as a clock repairman for the city's rail station. When Claude mysteriously disappeared, Hugo continued to service the rail station's clock while living in the clock tower so that he will not be discovered and sent to the orphanage. Hugo continued to spend his time trying to fix the automaton left behind by his father; he would steal parts and tools from a local toy repair shop owned by a sad looking old man, Papa Georges, played by Ben Kingsley. One day, papa George caught Hugo trying to steal his toys and seized his notebook in retaliation. Hugo recruits Papa George's foster child Isabelle, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, to help him retrieve the notebook. This plot starts a strong friendship between the two kids, and opens up a new secret about Papa George which has been hidden for a long time. The theme of the film is about healing the broken hearted by fixing the broken pieces in one's life and not giving up one's dreams and aspirations. The focus of the film is on a plot to fix the broken automaton left behind by Hugo's father, but in the process of fixing the automaton, broken hearts are mended, and dashed dreams are revived. A good reference to the theme of the movie is a line from Papa George when he said of Hugo, ""I am here today because of a young man who found a broken machine and against all odds, he fixed it"". Elements of the film that contribute to the theme include the soft color palette; there is an overall cool color tone to reflect the time\period of the movie. The color palette is also a reflection of the unusual depressive mood in the movie. All the major actors had some form of gloom around them, from Hugo, to Papa George (including Mama George), to the station officer etc, were not happy characters, this is in contrast to the final scene, where the colors suddenly lights up with each character being bubbly and individual issues fixed. The classic music tracks played in the film are also a good element to the film. The music, at times fast and other times slow were consistent with the tempo of the movie. The movie soundtracks are definitely well blended into the overall theme of the film. The film, Hugo is an ageless movie whose story talks about courage, dedication, and perseverance of a young man in his search of closure as summed up by Isabelle in her final line of the movie, ""this singular young man searched so hard to find a secret message from his father and how that message lit his way all the way home""."

Coming from master of cinema this is just a decent movie.<br/><br/>From technical point of view the movie deserved all the Oscar awards and nominees . ""Hugo"" looks good , even if the CGI is too visible sometimes. You can find many more or less subtle references to old movies ( For example ""Safety last"" – it's even on the movie poster) . The acting is good . Only Sacha Baron Cohen seems to be miscast . He is rather annoying instead of funny . Not to mention he can't give his character true depth that is required in the final of the movie.<br/><br/>The biggest problem however is the screenplay. This movie is nothing by generic family friendly movie. It's not too deep. It's ABSOLUTELY predictable . There are no surprises or twists. It was hard for me as an adult to watch this movie , because every message is told loud and straight to the audience face ( The broken machines are like people who lost their dreams etc. etc. ). I think Scorsese made a movie for kids not adults. This is not necessarily a bad thing , but Scorsese lacks the sensibility of Steven Spielberg to direct this kind of movie. The movie didn't left me cold , I felt something , but I wasn't in tears or anything like that.<br/><br/>For a movie about movie magic there isn't too much magic here. I give it 7/10."

It is too accomplished, too polished and ultimately too life- and soulless, like Scorcese himself has become a robot who pretends to have human emotions but just goes through the notions. First off I thought I had put in ""The Polar Express"" by mistake. This cg-world is supposed to be from the man who made ""Raging Bull""? I cringed for Cohen and all the Amelie-like side-stories. And I always heard a loud voice in my head, bellowing: ""Come on! Isn't that quirky and charming? IT IS! ISN'T IT?"" But there is a very telling moment in the movie that made me think. When Melies bows down to that kid in his studio and asks him: ""Did you ever wonder where your dreams come from? THIS is where they are made."" It wasn't touching, it was scary, a bit like ""1984"". Movies have become the ultimate dream-control-devices, because nothing is left for the imagination of the viewer, nothing at all, saccharine music in every scene, plot-points you can set a stop-watch to, even the colors get tweaked to resemble a certain emotion you are supposed to feel. With Melies it was all theatrics, woodwork, floorboards and you filled up the rest in your head. With Melies movies where a starting point for dreaming. With a film like Hugo it's the mournful waking up."

The tiny visuals shown during the Oscar ceremony made me believe that there would be a lot of magic and a lot of action in it. Also the name of the film Hugo made me believe it would largely be about the boy and his adventures. The film turned out to be something else and it probably was my expectation that made it disappointing for me. I kept waiting for miracles and action, but there was a lot of conversation instead which made a very lengthy film even lengthier. Though, I have to admit that I loved the art and the cinematography. The 3D effects were great and I just loved the old Paris station. I kept wondering how different life was several decades ago and how much things have changed now. I also liked the story of George Melies, his filming days, the history of cinema and the several short film shots of the classic era. The Lumière Brothers 'Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat' part was also interesting. So Hugo hardly played any role there which made me believe that the filmmakers suddenly focused on different track altogether in the second half. Overall a good experience but not a great one. Watch it once for 3D and the great classic period, but you may not watch it again."
"Buddy-51","7","0","2","27 April 2012"," dazzling visuals and a love of cinema overcome the movie's flaws
","Melding elements of both Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger into a single character, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a homeless orphan who lives surreptitiously inside a great train station in Paris circa 1931. To assuage his loneliness and to give some purpose to his life, he fixes and maintains the station's many elaborate time-pieces - and, to survive, he furtively steals food from the local vendors selling their wares there.<br/><br/>A life-affirming departure for the normally dark and brooding Martin Scorsese, ""Hugo"" is such a beautifully crafted work of commercial cinema that I feel a trifle ungrateful for not actually liking it more - though, more accurately perhaps, I should say that I love the final third of the film but have some reservations about what comes before. It is certainly a wonder to behold in terms of its art direction and scenic design, which together help to create a never-never world of Art Deco architecture and breathtaking cityscapes, where the surreal and the real comfortably meet - a fitting visual correlative, as it turns out, for the theme of the film. And it goes without saying that the movie richly merited each of the many awards it earned for its visual accomplishments.<br/><br/>Adapted by John Logan from the Brian Selznick novel, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret,"" ""Hugo"" is at its most magical when it is reveling in and celebrating the pioneer days of filmmaking, particularly the fantastical works of magician and special effects wizard Georges Melies (""A Trip to the Moon""), who is an actual character in the movie (played by Ben Kingsley). It seems, according to the story, that Melies left filmmaking an embittered, forgotten has-been and now owns a toy booth in the very train station that Hugo calls home. One fateful day, Hugo and Melies' paths cross - and so the adventure begins <br/><br/>Given all these quality elements, what then are my objections to the film? Primarily, they rest in the fact that, as a central figure, Hugo is too lacking in fire and passion to generate much interest for the audience; that the secondary characters - particularly Sacha Baron Cohen as a war-ravaged security guard - come across more as live-action cartoon figures than as real people; and that the storytelling and pacing in the first half of the film often lag behind the visual stimulation. All these work as distancing devices that keep us from becoming as fully engaged in the plot and the world of the film as we perhaps would like to - until the last third, that is.<br/><br/>And that final third winds up making all the difference, as it brings together the movie's disparate elements into a unifying theme of fixing that which is broken - be it a mechanical device or the human heart. This theme is reflected in the film's visual motif of endless machines, both those that are functional and those that are in need of repair. And Scorsese's meticulous re-creation of Melies' classic works is indeed a wonder to behold.<br/><br/>There is one glaring anachronism, however: though the story is set in 1931, Hugo at one point makes reference to having seen Errol Flynn in ""Robin Hood,"" a movie that wasn't released until 1938! A prescient kid, that Hugo."

","You could imagine from the name, from the director and producer and from the trailer that this film is going to be an extravaganza of marvel and beauty. Indeed, it is a movie about finding purpose, about old mechanical machines, books and movies, about happy endings. It should have been a wonderful film and, in part, it mostly was. But I can't help feel that it missed its target. The images were not as wondrous as they were meant to be, the child actors were not terribly easy to empathise with and the reactions of characters in the film were pretty weird to begin with. It all left me in the ""uncanny valley"" when you know something is off, but you can't just put your finger on it.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean the story was not interesting, the budget high and the interpretation good. It starred Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee, for crying out loud, and it was about one of the oldest and greatest film makers of all time. The movie was close to great. Just close."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","26 March 2012"," The young boy who keeps the clocks running in the Paris train station.
","With as much advance publicity this film received ... several Oscars and awarded best film of the year by some groups ... it would be easy to be disappointed, but my wife and I were not. It is a very entertaining and very visually pleasing movie. <br/><br/>Set in 1930s Paris the first thing is not to be thrown off by all the characters speaking with a British accent. In a form of throwback this is how movies were often made back in the middle of the 20th century. <br/><br/>The story starts with the Paris train station at its busiest, with the Eiffel tower in the background. In the first 2 minutes we get glimpses of most of the main characters, and all of them by the 4 minute mark. The title character is Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret whom we soon discover is living in the expansive walls of the train station and keeping the massive clocks wound and running. We wonder, how did he get to this point, and why is an 11-year-old allowed to do this? <br/><br/>Hugo is a fictional character but Ben Kingsley plays the real Georges Méliès, the French auteur who in the late 1890s and early 1900s made dozens of movies each year, and pioneered many of the film techniques that would shape the future of the industry. Méliès was in his 70s by the 1930s and was nearing his demise. He had long quit making movies and now makes a small living selling items in the train station. This movie is a relatively accurate depiction of him. <br/><br/>Their paths cross when Hugo is trying to pilfer a mechanical mouse but is grabbed and forced to surrender his notebook, with the mysterious drawings of an automaton, a mechanical man that also had a history in Méliès' life.<br/><br/>What might seem like an unusual choice Sacha Baron Cohen (of 'Borat' fame) plays the Station Inspector after petty criminals and runaways. He is very effective in this role.<br/><br/>American Chloë Grace Moretz (vampire in 'Let Me In'), about the same age as Butterfield, is Isabelle and lives in Méliès' household, although she says he is not her grandfather. She and Hugo eventually become fast friends and she helps assure his notebook is not burned.<br/><br/>Jude Law has a small but important role as Hugo's dad.<br/><br/>So, what is this movie about? The young boy gaining some resolution about his dad and becoming a spark to get Méliès excited about movies again right before his death. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Hugo knew little about the automaton that his dad salvaged when it was being discarded, but the notebook was of his dad's drawings to try to rebuild it. His dad died in a tragic explosion and fire and Hugo took refuge in his dad's old job to avoid being placed with his drunkard uncle. The automaton originated with Méliès who was shaken by the images it brought back in his mind."

Hugo meets a bitter toyshop owner that takes an interest in him and his interests. Later the boy finds a friend in the toy merchant's daughter who helps the boy to explore his memories of his troubled childhood and clockwork hobbies.

The portable film screen used to show Mrs. Milies her husband's film remaining film by the museum professor was not available during the time period of this film, an anachronism.<br/><br/>*Emotion- An enjoyable but rather preachy film on the origins and scarcity of early 'Flickers"" one reel films from the 1890's by George Milies encased in a family drama. While the narrative plot of this film is thin but charming, the rest of the film is a bio-pic of George Milies and tediously showcased his life and his works. The acting in this film was pedestrian but the biographic matter was of some note to hardcore film students and historians. Mainstream audience will find this film slow and boring with little human pathos. There were too many boring digital dolly tracking shots, disgusting digital 'dust in the air' shots and infinity digital sets shots that detracted greatly from the enjoyment of the dramatic scenes. The character development was lacking in many of the more colorful characters. I found myself wanting & watching them and not the lead actors. A pretentious film of a overbearing point of view which was not very entertaining."
"saadgkhan","6","0","2","5 March 2012"," Good but Hugo's story is actually not that fascinating...
","HUGO – CATCH IT ( B ) It's really hard to describe Hugo as it's not one of the CGI children movies. It's more complicated and to be honest more mature for children. The story may involve a kid living and hiding at the franc train station but it's not for kids. Hugo is directed by Martin Scorsese and has great production value. From its train station to costumes everything is simply stunning. I must say that Mr. Scorsese has worked really hard on the detailing about the era. The movie showcases the time frame and look which we don't see that often in such aesthetic way on screen. Chloe Morets and Asa Butterfield did a fantastic job as well Ben Kingsley and Emily Mortimer. For me Sasha Baron Cohan was the best as after watching him playing and living characters like Ali G, Borat, Bruno and now Dictator. It's just so good to see him acting like a normal actor. As far as the movie goes it's a good movie but as great to be remembered. The problem with the movie is that Hugo's story is actually not that fascinating enough. It's not the kind of story we like to see for two hours on cinema. If Martin Scorsese didn't direct this, it would not have been that much appreciated. Overall, it's a good movie but I would not recommend to someone at least."

","Hugo is a visually stunning film. The film is fluent, steady and quick with a myriad of harmoniously balanced scenes and colorful stages. However, it lacks a film narrative that is purposeful and captivating. Half way through the film, the main (and seemingly only) task at hand was deliver. So what is next? And how is this linked to the other thing? Huh? Think of Twin Peaks and the discovery of Laura Palmer's murderer in the middle of the second season(and how this inevitably led Twin Peaks to be canceled)... and now there is a passage to hell in twin peaks? <br/><br/>This is a great homage to one of the most important entrepreneurs in the history of film but as a film, is does not capture the viewer's imagination. <br/><br/>AND.... what's up with people having french mannerisms but British accents..."
"h-b-bos","7","0","3","26 February 2012"," Good but not excellent
","Meant to be visually stunning, it fell a little short to my expectations. The visual effects may fool the children, but at some point they will get annoying. When Hugo is within the walls of the train station you will notice that his movements do not fit the constraints of the architecture as you saw it in the interior of the station. The train station and the space between the walls are obviously different worlds. Another flaw is that there are several shots which would have the camera position as much as three times as high as the Eiffel tower. There is no such tall building in the vicinity of the Eiffel tower in my recollection of Paris, especially not in the time in which the movie is set. I also noticed I got a little bored with the 'steampunk' clockworks and machinery that you see in this movie, the golden compass and likes. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the wild experiments of the beginning of film making, in which the main character George Melies plays a big role. You feel the excitement of new inventions and wonders of technology. But I fear that this movie suffers too much from lack of focus; children will miss the different layers and will probably be bored and the storytelling will leave adults something to wish for."
"shriharipandula","5","0","2","25 February 2012"," English sight, French taste, and American stink
","The positioning is vague, Hugo is definitely not a film for children just because 2 kids star in it. If kids liked this movie, I am sure they loved Titanic too! It's a movie out and out for film-making lovers who know or are curious of the film history. Scorsese tried to give us a ride into the past using clips of earliest of the films but somehow the nostalgia wasn't created enough. The storyline is more or less a Brit drama. Cinematography is brilliant in the first 2 scenes which coupled up with seamless editing and fx but blame the DI team for inconsistent saturation and contrast throughout the film. In the predictive story element, the relationship between film-making, automaton, magic tricks, and mechanical toys have been established but somehow it shows the convenience of the script writers who totally dealt with under-developed characters till the very end. They also didn't seem to understand that there's a difference between artistic storytelling and drag which made the film terribly slow in the first half. It looked like a couple of good-to-have (as opposed to must-have) scenes were just added externally to display 3D special effects workmanship that were barely palatable. Actors were flawless. The film-title at start may be clichéd but the background score at end credits is lovely. Hugo is in talks only because of ""Scorsese"", rest everything, the kids, 3D, graphics, history, is plain effective marketing. I may have expected more from a Scorsese movie, but Hugo didn't even reach up to my average expectations from cinema."
"yorkshire_keith","7","0","3","23 February 2012"," Beautiful but flawed
","This is a lovely film, no doubt about it. It's a heart warming with some of the most well thought out cinematography I've seen in a long time. If you see this film for no other reason see it for classic shot after classic shot whether it's 3D or not. <br/><br/>Never the less it's not perfect and the two reasons are:- the dialogue which is incredibly inconsistent and the acting which similarly sways between brilliant and average. Some of the speeches which in the film change the outlooks and attitudes of major characters, I just didn't feel would do so. When that happens you're left with that ""Oh Come on!""or""as if!"" feeling a little two often. As I've said a lot of that is down to the dialogue which isn't strong enough on occasion to elicit the resulting attitudes and actions from it's recipients no matter how well delivered and some is down to the acting which is a bit laboured now and again particularly from Hugo himself. I wonder if Martin expected a little too much from his younger talent and should have given stronger or more prescriptive direction on occasion. <br/><br/>I'd be surprised if most young teenagers would pick up on this and I doubt it will spoil the story or cinema experience at all for those between 9 and 14. For younger children I think it will prove a bit slow. For older ones a bit ""nice"" but that's more a fault with exploitative video from the music and games industries than a serious fault with the film.<br/><br/>In every other respect. Set design, special effects, music, minor character portrayal, costume "" apart from (like war Horse) the main characters hair-cut which is not very 1930.(My dad was 10 in 1930 I've seen the pictures), It's a tour de force. <br/><br/>As a fifty year old film fan taking my daughter to the cinema She was bored in places but overall very much enjoyed the film. I thought it was nice; not credible in places and as a result very slightly disappointing."

Not to take anything away from this movie, I was impressed by the cast and the fact that Sacha Cohen does a pretty decent job.

"jadepietro","7","0","1","29 December 2011"," Hugo: Like A Tin Man In Search of a Heart
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>Time is of the essence and creativity is at the heart of Hugo, Martin Scorsese's so-called children's film about a boy and his robot. It's 1930 and Hugo Cabret ( Asa Butterfield ) is an orphan who secretly lives behind the clockwork of a Paris train station and dreams of a better life. Left alone by his inventor father, played by Jude Law, Hugo survives from day to day at the Gare Montparnasse. His father's lasting legacy to him is a robot in need of repair which Hugo diligently works on using stolen gears from a toy store at the station. One of the missing components is an elusive key to put all the gears into motion. Achieving that goal will take him on a journey unlike any before. <br/><br/>It is at the train depot that he soon befriends a shop owner ( Ben Kingsley, giving a superb performance ) and his daughter, Isabelle ( Chloe Grace Moretz ). However, not everyone finds Hugo endearing, especially the station inspector who is always on the hunt for him. Sasha Baron Cohen plays the villain of the piece and provides the broad comedy and slapstick to entertain the younger members of the movie audience while the older moviegoers can be transported along with them to an imaginative world of adventure.<br/><br/>Based on Brian Selznick best-selling book, The Inventions of Hugo Cabret, and adapted by John Logan, the film is breathtaking in its visual splendor, but rather mechanical and leaden in its story. The characters and sets seem to be inspired and resemble the detailed illustrations of another children's author, Chris VanAllberg. With the state-of-the-art technology on this big screen adaptation, the camera artfully glides and soars, showcases the 3-D experience to its maximum effect and in the hands of a master like Scorsese. All moviegoers will be totally enthralled by the CGI, even when the story begins to lose some momentum in its narrative focus. The tracking shots, especially the opening sequence, and the fluid camera movements are astonishing and literally carry the viewer into a journey to another dimension. Scorsese's impressive use of swinging pendulums, metal staircases and moving gears, his use of smoke and dust particles floating in the air, his aerial perspectives within the train station, all add to the film's sense of awe. ( By the way, Hugo's surrealistic dream sequence is pure artistry. ) This film's technical craftsmanship is the best use of 3-D since Avatar. <br/><br/>Yet, my movie-going experience felt a bit incomplete due to the narrative structure of the film. At times, Hugo strays from the central plot and begins to meander. The children's adventure is at odds with its overt history lesson of early filmmaking. The two story lines never connect. The first half of the film is too leisurely paced and the minor characters remain only one- dimensional, continually upstaged by the lavish three-dimensional trappings. Children should be children, and children's films should be children's films, keeping their lighthearted nature with less pontificating. When Hugo takes itself too seriously, which is most of the time, it becomes somewhat inert. <br/><br/>The film wants to work on another more sophisticated level with its love of film imagery and its heartfelt nostalgic view of the early days of filmmaking. While the film has moments that enchants as a children's fantasy should, to this adult in the audience, it became slightly desperate in its attempt to become more serious straining its credibility whenever it served as an homage to talents of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and specifically to Georges Méliès, a pioneer of early cinema. ( In fact, the shopkeeper is one and the same man and that plot device bears some truth. ) <br/><br/>Scorsese has assembled a first-class team to handle the production values: music score by Howard Shore, absolutely terrific cinematography by Robert Richardson, editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, costumes by Sandy Powell, and an overall production design by Dante Ferretti, whose period sets are reminiscent of the old sepia stereoscopic images of time past. These are all gifted and accomplished artisans in their respective fields, and this film contains some of their finest work to date.<br/><br/>Like its automaton, Hugo is a technically brilliant creation lacking in genuine emotion. Still, the film is quite captivating and an impressive achievement in modern day filmmaking. ( Make sure you take the time to see this film experience in its 3-D format and on the large screen for optimal effect. ) Hugo is a thrilling joyous ride into the world of 3-D and the vivid imagination of one of our foremost directors.

","The trailer for Hugo was intriguing, and I expected to see an engaging adventure between 2 children and the automaton. That did indeed occur - but even better was the factor of the silent films. Earlier this year I began studying the history of film making, and that means the silent film era. When Hugo took Isabel to the silent film, my level of interest picked up. Then as the story of George came into play, I fell in love. Suddenly the story went from something nice to something so wonderful. The setting in the Paris train station,and the characters were also wonderful, and I think it must have made for some tricky editing decisions as to how much of those stories to portray.
