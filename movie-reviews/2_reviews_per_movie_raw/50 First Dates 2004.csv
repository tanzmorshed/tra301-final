"EvilNeverDies","Null","209","234","23 November 2005"," This is what you call a 'feel-good' film
","The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: Henry Roth lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment. Then he meets Lucy Whitmore. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn't even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn't overly stupid, but it's not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film's true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to Henry who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with Lucy, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. Henry's character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with Lucy, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn't really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn't even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended."

","See, I am a married man. And watching this movie, at home on the sofa with my wife whom I love above anything and hopefully always will, almost brought me to tears and easily did her. This movie, no matter all the overdone/overacted characters and the fact that Adam Sandler is probably the worst person in the world the act crying, is simply the best description of love ever. To have the energy to every day win over the heart of the one you love, is what we all should do, though ever so often don't have the energy to.<br/><br/>I believe that movie criticism often nitpicks too much on technical details or other such stuff of -actually- little importance. Show me a person who is not moved by this film and I show you a person who knows zip about real love. Real, I mean. I am not a religious person and this made me feel closer to what people often call God, whatever that is. Maybe I exaggerate, but I want to. And no work of art, of any genre, can be asked to do any more. On scale of 1 to 10, this goes to 11. (Can you see?!)"
"Bob-45","10","142","169","25 June 2004"," Amazingly Good
","Take a little ""Memento,"" Add a generous helping of ""Groundhog Day,"" and even a little of ""Sommersby"" and you have ""50 First Dates"". Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler create a synergy that neither has been able to capture with anyone else. Together, they produce a romantic team comparable to Gere and Roberts, Day and Hudson, Grant and Loren and Tracy and Hepburn. My wife and I watch ""The Wedding Singer"" at least once a year. While ""50 First Dates"" is a superior movie, I don't know if I can take the melancholy ending again.<br/><br/>
For once I'm grateful for the Khamakazee antics of Sandler's acting ensemble, particulary Sean Astin and Rob Schneider.  If Schneider wasn't playing such a farcial role, he would be a natural for an Oscar. Certainly the animals add a lot to the farce. The goofy humor makes the basically tragic scenario not only bearable but almost pleasant. It's also genuinely funny.<br/><br/>Sandler convincingly plays a marine biologist(!!!)in Hawaii who enjoys ""entertaining"" the ""mainlanders."" Sandler doesn't date ""locals"". He wants nothing to interfere with his dream of studying walruses. He discovers Barrymore having breakfast in a local bar and grill. What captures Sandler's attention, even more than her beauty, is Barrymore's creativity. What Sandler doesn't know is that Barrymore has brain damage. The brain cells which move short term memory to long term storage are destroyed. She forgots everything she's learned during the day while she sleeps. So, Sandler, the lothario who forgots his relationships with mainlanders after one week finds himself in love with a woman who forgets hers in 24 hours. That's writing genius, something you don't see very often, and Sandler, Barrymore, and Sandler's acting troupe handle it perfectly.<br/><br/>Though my wife is physically handicapped, my mother has severe short term memory loss. So, I really related to the trajedy so expertly portrayed in ""50 First Dates"". It's not often I give a movie that leaves me this sad a ""10"". The last time, I believe, was ""Sommersby"". Nonetheless, ""50 First Dates"" is a ""10,"" since there is nothing about it I can suggest that make it better. <br/><br/>P.S. Looking forward to the NEXT Sandler/Barrymore collaboration."

","This is an excellent movie, I enjoyed every bit of it. It has a cleverish dialogue, a good ascending of events, and a good ending. Long story short, this is a movie that should NOT die. Sure, it has some downs, for example the underwhelming thought-woulda- been-funny scenes (like the penguin's). The hispanic dude was really good though, he had this fine impact on the movie.<br/><br/>Anyways, you gotta give this movie a shot, it is hilarious, and fantastic."
"jfwhelan","7","131","160","28 January 2005"," I Enjoyed it.
","This is quite simply a very enjoyable film. It's not, perhaps, a great film, but it is fun and it left me feeling pleasantly content. Basically this is a romantic comedy about a man (Henry) and a woman (Lucy) who meet and fall in love, there is just one problem: Lucy won't remember, tomorrow.<br/><br/>It is easy to pick holes in films and yes there are things wrong with this film:- <br/><br/><ul><li>The first 5 to 10 minutes do seem a little out of place: I understand the need to set the scene, but couldn't help feeling that the pace and characterisations didn't quite fit with what was to come.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some of the characters take away from the story: Doug (Sean Astin) is a little over done and comes across as more damaged than his sister. Perhaps the worst, though, is Henry's female (?) assistant: this character was a mistake and did not belong in the film.</li></ul><br/><br/>In the end, these flaws don't matter: the film is enjoyable and that is what counts.<br/><br/>The plot, even if somewhat contrived, is clever and in the context of the film believable: there is a good beginning, middle and surprisingly satisfying end. Some of the difficult aspects of the film are not ignored but properly dealt with. Clearly it is easy to read a sordid side into the idea of a man meeting a beautiful woman each day in the knowledge that she will forget everything and they can start again tomorrow. This is covered and Henry is asked some pointed questions; without giving anything away, his answers worked and leave us, the audience, able to enjoy the film, without any unpleasant nagging doubts or feelings of guilt.<br/><br/>Don't analyse or pick holes; just watch this film. Chances are very good that you will enjoy it. It is a fantasy a bit of escapism: a first rate piece of entertainment and hopefully it will leave you, as it did me, feeling pleasantly content."
"jamesbourke59","10","68","87","14 April 2005"," A Movie For All Seasons
","Lets face it, when Adam Sandler needs a hit movie, who is he going to call, Drew Barrymore of course, and indeed why not, after the sentimental success of The Wedding Singer, anything these two bright young things appeared in together would be nothing short of pure gold.<br/><br/>A perfect case in point is 50 First Dates. Now as a rule i would never break out in a fever to go see anything with Adam Sandler's name attached to it, however i broke the rule when i first went to see The Wedding Singer, which contained many charming and heartfelt moments, as well as the comedic, aside from that one the only other film of note on Sandler's resume for me anyway has been Billy Madison.<br/><br/>Like all good things that come to pass, in between the misses more than hits, along comes the last to date pairing of Sandler and Barrymore. A movie i missed on it's theatre run but more than made up for it by viewing on DVD then subsequently purchasing it.<br/><br/>A lighthearted take on the notion of amnesia, with the emphasis clearly billed around a love story. We watch as local Hawaiian vet, Henry Roth, played by Sandler stumbles through existence, dating and dumping female holidaymakers, all the while searching for that perfect one. Into his life comes Lucy played rather charmingly by Drew Barrymore.<br/><br/>Of course loves young dream could never run smoothly, remember we have 95 minutes running time on this movie, So as soon as they have met and broke bread, the dawning of a new day arrives, but not without it's hitch. Without giving too much away, just in case their might be someone out there who hasn't seen this film, regardless of the hiccups that ensue throughout.<br/><br/>We are party to many highlights, which include Rob Schneider as Henry Roth's less than able sidekick Ula, Jocko the Sea lion and many many more. I personally never tire of watching it, not to the extent of reaching fifty times but i do regard it as a breath of fresh air, even if Adam Sandler parlays his usual bag of comedic tricks, but hey the late great Chris Farley did the same and it worked.<br/><br/>Truly a movie for all seasons, and a must if you are in a relationship. A resounding 10 out of 10 and that is saying something for a movie with Adam Sandler in it!"
"marmac2768","8","88","115","14 November 2004"," A very entertaining film
","When ""50 First Dates) came to theaters, I really wasn't interested enough to go see it. When it came out on video, I waited about 2 months to see it until it came down to the $1.99 rental price.<br/><br/>Was I surprised! This movie was so entertaining to me, that I wound up buying it. I only buy about 5 or 6 videos a year, so you can see that I really must have enjoyed it. It won't win any Oscars, but it will make you feel good when you watch it.<br/><br/>I am familiar with the condition that Lucy has here having a cousin who has a similar problem and has had it for several years. I was really concerned with how a production company can play a condition like that for laughs, but, somehow, they pulled it off. They treated the subject matter with dignity showing that the people who have this terrible condition can (and do) have somewhat normal lives. My cousin does it the diary way. She doesn't lose her memory everyday, but at different times. She has gone as long as 3 months in retaining her memory and has lost it on other occasions after 4 hours. <br/><br/>I am not a big Adam Sandler fan, having always thought he was a bit ""over the top"" in his other films. I thought he was going to do this in this film as well after the first few minutes of the movie. However, when he is shown in the diner with Lucy, he shows that he is really a nice guy who, deep down, wants to find a relationship that is fulfilling with a pretty girl.<br/><br/>Drew Berrymore is another actress that I don't particularly care for most of the time, but she is really a sweetheart playing Lucy. She is just so lovable in this role, it's hard to believe that she has the Demons in her past. <br/><br/>Rob Schneider is very good in his supporting role as is Sean Astin as Doug, the 'roid raging brother of Lucy.<br/><br/>Again, not an Oscar winner, but well worth the $15 or so to purchase it at WalMart.<br/><br/>Marty"

","Henry Roth is a man afraid of commitment up until he meets the beautiful Lucy. They hit it off and Henry think he's finally found the girl of his dreams, until he discovers she has short-term memory loss and forgets him the very next day.<br/><br/>At first, I just liked some of the usual humor: the use of spam to make me believe we were really in Hawaii. And also Rob Schneider, who is often the funniest person in Sandler's films. (He is still good here, though perhaps not at his best.) <br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised that amidst the stupid humor was an actual story about love and the growing bond of two people. There could have been a variety of ""Groundhog Day"" jokes. And indeed, there were some. But the character Sandler plays is actually quite sweet. Who knew?"

","Let me start this review by admitting that Adam Sandler is at the bottom of my 'funny people'-list. The guy just doesn't do anything for me. I don't think he's funny at all. I think Drew Barrymore is absolutely hilarious though and she carries every single movie she makes.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of the movie are awful. Every cliché in the books passes us and Adam Sandler is simply horrible. After the first ten minutes something changes though. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe I learned to appreciate the humor or maybe the movie got funnier, I don't know, but...what a great movie it is.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with the story of the movie, but this is it in a nutshell: Henry (Adam Sandler) meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in a diner and the two really connect. The next day she doesn't remember him though and Henry finds out that due to a car accident, Lucy suffers from short memory loss. Meaning that everyday she wakes up under the impression that it's still the day of the car accident. She does the same thing every day, over and over again, not remembering what she did the day before. Henry believes Lucy is worth fighting for and every single day he manages to make Lucy fall in love with him. He hopes one day she will wake up and remember him. This of course never happens. He stays true to her though and the two get married and have a daughter.<br/><br/>What surprised me about the movie is that it's definitely not just a comedy. Sure, it's funny at points and even hilarious sometimes (Like ten-second Tom for example), but...it's just very romantic. There's just something deep behind the whole idea of 'falling in love with someone over and over again'. This movie deals with that in the literal sense and there's just something beautiful about that.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Drew Barrymore shines as always in this movie that goes a little deeper than your average romantic comedy. And Adam Sandler? He's not all that bad.<br/><br/>I give this movie 8/10 stars. I loved it."

Not only is it funny, but it has just the right amount of romance to pull at your heart string without ripping it out. <br/><br/>Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are the perfect on screen couple. Their chemistry seems so real. Not to mention they both just look so darn cute next to each other.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie to anyone."

","This is a movie I never get sick of watching and have watched it far too many times to keep count. 
If you are into romantic comedies this is a must see, there are so many funny characters in it you will just have to laugh out loud at some point.
Rob Schneider's character is just hilarious and if you don't laugh at him, well........
As always Drew Barrymore's acting is sublime and the movie is worth watching just for her.
Not really your typical over the top Adam Sandler movie, but most if not all Adam Sandler fans will love this one."

","Not being an Adam Sandler fan, we avoided this film when it was released earlier last year. The premise sounded too much like ""Groundhog Day"". We took a chance the other night when it was shown on cable, and frankly, we found the movie entertaining. There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, ""Punch Drunk Love"".<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore and Mr. Sandler had worked together before to surprisingly good results. They show an easy chemistry between them that serves the movie well. The idea of making Adam Sandler an aquarium doctor offers a lot of possibilities; his scenes with the walrus are hilarious.<br/><br/>The supporting cast plays well together. A surprise was Rob Schneider, not one of my favorite actors, either, but in here, under the direction of Peter Segal, he delivers. Sean Astin, as the lisping brother on steroids is quite effective, as well as Blake Clark, as Lucy's father. Dan Aykroyd puts an appearance as the doctor who treats the young woman who has lost her long term memory.<br/><br/>Watch it without any preconceptions, as probably it will surprise you."
"christian123","7","39","54","24 January 2005"," Hilarious
","50 First Dates is a very funny movie and for Sandler its one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a womanizing marine biologist afraid to commit, who falls for the woman of his dreams, played by Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, she has a brain disorder that makes her forget everything that happened the day before whenever she falls asleep, so every day, he needs to win her over and make her fall in love with him anew. The plot is nothing new as this movie is a cross between Memento and Groundhog Day both very good movies. What makes this movie work is the chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler since they work so great together and make the film fun and also this film is better then Sandler's last effort Anger Management. Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. Drew Barrymore is very good in her role as Lucy and she makes up for the horrible Duplex. The supporting cast is also very good with the best being Sean Austin. Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. The last main part of the cast is Dan Aykroyd and his role isn't very memorable. This movie has good intentions and some sad moments like when Lucy finds out she can never have her memory restored or when she sees pictures of herself from the accident. However, there's also some gross humor so I think this movie can appeal to everyone under the age of 21. Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy."
"lee_eisenberg","7","55","82","4 October 2005"," If I could do this...
","Okay, so ""50 First Dates"" is mostly silly, but they do a good job with it. Honolulu veterinarian Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) falls for Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), only to find out that, due to an accident, her memory only lasts one day, so she won't remember him the next day! How will Henry cope with this? The movie gravitates between goofy and sensitive, but never gets mind-numbing; Adam Sandler always has something up his sleeve, and he and Barrymore have a great time with the material. As is often the case in Adam Sandler's movies, one of the characters is an embarrassment to everyone else (in this case, it's Rob Schneider as Henry's whacked-out friend Ula). Great fun.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing: don't watch ""50 First Dates"" if you haven't seen ""The Sixth Sense"" first."

","I can't begin to say how much I like this movie. Barrymore is better in this than the Wedding Singer. It is a Sandler comedy so I've rated it with the idea in mind that it's purpose is to make you laugh and also tells a great, albeit unlikely story. Sandler is superb in movies he doesn't write. I don't like most of the movies where Sandler has had a heavy writing credit. Those are usually too sophomoric to be enjoyed. The music is great, the setting is great, the story is great and the characters are hilarious. I often wonder how people can take things so seriously. I mean if you read the synopsis or see the trailer for a movie Sandler is in and it looks like a corny comedy then go in with the right attitude. I watch this movie every time I see it on because it is just enjoyable. Barrymore can be mesmerizing at times. I can't think of a single character that is annoying."
"ironhorse_iv","7","6","7","12 March 2016"," Wouldn't it be nice to live together, in the kind of world where we belong? Yes, it would! 50 First Dates is a guilty pleasure of mine. I like this movie.
","Adam Sandler's movies is mixed bag for me. Some of his works, are really horrible, however, this movie isn't one of those. This movie is one of my favorites from him. I have always been a huge fan of his romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore. Starting it with 1998's 'The Wedding Singer', and follow up with this movie. This movie directed by Peter Segal, has Adam Sandler as Henry Roth, a local veterinarian falling in love with Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) an amnesiac student in Hawaii. Since she has short-term memory loss cause by a car accident, Henry must learn how to recognize the difficulty of building a relationship with someone who will never remember you; and how to overcome that, for the reasons for love. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while, this movie concept seem depressing, I think screenwriter, George Wing and Adam Sandler put enough charming comedy in the film, so you don't have to think, how stressful, it must be, for Lucy to wake up to find out, her entire life has change. While, the memory impairment suffered by Barrymore's character is fictitious, I think the movie gave enough respect to her ailment, that it doesn't seem, just like a running joke. Drew Barrymore plays her illness, very well. The movie really does explore, what struggles, she has to tend with, and if Henry Roth should even continue to love her. Because of that, this movie is a lot more mature and emotional driven than Sandler's earlier works. It's both heart-warming and very heart-breaking at the same time. Both Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore work well with the story. I'm glad, that Sandler's role in this, wasn't of a man-child, with anger issues, and an annoying lisp. He was somewhat charismatic. I can see a woman like Drew Barrymore falling in love with him. Even the supporting characters were strong, they share some good emotional scenes and some really fun laughs. I like Sue (Amy Hill) the Hukilau café manager and friend of Lucy and her late mother. She was so motherly. Pomaika'i Brown as Nick, the Hukilau café chef was a guy, I would love to hang out with. Even Lucy's father, Marlin (Blake Clark) & steroid-dependent brother, Doug (Sean Astin) was watchable. I think the only jokes that didn't go well is with the supporting characters of Ula (Rob Schneider), the native-Hawaiian friend & Alexa (Lusia Strus), Henry's ambiguously gendered assistant. I found the gay jokes to Alexa to be a bit mean-spirited; while Ula felt a bit offensive, with the over-the-top Hawaiian Yellow face racism stereotypes. While, some of the jokes, are offensive, gross, and not call for. Most of them, really works with the script. Very few jokes, fall flat. Even the pop culture shout outs inside jokes like the brain institute is funded by auto parts manufacturer T.B. Callahan of Sandusky, Ohio from 1995's film, 'Tommy Boy"" fame & how the characters go to a golf course like 1996's Happy Gilmore' were clever enough that it was fun to see, even if most audience didn't get it. It's even funny, when the movie makes mistakes, like saying the Boston Red Sox didn't win the World Series, when they did that year. Not only was the movie, very funny, but the movie was very beautifully shot. I love the fact that they shot in real Hawaii Island locations. The rural shots really makes this film, seem very unique, compared to the other Adam Sandler's films that mostly take place in an urban New York City like settling with way too much product placement being shown. It's a blessing in disguise. One of the big things about this movie has to be the music. I love the tunes of the Beach Boys, playing in the background. 'Wouldn't it be nice"" to have music like this, again. The other song, worth noticing, from the film is the covers song from Hawaiian native artist, Israel ""IZ"" Kamakawiwoʻole. I love his covers for 'Somewhere over the Rainbow"" and 'What a Wonderful World'. His tropical reggae version of 'Somewhere over the Rainbow', is my favorite version of the song from the 1939's 'Wizard of Oz'. It's beats singer, Judy Garland's version, 50 times over. It's so good, I kinda wish, it was the state anthem for Hawaii. That's how much, I like that version. I also love the fact that this movie, help inspire 'real world application treatment for people with early dementia. It's nice for them, to watch a video every morning in which they see comforting messages and reminders from family members that they may still know. If that's not a good reason to love this movie, than I don't know, what is! The movie is also so good, that in 2014, a Malayalam film titled 'Ormayundo Ee Mukham' was created, to capitalize on the premise. Overall: While, '50 First Dates' doesn't have the complexity and depth of something like 1993's 'Groundhog Day', with a similar theme. It was entertaining enough to be stand out. In the end; check it out. You will find yourself, loving this movie as well."

","This is a good one. Gentle souls in this one. Dramatic storyline, colorful views, capures the twirling human forces pretty good. Tall man does a back flip over sandler. Sandler ignores it and moves on to his feasting. Sandler drives the boat calling out. Does it turn out good? Does it turn out bad? Or is it that sandler will all of a sudden be able to keep quiet and not have to do anything at all? (stuff never ends like that because we're controlled). You'll have to watch it."

","This is the story of Henry Roth and Lucy Whitmore. Henry is a Vet working at Sea World in Hawaii. He is also a playboy and uses subterfuge to hook up with as many tourists as possible. It's not that he is afraid of commitment but rather he is planning an expedition on a boat he is refurbishing to study walruses in the wild. He plans to be gone for several years. One day Henry ends up at a local diner and meets Lucy. They connect immediately and it seems like a case of love at first sight. The next day when Henry returns for their second date, Lucy acts like she does not know him. It turns out Lucy was in an accident and cannot convert short-term memories into long-term, so when she goes to sleep she forgets what transpired the day before. So Henry sets about a daily task to make Lucy fall for him anew every day.

"MartinHafer","7","3","3","1 May 2009"," Enjoyable despite a tough to believe plot
","50 FIRST DATES is a very enjoyable film--especially as a date movie. However, it's also a film that also has a plot that is completely ridiculous and unbelievable, so you really need to be able to put aside your critical side and just sit back and take the movie for what it is--a nice romantic-comedy.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is a tough actor to pigeonhole. On one hand, he's the guy who made such obnoxious comedies as LITTLE NICKY but on the other, he can make some enjoyable comedies (WATERBOY) and probably his best film was another romance starring Drew Barrymore, THE WEDDING SINGER. Considering how successful and sweet this film was, it's certainly not surprising that they'd return for another try.<br/><br/>This time, the plot is very unusual to say the least. Adam plays a rather shallow womanizer who becomes totally infatuated with a woman who is just about impossible to get to love because she cannot remember anything that occurred after an accident. In other words, no matter how much he captivates her and makes her love him, when she awakens, she can't remember anything from the previous day. While brain damage can create an individual with impaired short-term memory, the way the illness is portrayed is pure fiction....as is the idea that any guy could see a future with anyone with such an injury. It's sure fun seeing Drew and Adam together, but you just can't take the plot seriously at all.<br/><br/>My advice on this one is to watch it. And, if the plot is too much to handle, switch it off and try something else. However, if you stick with it, nice acting and a nice quirky romance might just make it worth your time. Oh, and guys, this is a great ""chick flick""--even if you don't like it, your special someone very likely will."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","6","8","10 November 2009"," Very sweet feel good film
","I will admit right now, I am not an Adam Sandler fan. However, I found this film to be surprisingly enjoyable. It is sweet and cute in places, and while certainly not a masterpiece it is above decent. A vast majority of the jokes work here, and that was great to see, and the direction was surprisingly subtle. The camera work was good making good use of the gorgeous scenery, and the soundtrack was lovely. I had little problem with the performances; Adam Sandler gives of his more likable performances, and Drew Barrymore is the persona of sweetness as his love interest. Out of the supporting performances, Rob Schneider guarantees a number of laughs, and Sean Astin comes close to stealing the film in places. But it is the chemistry of Sandler and Barrymore that shines through despite the flaws that mar it from being more than enjoyable.<br/><br/>While Dan Aykroyd has a small appearance, it is sadly one that isn't particularly memorable. The plot isn't exactly original, and certainly isn't the most interesting one ever. And the script does have its ups and downs, and is predictable. Overall though, it is a sweet feel good film. It has its flaws, but it is a brave attempt at a romantic comedy, and mainly because of the chemistry of the two leads it mostly succeeds. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"paddyolguin","10","6","8","15 May 2009"," A Surprisingly Sweet and Funny Movie
","Like him or not, Adam Sandler is very clever. His wacky over-the-top slap-stick is just a way to get you to laugh before he sticks you in the heart with something completely unexpected and you suddenly end up with tears in your eyes. I rarely buy DVDs, but this (and the Wedding Singer) is a notable exception. The perfect date movie - over and over.<br/><br/>I won't repeat the plot-line - read a couple of reviews. What bears noting is Rob Schneider's ridiculous and hilarious supporting role. No Oscar, but he was brilliant.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Barrymore and Sandler is easy and natural. And for you Sandler fans, his Lucy song will have you rolling. Sentimental without being sappy, it's a story of a family dealing with a debilitating injury and a tireless guy who's willing to win his girl's affection every day. I don't know how some reviewers see the ending as sad or disappointing. It seemed like an obvious victory of love and devotion over adversity. My wife and I watch this movie over and over. How else would you treat a 10?"

","First, let's forget about the facile comparison between this movie and Groundhog Day. Anything with Bill Murray in it is just to annoying to be taken seriously. Second, this is nothing like Groundhog Day, anyway. It's much better. And don't for an instant listen to the idiots who are comparing this movie to Memento, still the most overrated, vapid, pointless, gimmicky, dull, worthless movie ever to be hyped into the public psyche. But I digress.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore is undoubtedly the most adorable woman in movies today. She's beautiful, bubbly, child-like and yet sexy. In short, she's perfect. If Meg Ryan is getting too old to do all the Meg Ryan movies, no worries. Drew is there, ready, willing and able to become America's cinema darling. And she's cuter than Meg.<br/><br/>But what about Sandler? Isn't he a crude, obnoxious, fart-joking, hooligan who isn't as funny as the thinks he is? See, you're still thinking about the OLD Adam Sandler. This is the new Adam. He's funny, sensitive, vulnerable, and yes, adorable. In short, he's matured as an actor, making the pairing of Adam and Drew the best romantic comedy pairing since the aforementioned Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple. Drew has a problem with her short term memory, and Adam loves her but has to convince her to fall in love with him all over again every day. But the story isn't in the telling, it's in the watching. Drew and Adam flutter around each other like butterflies, dazzling in the sun, as the delicate journey from being strangers to becoming lovers is repainted every day. And yes, there are fart-jokes and vomit-gags enough to make any Sandler fan happy.<br/><br/>One thing that makes this movie so enjoyable is the amazing soundtrack. I can put the DVD on and simply listen while I surf, and the music alone is delightful. But what really makes the movie is the way it starts where you would expect it to, a typical Sandler movie, and then floats beautifully higher and higher into the realm of cinema gold. It isn't until about midway through the movie that you realize you've got more on your hands than you expected, and by the end of the movie, if you aren't crying you should ask for a refund on that therapy you've been taking, because you haven't learned to express your emotions at all.<br/><br/>Maybe half a dozen times a year I find a movie that enters the list of my favorites, and I can pull them off the shelf and love them all over again for years to come. I keep those DVD's on a separate shelf from the rest of my collection. It's a small shelf, in a different room from the rest of my collection. 50 First Dates is on the small shelf."

","I was a little kid when I first watched this movie in 2005. Although it has been broadcasted many times on television since, I simply always enjoy to watch it every now and then. I almost never re-watch movies, but I always check this one out when it's on.<br/><br/>The jokes are funny, but it's not just a laugh. The story has some sad parts and it really got me as a child, I still seem to find it a bit sad.<br/><br/>In short I would say it's a good, romantic comedy movie about a really difficult relationship. From the moment Henry meets Lucy, to when he finds out about her memory difficulties and starts to make her fall in love with him everyday. In the beginning it comes with a lot of funny situations, but later on it starts to get harder when her family and Henry start telling Lucy about the accident every morning and she wants Henry to go on with his life without her. After a lot of struggles they still work it out and the happy ending shows Lucy and Henry are having a child now and are still together, while she still has the memory issues.<br/><br/>I think the end the best ending this story could have had. I personally hate to watch a movie like this and have the characters split up at the end. I also would've disliked it if they made an ending with Lucy wonderfully getting her short term memory back, after one of the doctors they visit in the movie found a solution or something for it.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7 out of 10. Far from the best, but very enjoyable for me. The actors were great too."
"philonous09","7","2","2","28 June 2015"," An imperfectly good movie
","Fifty first date has a lot of potential. In fact, in some sense, the movie succeeds in realizing the core theme: persistent and undying love for someone in spite of the daunting condition of a short term memory; nothing hurts more than to be forgotten by someone you love. Moreover, the creative measures the protagonist undertakes to help his lover remember him are moving and touching. Overall, the dramatic and romantic elements of the movie are wonderful, but the comedic elements are typical Sandler humor extraneous to the film's essence. For many reviewers, Sandler's style of humor has a corrosive effect on the film, but I think the strength and message of the film endures in spite of its flaws. I would add this this movie would easily be the best romantic movie had Sandler decided to make this into a romantic drama than a romantic comedy. This doesn't mean he should do away with any comedic elements. There were some decent ones, but he could easily get ride of a lot of bad comedic moments. Moreover, Sandler is capable of doing drama as evidenced by his decent performance in drama movies like Reign Over Me and Punch Drunk Love. It would have been one more decent drama performed by Sandler. Unfortunately, it is too late and the flaws will remain permanent parts of the film. Nonetheless, I still think this is a good movie which is quite underrated due to the recent and understandable backlash against Sandler."

To be able to make someone fall in love with you again every single day is a herculean effort if we really think about it. Presenting this concept in a comedy really brings it to a very fun level. I really like the early parts where Henry would do over ad over his mistakes with newer and newer ways. The practical jokes are very much entertaining. I really like how Lucy bludgeons Ula in helping Henry. All the side ingredients also fared well. The things with Alexa and Doug comes in well and funny to the end. The acting job is a very goo overall. Adam Sandler manages to be still funny amidst the story that is more focused on the romantic and touching side. Drew Barrymore acted out great as the girl who gets her memory wiped out clean every single morning. Having additional big names such as Sean Astin and Dan Aykroyd sure didn't hurt this movie."

","Ladies !!! Do you want this man to be your lawfully wedded husband ? Isn't Henry Roth the most romantic guy? I wonder if doing this film made Adam Sandler think of his own relationship and improve on it. I felt very challenged by his persistence and determination for the sheer fact that this might be what women expect. Or is it? Is this the mark set by women for all men? Does watching this make single women feel that ""I know he is out their somewhere"". Do you think Henry would have gone through all this if Lucy was not attractive? It was amazing to see Lucy's father and brother going through the routine everyday just to keep Lucy happy. Does dads and brother like Lucy's exist? They actually do. The love and care of the family structure is one thing realistic about this movie. Have you ever thought how hard it must be to look after a disabled child or a child who is mentally handicapped? tendency is to identify with Lucy and wish that someone would love us but isn't it the other way around? Lucy however finds a husband to love her and take care of her but aren't their so many like Lucy who are waiting to be accepted by society and waiting to be loved by someone? Does the movie challenge you to be sensitive to people like Lucy?"

","The key to whether you should watch this film is how much you can stomach Adam Sandler. If you think he's great you'll love this. If you can't stand him then you will probably not find much here to distract you from that.<br/><br/>Personally, I've never been a fan of his. But I watched this because I quite liked the idea of this film. Let's face it - it's not often you get a movie about a woman (Drew Barrymore) who is involved in an accident which leaves her with a 24-hour memory span so that her would-be boyfriend has to make up ways to 'meet' and make her fall in love with him every day. So I watched it, and it was OK. A good few laughs plus some nice 'aaaah' moments and a pleasing soundtrack thrown in as well.<br/><br/>Downsides? I could have done without some of the annoying sidekicks. Admittedly the two leads couldn't have sustained the whole film on their own, but for me there are a few too many 'quirky' hangers-on, playing - largely unsuccessfully - for laughs. The exceptions to this include the slightly more classy turns from Dan Ayckroyd as the doctor, Blake Clark as the girl's father, and the show-stealing walrus who is the star attraction at the zoo where Sandler's character works as a vet.<br/><br/>So overall, 50 First Dates is not great, but it doesn't pretend to be. It's a nice, amusing, diverting, feel-good movie that will leave you with a smile on your face and - just possibly - make you despise the male lead a little less than you did before."

Just the idea that Adam Sandler's character could make Drew Barrymore's character fall in love with him on a daily basis that many times melts my heart.

This time Adam Sandler must reintroduce himself everyday to the same woman because she lost her short term memory in a car accident.

Sandler delivers one of his best comic performances as someone struggling repeatedly to connect. Drew Barrymore is the emotional centre repeating each day seamlessly new. Both she and Sandler were previously in The Wedding Singer and she steals both films. Funny supporting work by shark bitten Rob Schneider whose antics are questionable at best. At one point Barrymore takes a baseball bat to him but perhaps that was a reaction to Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.

","OK, let's get the obvious comments out of the way: ""Groundhog Day"" bladibladi ""Memento"" blablabla ""The Misadventures of Death And Phug"" blabla. Yes, this movie is about a person with no memory, repeating the same day over and over again. This has been done before, but it's not a clichÃ© - and anyway, the angle of this movie is a lot different than those three, so let's just give all that a rest.<br/><br/>In actual fact, I found the concept of this movie interesting - a real twist on the old love story fare. Man With Fear Of Commitment Finds Woman With No Memory - it's a fun little jigsaw. And, for all intents and purposes, the skeleton of this movie works fine. <br/><br/>But. BUT! This is where I get annoyed. This movie is crammed full of pointless and annoying cheap gags. I don't know if it's just me, but I am not particularly appreciative of super-intelligent cutesy animals who understand everything said to them in plain English and respond with a suitable adorable sound/flipper gesture. Animals don't act like this. They never have, they never will. It p***es me off. Also, the movie just HAD to tack on some meaningless gross-out moments via the horny and androgynous Slavic assistant and (hold on to your hats and glasses) somebody getting showered from head to foot in walrus puke. Ah, the subtlety. And will somebody shut the old Hawaiian guy up, who has no function in the movie other than saying ""hilarious"" cuss words? <br/><br/>I think the writer of the original screenplay is pretty horrified at how his movie was represented.

But she knows movies, she knows herself and she knows how do a few things in service to the projects she chooses.<br/><br/>And she does choose. These days she is a power in the business and can shape a project, even one initiated and controlled by Sandler.<br/><br/>In this case, she works with a simple notion that has depth: movies are never about life, always about other movies. Date movies especially refer to a particular work of love that was invented by movies - and only exists there. So they are about memory. Each visit into a film is a new short term memory that we relate somehow to the frame of our larger lives.<br/><br/>In other words, this is a movie about movies pretending to be a love story comedy. It starts with an incongruous James Bond parody, but not a parody to us, rather to another character in the movie. And not just one girl, but many, each representing a genre.

","In his earlier efforts, Adam Sandler was known for his goofy comedy in movies such as ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Billy Madison"", and even ""The Waterboy"". With ""50 First Dates"", however, Sandler tries to add a bit of emotion into his juvenile sense of comedy. The result is closer to chaos than consistency.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Hawaii-based ladies man Henry Roth (Sandler) living the bachelor life by churning through one woman after the other. When he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), however, everything changes for Henry. The reason? Due to short-term memory loss, Lucy relives the same day over and over again, never remembering the events of the previous 24 hours. Thus, Henry must decide whether to take advantage of this situation, or help Lucy live a happier life.<br/><br/>The trouble with this movie is that Sandler's crude sense of humor does not mesh well with the more heartfelt tone of the overall picture. It is almost as if two movies are going on at the same time...one where Sandler cracks sexual jokes with his buds (of which again include Rob Schneider), and one where Sandler interacts on a more personal level with Barrymore.<br/><br/>It would have taken a great directorial effort to make this juxtaposition work, but unfortunately Peter Segal just wasn't up to the task in this case. The movie actually needed to focus a bit more on the ""serious"" stuff and leave off some of the crudeness. Had that happened, it would have worked much better due to the intriguing ""memory-loss"" concept.<br/><br/>Thus, I was solidly underwhelmed by ""50 First Dates"". It isn't unwatchable, but it really can only succeed as an adolescent ""date movie"" for those new to Sandler's comedic persuasions. It may make you think/feel on a deep level for a second or two, but those moments are quickly abandoned for another crude joke or sight gag."

","Another Adam Sandler movie. Another Chick Flick. Another romantic comedy. Another film that Rob Schneider appears in. All in all, another Spectacular Waste Of Time.<br/><br/>50 FIRST DATES is almost as painful as the brain injury it makes fun of.<br/><br/>Henry (Sandler) is a marine biologist at a SeaWorld in Hawaii. (If you can conceptualize Adam Sandler as a marine biologist, the rest of the outlandish and offensive concepts in the movie should just clack into place.) He's a philanderer, bedding women on vacation in Hawaii and forgetting them the next day.<br/><br/>I see an ironic twist coming like a wrecking ball shaped like stupid.<br/><br/>Henry falls for Lucy (Drew Barrymore, her lisping out of control from overdosing on coquettishness). Little does he know she suffers from short-term memory dysfunction - when she goes to sleep every night, her memory wipes clean. She retains memories up to the point of the accident that caused her condition.<br/><br/>So when Lucy sees Henry the next day, she doesn't know him. Who can blame her? Don't we all try to wipe Adam Sandler out of our minds daily? So begins Henry's odious quest to make Lucy remember him. Again. And again. And again. It's GROUNDHOG DAY for retards, i.e. Adam Sandler fans.<br/><br/>Written unthinkingly by George Wing (his first movie) and directed adequately by Peter Segal, the premise of 50 FIRST DATES is a lecher's wet dream, a sick exploitation. It is not even tragicomic - it is flatly simply a tragedy. You can sophomorically pass it off like a GILLIGAN'S ISLAND episode, but the reality is that this woman has BRAIN DAMAGE! Movie about a disabled, fecund chick and the genetically-dysfunctional, horny philanderer trying to screw her. What makes anyone think (audience and movie characters alike) that Henry has ""changed"" since we met him as a slut? What has come to light is his pathological eccentricity in pursuing this woman whom he has no possibility of having a future with.<br/><br/>If he was sincerely trying to cure her brain problem, we might excuse his randy ""courting"" - but he's simply trying to get into her pants - on the pretense of ""noble love."" He wants Lucy to regain her memory to remember HIM, not to improve her quality of life (even though we know that in his warped head, he is considering her memories of him as that very improvement).<br/><br/>Then there is the tragedy that is Sean Astin: from starring roles in three of the most renowned films in moviedom (Peter Jackson's stunning LORD OF THE RINGS series), here he slips backwards, downwards, almost too comfortably into the filth from whence he came - his Z-character niche - as Lucy's lisping, ambiguously-masculine brother, Doug. The mesh belly shirt doesn't help. Or maybe it helps too much.<br/><br/>Doubt that Henry would be so intent on pursuing Lucy if she looked like Sean Astin in the belly shirt.<br/><br/>And Rob Schneider. At least Sandler tries for cred - with reputable roles in SPANGLISH, REIGN OVER ME, PUNCH DRUNK LOVE - but Schneider (playing Henry's idiot friend here - no surprise) has never chosen one redeeming role in his sloppy-seconds career. A one-trick pony with two broken legs.<br/><br/>Blake Clark plays Lucy's father. Dan Aykroyd slaps down a cameo as Lucy's doctor.<br/><br/>Henry's major breakthrough in bedding Lucy is creating a video, which Lucy must watch every morning, outlining her life from her accident to that point in time, including the bilious parts about her falling for Henry.<br/><br/>He gets his wish, gaming it so badass one day (one of the many days he has nothing better to do with his life) that he scores third base. Of course, no one questions the morals or gullibility of a woman who would watch a video, be convinced she is the victim of a memory-loss accident and then fall for the guy on the video who is telling her that she loves him.<br/><br/>Henry eventually sails off to ""find his dream"" but realizes Lucy retains some shred of him in her memory, so - talk about ""dreamkiller"" - he returns to port, to find that Lucy has been made Art Director of a Spastic Institute (is the movie trying to be ironic?), surrounding herself with her drawings of Henry, not understanding why an image of this ugly guy who looks like Adam Sandler is in her mind.<br/><br/>But how does she remember she is an Art Director every day? How does she perform her administrative job with no memories of the previous day? What's this Post-It on my desk? Where did I put my file of symposium attendees? Are the audience as stupid as we think they are to fall for this? <br/><br/>The movie's message is noxious and disturbing. There is no badness in Henry - he is not exploiting her or taking advantage of her - it is the opposite: his innocence in wanting to ""love"" her is a genetic mutation, and that's the disturbing part, because the movie tells us his behavior is laudable. But there is no evolutionary reason for Henry to try this hard with Lucy when he already has the game to impregnate hundreds of other females. The psychology of growing closer to your partner is linked with ""shared experiences."" Lucy is never going to share any experiences with Henry, except those of a stranger within a 24-hour period. And even her day-to-day relationship with him is predicated on the fact that every single day she must believe she has lost her memory in the first place.<br/><br/>What does it say about Henry that he also must re-acclimatize himself with her confusion every morning? What kind of a sick person would get off on doing this every single day? <br/><br/>Now comes the easy part. Forget this movie.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","I like Adam Sandler. At least I used to until he fell into the business of doing movies just because they're there. Like so many ""Something About Mary"" movies before this (cute, sexy, virginal blonde girl meets doofus, bungling, but adorable guy who wants her at all costs), the entire plot (if you can call it that) was exhausted in the first 15 minutes. Absolutely nothing original here. They thought that they'd take the success of Groundhog Day, turn it upside down (the star stands still while the calendar moves), and have a hit. It didn't work. Add to this, textbook acting by a moronic dad and a stupid brother (that can't even spell act) and the heroine actually comes across as the best actor in the film. I guess that after you saw the credits go by, you'd sympathize with Adam and like the movie. Hmmm...<br/><br/>Maybe I was jaded when I saw this on an eternal flight from Germany to Los Angeles. But after 10 hours in the air, it was only slightly more entertaining than the crying baby next to me as I sat in a middle seat."

","As unlikely as it may seem, Henry Roth is a wow with the ladies and living on a tropical island means he gets to have short relationships with many beautiful tourists who are there for only a short time. This has bred a fear of commitment into him but a chance meeting with the beautiful local Lucy threatens to change that. They share a breakfast and Henry is smitten, agreeing to meet up the next day. However the next day she has no memory of him and he finds that he has to win her over again and again.<br/><br/>In fairness to Adam Sandler he is not to blame for me not really liking this film. You see he made it clear from the very first scenes that this was going to be a film just like all his other films, with the same slightly crude and childish sense of humour and the same broad and basic approach to plotting and character development. In a way it is the same as putting a warning sign on an electrical panel to make sure that you don't go into unless you know you can deal with it. And so it is here with a film that relies on crude characters, cute kids and animals to get laughs and seems totally at sea when asked to deliver anything other than the most simplistic and formulaic of emotions. The plot awkwardly mishandles the central concept so that it is never convincing even on the very simple level that the script needs it to be.<br/><br/>For fans of Sandler though there are laughs to be had. Personally I didn't laugh more than once or twice but others may find it differently. That said though, I was surprised by how much the clunky plot took away the scope for the usual laughs and it was noticeable. Sandler plays the same character he always play with the same performance he always does. I found it hard to believe he could get all these women but he suits the material I suppose. Barrymore is stuck with a hopeless task. She needs to bring out feeling and pain in her character to make it work but she is in a film where this doesn't really matter and when she tries it, she is actually taking away from what the film is trying to do. Schneider does his usual stuff; he is crude and amusing but it is hardly wit. Astin's character is great fun and he works it well although why Dan Aykroyd bothered is beyond me.<br/><br/>Overall then a fairly basic and obvious film. If you like even the weaker Adam Sandler films then you will like this but otherwise you should probably just avoid because it is nothing different from his usual stuff and does as little as you expect it to do."

He has a nice life and one of his dreams is to navigate with his own ship to Alaska. One day, when he is taking his breakfast, he sees a beautiful blonde girl called Lucy, and decides to talk to her.

","I have to admit it, despite Adam Sandler is among my favourite actors, I can't deny he has made some wretched movies (such as GOING OVERBOARD and JACK & JILL). However, when he has good scripts and directors he can do great and likeable movies like CLICK, this one and the other movie in which he co-starred with Drew Barrymore before this one, THE WEDDING SINGER.<br/><br/>Here Sandler plays a womanizer that works as a veterinarian in the Hawaii and after going to a bar for a while he becomes infatuated with a woman (Barrymore) that unfortunately has short-term memory and so she can't remember anything that happened to her the day before thanks to an accident. So Sandler tries his best for helping Drew falling in love with him every day like the very first time.<br/><br/>This time the plot is not very serious since the idea of a guy that wants a future with a woman that suffers of short-term memory is very hard to believe especially in real life. So my advice on this side is relax and take the movie for what it is.<br/><br/>Sandler and Barrymore have lots of chemistry together. Rob Schneider here is surprisingly good and comes off as the best of the supporting players. Dan Aykroyd's role unfortunately is very small but at least he steals the scenes in which he is in. The soundtrack is very likeable with its many covers of famous songs from the 1970s-1980s by the Police and the Cure. All in all, it's a sweet and delightful romantic comedy that despite not being perfect, it manages to please its target audience."

","What would happen if you met a soul-mate by accident in a café, hit it off really well, made a date for the next day, and then, when you met her, you notice that she does not remember you at all? This happens to Henry (Adam Sandler), who is completely confused until the café owner pulls him aside and lets him know that Lucy (Drew Barrymore), the girl in question, has brain damage from an auto accident which causes her short term memory to be erased every time she goes to sleep for the night. Henry is discouraged to realize that, if he wants to get to know Lucy, he has to hook up with her fresh every day, and on a bet with one of the cooks in the café, he does this until he realizes something extraordinary is happening--he is falling in love.<br/><br/>Enter a premise for a romantic comedy that seems a little weak on the surface, but actually turns out to have a lot behind it. The idea is clearly inspired by the now classic Groundhog Day, with its notion of an endless existential loop, and actually asks the question of whether a person can somehow manage to develop a coherent existence if they have to start fresh every day. Henry and Lucy recreate their relationship every day, and the question is whether it can possibly last.<br/><br/>The film is fun--not only because of the performances of the leads, but also a set of supporting characters who clearly are up for the situation. Sandler gives a really good performance--the irony of his character is that before the relationship, he has a phobia about commitment, and once he has met a woman for whom this is not an issue, he actually wishes more and more that he can have a long-term relationship. The relationship actually goes through the normal phases--getting more and more serious as time goes on, with Sandler with the aid of Lucy's family finding more and more ingenious ways to reacquaint Lucy very quickly with the specifics of her life each day. Can it work? Obviously you need to see the movie to find out."
"nicolechan916","6","2","3","17 March 2016"," Likable
","The film has great production and visuals though with a satisfactory story. The character of Henry is depicted as a playboy character at the beginning but nothing of what we see of him actually affirms this idea. <br/><br/>Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are believable as their characters. However, they did feel a little generic and didn't express much emotion. Also, maybe it is the the script development, but I didn't feel like Henry showed much passion or reason for chasing after Lucy (except to make a film out of it). A number of characters ask him this too, and he doesn't give a clear answer. Love at first sight perhaps. Ula (played by Rob Schneider) is Henry's cousin and is pretty much just there for comic relief. His tight shirts and extra short shorts are a sight to behold. <br/><br/>The story overall is presented in an orderly manner, going chronologically while sometimes fast forwarding in time. The montages and editing is done in a clear and concise way with little confusion between jumps. There is also some great landscape cinematography in the film, with sunsets and nature settings as the backdrop. <br/><br/>I also liked the interactions with the animals. I'm sure they are mostly computer generated imagery but it does look very realistic. Unless it is real in which case the animals are really well trained! It's hard to tell nowadays between what has been manipulated by the computer and what actually occurred before the camera. <br/><br/>Regarding the concept of the story, it is definitely an intriguing one. I am not entirely sure of the accuracy of what is presented in the film, and am mainly re watching this for a psych class. There is such a thing as losing the ability to form new memories after an accident (anterograde amnesia) which occurs due to damage in the temporal lobe. However, the specifics as to when the memory is 'restarted' is very vague, but it does seem like waking up with a clean slate every morning is more for the convenience of the film. <br/><br/>Overall, a likable film for casual viewing with an interesting concept and some great cinematography but average characters."

","There's nothing wrong with a formula comedy. If well done, a formula comedy can be extremely satisfying even if we know what's coming (Eg. ""Seventeen Again""). However, this film's wooden, shallow employment of the standard devices of the genre left this viewer not only unsatisfied but seriously annoyed.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the characters in such a film have to be likable enough to allow the audience to root for them. The Adam Sandler character was extremely unlikeable. Further, he wasn't redeemed or forgiven so much as his flaws were simply ignored. I found myself feeling sorry for Drew Barrymore's character, because she would be ending up with Adam Sandler's character. It would have been better if his character would have received some poetic justice in the end. <br/><br/>Second, the construction of this type of comedy often requires the suspension of disbelief. The plot set-up in this movie made no sense whatsoever. There has to be SOME logic even in a fantasy.<br/><br/>Third the use of comedic devices such as crazy side-kicks and periodic vulgarity were over-used and very very, poorly done in this film. Not one was worth a laugh.<br/><br/>I don't think I'm over-analyzing this film. I have enjoyed a number of Adam Sandler films, and I usually like Drew Barrymore too, but this one was flat at best. At BEST."
"StevePulaski","8","2","3","22 February 2012"," Sandler shows his third alter ego
","50 First Dates is Sandler experiencing with the romantic genre, while slightly tilting it towards the dramatic side, with an essence of comedy. It tells the heartwarming, if not mildly depressing tale of a Marine Biologist who falls in love with a woman who was in a car accident, and suffers from short term memory loss where her memory is wiped clean the next day.<br/><br/>She can still remember everything that happened the day before her accident, but she is unable to remember anything that happens in the present for more than a day. She is stuck living in what, she thinks, is October 13. The woman is Lucy, played by Drew Barrymore, and the Biologist is Henry, played by Adam Sandler. Despite her current state, Henry is head over heels in love with her, and desperately tries to make things work between them by constructing a scrapbook for her to read every morning, a tape to watch, and by having her father, Blake Clark, and brother, played by Sean Astin, who drops the funniest lines in the film, try to tell her everything about him again and again.<br/><br/>If a condition like this really existed, in the film it's a merge between short term memory loss and amnesia, the question is who would it be harder on? The person who has to suffer it, or the relatives who must deal with it. In the film, it shows the father and the son of Lucy going through the same daily phase of rearranging everything from repainting the wall they let Lucy paint to refilling the shampoo bottle. It just so happens that October 13 is her father's birthday, so they have to go the trouble of reliving it over and over again.<br/><br/>The story is charming, yet some of the comedic elements are a little out of place. The film has more characters than necessary, and tends to get focus more on them rather than furthering Sandler and Barrymore's wonderful chemistry. Adam Sandler's best friend is played by Rob Schneider, who is not funny at all in the film, and the ""Alexa"" character whose gender is never disclosed is an unnecessary and ridiculous distraction.<br/><br/>Also, the film seems a bit distended from the idea of this condition. Is this supposed to be cute and funny, or a serious and saddening? There are times when the film pokes fun at the illness (IE: ""Ten Second Tom""), and there are times with Lucy where feels genuinely serious. It's almost like Sandler is saying, ""yeah, it's sometimes sad, but c'mon, how do you not laugh at it?"" With those quibbles being said, I can still say 50 First Dates is a great change of pace for Sandler. It's the second Sandler film I have really enjoyed, with the first being Funny People, and, at the rate we're going, will probably be his most sincere. If this is the best we'll get than so be it. I can live with that.<br/><br/>If I can compare old Sandler with new Sandler, it's easy to broadly state that his new films are humorless failures, but 50 First Dates is like the better version of one of his more recent comedies, Just Go With It. In Just Go With It, Sandler was playing a similar character; he preyed on young women just to get them in bed before abandoning them blind. Later on, he met a woman who he really did care for, pretended to be married, and still acted like a selfish, uninspired cad while putting on a nice guy face. Here, he is genuinely sincere, and not snarky and underwritten like his future character. We really go on to believe he cares about this young girl.<br/><br/>The ending is probably the saddest, yet most optimistic conclusion to any Sandler film yet. It appears to be happy, but when closely examined there's still a layer of sadness under it. Director Peter Segal, who directed the fun farce Tommy Boy (which is briefly referenced here), tightens his strings a bit to bring us a warm and simple drama with some characters we like and others we wish were shifted a bit out of focus. 50 First Dates isn't perfect, but it shows that Sandler is capable of doing a mostly serious role, and doesn't need to incorporate his two famous alter egos; the BIG, strong tough guy or the little, weak baby.<br/><br/>Starring: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Rob Schneider, Blake Clark, and Sean Astin. Directed by: Peter Segal."

"Buddy-51","Null","2","3","9 October 2004"," uneven romantic comedy
","In '50 First dates' - which might well be subtitled 'When 'Memento' Met 'Groundhog Day'' - Drew Barrymore plays a young woman whose short term memory has been destroyed in a car accident a few months prior to the time of the story. As a result, Lucy wakes up every morning still believing it is the day of the accident, while every night her memory of that current day is wiped away while she sleeps. Her father and her brother have devised an elaborate charade to avoid her finding out the truth, assuming that she will live a much happier life if she is kept in blissful ignorance of her condition. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a veterinarian who's deathly afraid of commitment and figures Lucy is the perfect woman for him. He can woo her afresh every day, secure in the knowledge that their relationship will never have to advance much beyond the getting-to-know-you stage - though this doesn't make for a very logical plan since winning her over day after day requires a lot more work and effort than a conventional relationship ever would. Nevertheless, this seems to Henry to be the ideal setup, until, of course, he begins to actually fall for the hapless young woman, revealing that he is not quite the callous rogue he appears to be on the surface. <br/><br/>Your enjoyment of '50 First Dates' may be predicated on just how willing you are to accept brain damage as a source of mirth and high comedy. If you are somehow able to quell the queasiness that comes with the premise, you might be charmed by what happens in the film. <br/><br/>This is basically a gimmicky, one-joke comedy that indulges in far too many distractions to be very successful. There is, admittedly, a certain sweetness to many of the scenes involving Barrymore and Sandler as they try to make a go of this highly unusual courtship. The final scene, in particular, has a kind of offbeat poignancy that feels both daring and satisfying. However, the film is populated by a whole host of annoying characters who work overtime to deaden the charm: Lucy's steroid-obsessed brother, Henry's creepy co-workers, and even an anthropomorphic walrus who high-fives his trainer, mugs for the camera, and vomits on cue - and whose sizable genitalia serves as the source for one of the many lowbrow gags that run through the film.<br/><br/>In 'Punch Drunk Love,' Sandler proved that he has the potential to stretch as an actor. Barrymore has yet to make that case. Her wide-eyed, innocent ingénue shtick has become a trifle threadbare by now. It's time for her to take a leap of faith into more challenging roles and show us what - if anything - else she can do."
"federovsky","Null","2","3","15 August 2004"," Nice film with stunning ending
","It's been interesting reading the other users' comments on IMDb. A lot of people have their prejudices: ""this turns out to be typical Sandler"", or, ""this is not what we want from Sean Astin"", or, ""Rob Schneider - yuck!"". Seems that many have their own ideas how the film should have been before they see it. <br/><br/>I rarely watch these spongy Hollywood comedy/romances so I had little in the way of expectation (I didn't even know Rob Schneider was in it till I saw the credits at the end, nor did I know that Sean Astin had been in the Lord of the Rings as I have studiously avoided seeing those films). Probably as a result, I thought both Schneider and Astin were great. In fact, Schneider and his kids were hilarious in every scene. The scary thing is, if I'd known it was Rob Schneider beforehand I might have judged him more severely. Don't ask me why, that's psychology folks, but it shows how difficult it is to be objective sometimes, and it certainly paid off to approach the film without any prejudice.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story is engaging enough - it even makes you think a little: what would it really be like to wake up each day and not remember the recent past? You know how sometimes you wake up and wonder where you are (or who you are)?... it's not totally unrealistic (as opposed to Groundhog Day, which was just fantasy) but not totally serious at the same time. Drew's performance - a bit silly, a bit serious - was in perfect balance, and this balance between silly/serious was echoed throughout the whole film quite successfully. Some people have criticised the use of cute animal characters, but Sandler has to play it straight for most of the time, and the animals (plus Schneider) provided the necessary balance. Very nicely done, I would say.<br/><br/>A slight feeling of repetition in the middle is the film's only real flaw, but any weakpoints are forgiven by the time we reach the stunning ending. Stunning is not too strong a word - I don't think anyone was expecting the final scene, in which the story - and Drew - provides a very satisfying, beautiful and thought-provoking moment that will (if you are a person of reasonable sensibility) stick in your mind for some time. This final scene was marvellous in the way it captured and tied up all the elements of the story very quickly and with just a little low-key dialogue - with Drew, in fact (and understandably) being lost for words. To imagine this scene being repeated every day is fairly breathtaking.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"Anonymous_Maxine","6","10","28","22 July 2004"," What do Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Memento, and Groundhog Day have in common?
","Well, nothing really, but if you mix them all together you get this movie. Sandler and Barrymore delivered a wonderful romantic comedy with The Wedding Singer, the vast success of which made me more than a little skeptical about whether or not they could successfully play different characters than they played in that movie and still be convincing as they fall in love again. And again. And again. And again.<br/><br/>The psychological realism of Lucy Whitmore's (Barrymore) problem is beside the point. We already know that short term memory loss doesn't happen on a daily schedule, let's not split hairs here. The point is that her 'condition' (a great homage could have been made if it had been described that way in the movie at some point, by the way) provides a constantly re-booting stream of possibilities for Adam Sandler to act cute and make us all grin ('Sorry I'm not better looking') as he tries to stop being the gigolo that he is at the beginning of the movie and tries desperately to find a way to make Lucy fall in love with him permanently.<br/><br/>If you can get past the requirement that you have to believe that any character played by Adam Sandler is a womanizer, then you're well on your way to enjoying the movie. Sandler puts in sort of a mixture of his traditional roles, which tend to include either a lot of sarcasm and anger and fart jokes if he's in a sophomoric comedy like Billy Madison or Big Daddy, or a hopeless and lovable romantic, desperate for affectionate attention but unable to communicate his intentions with women. And while there is plenty of gross out in the movie (consider a scene, for example, where Sandler's co-worker, Jennifer, who is a gross-out ploy him/herself, is covered from head to toe in the flying vomit of a gleeful walrus), Sandler's character pretty much sticks to his determination to win Lucy's heart for more than one day at a time. Yes, there is discussion about walruses having the largest penises in the animal kingdom, but is that really important when you have scenes like the one where Lucy and Henry (Sandler) both catch each other dancing in joy about their first successful encounter in the restaurant in the beginning of the movie?<br/><br/>Of course the typical Sandler cast members are all here. The incomprehensible coach from The Waterboy plays the part of Lucy's protective father, Rob Schneider, as usual, plays distantly below his comedic abilities as a goofy character who wears too-short shorts and has discolored eyes and a bad accent, and Dan Aykroyd also makes a clever cameo appearance, while Sean Astin delivers yet another embarrassing performance as Lucy's insecure and bulky brother with an extreme lisp. It is indeed strange and unfortunate to observe what happens to child stars when they stop being cute.<br/><br/>The movie makes clever use of videotape to remind Lucy every day of who that guy is in her bed with her, and makes a pretty charming conclusion to her ultimate, and necessary, decision that it's not fair for Henry to have to put up with reminding her who he is every day. The major problem with the movie, however, is that it suffers from the confliction of the characteristics of the character we're supposed to like. This is exactly why Bad Santa didn't work, we were supposed to root for a guy who literally had not a single solitary redeeming value.<br/><br/>The movie starts off by showing what Henry Roth's (Sandler) daily life is like, living on a tropical island and routinely bedding sexy tourist women looking for some horizontal accompaniment during their vacation. As he's trying to rid himself of a beautiful woman, he tells her that he's a secret agent who must avoid her for her own protection. Sure, the piece worked pretty well by itself in the theatrical trailer, but when it's attached to the rest of the movie it presents Henry not only as an un-trustable womanizer, but it also makes him out to be a complete moron to think that any girl with a thought in her head would buy such a nutty story. Character change is important, but it doesn't have to be from one extreme to the other.<br/><br/>The result of combining this character with the much more interesting story of Lucy's memory disorder is a romantic comedy that's not as funny as a more deliberate, low-brow Sandler movie, and barely romantic at all. Lucy's memory disorder could have provided the premise for a far superior movie had it been made as a drama and without Adam Sandler. It's as if Sandler wandered onto the set of a dramatic film about her problem and he turned it into this. The interactions that Lucy has with her family, and especially the palpable care that her father clearly has for her certainly deserve a better movie. It tries to do too many different things and ends up doing none of them well."

"CinemaSerf","6","1","1","14 March 2020"," Quite a fun concept adequately executed...
","A harmless feel-good romantic comedy with Adam Sandler on usual form as a bit of a commitment-phobe. That is, until he meets ""Lucy"" (Drew Barrymore"") and he really thinks he has found true love. The snag is that she has some pretty serious short-term memory issues and so each time they meet, he has a sort of first date groundhog day to get through. This is a bit of a one joke movie, though some of the daily variations inject a little extra to the, sometimes laboured, prevailing theme. Decent enough performances from the leads - with a strong supporting cast (including Dan Ackroyd, Sean Astin & Rob Schneider) - make this a watchable, if forgettable rom-com."

"aebrown-35726","10","1","1","31 May 2019"," 50 First Dates movie Review
","50 First Dates review<br/><br/>I fell in love with the movie, 50 First Dates while lying on my hospital bed. I saw how Adam Sandler jumped through hoops for Drew Barrymore despite her condition and it gave me hope. The film 50 First Dates directed by Peter Segal was made in 2004. Featuring Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, and Kevin James. The plot of the film focuses on a romance between ""Lucy"" who suffers from memory loss and ""Henry,"" who is a funny sailor who also manages an aquarium. The theme of the plot was romance and comedy. The movie has a lot of funny actors like Sean Astin, Rob Schneider, Maya Rudolph, and Allen Covert. The main Characters were Lucy (Drew Barrymore) and Henry (Adam Sandler). The main conflict if the film was protagonist vs self because Lucy is angry with herself for not being able to remember anything from after the day she lost her memory.<br/><br/>First Henry is introduced as a humoris ""player"" who is also an aquatic veterinarian. Henry meets Lucy at a cafe in Hawaii, they both hit it off and exchange contact information to meet again in the future. The film then introduces Lucy's at home life with her brother, Doug and father, Marlin. They show how Doug and Marlin have to ""reset"" the day after Lucy goes to sleep, the film later explains that Lucy lost her memory due to a car accident that both Lucy and Marlin were in on the day of her dad's birthday. Henry sees Lucy again, at the same cafe but is startled when Lucy does not remember him. Henry then finds out about Lucy's memory loss through Doug and Marlin. This doesn't change how Henry feels about Lucy, infact Henry decides that he will try to ""woo"" Lucy everyday to make her fall in love with him all over again.
Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have a real tv chemistry that makes the audience fall in love with Henry and Lucy even more. The 2 also play as an romantic couple in the 2014 film, ""Blended."" Adam Sandler brings the humor to the film with his funny bestfriend Ula, played by Rob Schneider. Drew Barrymore totally crushed the role of Lucy! The way she acted as though her memory had been erased was very convincing. The film based in Hawaii the visuals show a lot of beaches and Palm trees which makes the film feel more romantic.<br/><br/>This film brings you on an emotional rollercoaster, a lot of laughter and smiles, but also tears. The film also really makes you reevaluate yourself and appreciate what you have. Overall the film leaves all audiences with the same question; ""what would I do in either Lucy or Henry's shoes?"""

While not much in the way of character depth nor real substance, this lightweight but clever movie plays on Groundhog Day and other Momento devices that contribute to a rather fun and enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>Hopefully Drew will begin to expand on her future roles and Adam will begin to enter into a Tom Hanks, Robin Williams maturity phase that will really demonstrate what Adam is made of."

","Adam Sandler stars as Henry Roth, the leading man whose womanizing ways change when he falls for a younger girl Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore. The concept of the film is relatively simply but it is quite interesting, how the film could have been (for better or for worse) seems to be cut from the same cloth as the lame line of humor, but the romance story that develops around the idea actually achieves a certain level of charm. A major reason why Adam Sandler comes off fairly well in the film is the rest of the cast simply stay out of Barrymore's way whenever she appears; her effortlessly beguiling performance generates both smiles and genuine poignance. The ending is quite unique but it makes sense in the way. All together, 50 First Dates is a decent watch for Sandler fans, and those of mysterious romantic comedies."
"squirrel_burst","6","1","1","18 February 2015"," Slightly above average for a romantic comedy, genius for Adam Sandler
","There are some serious problems with ""50 First Dates"" but thanks to some good chemistry between the leads it works enough of the time to warrant a mild recommendation. The plot follows Adam Sandler as Henry Roth. He specializes in picking up vacationing women and then dumping them right before they go back to their regular lives. One day Henry meets a woman named Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). The two hit it off and set up a date to meet the next morning but when Henry approaches her, she doesn't remember him. Turns out one year ago Lucy was in a car accident which left her incapable of forming new memories; every day she wakes up thinking it's Sunday, October 13. Despite her condition, Henry is smitten. Against the wishes of her family and despite the warnings by her friends, Henry attempts to romance Lucy over and over.<br/><br/>When the movie is focused on the romance between Henry and Lucy, it works. Sandler and Barrymore have some good chemistry and there's a genuinely romantic idea at work here. Who wouldn't want to be loved by someone who would go above and beyond to make sure they were happy, even if it meant suffering and getting their heart broken every night? Thanks to her bubbly personality, Barrymore convincingly plays a woman that is a lot of fun to be around and would be worth the time and effort required to have her fall in love with you daily. Sandler also does a good job, playing a guy that falls hard for the girl and manages to make himself seem worthy when he doesn't resort to coddling her like everyone else. Sure at first he's an unrealistically talented ladies man that's basically a scumbag (and not a particularly clever one at that) but I warmed up to him eventually. The two leads make a good couple and their characters are well developed with some subtle touches (for example, you know that Lucy loves elephants not because she says so, but because she's constantly painting them). This is what manages to save the movie from the dreadful comedy that is typical of the Happy Madison brand.<br/><br/>The romance and the couple involved are charming, but whenever the story focuses on the ""comedy"" side characters, you want to fast-forward through the film. Typical of Adam Sandler's brand of humor these are all either weird ethnicities, are physically deformed, unattractive and/or speaking in funny voices. I absolutely hate this kind of comedy. Yeah I know it appeals to some people, but so does a well-placed kick to the crotch (oh wait, there's some of those in the movie). Here's what you can look forward to cringing at: Rob Schneider as Ula, a marijuana enthusiast with a weird eye that hates his wife; Sean Astin as Marlin, Lucy's lisping, steroid-addicted brother; Lusia Strus as Alexa, a dimwitted marine biologist (or marine assistant, whatever) whose gender is unclear, and a bunch of other one-joke characters that contribute nothing worthwhile to the film. If the story could have just disposed of these time-wasters and the sub-plot where Henry is a commitment avoiding womanizer (which gets suddenly dropped about a third into the film anyway) the whole thing could have been very sweet and very romantic. I can picture it now, the doomed romance, the question of ""does love conquer all?"" We might even have a bittersweet ending, reminding us that it is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all because who could really keep up this elaborate romance for the rest of their life? Someone out there please rip off this movie and forget to include all of the comedy! I have very mixed feelings about the movie overall. I even get some inner dilemmas that are totally unrelated to the general plot of the movie! As a responsible adult, I feel like I should be obligated to take away a half star from ""50 First Dates"" for having a lame joke that involves spoiling the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" but the movie also has a scene where Rob Schneider gets brutally beaten by an aluminum baseball bat-wielding Barrymore, so I think those two cancel each other out.<br/><br/>In the end there is enough in the film that works to make it overall a pleasant experience, particularly because the further into the story you go, the less Adam Sandler's traditional humor is present. It's too bad the film makers lacked confidence in their love story because it really could have been great and as is, it's just OK, with the good chemistry and compelling love plot raising it to just above average. If lame humor that at times involves a walrus projectile vomiting, constant references to sea animal genitalia and a lot of mean-spirited humor is exactly what you're looking for, you'll have a great time (though I wonder if you'll appreciate the love story). If what I just described seems like utter rubbish it is... but that stuff doesn't last too long and by the end you'll have mostly forgotten about it so you'll still have a good time thanks to the leads.

When he meets art instructor, Lucy (Barrymore), he realizes that he's finally ready for commitment. The catch?

She lives everyday thinking it is her father's (Clark) birthday. They go on a series of dates, that is truly funny and heartwarming.<br/><br/>This is the Adam Sandler I miss. He does wacky and immature comedy that plugs many laughs, and still gives a wondrous life lesson. The problem with him today is, he can't find an even balance between the two. The Grown Ups movies had good lessons, but weren't funny and the second one made no sense. Blended has a nice serious side, but was not funny at all. 50 First Dates is hilarious, makes sense, and has great seriousness that it needs. The main idea of this is that love has no boundaries. Henry doesn't mind that Lucy forgets who he is everyday, because he loves her so much and is willing to do anything for her. This general premise has been done, but 50 First Dates is nearly at their levels as a whole. The comedy and moral are at all-time highs for the two stars.<br/><br/>3.5/4"

","50 First Dates is Drew Barrymore's finest! What a sweet movie! Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, Hawaii's Casinova, who goes after women for a one night stand- but that all changes when Henry spots Lucy, a local, in a restaurant. The two of them hit it off magnificently and they make a date to meet for breakfast the next morning in the same place. When Henry approaches Lucy the next day, she doesn't remember who he is at all. Turns out that she was in an accident and has short term memory loss.<br/><br/>The movie was truly great. One of my all time favorites. Adam Sandler is a good actor and Drew Barrymore was terrific.

The directing, music, editing, etc are not focused on at all. Overall, the film was...""eh"". Sorry Sandler, but almost every joke in this movie is absolutely pointless.

","First of all, this movie is one of my absolute all-time favourites. The first time I saw it, I cried like a baby at the end, and continued to do so for the best part of an hour afterward. I was watching it alone, on DVD, so I was able to fully let go, completely releasing myself into those blissful waves of emotion. And yes, I do cry in movies now and then. But never like this.<br/><br/>50 First Dates is a synergy of many elements coming together: plot, themes, characters, humour, pathos, music, acting, etcetera, to create something that is entertaining, fresh, beautiful and real. The humour is less inane than you often get from Adam Sandler and his mates, and there is more genuine fun. But where the film really shines for me is that the movie is entirely about relationships, and there are so many of them ... Lucy with her father (Marlin) and brother (Doug), Nick and Sue at the diner, Henry and Ula, Ula with his kids, Henry with the aquarium animals, and of course Alexa mixes things up.<br/><br/>Okay, so the primary plot device, Lucy's memory problem, may not be realistic ... but that doesn't seem to matter. The movie makers have taken that idea and created from it an original story which is both light-hearted and poignant. The writing, casting, direction and acting are all excellent. Ignore the posters, which were terrible, and don't let the name of the movie put you off either. Just see it."

The leads have great chemistry, earlier they showed in Wedding Singer and now this. You will surely fall in love with the story and will be looking more towards your partner after this. Don't know why the critics have not rated it that good, probably they don't know what Love is as they are busy screwing and reviewing others."

","Honestly, I am shocked that such a great movie would get a rating of 6.8. It's great fun to watch over and over again especially with the cast able to pull off the roles with sincerity, it's one of the few great Romantic comedies of the decade that manages to be sweet, fun and sentimental at times. It's a movie that is not to be taken too seriously with Adam Sandler again playing round about the same character he always plays, but Drew Barrymore has come up with something special , she manages to be really cute playing her character and gets the sentimental angle just right, it's loads better than ""Wedding Singer"" (Sandler and Drew's previous film together) what's refreshing is the funny dialogues of the side cast , the pet animals used in the shooting. All these things really go to show that the movie is making a sincere effort towards making you laugh and I laughed throughout the film indeed. If you are the scientific type and don't like Romantic Comedies this is probably not the film for you , for those of you who enjoy fun movies this is IT! It has a got a great soundtrack featuring Sir Paul McCartney, Beach Boys and at the end of it it is just fun to watch, it does not require you to think a lot and delivers on what it promises i.e enjoyment."

They hit it off and have breakfast together. They plan to see each other the next day at that same café, but when Henry goes to talk to her, the next day, she doesn't remember who he is.

"OllieSuave-007","8","1","1","24 January 2014"," Interesting romantic comedy.
","This is an interesting romantic comedy starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Henry Roth (Sandler) is a worker at a Hawaiian ocean park and meets Lucy Whitmore (Barrymoore) in a local restaurant one day. They both get to know each other and feel a relationship forming but, the following day, Lucy does not recall meeting Henry. He later discovers that Lucy suffers from short term memory loss resulting from an accident and can't remember each individual day, meaning she does the same things every day.<br/><br/>While many romantic comedies have the same story development and formulas (dating, falling in love, breaking-up, getting back together, etc.), this movie actually has a unique and interesting story line. It is astonishing to see the different types of memory loss people actually suffer like Lucy's - living each day only to forget what she did yesterday and relives the same routine events again. There is also a patient depicted in this film where his memory only lasts 10 seconds - astounding. <br/><br/>It is pretty exciting to see Henry try to win Lucy's heart over and over again even though she forgets him the next day, and it is exciting to see all the lengths he goes through to win her heart despite her short-term memory loss. This gives the film a pretty entertaining plot and storyline.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad and I especially liked the Marlin Whitmore character (Blake Clark) - witty and no-nonsense. I also liked the Hawaiian setting, giving it a fresh, carefree and bright atmosphere and the ending's song (Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's version of ""Over the Rainbow"") was a fitting piece of music for the film - sadness, yet hopeful in a huge horizon).<br/><br/>Overall, an unique romantic comedy that will surely entertain.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

","When I saw this film on Netflix, I had a feeling I would despise it. After all, I hate Grown Ups 1 and 2, Jack and Jill, and pretty much everything Adam Sandler has put out since he's become comfortable with his fame.<br/><br/>And that feeling was still there the first 20 minutes. It had all the bad Adam Sandler-movie clichés. A weird guy, who is more creepy than funny (two in this one), kids saying inappropriate words and giggling, and Adam Sandler somehow being able to directly communicate with animals.<br/><br/>And then everything just changes... completely.<br/><br/>I was struck with a LOGICAL dilemma. Adam Sandler falls in love with a girl who wakes up every morning not remembering the last day. The parts of the movie that work off of this genius idea are brilliant and entertaining as hell. The comedy during these parts is actually good, too.<br/><br/>Even though the movie occasionally goes into dumb territory, the main plot kept me watching and invested, and for this the film gets a solid 8/10.

"lolooo70","Null","1","1","24 September 2013"," 50 First Dates
","""50 First Dates"" is a story that combines facts, funny, romance, and comedy. The film is written by George Wing, and directed by Peter Segal. The main character is Henry Roth (Adam Sandler). Henry plays the role of a veterinarian at Sea Life Park on the island of Oahu with a reputation of womanizing female tourists. One day Henry met a girl in the restaurant she was Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). Lucy is a person who has accident when she was with her dad, and this event gave her amnesia. Most part of the film photographed in Oahu, Hawaii. 50 First Dates is a film worth seeing because it has an amazing, funny, and lovely plots, convincing acting, and wonderful, quick direction. <br/><br/>The story of the film offers two ways, the first way from the typical Hollywood romance. For example, the way that Henry chose to tell Lucy the true about her illness, and he gave her a video type, that has the picture of the accident. Henry tried to help and support Lucy until the end by reminds her everyday what happened the last day. Moreover, every time Lucy kisses Henry, she side to him ""nothing as the first kiss,"" it romantic and emotional. Other parts film focus in humor and funny. For example, when Henry tried to do anything to get Lucy's attention, first time Henry failed to make relationship with Lucy, he tried to do something else. He tied to show her, he is a illiterate and he put some of water under his eyes. Other example, when Henry tried to meet Lucy everyday by a weird way. One day Henry and his friend did a prank. Henry's friend hit him in the street and he said, ""Gives me your wallet."" Lucy saw that, and she stepped by him. She hit Henry's friend until he ran a way. Other point, this film portrayed a lot of reality a lot of people who have amnesia are forced to live in a hospital setting. In fact, the actors in the film were professional and witty, both Henry and Lucy played difficult roles. Henry played the role of both a romantic and a comedian For example, when Henry tried to meet Lucy, he tired to meet her by a funny way, but when he with her, he played to role of romance."" Also, Lucy was gorgeous performer. She is that person, who are met the people and next day, she forgets everything For example, When Lucy gave appointment to meet next day, and then next day she forgot him and the meeting. In This film, Peter Segal chose gorgeous places to shot their movie scenes. For example, Lucy father's house was near from the beach. Also, the music was slow and romantic. Peter Segal took a great photo to Henry and Lucy such as the picture for both of them when they were outside of the cave on the beach with the light of the fire. Other example of the great direction, Lucy and Henry where setting in the boat in the middle of the sea and the dolphins where jumping around them. Henry was singing to his lovely lady. This sense sends a feeling of love to the viewer. <br/><br/>Overall, the quality of this film was great by astonishing written, smart actors, sturdy director. While the film gives the viewer kind of feel good, and whatever the life is difficult by love and delight will be easier. In these days, if a person has any health problem his/her love will keep loving and supporting him or leaving him."

The storyline is original but classic at the same time, it is a movie which story is not like any other, a story which can make you literally laugh out loud but then cry the next minute. It is a true entertainment. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymoore performed incredibly well in this movie and so does every other cast in this movie. They were all very talented! 50 first dates is one of those movies you won't ever get sick of, it is one of those classics you will watch over and over again with your beloved family and friends at home on a rainy day.

","This move is a little out of Sandler's repertoire but it could be one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth: an ocean-cuddling bachelor who manages to enchant single women on their vacations in Hawaii, whose character also manages to use typical movie bachelor cliché. <br/><br/>Though this side of Sandler is well under-developed because he soon falls for a woman (Drew Barrymore) who is living a Truman Show-esque life with the same day re-inacted by her stern but then soon loving father and her obnoxious brother who often makes a fool of himself when displaying muscular pride. <br/><br/>Although the characters in this film sort of have a schizophrenia, due to the fact characters change insanely quickly, this film is indeed in its own. This is the romantic comedy unlike others. The humour is quirky and very little, with the walruses overused to display humorous inclination in Roth's life.<br/><br/>Though of course we expected a happy ending from the start (what is a Rom Com without one?) but this film is sure a success. Occasionally funny but unlike Sandler the humour isn't forced down our throats. We aren't laughing at his over-portrayal of an extreme character, we're looking at a guy who realises he wants to use any means possible to get the 'girl of his dreams'. <br/><br/>The film has unnecessary parts of it and Rob Schneider's part again was just absolute ridiculous, pushing stereotypes to the extreme in unfunny ways (Big Daddy his best attempt) but despite quick-changing characters this film is immense."

","For once I'm grateful for the Khamakazee antics of Sandler's acting ensemble, particularly Sean Astin and Rob Schneider. If Schneider wasn't playing such a farcial role, he would be a natural for an Oscar. Certainly the animals add a lot to the farce. The goofy humor makes the basically tragic scenario not only bearable but almost pleasant. It's also genuinely funny.<br/><br/>Sandler convincingly plays a marine biologist(!!!)in Hawaii who enjoys ""entertaining"" the ""mainlanders."" Sandler doesn't date ""locals"". He wants nothing to interfere with his dream of studying walruses. He discovers Barrymore having breakfast in a local bar and grill. What captures Sandler's attention, even more than her beauty, is Barrymore's creativity. What Sandler doesn't know is that Barrymore has brain damage. The brain cells which move short term memory to long term storage are destroyed. She forgots everything she's learned during the day while she sleeps. So, Sandler, the lothario who forgots his relationships with mainlanders after one week finds himself in love with a woman who forgets hers in 24 hours. That's writing genius, something you don't see very often, and Sandler, Barrymore, and Sandler's acting troupe handle it perfectly."
"mark.waltz","9","1","1","24 May 2011"," A practically perfect comedy with a delightful screen team.
","I can't think of any romantic comedy team of the past 20 years (other than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan) who perfectly fit each other like Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. They totally charmed me in ""The Wedding Singer"", so to see them together again in this totally sweet comedy was a treat. This is a film that other than a few sad sequences had me smiling the entire time in addition to laughing. Other than the opening (which seemed out of place, having a dozen or so women talking about their first and last date with Sandler) and a few gag sequences straight out of early Sandler films, this is a complete charmer, filled with romance and humanity, and perhaps, Sandler's most lovable character. As much as I like his early work (""Billy Madison"", ""Happy Gilmore"", and reluctantly ""Little Nicky""), those films were filled with an anger missing from this and ""The Wedding Singer"". Together, Sandler and Barrymore are a perfect match, and I hope they do more films together.<br/><br/>The basic storyline has Sandler meeting Barrymore in a Hawaiian restaurant, and not realizing she is brain damaged following a car accident, pursues her romantically. He has no idea that her short-term memory only lasts one day, and like an etch-a-sketch, erases once she goes to sleep. Rather than desert her, however, Sandler decides that he loves her enough to give up his own dreams just to be with her. He wins the trust of her eccentric father and her lisping, steroid taking brother, who once they realize he is sincere, allow him to court her anew on a daily basis. This leads to a situation that creates many entertaining moments and leads to a potential of sadness that it takes a magnificent writer to end in a satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>As usual, there are the typically eccentric supporting characters, familiar to those who know Sandler's work. From the funny (if a bit creepy looking) Hawaiian pothead (and his group of likable kids) to Sandler's androgynous Russian co-worker, as well as the staff of the Hawaiian restaurant, there's a lot of amusing bits with these delightful wackos. Even an amusing gross-out bit with a very funny walrus at the beginning doesn't come off as disgusting since its done so sweetly. If more recent Hollywood comedies could be like this, all would be right in the world of cinema. I can't think of another recent romantic comedy that is written with such love. This is what Hollywood magic is all about."

","I think this film, sort of falls right in the middle between bad and good. There are times when you almost want to turn off, because it can get really boring and dumb, and other times, when you almost feel like crying because of the emotion that the film carries. However, never do you feel the need to own this movie, or watch it every week.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, star in their second romantic comedy together, as two people who are attracted to one another from the first day they meet. However, Lucy (Barrymore) has to be reminded of that fact every single day. She has short term memory loss, and it's up to Henry (Sandler) to convince her each and every day that he is the love of her life, and she of his.<br/><br/>Picture 'Groundhog Day' only not as funny, cute or sweet. It's a really bad remake of that I guess. It does have it's moments though, of being sweet and cute, just not enough of them to make this one of the more worthy 'Happy Madison' productions. If you're a Sandler fan, I'd stick to 'Gilmore' and 'Wedding Singer', and if you're a Barrymore fan, stick with, 'Angels', and 'Mad Love'. This is not a better film for either actor, and I'm not terribly impressed with it."

"MovieManMenzel","5","1","1","20 February 2004"," A comedy, which at times wanted to be a drama but didn't work out to be the perfect dramedy
","Well its February of 2004 and there was only one film that opened this weekend. So I can't say I had much of a choice this weekend except to see 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. I don't know what to think of Adam Sandler anymore. His career started out good with many funny guilty pleasure films like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and The Wedding singer. Then he went to the Waterboy, which was one of the worst films I have ever seen, and then went on to do some so/so films like Big Daddy & Little Nicky. Then every film after Little Nicky as been worst than the next, first with Mr. Deeds, then the awful Punch Drunk Love, then the animated disaster Eight Crazy Nights, and finally the incredibility stupid Anger Management. So needless to say I was very hesitant to see his new film 50 First Dates. The trailer to me didn't look like something I wanted to see but I figured he was teaming up with Drew Barrymore again and I liked the Wedding Singer so I figured what the hell I will give it a shot. I am sure it can't be that bad. So continue on reading to read my thoughts on 50 First Dates<br/><br/>So I walked into the local AMC Theater tonight (Great Product Placement huh) to see 50 First Dates at the 5:20pm showing. The film started and the basic story is this, Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth who is a playboy that sleeps around with all these different women and maybe a guy or two since that's what the film was stating in the beginning. Henry does this because he is scared of commitment so he figures sleeping around would be the best way to never have to commit. Well one day he sees Lucy (Drew Barrymore) at the dinner where he normally goes to eat his meals. He immediately falls in love with her and is no longer afraid of commitment. He only finds out later that Lucy suffers from Short Term Memory Loss and this is were the fun is supposed to start. To me the film seemed more like a Farrelly Brothers comedy than anything else. <br/><br/>Well Adam Sandler is back at it again, same role as always, playing the immature guy who then all of a sudden grows up because he finds true love. Don't believe me watch Mr. Deeds, Anger Management; even films I liked of his like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore all have that love story. Well Adam Sandler does the best he can and by now if you like Adam Sandler you see him do the same thing over and over again and still go home happy. Drew Barrymore was pretty good in the film, although I liked her better in the Wedding Singer. She has a very likable character in the film and the way they write her character you feel very compassionate for her. I also think that Sandler and Barrymore both have great on screen chemistry. The supporting cast in this film is what really drove me nuts and which caused me to not like the film as much I probably would if they haven't been in it. I normally like Rob Schneider (yes he is my guilty pleasure for comedy) but in this film he was intolerable. I wanted him to go away. He annoyed me. His role was so dumb. He played this guy name Ula who was an always-high adventurer. Then we have Steve Astin who played Doug, Lucy's Brother in the film. I didn't get the joke in his character. He had a lisp and took steroids.. To me the character was very annoying. Well then they had this transsexual character, which seems to be the new latest joke in the Sandler films, again another badly written character that I would have been more than happy to do without. <br/><br/>Newcomer George Wing wrote 50 First Dates and I have to assume that he sat down with Adam Sandler and revised the script a bit because there were some very Sandler moments in the film, which we all know he had to put in himself. The film itself seems like something the Farrelly brothers would have done. They usually take a serious disease or syndrome and turn it into a joke. I didn't think a lot of the jokes in the film worked. It was like they were first making fun of the syndrome and the character with the syndrome and then all of a sudden they want us to feel bad for the character. Granted it worked for some people but it didn't really work for me. Jen thought the film was sad and I thought of it more as a sappy way to get you to feel bad for the character. Either way is fine but I didn't care for them trying to mix my emotions. I didn't want to laugh at the character and then feel bad about it, which is basically what the film aimed to do. The Henry Roth character was decently scripted and so was Lucy's character. All the rest of the characters should have been thrown away. It was a so/so script some of it worked, some of it didn't. This film is like a version of Memento if it was turned into a romantic comedy. <br/><br/>The film was directed by Peter Segal, who directed a total of six feature films, 50 first dates being the 6th. The first three films he directed I really enjoyed those being Naked Gun 33 1/3, Tommy Boy, and My Fellow Americans. Then he went on to direct the awful Nutty Professor 2 and Anger Management. So with a director who's first half of films I really enjoyed and the second half of films I didn't really like at all its hard to judge him. Mr. Segal did a great job of capturing the emotions of Lucy in the film. I also think he did a really good job with filming on location in Hawaii. He really caught the beautiful landscapes. I can't really blame the director for the things I didn't like about the film. Well I guess I can because in the end, he probably could have reviewed the film and taken some of the pointless and unfunny characters out. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, I wasn't thrilled with 50 First Dates but it was all right. I must admit it's a hard film to hate. You really start to feel for the Lucy character in the film. The movie was passable at best in my opinion. Jen, on the other hand, was happy with the film and stated that she will be purchasing the DVD for our collection. I can't say anything more than it was a so/so movie. A few jokes worked, many didn't. I actually laughed 2 or 3 times throughout the film and I smiled a few times. I guess that's the best way to judge what I thought of it. So my final thoughts if you like Sandler give this movie a shot I am sure you will enjoy it. If your not a huge Sandler fan or aren't a fan of his at all there are better films to see. The highlight of the film for me was seeing the Johnny Depp Secret Window trailer again. This film would be best at a rental level at the local video store when it hit shelves sometime in the future. My final rating for 50 First Dates is a 5/10."

It's an insult to the audience's intelligence that we're expected to believe that, every day, Drew Barrymore's character's father and brother repaint a room, and have thousands of copies of the same day's newspaper cleverly squirreled away in their house.

","This movie stinks to high heaven.  The script is so unfunny that no-one over the age of 7 would find it amusing.  The acting is so bad that even Along Came Polly looks good beside it.  The direction is sloppy.  Overall, every scene is utterly predictable.<br/><br/>More seriously, this movie is ideologically offensive.  For a start, it's deeply racist. According to this film, native Hawaiians are dirty, lazy, stupid, and socially unsophisticated.  Additionally, the movie never misses the chance to make a homophobic wisecrack, even throwing in an androgenous zoo worker to create even more opportunities for seriously cheap jokes. To make matters worse s(he) is given Viking hair - evidently in the director's opinion, people from Northern Europe haven't got beyond the Viking era yet.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the fact that you will be so bored that you'll want to shoot yourself 30 minutes in, I don't believe any responsible parent would want their kid to see this film.  It's the kind of objectionable trash only a family wedded to the Ku Klux Klan would enjoy. That it can get a 6.8 reading on IMDB is a serious indictment of public taste."
"rebeljenn","2","7","18","19 March 2006"," Only offers short term fun
","As I am not a fan of Adam Sandler and his type of humor, this film is no exception to the rule. Sandler plays a young man in Hawaii who is afraid of commitment until he meets a young girl who suffers from short term memory loss after an accident. Finally, Sandler's character commits to help this girl, and he falls in love. This is pretty much the same mold that his other films portray. If you enjoyed Sandler's sense of humor and other films, then you will probably enjoy this one too. The comedy can be funny in some places, but it is crude in others, but only expect to remember the jokes in the short term (no pun intended!). The humor, however, is not quite as crude as some of his previous films. As I am not a fan of Adam Sandler and this type of comedy, I have to rate this one a 2/10."

","My mother rented this film and I didn't want to see it cos I thought it would be just slushy and girly and really predictable. HOW WRONG I WAS!!!! This is an absolutely FANTASTIC movie!!! Nice to see Adam Sandler back on form after Punch Drunk Love (what was THAT about!!?) even though it's not his best and felt kinda muted to me - a bit more gross out humour would have done it, but if you have a mental character in a film I suppose there's only so far you can go. Drew Barrymore is REALLY SWEET!!! I mean REALLY SWEET!!!!!! Which is just such a surprise as I've never seen her do that before. And I really didn't see that ending coming. It had me in tears!!! I like a film to be unpredictable and this one was in spades. My mother said it reminded her of Groundhog Day but I said who cares, that's an old b&w film and who remembers that anyway? She agreed with me after a while. So GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Fifty times!!!"

","This movie is the theatrical equivalent of Chinese water torture - slow, tedious, annoying, painful. The plot consists of a tragic and utterly depressing backstory that's dressed up as a candy-coated romantic comedy. The characters consist of what I guess are supposed to be wacky and hilarious people and sea animals, but the lines are poorly timed and/or written and the personalities so far-fetched that they are completely shallow and unrelatable. Rob Schneider should be a spokesman for an environmental activism group, because he is the king of recycling. The jokes consist mainly of walrus penises and other toilet humor. You know the writing is bad when they bring in animals as actual characters. Don't waste your time and money, do something more exciting like sort your loose change in to piles ordered by the date they were minted."

","50 First Dates is a watchable, sort of funny but nothing more. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have genuine chemistry. The film's premise, about a guy who falls in love with a woman with no short term memory is not very funny. The movie gets off to a slow start, with Barrymore's father and brother trying to tell her it's the same day all over again day after day. This part of the movie is not believable because sooner or later she would catch on. The second half improves because it has more of Barrymore and Sandler together. Still, I am not a big fan of Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore. Sandler plays the same character over and over again. I think Barrymore is a good actress who has wasted herself in one mediocre movie after another, such as the Charlie's Angels movies. I think she can do better. A generous 5/10"

","While this movie did have a couple ( and I mean just a couple ) good laughs, mostly it was filled with juvenile, toilet humor ( not that this is always bad ) which had nothing to do with the story itself. It looked to me like the main story wasn't long enough, so all kinds of dumb jokes were thrown in to stretch it out. Rob Schneider's role should have been completely left on the editing room floor - added absolutely nothing to the story. I suppose that is what I found very disappointing about this movie - it started out with an interesting idea, but got bogged down in the usual dumb jokes that usually fill an Adam Sandler movie. I really expected a lot better from both of them after ""The Wedding Singer"" ( by far, Sandler's best movie )."

","I have to say first of all that Drew Barrymore is my favourite actress, she is not only very very pretty, but extremely charismatic and talented. And her wonderful essence shined through as always in this film. I also adore Adam Sandler- he is very very funny and charmingly silly and all his great characteristics donned the screen. However, this movie was a bit of a disappointment for me. I do admit that it was entertaining and the story line kept my interest from beginning to end, but if it wasn't for the two amazing stars in it -Barrymore & Sandler- this movie would've totally sucked. I guess I was offended by the way the story made fun of amnesia and short-term memory loss. I kept thinking throughout the whole movie that if someone really had this disorder, it would be completely and utterly awful! I know that comedy is meant to make light of certain negative things and I did laugh often, but I would immediately feel guilty... so I constantly had mixed feelings about everything that was going on in the film. The setting is in Hawaii and therefore the movie brings you to a warm and welcoming place. There is also a great collection of '80's & '70's songs scattered throughout the film that is also very comforting and nice to hear. There are many good qualities about this flick, but if you are very sensitive like I am, the issue of making fun of a mental disorder/physical disability may offend you- so be prepared. However if you can look past that, you can find yourself having a good time."

","America's fascination with all things Sandler proves there is a devil, and Satan purchased this lame comedian's soul about 10 years ago.<br/><br/>Granted, Sandler's performance in 'Punch Drunk Love' was charmingly off-beat. However, his nuanced delivery was more the work of director Paul T. Anderson, who knew to keep Sandler under a tight reign, rather than any innate talent.<br/><br/>What we have here is a single joke (and I use the term 'joke' extremely loosely) 'comedy' that grows tired before the opening credits finish rolling. The very premise of the film, that Sandler essentially ignores ALL responsibilities (including earning a living) for several months to set up an elaborate scheme to restore Barrymore's memory, is purely idiotic. A lot of less-than-brilliant people seem to find this movie romantic, but if this is what passes for 'romance' these days, we are all doomed. <br/><br/>The secondary-characters are caricatures of people that were never entertaining to begin with. In fact, there is not one single thing in this movie that makes it worth recommending -- it's not funny, the plot is stupid, there is not one memorable quote and the characters are all boring, lacking coherent motivation.<br/><br/>Even the ending scene, meant to be endearing, is just plain moronic. SPOILER: Barrymore has a child with a guy that she 'meets' for the first time every single day? Their daughter is going to have some remarkable life with a mother that forgets giving birth daily. Just like the rest of this movie, this theme is pathetic and stupid.<br/><br/>Fortunately for me (and hopefully a few other sane people remaining on this planet), I avoided Satan's command to 'love Sandler no matter what garbage he gets paid $20,000,000 to do.' <br/><br/>If you have an IQ in the double digits, avoid this turd. 2/10"

","Adam Sandler can have a certain charm that helps him to carry a movie. We especially saw this in Punch-Drunk Love, but also to a lesser extent in The Wedding Singer where he starred alongside Drew Barrymore, who not so coincidentally is his co-star in 50 First Dates, the latest in Sandler comedy.<br/><br/>The premise is something like this: Sandler plays Henry Roth, a philandering marine veterinarian in Hawaii who happens to meet and fall in love with a girl named Lucy (played by Barrymore). He's excited and with a moment's notice pretty much ready to drop everything he had going in life up to this point. Only thing is, the next day Lucy doesn't even remember Henry. As we soon find out (if we hadn't already from the trailer and talk all over the internet), Lucy has no short term memory and every time she falls asleep, she forgets all that happened in the previous day. What's more, her father and steroid-obsessed brother with a lisp (played by Sean Astin) make sure that Lucy doesn't realize that she has this short term memory loss, so every day they go through the same actions as all the days before just to help out their sister who won't remember it anyway. If this sounds interesting, it could be, but read on...<br/><br/>The promise that such an idea holds is quickly wasted amongst the gross out humor that Sandler's movies (with the exception of the two I mentioned at the outset of this review) hold. We have a pretty serious thing going on here in Lucy's life and humor about Walrus testicles, she-women, projectile vomit, and wet dreams mixed in. It's really quite a distasteful mix. The scene where Henry finds out about Lucy's condition is just plain bad as well. It's delivered as some kind of giant surprise complete with flashbacks and the like, like you would see in some kind of suspense movie. But of course all seriousness is quickly lost.<br/><br/>The performances of Sandler and Barrymore are good. As comedies go, they make one of the better on-screen couples to be found. It's just the presence of all the other actors around them that screws things up. Most minor characters in the story possess absolutely horrid acting skills and quickly throw off the level of believability.<br/><br/>Honestly, the conclusion to 50 First Dates could have been pretty powerful had it not been for the 90 minutes of the movie that preceded it. If this movie was handled differently, it could have been a good one. But in the hands of those who made 50 First Dates, it certainly wasn't.<br/><br/>4 out of 10."

","The premise of this movie is incredibly stupid.

The problem is that Lucy has short-term memory loss and he has to wake up each day and re-convince her to fall in love with him. That's a pretty ridiculous scenario. That being said, I have no problem with the ridiculous plot-line. I pretty much expect it with an Adam Sandler movie. The problem with this movie is that its not funny enough to overcome to horrible plot. Normally, you accept the bad story line because all you really expect out of the movie is to laugh and enjoy it. With this movie, however, it seems like the creators wanted to make this like every other romantic comedy, where the love story is more important than the comedy. It just doesn't work in this case because its just not believable to think that these two characters would ever live happily ever after. There are some funny parts in the movie, but overall not enough to keep me interested throughout the film."

","I don't know what happened. The critics are raving about this film because it ""shows Sandler's humble and sensitive side"", but I am raving because we saw this side of him. Where was his Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison days? Have they long gone? I at least thought that it would be better or as good as The Wedding Singer, but alas, that dream didn't come true either. The moment we walked out of the theater after seeing this, my wife referenced it to a bowl of oatmeal. The lumpiness of it reminded her of this film.<br/><br/>50 First Dates just didn't make any sense. There were loopholes like crazy that our audience just didn't see because they were laughing at the walrus throwing up scene. There were scenes that were not finished, and there were actors that just didn't care that they were in the film. It is bad when people who have seen this film are talking more about Sean Astin and Rob Schneider more than Sandler or Barrymore. Astin, oddly enough, wore the same outfit in this film as his ""brother"" did in the Goonies movie. Coincidence? No, I saw this as yet another marketing ploy to make people think that there was something funny going on when there actually wasn't. Drew was off in this film. She just seemed like she was overacting, while it seemed like Sandler just wasn't himself. I guess that is what happens when Happy Madison productions and Flower Films team up to do a movie ... wait ... don't they both own those production companies? Cheap people. What was Dan Aykroyd doing in this film? There was a line that he said that just didn't seem to fit anywhere in the movie at all. He wasn't funny. Also, he was trying (or perhaps it was the director, but Aykroyd was in on it too) to milk every last drop from Tommy Boy. Something about Callahan motors paying for the doctor's office. I don't know, by that time I was ready to pass out from the boredom.<br/><br/>There was only one redeeming scene in this film, and that was close to the end. I am not even going to talk about it, because just like Barrymore in this film, I am hoping that I wake up tomorrow and I don't remember this at all. People just need to be educated. What gets me about this film is that if you watched the film, you would understand that the song that Barrymore sang, the pivotal song of the film ... the song that takes Sandler back to her ... was not sung because she remembered him, but because she remembered her parents. WAS NOBODY PAYING ATTENTION??? Arg. Where was Kevin McDonald? Where was Steve Buscemi? Where was the fun? Missing from this film.<br/><br/>The only compliment that I will pay this film is that it did make me want to go back to Maui. The background was beautiful. That is what the whole state is like. Too bad this film couldn't have been the same. Unless Sandler goes back to a serious director, I will definitely think twice about giving my money back to him. I sometimes wish that I could place his face on a milk carton and send it out ... send the message that we miss the old Sandler, and hope that he gets the message.<br/><br/>A man can dream ... can't he? <br/><br/>Grade: * out of *****"
"CurtMan@LVCM.com","Null","4","9","20 November 2004"," Charming and Fresh Sandler Romantic Comedy
","""50 First Dates"" features Adam Sandler in a more subdued comedic role than he has previously exhibited in films. His performance in ""50 First Dates"" is much akin to ""The Wedding Singer"", which is a pleasant deviation from his recently zany roles in outrageous comedies. He is teamed once again with Drew Barrymore, and (you guessed it), they once again develop a romance- yet is a romance really a romance when one of the partners cannot recall your name the following morning? This is a clever premise, set most curiously in Hawaii (perhaps the director felt a tropical setting was appropriate for the ""sweet and temperate"" plot): a man named Henry (Sandler) falls in love with a woman named Lucy (Barrymore), and despite their peculiarities and differences, they manage to really hit it off on the romantic course. That is, until the following morning, when Henry goes to meet Lucy in the diner and is acquainted with consternation: ""Who are you?"" Yes, Lucy appears to have a memory problem, short-term amnesia, where she cannot recall any events of the previous day. Why does Henry continue to woo Lucy, even after acknowledging that their (conscious) romance can only last a day? Perhaps love at first sight... So ensues a series of hilarious attempts by Sandler to woo and eventually form a romance akin to ""Groundhog Day"", where the same scenarios are carried out day after day until the man with the prerogative (or disposition thereof) finally decides to make important, helpful use of the situation. This is a sweet, charming, sometimes too sentimental, sometimes too implausible, and even smart, romantic comedy, featuring some delightful performances by Sandler and Barrymore, who once again prove their status as a romantic team in movies. The ending lacked much resolution, but at least it ended on a good note. Overall, I definitely recommend ""50 First Dates"" as a decent romantic comedy, and a handbook on how to make the girl of your dreams, who believes you are invisible or nonexistent, fall in love with you, time and again. *** out of ****"

But in Drew's case, there is no ""event"" such as a grenade explosion to mark the trauma, only the same psychological ""stuckness."" Drew has a state of mind that is the outline of a post traumatic stress disorder, without and actual event inside her mind.<br/><br/>So, without being able to address an ""issue"", in the classic Freudian sense, to help a person to possibly be free of it, Adam must approach it again and again, on a daily basis, with out any noticeable results, until the effects of his actions build up within the subconscious enough to finally surface out to the conscious, or external world (i.e. in Drew's paintings.)<br/><br/>In short, love can be transmitted subconsciously, and it is nice to see this shown or explained in a film. I suspect this kind of subtle influence is a forte of both Adam and Drew, and the film is a welcome treat for those of us who handle psychological burdens.

","The premise for this movie was, quite frankly, pure genius. It was one of those rare ideas that could be brilliant as either a comedy or a drama. This could have been a harrowing, yet beautiful love story. It could have been a riveting, intelligent comedy. But when they cast Sandler, it became neither.<br/><br/>Instead of telling an almost comically tragic story of love prevailing against impossible odds, they take a real medical condition and stretch it and stretch it until it becomes almost offensively unrealistic. I swear, ""Finding Nemo,"" who only had the condition for laughs, did it better than this movie, which was fueled by its very presence. <br/><br/>The directing is alright. There's rarely anything specifically wrong with directing in a movie. In addition to this, there were multiple occasions where I found myself laughing. There was one occasion that I was cracking up.<br/><br/>But those are the only redeeming qualities. The acting, writing, and realism are all atrocious.<br/><br/>The writing is my biggest problem. Once again, it takes a fantastic premise and wastes it on lesbian jokes. It wastes it on slapstick. It wastes it on vomit jokes. It wastes it on butt crack jokes, and worst of all, it wastes it on Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the acting. Barrymore was actually very good in this movie; I'm not going to lie. Especially considering the incredible emotion she's tasked with portraying, she's phenomenal. There are very few actors or actresses who can successfully pull off that very specific emotion of realizing that, well, this is the thousandth time you've seen that tape.<br/><br/>That being said, Sandler was absolutely horrible. Over the many, many years he's been making movies, he seems to have mastered the emotions of ""happiness"" and ""weirded out"" down to a science. Unfortunately, this movie requires him to feel actual emotion, and play a character that isn't exactly who he is already, and in the department of actually acting, he seems to be at a loss.<br/><br/>Really, really atrocious."

"Drew_Smith","4","3","6","6 January 2007"," Make up your mind
","The premise here is derivative but full of potential. In short, two lovers are stuck in the same day. The woman (Barrymore) is stuck due to a mental impairment that prevents her from retaining new memories. The man (Sandler) is stuck because, smitten with her, he resigns himself to the same fate. Day after day he takes her on a romantic first date, knowing she'll never remember him in the morning.<br/><br/>The filmmakers could have played this a number of ways. They could have played to Barrymore's strengths and made on those edgeless rom-coms in which everything turns out fine in the end. They could have played to Sandler's strengths and exploited the idea for cheap, crude laughs. They could have opted for the black humour and narrative fun of 'Groundhog Day.' There are certain filmmakers who would work this idea as a tragicomedy.<br/><br/>The problem is the filmmakers never choose one of the above paths. They try to negotiate them all. Therefore, despite some promise, we get a painfully uneven film that never resolves the issue of whether to take itself seriously or not. We get scenes that belong in a harmless rom-com, we get scenes that belong in a bittersweet drama, and we get scenes involving Rob Schneider and a barfing walrus. I doubt anyone could meld these into a cohesive film.<br/><br/>To understand why this doesn't work, consider the ending. The film concludes with a 'solution' that is presented as sweet and romantic. But it's not. Consider the dilemma Barrymore's character would wake up to every morning. Throughout the film, Sandler's character is presented as decent and well-meaning but what he does at the end is selfish and cruel.<br/><br/>Of the four stars I awarded, three are for Barrymore who tried hard to hold this mess together with sweetness and charm. In the end, though, this movie is just too poorly conceived."
"sddavis63","5","3","6","6 March 2006"," Could Have Been A First Rate Romantic Comedy If It Had Been Taken Seriously
","To be perfectly honest, I feel almost guilty giving this movie only 5/10. It has a lot of potential as a romantic comedy and there's a lot of fun in it, but for all the good points about this movie, it has a lot of weak points as well, that can be summed up as follows: Adam Sandler! I shouldn't be too hard on Sandler, I guess. I mean, he didn't produce this, or direct this, or write this. But he did star in it. From a strictly personal perspective, I simply don't care for Sandler; never have and never will. And even though I can't hold Sandler responsible for how this movie is put together, how it's put together and the fact that it fits Sandler to a ""T"" just reinforces to me what the problem with him is. It seems to me that he wants to be taken as a serious actor (the movies I've seen him in always seem to have something of a ""serious"" subplot to them) but I wonder if he just doesn't have the confidence to think he can pull it off, and so ends up falling back on the more juvenile plot lines that his movies will be largely remembered for.<br/><br/>This could have been a truly first-rate romantic comedy. The plot is probably nonsense from a medical point of view, but from a comedic point of view it's OK. Lucy (Drew Barrymore) suffers a brain injury in an accident and suffers short-term memory loss, which means that she remembers nothing since the accident, and she wakes up every day thinking it's October 13. (Sort of like ""Groundhog Day,"" except that Bill Murray's character knew he was repeating the same day over and over again.) Everyone around her protects her from reality by going along with what she remembers. Then, one day, Henry Roth (Sandler) enters the diner where Lucy is having breakfast, and they fall head over heels. The next day he's back, and so's she - but she doesn't remember a thing about him. The movie then proceeds with the premise that the love-stricken Roth has to convince Lucy to fall in love every day with a man who to her is a complete stranger in order to keep the relationship going. And that basic premise is good, and it works very well, and to give credit where credit is due Sandler plays the part well, when he's taking it seriously. But therein lies the problem. This is an Adam Sandler movie, and it has to fall into typical Sandler-style juvenile thinking, which is displayed largely around a couple of characters.<br/><br/>Why does Lucy's brother Doug (Sean Astin) have to be a lisping steroid-abuser? It would been far more effective had he been just another serious, caring and compassionate person in Lucy's life trying to protect her, and the character of Ten Second Tom (Allan Covert) is meaningless. Setting them aside, though, my real pet peeve then appears: the character Ula (Rob Schneider.) Ula grates on the viewer and is totally unnecessary to the movie's development, and serves no purpose whatsoever - absolutely none - except to get Rob Schneider a paycheck. As to Sandler's Henry Roth, I have no problem with him being a veterinarian, even a vet who specializes in walruses (someone has to, I guess) but the trained walruses in the movie kind of give this a sense of being an adult-oriented kiddie movie.<br/><br/>What a shame. It's really a good idea for a movie, and if its producers, writers, director, etc. had chosen to treat it as a more serious romantic comedy, it could have reached great heights. Drew Barrymore was superb as Lucy, alternatively being in love with Henry and then hating him (depending on the day) and portrays brilliantly Lucy's fear and shock at discovering the reality of her existence. Dan Aykroyd's talents were largely and unfortunately wasted as Lucy's neurologist, Dr. Keats. Lesser known Blake Clark was convincing as Lucy's protective (and over-protective) dad, and Sandler himself did very well when he was treating this as a serious movie for grown-ups. But the whole typical Sandler-Schneider thing just got to me and I can't give it any better than a 5."

It is a light-hearted romp rather than a serious film and should be judged in that way rather than overly seriously. One could cite the reality of head injury related memory loss and criticise the film for not properly tackling the seriousness and horror of the situation, but it is not meant to be a serious film about head injuries but a COMEDY!

In fact, showing how Lucy becomes frightened watching TV, while her relatives react in a sad deja-vu manner, is an effective way of depicting how the repetition of this day's activities is taking a toll on them (the relatives).<br/><br/>What follows next however, is totally disgusting, unconscionable and uncalled for: upon finishing their videotape, Lucy blurts out the surprise ending of ""The sixth sense"", with no warning and no useful effect on the plot of ""50 first dates"". This is called spoiling another film in the worst possible manner!!! I cannot express in words my disgust at this blatant act of chauvinism, as if the script were saying ""You should have seen that movie by now; if not, you're screwed"".<br/><br/>I am of the opinion that ""The sixth sense"" was a far superior movie than ""50 first dates"". (The number of awards nominated for and won by the former supports my opinion.) I point out as matter of fact that neither film has ANYTHING to do with each other. The question that begs to be answered is then, what business did the writers of ""50 first dates"" have in revealing the ending of ""The sixth sense""? WHAT THE F*** WERE THEY THINKING?!?!<br/><br/>*****Begin spoiler for ""The sixth sense""***** It turns out that I bought ""The sixth sense"" two-DVD set in a nice collector's edition box. As I watched it, I noticed too readily how the character played by Bruce Willis, a child psychologist, never spoke or confronted any person other than the boy played by H. J. Osment. He was never shown to be hired by the boy's mother. He never exchanged a word with his estranged wife. His actions were never shown to have an interactive effect with any other character of the movie. All these subtle details were carefully and meticulously filmed by director Shyamalan, but were intended to be reflected upon only after the viewer reached the final twist of this beautiful movie. For me, it was an agonizing torture to savor the tastelessness of each such detail, knowing all too well the ending that resonated in my head.<br/><br/>So, who in the cast and crew of ""50 first dates"" is responsible for this atrocity? Drew Barrymore, for speaking the unspeakable? Director Peter Segal, for forcing the words into Ms. Barrymore's mouth? Writer George Wing, for the incontinence and flatulence of his pen? Ms. Nancy Karlin, script supervisor, for neglecting to wipe the droppings of the writer? Whoever was responsible for this atrocity, he or she earned my scorn for eternity."

That said, the only gag I laughed at was when the walrus threw up but that was not enough to redeem this film for me. Those who like it, fair enough, I'm not trying to be rude or anything.

","My husband and I were drawn to this movie when it first came out, but only got around to seeing it last week.

My husband of course is not exactly like the girl in the movie (Lucy) but he does have short and longterm memory loss, as well as weakened impulse control and anger problems. We are active in the Brain Injury Association. This matters because Adam Sandler actually did a really good thing in making this movie. People with brain injury, and their families, rarely get the chance to laugh about it. Our family watched this movie together-although we had to cover our four year-old's eyes a few times. But he (the 4-year old) asked his daddy if he really has brain damage, and my husband answered him, and we had a real conversation about brain injury, all thanks to this movie, which opened us up. Yes, it is a sweet funny love story. But it was also a healing experience for our family-and I think Sandler may not have realized that he was really doing a good thing with this movie!"

","It is not unusual for Hollywood to create or discover a unique idea and then throw it right into gutter by making a movie about it. Most of the time they don't base the movie on the idea instead it entirety is about the idea. In any such case the content simply seems to say, ""The creators of this movie had an idea and they happen to think that you should know about it."" And this is another example. The basic theme behind ""50 First Dates"" is quite unacceptable for me. Or maybe it is bad writing and Drew Barrymore's acting.<br/><br/>After my above rant it is needless to say it was a badly written film. However, I must say I don't find Ms. Barrymore's acting abilities particularly entertaining and this was no exception. Her childish style and media craze attached to her physical properties, which was fuelled by her infamous Late Show adventure, makes her even more unattractive. Anyways this movie could not be better without Drew Barrymore, thanks to the writing.<br/><br/>I don't know how but Adam Sandler always manages to entertain with his monotonous acting and invariable style. He was no different in here but even he could not help this failure.<br/><br/>The idea of memory loss was not thought over thoroughly. Many of the paradoxes associated to such a condition were simply ignored. Given the human psychology and its basic instinct to stay wary of a total stranger – not to mention the psychological stress of given situations – such a scenario is impossible and help less.<br/><br/>""50 First Dates"" is not recommended if you don't want to wonder after watching it ""Is this really what I wasted a sunny afternoon for?"""

In this movie, Lucy Whitmore's (Drew Barrymore) memory cache is cleared every 24 hours. Her father and brother do all they can to make her life normal, they do a daily routine to set things up as though every day was the day after her last memory. Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) throws a wrinkle in her life when he tries to woo her in spite of knowing of her memory problem.<br/><br/>The story made for some very funny situations, and the Sandler/Barrymore duo is a good combination (definitely a whole lot better than the Sandler/Ryder combo).

","To twist the immortal words of Marlon Brando, ""This coulda been a contenda...""<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film a lot for what it was. It's fun & works, mostly because of the chemistry between Sandler & Barrymore. It's too bad Sandler's propensity for juvenile potty humor kept it from being an Oscar-winning classic.<br/><br/>Wonderful things about this movie? 1. The music totally, totally rocks. I sooo need this soundtrack. 2. The Hawaiian scenery & marine wildlife are gorgeous. 3. The vast majority of the principal actors are spot on with their performances, helping draw the audience into the story & setting. Drew Barrymore  amazing, wonderful, heartwarming performance. Sean Astin  hilarious. Rob Schneider  surprisingly believable. 4. The storyline/movie premise gets an A++. Not only was it original, but it dealt with Traumatic Brain Injury in a respectful way without magic Hollywood fixes.<br/><br/>Things that will keep me from buying this movie? 1. Vomiting animals as humor 2. Unnecessary crude language/humor 3. Rob Schneider's channeling of Cheech & Chong. The part could have been so much more had he not turned it into a stereotype. 5. The fact that Adam Sandler  while believable as an intelligent man who really cared for Drew's character  was completely unbelievable as a veterinarian. I mean, c'mon...Sandler going through medical school??? There's just no way on God's green earth that would happen & he would retain the juvenile sense of humor he exhibits throughout the film. Not to say that Sandler's interpretation of the role isn't amusing/heartwarming, etc. but I'm sorry, I just don't buy him as a vet. Part of the zoo cleaning crew? Now that, I would have bought.<br/><br/>All in all I'd say that this was sort of like watching a bunch of friends who enjoyed one another do their own silly spin-off of a movie they liked. I can only hope that a less adolescent re-make is made someday because, in the right hands, this script could be a masterpiece."

","""50 First Dates"" is one of the more enjoyable romantic comedies made in recent years, relying a lot on Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler's chemistry to carry off the out-there but original plot. The idea of Sandler's Henry Roth being the irresistible ladies' man that he's presented to be in the first few minutes is a stretch and thankfully falls away soon after he meets Barrymore's Lucy. What puts this movie above a lot of other Adam Sandler comedies is that, unlike many of his other love interests that might as well be named ""Love Interest"" for all they have to do with the plots, Lucy is an actual character who has a journey to go on too. The viewer really wants to see both main characters overcome their obstacles and come together at the end.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, however, is not as strong as it could be. Blake Clark delivers a fine performance as Lucy's doting, protective father and Dan Aykroyd has a nice extended cameo as her doctor. However, I don't buy Sean Astin as Lucy's steroid-enhanced, lisping brother; and Henry's sidekicks androgynous Alexa and Ula (Lusia Strus and Rob Schneider, respectively) are good for a gag or two but don't really serve a purpose. Meanwhile, Amy Hill as Lucy's surrogate mother Sue is sadly underused.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie, but it's a good movie that leaves you smiling at the end."

The idea of falling in love again each day has some potential, unfortunately the script goes all the time the easy way, combining bad taste and bore.

"larajane","Null","2","4","12 August 2004"," Couldn't. Possibly. Hate. This. More.
","I sort of watched 50 First Dates this morning, while i was waiting for laundry to finish. I say 'sort of' because i loathed it so much after the first 10 minutes that i watched in horrified fascination for 30 minutes and then, feeling slightly queasy, skipped through the rest in 5 minute chunks just to see how this heinous festival of suckage could possibly be brought to a conclusion that hadn't made it famous throughout the known universe as the most cringe worthy waste of celluloid since ..well..actually the last Adam Sandler film.<br/><br/>Only 'Little Nicky' was worse than this, though I cant say for sure because I never made it past the first 20 minutes of that, (the part where it was deemed hysterical to have breasts growing on someone's head) after realising life was too precious to waste on such compellingly awful dross.<br/><br/>I hesitate to dignify '50 First Dates' by analysing it, even for the purpose of this commentary, because analysis seems to somehow to endorse its poorly executed and insultingly simple minded premise. <br/><br/> From the opening scene where Henry is seen to be a opportunistic wide boy and congenital liar who has abundant and casual sex with any tourist stupid enough to fall for his drooling halfwit persona: 'Uh, I'm a ..ya know..uh..secret agent, so I cant see you again', I assumed he would get his come-uppance and learn the error of his ways in a predictable retribution/redemption scenario. Unfortunately this was not to be, as he is in fact rewarded for being a shallow dullard by winning the ever-so-cute mental patient of his dreams. <br/><br/>Some notable scenes which provoked uneasy gastric reminders of my breakfast were when he punishes his co-worker for eating his roast beef sandwich by asking her to put her face next to a walrus's mouth and makes it vomit over her; when his horrendous Hawaiian stereotyped surfing, pothead buddy dresses up as the aforementioned mental patient cutie by wearing a mop head as a wig and a coconut bra and licks his coconut 'nipples' for no apparent reason than to make a cinema audience of 11 year old boys snicker; when an entire ward of brain damaged patients fall about laughing because someone mentions the phrase 'wet dreams'. <br/><br/>Why did her good natured, steroid-taking brother need to have a lisp? Why did his friend need to be blind? Why were all the Hawaiian women clinically obese? It smacked of 'Let's all laugh at the freaks' schoolboy humour, devoid of wit, style, kindness or relevance. Why did a random character on a beach, whom we hadn't met before, and never met again, suddenly snicker and say 'I have to go for a tinkle'. Were they THAT hard up for dialogue?<br/><br/>I normally would have gone about my business after this talentless garbage was over - after all its not as if i paid to see it. But I logged onto IMDb to see if other people had been similarly appalled, and instead found pages of praise! This naturally enraged me enough to attempt a tiny redressing of the balance. Anyone with an IQ higher than that of cheese should really not see this movie. Its too late for me - but save yourselves!"

Barrymore plays a very sweet instructor who has a loving father and brother, but a short-term memory problem that creates the interest in the movie's story. I mostly like both Sandler and Barrymore, and they are good together here. The story is a fantasy, and best appreciated as such. It doesn't come up to the standard set by my favorite rom-coms, but it is a very nice movie in its own way.

She is different from all the others, and he looks forward to seeing her again the next morning. Which he does. But she has no memory of him and rebuffs what she senses is a pushy guy. Turns out she was in a car wreck a year or so earlier and developed a short-term memory problem, a specific kind (fantasy) which erases each day's new memories as she sleeps overnight. Akin to 'Groundhog Day', but exactly the opposite, where days continue but her memory does not. But Sandler persists, as he develops a particular affection for this sweet girl, gains the trust of her dad and brother, uses videotape to show her their relationship. Movie ends with her waking up on a boat, looking out a port hole, going on deck, there are Sandler and their daughter, videotape remaining her connection with previous days."

","'50 First Dates' is Sandler in his typical innocuous role just as he has in nearly every role he's been in since he started making movies. But, this one, probably because of an unusual love story and a decent supporting cast, is much better than his recent mediocre fare which includes 'Mr. Deeds,' 'Eight Crazy Nights,' and 'Anger Management,' three of the most mundane comedies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is Henry Roth, a veternarian who initially appears to be a real jerk. The introduction features several women sharing with their girlfriends about a romantic fling they had during their vacations, all with the same guy: Henry Roth; a guy who hates commitment. All that changes for Henry when he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) at a local cafe. Unfortunately, the one girl he's really fallen in love with turns out to have no short-term memory. Her brain damage is a result of a car accident and she can't make any new memories. So, every day she gets up thinking it's exactly the same day that it was when she had the accident. Hence the title, '50 First Dates.' <br/><br/>The story is very reminiscint of 'Groundhog Day,' in that the same situation is repeated over and over again. Except, Lucy doesn't know that she'll be reliving that same day again and again. And although her father (Blake Clark) and brother (Doug) always try to recreate the same day for her--her father's birthday, the last day she remembers--Henry wants to make the most of the day for Lucy, starting every day by telling Lucy about her accident, and essentially, spend time with her for the rest of the day. Henry Roth really falls in love with this girl, so it's a matter of is he going to be doing this for the rest of his life since the people at the institute have basically declared her condition incurable? <br/><br/>It's a pleasant comedy and makes for an interesting love story, although at times a pretty sad one because Lucy is basically being told every day about her accident and the passage of time and so forth. It works, I suppose, because Sandler and Barrymore are pretty much in the same character roles they've been doing for a long time. I'm sure the audience's favorite, on the other hand, was the kooky character, Ulo, that Sandler's faithful co-star, Rob Schneider plays, delivering many of the laughs in this film.<br/><br/>
The story and characters are a formulaic arrangement of previous Sandler comedies. The strange friend (here, a hermaphrodite) with eerie suggestions and confusing sexual innuendos; old characters who say the damnedest things; and so forth. If you liked 'The Wedding Singer,' chances are, you'll enjoy this one even if you haven't been too pleased with previous Sandler comedies. I wonder if he's ever going to be able to get away from comedies like these and still be funny, especially when he gets older."

Sandler and Barrymore certainly have the kind of chemistry required for their romance to blossom. This film takes a really wild idea of a man falling for a girl who happens to suffer from short term memory loss. It's a fictional kind of memory loss, where her brain resets every night. It's a bit like Groundhog Day and Memento with your usual wacky Sandlerness. In some respects he does play it slightly different, as he is quite understanding here and resists the urge to become the angry version of himself. As it gets towards the end I was astonished that it didn't bitch out with a quick fix to the problem. So many Hollywood endings have that love conquers all, happy ending, but this went with a bittersweet ending. Along the way we have the usual grotesque but likable characters, such as Schneider's Ula and Strus' Alexa. Each of these add enough humor, but it's Astin who steals the show, as a workout obsessed protective brother with a lisp. Certainly worth your while."

","Not being a big fan of romcoms, i must admit that i wasn't overly enthusiastic about 50 First Dates, but what attracted me to the film was that once again Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore were playing opposite each other, a combination which worked so well in The Wedding Singer. I'm pleased to admit that this duo did not let me down, in fact there's not a lot that i can find fault with.<br/><br/>Henry Roth is one of the central characters in 50 First Dates, who we find out early on that he is afraid of commitment. That is until he meets a beautiful woman called Lucy, and from then he can't seem to get her out of his mind. The trouble is that she suffers from short term memory loss and day to day forgets ever meeting him.<br/><br/>At first i was led to believe that this was going to be a predictable romance film. But i was far from wrong. The context of 50 First Dates is not only believable, but somewhat clever. The difficult aspects in the narrative are not ignored but properly explored and dealt with, and this helps to heighten the emotion portrayed. It goes to a completely new level by showing audiences that there is something deep behind the idea of falling in love with someone over and over again.<br/><br/>The film being set in Hawaii just adds to the overall romantic feel, and the music accompaniment also creates a beautiful feeling. Although there is comedy, this is not the main focus and thanks to Adam Sandler's perfect comedic timing, it does not take away from the overall feel of the film, but instead it enhances it.<br/><br/>You should watch this film with an open mind and no preconceptions, as it will probably surprise you as it did me."

","I love this movie, if you are in the mood for something funny, entertaining and sweet, this is for you. <br/><br/>This romantic comedy is about a woman, Lucy, who has an accident and loses her memory and every day onwards her mind resets at the end of the day. She doesn't remember the people she meets after her accident. One day she meets Henry, and it then becomes Henry's daily mission to see Lucy and take her out. In true Adam Sandler style, he is entertaining and endearing, and his character spends his time trying to convince Lucy's family and friends that he has her best interests at heart! It's lighthearted, and entertaining, and for anyone looking for something to make them laugh and smile, it is highly recommended."

"Bravesfan17","8","0","0","21 May 2010"," A great Adam Sandler romantic comedy
","Adam Sandler has done a great job at starring in romantic comedies, and 50 First Dates is no exception. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a veterinarian in Hawaii who has always had flings with female tourists and is always able to get out of it. He has been happy with doing that, working with his animals, and hanging out with his buddy Ulla, played hilariously by Rob Schneider.<br/><br/>His life changes when he meets Lucy Whitmore, played by Drew Barrymore. Barrymore is witty and brilliant as Lucy. She knows how to play this character without hamming it up. Henry doesn't know what he's in for when he meets Lucy for the second time and she says that she has never met him. What made Lucy not know Henry is that she had an accident months prior to their first meeting that made her lose her short term memory. Instead of being discouraged, Henry sees it as a challenge to make Lucy fall in love with her every day. For a while, it works.<br/><br/>Like most Adam Sandler comedies you will see cameos by his buddies. Allen Covert has the most unfortunate role as Tom, a patient who has a memory that lasts only 10 seconds. Peter Dante plays a receptionist at the mental institute where Lucy visits. Blake Clark appears as Lucy's dad, who thinks Henry is up to no good.<br/><br/>Another two funny supporting performances are Sean Astin (aka Rudy and Sam from Lord of the Rings), and Dan Aykroyd as the doctor. Doug, played by Astin, is a workout enthusiast who takes steroids. Aykroyd is great as the doctor who repeatedly helps Lucy understand what happened.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies, and he shows his comic genius. This movie fits easily in the realm of The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, and Anger Management. Anyone who watches this and expects to see a funny, original Adam Sandler movie will not be disappointed."

","I can't claim to be at all into Sandler and his nasty style of ""humor"", and this definitely is extremely disrespectful and awful towards a couple of groups(especially unfortunate victims of brain injuries). However, on the occasion that this actually goes for being genuine and tries to have its heart in the right place, it succeeds. The drama works, and there is downright sweet stuff in this. It does also contain its share of sap, and in an odd sort of way, it does manage to be something of a standard romantic comedy(meaning, if you're going for that and you either enjoy or can at least stand the nature of the rest of the material, you may very well like this). The jokes and gags are all crude, most are cruel, often offensive, many are disgusting, and for the relatively varied material, you have to wonder why they had to go to the well so ridiculously many times on so much of it. Acting is quite solid, for those allowed to do so. The characters are typically there to be fodder, for us to laugh at, though several of them are nicely fleshed out. This has good enough pacing, and holds at least some great directing. There is occasional mild to moderately strong language, a little violence, and only hints at sexuality, in this. The DVD contains an entertaining and interesting commentary track with Segal and Barrymore, three featurettes(two of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), five deleted scenes with the option of hearing the director's thoughts about them as they play, a teaser for Adam's next album, three music videos, a blooper reel and a few trailers. I recommend this to fans of those who made it and/or the genre. 6/10"

","There isn't much wrong with 50 first dates. I only have one problem with it. Like Click, it seems too serious to be a Sandler film, it doesn't feel like one. Perhaps it's not as serious as Click, but it's not as funny as it either. 50 first dates isn't the best of Adam Sandler's works. But compared to pieces of sh*t like The Waterboy, it is a classic. I hated The Waterboy, which is a hit with everyone I know but blows. It's just a really stupid film that tries desperately to be funny but just can't be. I did like 50 first dates. I didn't like it the first time around because I didn't really think it was that funny, but it is pretty funny. it's just as crude as some of his other films, but it's still serious. I liked Drew Barrymore. The thing about Drew Barrymore is that I didn't like her when she was dating Tom Green because she was a stuck up bitch but I like her a bit more now days. I give 50 first dates a thumbs up because I did think it was pretty funny . Though I didn't like it as much as some of his other films, I liked it more than some of Sandler's other films. 50 first dates works as a comedy and a drama.<br/><br/>50 first dates: ***/****"

It is quite funny in parts and you can actually feel the emotion of Sandler's character in the predicament he find himself, through no fault of his own.

"DICK STEEL","8","0","0","22 June 2009"," A Nutshell Review: 50 First Dates
","Call me a sentimental fool, but 50 First Dates, which reunites Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler after their successful pairing in The Wedding Singer, actually worked for me as a romantic comedy, balancing some hilarious situations and characters with a tragic romantic drama where the girl suffers from a medical condition (yes, quite staple in romances actually), except that this condition isn't life threatening, but life frustrating! Like Leonard Shelby and Sanjay Singhania in Memento and Ghajini, Barrymore's Lucy suffers from short term memory loss, in not being able to make new memories. She wakes up each day in Groundhog Day fashion, no thanks to her father Marlin (Blake Clark) and steroid-taking bodybuilding brother Doug (Sean Astin) who relive their lives day after day in the same day of her car accident (which led to the condition), and also with help from friends at a diner to recreate that perfect morning before that tragedy. And to Lucy, each day seemed like a brand new day, oblivious to changes around her, until she meets Sandler's Henry Roth, who intends to ditch his old womanizing ways, to spend the rest of his life with this new girl of his dreams.<br/><br/>So you can already see the problems here. How do you ensure you get remembered, by someone who cannot make new memories? For someone as commitment phobic as Henry, and to Lucy's protective family members, this is the kind of guy whom they are wary of, because it's wham-bang-thank-you-ma'am opportunities abound, and it's far more easier to take off without the victim knowing just who you are. Henry has that reputation of taking advantage of, and in quite comical fashion, shaking off his victims since they are all from various states, only that this time Lucy proved to be a little more than savvy in reproaching his advances, and therein lies the chase, the unavoidable pity, and the falling in love.<br/><br/>It's Memento gone romantic, and a touching one at that, with Henry having to be at his innovative best to woo the same girl all over again, to comedic effect of course with the multiple techniques employed, undoubtedly with Sandler being at his best without resorting to too many risqué moments like his recent Zohan adventures, and Barrymore complementing his effort seamlessly with great ease and chemistry. As far as recent romantic comedies go, none seem to be able to touch this one in terms of hitting the mark with its comedy and bringing out those tissues for its drama, and despite being made some 5 years ago, it still packs quite a punch for fans of the genre.<br/><br/>If there's a little hiccup, that will be Rob Schneider's overacting as Henry's horny best friend, but that was balanced by the very limited cameo appearance by Dan Aykroyd. For scene stealers, look out for Allen Covert's Ten Second Tom, one whose exaggerated role of a man with an extreme memory problem providing enough wicked laughter at the condition. For fans of sea animals, there's enough penguins and walruses to tickle your funny bone as well, complete at times with complimentary toilet humour.<br/><br/>At its core for the die-hard romantics out there, I guess it calls for a lot of effort in trying to craft opportunities to speak to someone, be interesting enough to engage and hold that attention, and generally have a feel good time at the end of the day. Try repeating that day after day and you'll probably appreciate the extent of the kind of tenacity required. Although it sticks to formula after boy-gets-girl (which calls for tissues), nothing beats being rewarded for all the hard effort, and it's a good thing too that the narrative didn't get plagued by the usual Hollywood miraculous ending.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't watch this film before you watch M Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, as it reveals the ending."

"dfle3","6","0","0","4 July 2008"," A warm romantic comedy after a very quesy start
","It's a good thing I stuck with this movie as the first 15 or so minutes (really, up until the love story starts and we see the lovely/always cute Drew Barrymore appear) are just awful. In fact, I considered switching channels when this was shown on commercial TV the other week. The reason it was so bad? The comedy was pitched at a level suitable for primary school children. Perhaps that is the norm for Adam Sandler comedies (I don't watch movies with him in it merely for the fact that he is in it...hence I haven't seen too many Sandler movies). It's as if Sandler, perhaps, didn't trust the script and insisted on low-brow, juvenile prat-falls and gross out humour be included. If it was intended to appeal to kids, then it is very surprising that in one scene Sandler's character Henry drops the ""F bomb"" in front of some primary school aged kids. The ""F"" word isn't really suitable for kids, you wouldn't think...and a love story might not appeal to them either.<br/><br/>So, if I had bailed on the movie early on, I'd have been forced to rate it 0 stars or a very generous 1 star. Fortunately, I soldiered on and the movie changed in nature...into something more watchable.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie has ""high concept"" written all over it: it draws on an actual medical condition-one in which a person has no longer any long term memory. To explain: just imagine that you get a knock to the head one day and you wake up the next day not being able to remember anything new-not after a while in any case. So, you could remember what you already knew before the knock to the head, but nothing afterwards...well, you could, but you'd forget it after a few short hours or whathaveyou.<br/><br/>So, serial womaniser and liar Henry Roth (Adam Sandler), has to try and woo a woman who he finds irresistible but who can't remember any positive impressions he has made the day before...or even remember him.<br/><br/>This movie has its heart in the right place. Not exactly plausible but nonetheless charming and at times poignant, mainly due to the lovely Barrymore. It's a rom-com, so criticising it for not being plausible is a tad ungenerous."

But, be cautious: don't expect too much! Do not watch the trailer previously! And forget the prejudice against Adan and Rob. It is a light romantic comedy with no room for common clichés, such as: a magical night of love will cure the girl from her situation; the father will only accept the boyfriend in the end; the funny friend come up with a never-thought solution. The film shows that, sometimes, is better to accept and deal with the situation, instead of struggle with it."

Like Drew isn't just a flaky girl sidekick. There's some emotional depth to that character when she reveals how much she internalizes her feelings because that what a good friend does. Sure they are exaggerated at times, that's expected since it's a movie, but somehow George Wing the writer keeps it realistic where I could see this sort of thing happen in high school. And the clichés usually seen in teen movies like when the house party goes horribly wrong, gets trashed and the protagonist gets in major trouble are thankfully bypassed. The love story is also believable as Adam Sandleer deals with it as a normal guy might; it's not completely awkward. When Drew and her have misunderstandings, they are plausible and the reactions are real enough to believe."

","Adam Sandler fans, fall in love with him again. Fans of ""The Wedding Singer"" will adore this one. Adam Sandler plays a young man who is quite adored by the ladies who go on vacation to where he lives. Did I mention he lives in Hawaii?? The number of women charmed by Sandler's character is quite impressive. But -- what if -- his friend, Ula, asks, he actually has a lady who wants to stay and with whom he wants to stay? (Yeah, right. Like that could happen!) Well... Henry Roth meets a mysterious, beautiful young woman at a diner (Spam, anyone??) and his life will never be the same! Be wary of letting kids watch this one. Some sexual themes which aren't meant for young ears/eyes. I loved the casting. Ever-present in Sandler films, Rob Scheider delivers a good performance as Ula, a native Hawaiian with a large wife and lots of kids. He is dysfunctional as a parent (well, as a person, actually), but he offers comic relief that is worth a belly laugh. The chemistry that was in ""The Wedding Singer"" between Barrymore and Sandler is also here. How can I describe the performance that is my favorite, though?? Sean Astin (Yes, THAT Sean Astin) plays Barrymore's brother, Doug. He also is delightful in his role and I just laugh each time I think of the things his character says and does.

","For an Adam Sandler movie, this is uncharacteristically sensitive about a true medical condition. I'm actually glad I saw it. When I rented it, I was expecting a lot of stupid jokes, people taking advantage of Lucy, and finger-pointing. Instead, it's a comedy that includes a caring community and family who watch out for one in need.<br/><br/>The video that Henry makes is a real ""intervention"" that would be done by nurses or medical personnel helping brain-injured people. His sensitivity and caring, working with Lucy's family, and changing his lifestyle immediately instead of coming to a sudden conclusion after hurting her, give light to a well-researched script. Lucy is not portrayed as ditzy or stupid. Nobody makes light of her injury. Amazing.<br/><br/>I have to give this movie an 8 because it treats Lucy so well. I hope Sandler can build on this type of comedy in the future."

","I was surprised at this film. I didn't expect to like anything of Adam Sandler's, and the premise seemed too much like ""Groundhog Day,"" but I loved it. Adam Sandler is quite restrained in this film, as is Drew Barrymore. The supporting cast throw some bones to the puerile Sandler fans, leaving the two leads to show a very convincing romance brewing in a somewhat far-fetched scenario. The writers took care with motivation and characterization for the leads which makes the cardboard characters that fill out the cast really fall flat. Nevertheless, some of the jokes are quotable, like ""You needed a fish-slap to calm down"" and ""aquariums make me super-horny"" and they define ""comedic relief,"" keeping the film from becoming maudlin in several places. The animal stuff (Sandler's character is an aquatic vet) is cute and make for some great shots, like when dolphins leap in the background as Sandler & Barrymore share one of many first kisses. The Hawaiian locale is gorgeous and it's a logical choice (where else could someone believe that every day is October 13th?) I think if it could be compared to another romantic comedy, ""Overboard"" with Goldie Hawn & Kurt Russell would come close. The story arc is similar, and amnesia is the main plot device. Kurt Russell's character is similar to Adam Sandler's, too -- seemingly crude in the beginning but with the proverbial heart of gold that comes to light through true love. Awwwww Grab a hankie & enjoy."

","The title of this comment is not that I hate this film. The title of this comment is basically the premise of this film. Henry Roth is a man who leaves woman after he dates, kisses, or have sex with them because that's not what he's looking for. He wants to meet a woman that'll be perfect for him. He finally meets Lucy in a restaurant. They get along together great. Henry finally thinks he found the perfect woman but there's one problem: She has a short-term memory that forgets him each day she meets him. This film is hilarious with Rob Schneider. The on-screen couple, Sandler and Barrymore, is great. This film is funny and heart warming but sometimes makes you feel sad. The ending could disappoint a few people but it was satisfying for me. One sad thing is that it reveals the ending for The Sixth Sense. So if you're going to watch this film before watching The Sixth Sense, you might be mad (like me) because it reveals the ending for it. If you think this is another old Adam Sandler movie, you're wrong. This is an entertaining piece of material!"
"Private_Beach","7","0","0","12 June 2006"," Enjoyable but somewhat schizophrenic (minor spoilers)
","The trouble with this movie is that it can't quite decide what kind of film it wants to be. At the beginning, it plays like a not very funny slapstick comedy in ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" style, as one might expect from Rob Schneider's presence in the cast. If you can get past this (my wife gave up on it after ten minutes), the movie gradually transforms itself into a sensitive romance, albeit one on which the low comedy elements continue to intrude.<br/><br/>The problem is that the two elements don't gel well together, so that all the stuff about walrus vomit and wet dreams and the aquarium assistant of uncertain gender seem grafted uneasily on to what is in essence a bittersweet romance, undermining the tenderness of the love story. However Drew Barrymore is charming, the Hawaiian scenery is beautiful, and without giving too much of the plot away, the ending is genuinely touching, and leaves the viewer with a good feeling."

As with all his movies you will see characters from the Saturday Night Live crew who are still close friends after he quit the TV show, and add a little humor to tickle your funny bone. Memory loss is a medical issue that still plague millions of people worldwide after vehicle accidents, which could have been prevented. Unfortunately the prevention issue has not been addressed in this movie, but the after accident solution that this movie successfully portrays has been applied successfully by too few therapists around the world. Hopefully this movie will change that.

Chie believes that Ding Ding can somehow help cure Don, and even if he isn't cured, the two can continue their relationship anyway. They use a notebook of Ding Ding facts, temporary tattoos, and many pictures to constantly remind Don of who he's supposed to love. And it seems to work, for a while at least.

If I had a friend like these two have in each other I would be living a dream.<br/><br/>Also, Sean Astin was accused of having a ""homosexual"" relationship with Elijah Wood because they had such a close relationship while filming Lord of The Rings. Subsequent clips of the movie LOTR, which showed how close they were as friends, is meaningful to the word friendship. <br/><br/>If America, AND the rest of the ""western world"", would have this kind of closeness, there would be more peace in the world. I would like to rejoice in these forward thinkers of showing that friendship is what makes the bonding of life meaningful and special.

You are, in my opinion, leaders of the future.<br/><br/>I love all your movies, and may they continue to bring levity, happiness, and change to our world.

Nearly (and I say nearly) all of Adam Sandler's movies are the feel-good movies I'm talking about. Big Daddy, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and of course, The Wedding Singer. When they're over, you feel great. They give you a very subtle amount of hope, and hope is always a good thing.<br/><br/>50 First Dates plays out in the same way as every romantic comedy does. Man meet woman, they have a great time, they have an argument, man does his best to fix problem, they live happily ever after. Sure, it's used all-the-time, but why not? It works and it never feels repeated, because you've always got new characters and a new concept.<br/><br/>The basic plot revolves around one Henry Roth (Sandler). He's the ultimate guy, he's got it all; he lives in Hawaii, he's got a good job, good friends and all the skills to winning any girl he wants. Problem is, he's afraid of commitment. He meets a girl, scores and then makes an excuse to break up with them. Then, one day, he meets Lucy (Barrymore). She's different, and as Henry finds out, very special. They get along from the moment they meet, and Henry seems to have found he girl he can finally settle down with. One problem: she's got short-term memory loss and everyday she forgets she ever meet Henry. So, as love is, Henry has to win her over; every single day.<br/><br/>The performances are great, especially from Adam and Drew. The cast was well selected and they two lead characters shine just like they did in The Wedding Singer. The old Sandler crew are back making great cameo entries and they really did make me laugh, as did the entire movie. The setting is beautiful, it's Hawaii after all!

Lucy than discovers what had happened to her and wants answers and thats when she discovers that she and Henry are dating, to help her remember this she puts all of her thoughts into her diary, but she than decides to end it with Henry because she thinks its not fair on him and deletes him from her memory, shocked by this he decides to leave the island and carry on with his travels, but suddenly he thinks that Lucy remembers him and rushes of to find her. its obvious what happens in the end of the film but i really enjoyed it, Barrymore and Sander have amazing chemistry on screen and should do more movies together! this may not be as clever or brilliant as ""The Wedding Singer"" once was but its a good movie.

","Samuel Beckett is an Irish playwright who wrote a famous play called Waiting For Godot. This play involves an existential battle between two people one of whom forgets everything that is said to him within seconds of hearing it. It is play based on the idea that even in pointless and meaningless existence there is hope. I think this film touches on the same ideas and would be interested if anyone thinks the same way. Although I cannot compare this film to what is a classic of modern literature I have seen many examples of seemingly frivolous movies showing an obvious allusion to more serious forms of philosophical thought. The characters in this film are, after all, dealing with the very essence of what it means to be human. Our experience of life makes us who we are."

It's sweet because he's willing to do anything to get this girl to fall in love with him each day. The ending is more realistic than most of these Hollywood-type movies. It's a must see!"

","OK everyone will laugh at this, but I think Rob Schnieder deserves best actor! That is quite a transformation. He is a little geeky guy, but in this movie he transformed into a pretty convincing Samoan (or Hawaiian native). I really bought into the role he played. No, he will not be recognized for an Oscar. Oh well, I still think he did a good job.<br/><br/>I kept thinking the movie was very similar to Groundhog Day in a reversal role. Instead of one person being aware of a repeating cycle, all the people were aware of the cycle, and only one person was unaware of the cycle. It was kind of an annoying twist. I am sorry, but I thought it was so corny. Why was everyone around the amnesiac character, (Lucy), trying to cover the truth? It would be slightly annoying after a year pretending to re-live the same day over and over for the benefit of the amnesiac. Why not tell the person the truth every day? It just seemed dumb to me.<br/><br/>The biggest question I have is: Why would a guy, (that can get any girl he wants), fall in love with an amnesiac with a short-term memory? My response is, he is really stupid or this movies plot is stupid. The character was lame, but not stupid. My conclusion is that the movies plot was really uninspired or ""Hollywoodish"". A guy that can get laid every night of his life would not fall for Lucy. Why was it established early in the movie that Adam Sander's character Henry was a ""player"". Henry could, and did, get beautiful women to fall for him on a regular basis. Why would this be established in the film? I think it was to prove he was not trying to take advantage of the mentally ill. If the main character were an average guy that could barely get a date, it would seem seedy preying on a mentally ill girl. Establishing himself as a player indicates that he ignoring Lucy's shortcomings and making a choice above and beyond what he is used to. An average person would just be trying to get a date and laid, and thus, it would be uncomfortable for the audience. Establishing someone that is a player establishes the character as being challenged and thus acceptable. I hate double standards. I would have like to have seen a person desperate for a date go after Lucy. It would have made the audience uncomfortable, and made me happy. IE. Punch Drunk Love. Almost a good one.<br/><br/>78/100"

","50 First Dates is slowly climbing the charts and becoming one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. I saw it two weeks ago on DVD. I was skeptical that it would be any good. Sandler has gone down hill with his movies from Waterboy and Happy Gilmore. The Wedding singer was cute, but not great. 50 First dates is great! It has enough comedy to keep the typical guy laughing and it has enough heart felt moments for the women out there. The movie will have you laughing the whole time. It also makes you really feel for both characters. The ending will have to feeling happy and sad all at the same time. Must see date movie!

","Adam Sandler stars as Henry Roth, a veterinarian who is into one-night-stands with beautiful tourists on the island of Hawaii. He constantly makes up lies to get out gracefully. His womanizing ways come to a quick end when he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore). There is only one problem, Lucy has no short-term memory, and Henry finds himself having to introduce himself to Lucy each and every day, with varying results.<br/><br/>Sandler is his usual self here, (the goofy, likable type). Drew Barrymore looks awesome, and does a great job as Lucy. She has to deal with the discovery that for the last year, she has been doing exactly the same thing each and every day, due to the car accident. Sean Astin, with a hilarious role as Lucy's steroid-popping brother, and Blake Clarke as her father do an excellent job of keeping the unfortunate truth from her. Rob Schneider is fantastic as Ula, a coworker of Henry's and a complete stoner.I couldn't help think of Cheech Marin watching Schneider's performance.<br/><br/>Overall a pretty good film. The Hawaiian location is a beautiful, and Sandler brings his usual cast of buddies along for bit parts.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"

","This was such a cute movie. Very amusing. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are great in this tale of a girl named Lucy with a fictional condition brought on by an accident involving a cow. Every morning she wakes up with no memory of anything that's happened since the accident. Adam 's character, Henry, happens to fall in love with her, and must make her fall in love with him again every day. Rob Schneider provides additional comic relief as Henry's buddy, a dread locked, one-eyed rasta mon. Sean Astin is amusing as Lucy's lisping, steroid-addicted, bed-wetting brother. <br/><br/>It's not the typical laugh-after-laugh goofball Sandler flick, but it is pretty funny, and heartwarming. More of the chick-flick variety, although there's plenty of Sandler/Schneider interaction and walrus-schlong jokes to keep the guys interested! <br/><br/>check out the soundtrack too, cool covers of 80s songs done reggae-style! great summer cookout music."

","In spite of some bad reviews I decided to watch this because I thought it would be more like Sandler's one good movie, The Wedding Singer, and my instincts were right. This does have much of the same tone as that movie, although it's marred by some of the cartooniness that makes most Sandler movies intolerable.<br/><br/>I like the premise, which falls somewhere between Groundhog's Day and Clean Slate, as Sandler has to make a girl with short term memory loss re-fall in love with him every day. While I find it hard to accept Sandler as a lady's man (I also find it hard to accept him as a phenomenally successful actor, so I guess I'm out of sync with the American public), he and Barrymore have a good chemistry that makes it work.<br/><br/>What keeps this film from working as well as Wedding Singer is the aforementioned cartooniness, represented by Ula, who seems to fall into the category of, ""if someone's really ugly and has a weird accent then they should be ridiculed"" and pathetic bodybuilder Doug. These characters feel completely out of place amidst the movie's low-key charm, as though they wandered in from one of Sandler's low comedies.<br/><br/>There is something generally unfocused about the movie. It can also be seen in an odd throwaway shot of the auto accent, which adds absolutely nothing to the movie, like the character of Ula. Wedding Singer had a very definite vision of what it was going for and Dates suffers from a lack of that vision. But it is moderately amusing and rather sweet, so all in all it's a good movie. 7/10"

Of course, I watched at the end of a long New Years Day, which could explain my sentimentality, but I liked it! Although I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, I tend to enjoy his work, though sometimes, when it's not straight slapstick, it tends to be over-sentimental and maudlin.<br/><br/>50 First Dates does have its sappy moments, but with romantic comedies, that's what you've signed up for.<br/><br/>In an effort to appease hardcore Sandler devotees, they throw in your zany, sidekick, Rob Schnieder, doing a nearly-insulting stereotype caricature of an Islander...but that's just a smoke screen for some touching moments delivered by Sandler, Barrymore and Blake Clark, as Barrymore's father. Sean Astin plays an additional comedy relief role as Barrymore's steroidal brother, with a couple of decent moments delivered.<br/><br/>But the best moments are really the way you feel when Sandler & Barrymore are doing their thing, drama-wise, I mean!

","Has anyone seen Groundhog Day? I'm sure Adam Sandler did. What was clever handled there in a montage just could not hold up in the longer form here. The hokey scenes of Sandler trying to get the attention of Drew were just so over-the-top that I was sort of hoping she would just drive on by and not meet him that day. What saved the movie for me was the cuteness of Drew Barrymore, though I still can't see why the Sandler character fell in love with her at first sight. The cute animals, the Rob Schneider fake eye, the man-woman aide at the aquarium...they all were just annoying. But, not as annoying as Sandler himself. He has one expression, and that one is blank. Drew's studio at the hospital looked like a haunted house with all those portraits of him. Still the ending with its schmaltzy introduction to the daughter made me glad I sat through the picture. It would have made a better drama: the struggles of the Drew's father and brother trying to protect her, the emotions Drew's character felt every morning upon waking up and finding so much time had passed, the one scene were they wake up in bed together...that is what should have driven the narrative, and the resolution in Alaska would have been more effective as the tension would finally lift for those around her (they finally solved the problem)."
"jpt27","Null","0","0","13 November 2004"," Masterpiece, overlooked by many because of anti-Sandlerism.
","MY RATING: *** / ****<br/><br/>Contains extreme battle violence and tentacle rape. (Maybe.)<br/><br/>'50 First Dates' tells of an unusual romance being played out in beautiful Hawaii. Adam Sandler plays Henry, a marine biologist (I love Hollywood) who has no problem with the ladies. He falls head over heels in love with Lucy (Drew Barrymore,) who ever since a car accident a year ago, loses all memory of what she did that day. In other words, Adam's going to have to meet her and make her fall in love with him each day like the first day. Ouch.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler comedies are unique in that I have hated every single one of them for the first ten minutes, and then I somehow 'tune in' to the humour and end up enjoying the movie. 50 First Dates has other familiar Sandler elements, such as Rob Schneider doing things no other star would possibly want to add to their credentials, and other scenes involving post - Farrelly brothers grossout gags (any comedy these days involving a walrus is going to have it vomiting or ejaculating or both.) These don't get in the way of the film's purpose, though, which is surprisingly spiritual.<br/><br/>Analogies have been drawn between this and Groundhog Day, and that's not such a bad comparison. This film is Groundhog Day in inverse, that is, only one character is living out the same day of her life over and over, and nothing she can do about this will make a difference tomorrow. 50 First Dates is masterful in its exploration of this premise. We grow to understand the rules of this game much like we would a new sport. In fact, I grew to understand it so well that I had a very confused couple of hours immediately after the movie readjusting to the real world. I love that feeling.<br/><br/>As we grow more confident of our grip on the ideas presented, the film uses this device to ask some seriously deep questions about human relationships. How we'd react if such an unusual situation arose, and how we'd let our humanity save the day. Henry gets to have a unique insight into both himself and the woman he loves by seeing that every day he finds something new and wonderful to love about her. Many couples' favourite memories are of their first meetings. Ever stop to wonder why that is? You won't after you see this. Some might call this Paul Ver Hoeven syndrome, after another famous director whose films explore moral problems that don't really exist yet, but I think 50 First Dates treads the line between fairy tale and drama with verve and intelligence.<br/><br/>Of course, the film relies on us believing that Henry and Lucy could really fall in love every day, and Adam Sandler - Drew Barrymore give fine emotional performances, especially Sandler, who's more known for his distanced, slightly vicious characters. In 50 First Dates he wears his heart on his sleeve, and is all the better for it. Barrymore has the easier role to play here - her situation is so unusual that nobody really knows how anyone would act in it - but nonetheless we see what has rocked Henry's world. The supporting cast are up to the job too, despite being slightly lumbered with standard quirkiness (the camp bodybuilding brother, the old sea dog father, the I-don't-know-how-to-summarise-her colleague.) The choice of location is perhaps too postcard-perfect to really give the romance credibility, but watching dolphins and sunsets so beautifully photographed can hardly be constituted as a 'mistake.' <br/><br/>All in all, I rate 50 First Dates very highly. It forced me to think deeply and quickly, and in today's movie industry, such a mental workout is rare without having to go to your local independent picture house and put up with your ten-a-penny artistic geniuses. I have to take off one star from the perfect four to reflect the disappointing ending, and that it is, at the end of the day, an Adam Sandler film. Sorry Adam. You came so close to eliminating my shadows of doubts."

","After watching this film, I can't wait for the next Barrymore - Sadler pairing. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sadler although maybe not quite Liz Taylor and Richard Burton on screen are truly excellent together. I thought their pairing in The Wedding Singer was good but it is well surpassed in 50 First Dates.<br/><br/>Basically the film centres around Marine Biologist Henry Roth (Sadler) whose aim is to complete building his ship and set sail to study the Walrus and Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) who has totally lost her short term memory as a result of a car accident caused by an errant cow. Needless to say Henry sees Lucy and the die is cast for a not quite so unusual love story.<br/><br/>There is certainly more than a glancing association with Groundhog Day, but for my money this enhanced the film. <br/><br/>Everyone played their parts extremely competently and the reason I called the summary 50 smiles, 50 tears is quite simply because the comedic action was performed subtly and well, even the slapstick. The same can be said about the tear jerking scenes also.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake of this film for me was the ending. Of course once we knew that Henry's aim was to get Lucy's short term memory back, it was a foregone conclusion that he would succeed and both he and Lucy would live happily ever after. But were we right? I was pleasantly surprised with the extremely well written and somewhat surprising ending.<br/><br/>All in all an extremely well written and thoughtful script, extremely well directed and acted on all fronts.<br/><br/>I have rated it 8/10 and would love to see it in my Christmas Stocking."

Mind you, I don't necessarily think that that's a bad thing; that first part was for me the least engaging piece of this movie.<br/><br/>What worked for me here was the romance, not the comedy. Given the rather ridiculous premise they had to work around, I thought that Henry's attempts to court and, later, to help Lucy were really rather touching. I also felt that the way their relationship went up and down and up again was honest for the situation (again, granting the the premise was absurd), and I thought that the ending was both emotionally satisfying without being a cheat (given that they could have taken the easy way out).<br/><br/>Of course, I could have done without the puking walrus and Rob Schneider, and Henry crying his way through 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' felt like a rip-off from ""Wedding Singer"", but Willy the penguin more than made up for all that.<br/><br/>7/10 for Drew and Adam's second pairing.

The walrus gross out scene near the beginning had me almost ready to turn it off BUT I am more then glad the movie steered away from having more scenes like it and instead explored the love affair between Henry and Lucy. Henry's determination at winning Lucy's heat is a great part of this movie as is Lucy's tragic life altering event but love does conquer all especially when truth is allowed to express its self fully no matter how painful. They say the ending is the most important part of any story and this movie has a great one. Plus, as one reviewer has said already ""any movie that has a pivotal scene that hinges on a Beach Boys song is just alright with me"". All in all a great movie. If you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favor, avoid the sex and violence for one night and rent 50 First Dates. I am more then glad I did."

","This is a really good movie to bond with your G F or your Wife  or other . I think it is a serious ""chick flick"" if you want to call it that.  It is about a guy so determined to win the girl of his dreams that he has to first win her over every day.  then he has made this VHS tape to show her what her life is like and remind that they are in love but she breaks it off and things go down hill from there but the good guy wins as always.  Of course. I dont pay attention to plot development or directing style or plot lines and how the writer messed up or the director did not do something that only some one in directing school or in show business would worry about.

","Here we have another interesting look at the comedic genius abilities of America's most loved - Adam Sandler, and the corresponding girly charm of ever-likeable Drew Barrymore. Sandler turns in a mediocre performance with Barrymore in this almost unique plot(similarity in some small measure to Ground Hog Day) where a concussion has caused the protagonist Lucy to lose her short term memory. In an endeavor to fall in love with his most challenging conquest yet, Sandler's character attempts a series of wild and imaginative stunts to combat her Achilles heel. Knowing that every new day signals the beginning of winning her over once again, Sandler bravely and stubbornly persists in trying to indelibly etch himself into Barrymore's deeper subconscious. In an emotionally draining and sporadically amusing relationship(If one day flings with an individual with no short-term memory classify as a relationship) Sandler must try to stay the course and through some inventive way manifest their mutual 'love' for one another deep within her. Ultimately the trials and tribulations pay off and through clever scheming via prerecorded video cassette the nuptial is concluded in a lovely Jewish Style Wedding!"

","When the movie starts out it is loaded with somewhat corny, low-end humor and obvious jokes for the simple-minded. One might even be tempted to initially walk away from it, groaning, that it is just another predictable Hollywood piece of fluff with cheesy jokes. But after the scene, where she first learns of her memory problem, this movie becomes an incredibly well done combination of near tear-jerking drama, and light-hearted humor. It does not end with everything becoming picture perfect and everyone living happily ever after, but ends with realism and happily ever after (which in my book is the best of both worlds). I'm glad I gave this movie a second chance. If I hadn't, I would have missed something great."

"cristalshandalear","Null","0","0","10 August 2004"," It deserved better.
","I liked the premise of this movie from the first time I saw the trailer, however I refused to go see it in the theater. I also passed it up in the video store three or four times, before I finally broke down.<br/><br/>You may ask why I would pass up a movie more than twice that I really wanted to see? I think I can explain it in two words.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>I don't think he's a bad actor. I think he's a hell of a funny guy. He's not even that bad looking in a goofy sort of way. But some of his laughs are at the expense of my stomach and he never fails to have a gross out moment that taught me ages ago this valuable lesson: Unless I want to regurgitate popcorn on a complete stranger, NEVER see an Adam Sandler movie in the theater.<br/><br/>However, movies with similar theme have been quite intriguing. Groundhog's Day, Memento, Frequency, Butterfly Effect; I loved them all. Plus, I'm always a sucker for a Drew Barrymore flic (the one exception being Charlie's Angels 2), so how could I resist this one.<br/><br/>So, I finally worked up my courage, skipped a couple of meals, grabbed a plastic bag anyway and settled down at home to watch this movie on DVD.<br/><br/>Needless to say, he did not let me down. I nearly hurled, but just barely managed to hold on. Quicker than you can say vomiting walrus, I nearly chucked the movie out the window. But the lady at the video store had already remitted my previous late fees once and I didn't want to pay for the entire movie, so I let my stomach settle a bit and fortunately this was the worst and only gross out part of the whole movie. Or maybe if there were other gross out parts, NOTHING anyone can come up with is worse than gallons of walrus vomit, so the rest of the movie was pretty good.<br/><br/>This movie really doesn't settle down much. It's either dead boring, laugh out loud funny, or over the top romantic. I have a feeling that this is probably what Adam Sandler must be like in real life. At any rate, what I didn't expect were my tears at the end before I even realized it, which were either because the movie was so awesomely romantic, or partly relief that there weren't any more hurl-worthy moments. Just like this paragraph, the movie contradicts itself greatly.<br/><br/>This movie also made me realize something. Movies should leave you with an overall impression. Kind of like a Monet: a vivid impression, an overall feeling, and solid emotion. This movie does all that but you're still left with the after image of walrus vomit.<br/><br/>It deserved better."

The story is very good and provides many opportunities for both funny and sad moments. It would probably work very well as a drama but what we have here is a romantic comedy. <br/><br/>It is romantic and sometimes it is a comedy but it doesn't really work as it should. Maybe it should have less crude jokes and concentrate more on the leading couple (Barrymore and Sandler). There were some funny moments but it was not hilarious.

","I wasn't going to comment on this film, but having voted (in the daily vote segment) for ""your favourite Adam Sandler movie"" and seeing how poorly ""50"" polled - well, I just couldn't resist the temptation. <br/><br/>Sandler, on screen, often projects a goofy character immersed in slapstick. Sometimes the character works; most often it doesn't. I love ""The Wedding Singer"" but feel that it indicated that there was more to come from Sandler. ""Happy Gilmore"", well... A feel-good movie with ridiculous caricatures within a ridiculous plot. <br/><br/>""50"", however, shows an actor apparently comfortable with, and in charge of, a sensitive portrayal. The premiss of the film is much that of ""Groundhog Day"" but original in its portrayal of problems which, later in life, are associated with Altzheimer's Disease. Living each day as if it is one's first is poignantly shown in the closing scenes. Life has passed regardless of its memories. And each day contains its own amazing happenings. Each day should be lived for its own sake.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is why I like ""50 First Dates"" so much. ""Yesterday is history / Tomorrow a mystery / But today is a present."" Sandler presents a character so much in love that he overcomes the perceived familial need to keep his love in an eternal cocoon - eternally locked inside a day that all around her will do everything to protect and thus preserve. Time however, is insatiable: it is a gaping maw which sucks us all into the ageing process. Love is all, love is you."

But Adam Sandlers evergoing effort to strive for Drew Barrymore's love was displayed very differently than I recall in a film of the past.

My wife really enjoyed it so I recommend it as a date movie. Laughed outloud about 3 times, far less than Sandlers other movies but this one is rewarding because your hopes get fulfilled.

"clydestuff","7","0","0","27 July 2004"," A little less of the usual Sandler shtick would have helped
","Let's make one thing perfectly clear. I am not an Adam Sandler fan. If it is within my power to avoid seeing Adam Sandler on the big screen, small screen, or on the cover of People Magazine, then I do so at all costs. The problem is that I have this girlfriend. She loves to watch Adam Sandler movies. Then again, my girlfriend will watch just about any film slapped onto a DVD and put into a case. She truly believes that if it says on the cover 'hilarious and uproarious' it must be so because they wouldn't print false advertisement since the manufacturer could be sued. Okay, so I'm exaggerating a bit but only a little bit. Anyway, the first Adam Sandler film I saw was The Waterboy, a film many found to be 'hilarious and uproarious' I found it to be 'stupid and idiotic cinematic crapola.' From that point in time, I vowed to cleanse my soul by making it my life's mission to never occupy the same room if there was even a whiff of Adam Sandler strutting across the TV screen. Until last night, except for one bout with Mr. Deeds, I had pretty much succeeded in that regard, but then my world caved in again. Having been to the theater three times this week without her (she was working so don't blast me), the aforementioned girlfriend insisted I sit and watch a film of her choosing. Her choosing was 50 First Dates, a film she had borrowed from a co-worker. Catastrophe! And worst yet, co-starring Rob Schneider! Yech! Well maybe I could fall asleep and she wouldn't notice. Then again, Drew Barrymore was also in it and I loved her in E.T. and loved her in Firestarter when she was doing that really cool fire trick with her brain so maybe I wouldn't suffer too much. <br/><br/>True to form, the early part of 50 First Dates is typical Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider shtick. Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a Hawaii Veterinarian who talks to his animals like Dr. Doolittle, and is heavy into one night stands with female tourists. To avoid having them become attached and want to stay in Hawaii with him he tells them stuff like he's a secret agent getting ready to go on a mission. So supposedly every female tourist that vacations in Hawaii is a dumb bimbo which they would have to be to fall for such nonsense. It wasn't funny and I was suffering already. <br/><br/>Henry's best friend and hanger on, Ula (Rob Schneider) comes to see Henry whenever he needs stitched up after having had a shark take a bite out of him. He also comes to see Henry hoping that Henry will relate every detail of his one night stands to him, because Ula's wife just doesn't do it for him anymore. Ula also brings along his brood of kids. As it turns out, the kids are cute, Ula is surprisingly funny, so are the kids, and my pain eases a bit.<br/><br/>Then there's Henry's assistant Alexa (Lusia Strus). She looks like Cloris Leachman had just made a wrong turn from the set of Young Frankenstein and ended up in the wrong movie. Her jokes are bad, we've seen the ugly assistant bit before and done much better, and then a Walrus pukes on her and I'm back wallowing in my misery once again. Soon Henry is having breakfast in a diner that specializes in spam and eggs so that later on we can have a few spam jokes thrown our way. It is then that he spots Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) making a house out of her waffles. He puts the moves on her, they have a nice conversation, Henry is attracted to her as a person and not as a bimbo, there's a funny guy sitting at the counter, the people that run the restaurant are kind of funny, and it looks like things are back on track. It's only a temporary reprieve though because when Henry goes back to the diner to meet her the next morning he finds out that she wakes up every day not remembering what happened the day before. This time when he tries to make hay with her, he fails and once again the film goes astray as we get scene after scene after scene of Henry meeting Lucy in the diner or down the road trying to get her to notice him so that they can have another first date. The sequences are totally done for slapstick, not remotely funny, and although we can sympathize with Henry's motives the low brow comedy just doesn't fit in with what he is trying to achieve or what the story is really about. Eventually Henry meets Lucy's father Marlin (Blake Clark) and her brother Doug (Sean Astin). There is a funny yet touching sequence where we see Lucy coming home and Marlin and Doug have to relive the same day over and over again because if Lucy finds out she loses her memory everyday, she becomes traumatized.<br/><br/>As you can tell the film is all over the place. There are times when it's a very well done sweet romantic comedy, with a lot of heart. At other times, it seems to want to sink back into the usual ineptness of low-brow films like The Waterboy. Eventually, in the latter part of Fifty First Dates, the comedy low-jinks do subside for the most part and the film seems to get on track. A lot of this can be attributed to Drew Barrymore who gives a very sensitive portrayal of a woman trapped by circumstances beyond her control. Whenever she is on the screen, the film lifts itself up about ten notches. Despite my earlier comments, I have always felt Barrymore was often underrated in the acting department. Her problem is she picks some lousy scripts with which to display that talent. Sandler however eventually tones down his shtick quite a bit, leaving the lowbrow comedy up to Schneider which is where it should have stayed in the first place because most of his lines are the funniest in the film. Likewise, Astin and the rest of the supporting cast are good also, but there's a running joke about body building concerning Doug that continues on way too long and wasn't really necessary at all.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film I find infuriating. There's a wonderfully romantic story, so why did writer George Wing not take that and run with it? Why sink to the idiotic antics that are so unnecessary especially when we've seen that kind of thing from Sandler so many times? When halfway through the film Sandler begins to show how much he does care for Lucy and the steps he takes to help her overcome her desperate plight, it's a side of Sandler we seldom see. He still can't act, as evidenced by his stupidly awful crying scene (at one point he does a fake crying bit, later he cries for real and both are the same), but Lucy and Henry's romance was good enough that we could easily have overlooked his failings. <br/><br/>There was much about 50 First Dates that I enjoyed. There was a large amount of it that I didn't. In the end, I'd have to say that the last half of the film is so good that it's just enough for me to give it a recommendation. Those who love the usual Sandler films will enjoy the first half, and those like me who don't will fall for the second half of the film.<br/><br/>And most of all it has a very nicely well done ending, that kind of touched me and when a film does that I have no choice but to give it my grade. I should probably just give it a C and leave it at that, but since it's an Adam Sandler film I have to grade on the curve and give it a B- but only because the romantic story was so well done, and I'm just a romantic kind of guy. Can't you tell?"
"Myssi from McF","5","0","0","20 July 2004"," Would have become a decent drama
","50 first dates was one of the big romantic comedies of this year. It contains big actors and it had major marketing behind it. I'm pretty neutral when it comes to Adam Sandler because he has couple of decent comedies but many very bad also. Drew Barrymore has convinced me just once in a good comedy (The Wedding Singer), and that one time she acted with Adam Sandler so I started watching this movie with little expectation.<br/><br/>
Movie was following pretty normal comedy line. It was made with certain formula, kind a like that it have to please a certain amount of audience. In itself it's not that bad thing, the movie was sometime funny but it didn't bring anything new to the comedy field. Also it shows that makers have to put a brake on some of the jokes just to keep the movie in that certain formula.(when they learn to make movies in more artistic way and less with dollar bills in their eyes --> I bet that the movies would be much better and they would have as much as audience than they have now, or ever more?) But now, back to the review:<br/><br/>I found 50 First dates a bit of sad movie. There are couples of things witch made tears in my eyes and made me feel sorry for the character. It might have been better idea to make a drama from the movie because it handles such a `dramatic?' subject. Memory loss might have been a funny idea in a text but at the latest at the filming the makers have understood that it really isn't that funny. So the result is that the movie is little confusing mixing basic Adam Sandler humor to the dramatic things. Somebody should have just leash Sandler and make an effort to make the movie a decent drama.<br/><br/>
Although movie shows couple of pretty funny characters and couple of over top ones. There are also funny animal jokes and overall the movie runs pretty fluently. Idea of the film is interesting and not so often used. Adam Sandler is making a little tamed version of his usual `goofy' character and is giving an ok performance. Drew Barrymore is a real actress and gives her character a little more deep and realistic interpretation spiced with little sad tone. I liked it. Because this is a `Adam Sandler' movie it of course includes a funny beating scene and Rob Schneider in a funny minor role.<br/><br/>5/10"

","While I would concede that I am generally not a fan of Adam Sandler movies, I nevertheless found `50 First Dates' to be a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming movie with an intriguing plot and excellent acting on the part of the main characters and quite a significant number of the supporting cast. <br/><br/>Adam Sandler provides an excellent portrayal of Henry Roth, somewhat of a playboy who has shunned commitment but finds his one true love, a woman with a very unique mental state of mind. Sandler gives his character a unique dimension of warmth, likeability and strength that ensures that he emerges as one of the strong points of the movie. With the help of an excellent script for his character, Sandler gives his character a dimension of warmth and humanity that is both heartwarming and thoroughly pleasant to watch<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore is also excellent in her portrayal of Lucy Whitmore a sweet and kind person with a medical condition that plays a significant role in the movie. Barrymore provides her character with a wonderful dimension of warmth, kindness and sweetness that allows you to truly empathize with her and the dilemma she experiences. Barrymore really allows the positive dimensions of her character to shine through and this also contributes significantly to the movie's success.<br/><br/>The script writers have done a wonderful job of examining and portraying Lucy's medical condition with sympathy and humour. They make you have a unique degree of empathy and warmth toward the characters while at the same time not transforming the movie into a series or sad affair. The portrayal of the plot comes across as unique and balanced.<br/><br/>There are some minor flaws in the movie, in my opinion. The character development of Lucy's brother is rather unfortunate and is one of the weak points of the movie it would probably have been better if he were provided with greater substance and depth and less clichéd and annoying dialogue. Also Rob Schneider's character was given too much air time and became rather annoying as time progressed. He should have been more of a background character than he was. I agree with what another reviewer on this site said about unnecessary over the top humour and accents it really would have been much better without all that and it does detract somewhat from the high quality of the movie<br/><br/>But these flaws do not undermine the heartwarming and beautiful plot of the movie, the wonderful acting and the flowing interaction between Sandler and Barrymore.

","This was an excellent movie. Drew Barrymore, plays a charismatic free spirit who doesn't remember anything from one day to the next, she retains her long term memory though. Adam Sandler is a ladies man who after meeting Lucy (Barrymore) decides that he isn't interested in living that way anymore, so he spends everyday meeting and re-meeting Lucy, just to spend some time with her. This movie is sappy and repetitive, but its also original, hilarious and quirky and holds onto you long after the film is over. Barrymore and Sandler are fabulous together as they are in The Wedding Singer, and they really show a true love story. I really enjoyed it. Please at least watch it, I personally am going to go buy my own copy."

","The chemistry that Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler showed us in ""The Wedding Singer"" carries over into this sweet and funny romantic comedy. Peter Lucas gives us an abundance of wacky moments, over-the-top characters, and quasi-adolescent sexual humor, but considering the cast, we'd be disappointed if it didn't have all that and more. However, it's the ""and more"" that makes this movie special. Sandwiched between the zany moments are bittersweet romance, the powerful ties of family and friendship, and, finally, a surprisingly insightful picture of the true meaning of love.

","50 First Dates is a nice compromise for Adam Sandler. After Punch-Drunk Love, many hoped he would stick to dramatic roles, yet at the same time, legions of fans chanted that a foolish idea like that was ""Borophyll"". Thus, as a kind of compromise for both camps- we have 50 First Dates.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Henry Roth, a Hawaiian native with a massive fear of commitment. One day, Henry meets Lucy at a local pancake house, and after falling for her- soon realizes something is amiss. The rest of the film chronicles Henry's repeated attempts to woo Lucy- and once he gets her- his attempts to remind her how much she really loves him.<br/><br/>Sandler is back to classic Happy Gilmore comedy form here. But he seems to have matured quite a bit. He actually seems to show a real love for Barrymore- and the two have undeniable chemistry on screen (even if the scenes with kissing in the rain are a little cliché). Having harnessed the anger of his early career, Sandler has finally made himself out to be one who is able to accomplish more than pee and fart jokes.<br/><br/>Overall, 50 First dates is nothing special. it won't attract droves of prepubescents to their local Blockbusters, and it won't attract critical acclaim like a film by P.T. Anderson. But it is fun and sweet, and It makes work for Adam Sandler's friends.<br/><br/>And isn't that what a movies are all about?-6/10<br/><br/>Line of the Movie: ""You were going for a feelski!""<br/><br/>Look of the Movie: Sean Astin when his...problem is revealed in front of his dad and sister."

","Fifty First Dates is the second teaming of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore following their first hit The Wedding Singer; let us hope it's not the last.<br/><br/>There's something about these two that clicks and I found that this most recent paring was just as enjoyable and enchanting as their first; perhaps even better. Sandler is charming while Barrymore is a graceful mix of innocence and beauty.<br/><br/>The story goes something like this: Sandler is a island playboy who ends up falling in love with a local girl who has a memory problem; with each day she wakes up, she has completely forgotten what has occurred the previous day. Sandler is forced to make Barrymore fall in love with him day after day after day which is the cause of some hilarious as well as some heartwarming scenes.<br/><br/>I really have only a few complaints with this movie, complaints that I consider really hold this movie back from being fantastic. The sub plots, which are there to provide humor, really fall flat, especially the scene with the vomiting walrus. These small glitches aside, the movie is wonderful and at the end, I even found my eyes a little misty.<br/><br/>If you loved Sandler and Barrymore in The Wedding Singer, You may just love them even more after Fifty First Dates.

","""50 First Dates"" is a movie far better than I expected.  It probably would have made an excellent date movie on first released, and certainly worth a trip to the new release section of your video store.<br/><br/>The basic premise (assuming you haven't read a thousand other post)is Adam Sandler, a Hawaiian ladies' man who tends to aquatic animals for his job and repairs his boat in his spare time, finds himself falling for Drew Barrymore, a young lady with short-term memory loss. <br/><br/>Perhaps most surprising is the movies unwillingness to compromise on the handicap, and working toward a solution that is realistic but sweet and romantic and occasionally heart breaking. It is comparable, easily, to ""The Wedding Singer"", and at many points shows the actors maturity, though Adam still seems to have difficulty with more extreme sincere sentiment.<br/><br/>
I would rate the movie higher, but individual performance are sometimes weak.  The total, however, is greater than the sum of its parts, and most people should stay moderately entertained through the movie.  The only thing keeping me from rating it an eight is that it doesn't seem to have strong purchase power, though once turned on you're not likely to turn it off. <br/><br/>

Imagine his own surprise when he falls for one of the girls on the island who can't remember him the day after.<br/><br/>You know the movie was funny in the first half, until the movie settles in on the reality of Barrymore's condition and gets depressing.

The plot of the movie sometimes gets a little bit repetitive, but Sandler and Barrymore are quick to change that up. All in all, its a great movie.

For the script is full of tasteless jokes, and the male half of the twosome is designed to be the greatest possible a***. The only thing one really wants after a while is to see him die a very painful death.<br/><br/>To make that disaster even more complete, Sean 'Samwise Gamgee' Astin plays a stupid bodybuilder here, who gets kicked in the ass by everyone, including his own father.<br/><br/>To me, it looks as if the people making this movie tried to create something like a second 'There's something about Mary'. But in that movie one liked Ted, Mary's admirer, or Warren, Mary's brother, and the Farrelly brothers where great to walk on the slim line between good and tasteless jokes.

Memento is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made, partly because the amount of ideas that the ""no new memories"" problem can produce is enormous. 50 first dates takes a look at this problem from the romantic side. This intellectual spin keeps the movie interesting all the way. This love flick actually makes you put yourself in the characters shoes and think about what would you do. So although its ab love movie, I had fun almost every second of it- all I had to do is filter out the Schneider jokes (that didn't work at all, unlike his other movies). 50 first dates wasn't just a intellectual pleasure, It also moved me quite a bit.

","I truly adore this movie! I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and of Drew Barrymore, so this was ideal for me. This movie is THE perfect example of a ""feel-good flick"". Sandler and Barrymore have an undeniably sweet and believable chemistry on the screen. So much so, that I think seeing them in movies together (The Wedding Singer, of course) makes some part of us as viewers wish that they'd actually start a real-life romance. There are definitely some parts of the storyline that people who are more attracted to realism and practicality would have a problem with, because this movie is not about what's practical. It's about loving someone so much that you'd go to great heights to remind them of that in the best way you can, every single day. We can all definitely use a reminder about that kind of stuff, right?<br/><br/>There are parts that will get a chuckle (maybe even a cackle) out of you, there are parts that will get you a little misty, and there are definitely parts that will get you all warm and squishy inside. I can safely say that even if I wasn't already a huge fan of Drew Barrymore, I'd still be extremely impressed by her performance in this movie. When she cries, it's hard not to bust a tear or two yourself. Overall (if you can't already tell), I think this movie is a fantastic love story with a refreshing and original plot, and an ideal movie to watch when you're in need of cheering up, or if you're slightly disenchanted about love (or if you're like me and you like to live vicariously through a great film). I'd recommend it to anyone with a sweet tooth. Hope to see Sandler and Barrymore together again on the big screen soon. RENT THIS MOVIE!!!"

","This review contains the odd spoiler.<br/><br/>If I had to make a list of my favourite movies, ""The Wedding Singer"" would be there for sure; Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore made such a good team (Barrymore has more chemistry with him than she does with Ben Stiller in ""Duplex,"" which I saw the day before this), it was inevitable that they'd team up again - ""50 First Dates"" isn't quite as good, but it's no disgrace either. It's also not an all-out laugh riot, but you don't get the idea that was ultimately the aim of writer George Wing and director Peter Segal.<br/><br/>Commitment-phobic Hawaiian marine zoologist Sandler's preference for flings with tourists (Adam Sandler as a woman magnet? Well, it takes all sorts) goes out the window when he sees lovely, likeable Lucy; but he finds out that the woman has short-term memory loss, making it seem as if his usual stance would actually be the best thing this time. Wing's script avoids playing Barrymore's serious plight for major laughs, leaving the humour for Sandler's best friend (a never-more-useless Rob Schneider - many will find the trailer-excerpted scene where she beats him up with a baseball bat to be a highpoint) and for moments like Sandler's sexually indeterminate colleague and a walrus who's almost another friend (if you've ever wanted to see a walrus vomit, here's your chance). They seem to have been added just to reassure people that yes, this IS an Adam Sandler movie.<br/><br/>But the movie's essentially a romantic comedy-drama, and thus more sentimental than gross-out, in spite of Barrymore's lisping steroid-abusing brother (Sean Astin), who's just as willing to help maintain her belief that it's still the day of the accident as her father is. (Incidentally, am I the only one to notice that Anonymous Content did both this and the very different brain-damage-romance ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""?) The movie goes for every different variation on its theme, but still seems to go a bit too long - removing the gratuitous gross-out gags might have made a difference to the overall effect - and why are there so many reggae-flavoured songs on the soundtrack for a movie set in the PACIFIC?<br/><br/>
All this, however, is forgiven by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR SPOILER.<br/><br/>I have to admit I was really expecting Lucy (Barrymore) to be cured by the end of the movie and live happily ever after with our hero Henry (Sandler). But kudos to writer Wing for having the guts to not go for the easy way out - at the end of the movie Lucy still has amnesia and isn't even beginning to make a recovery (she's dreaming of Henry, but she still has no idea who he is when they meet at the start of each day), and Henry and her family are still taking care of her. But that doesn't mean it isn't a happy ending... I'm not giving away EVERYTHING. Let's just say all compromises should be this effective.<br/><br/>WHICH BRINGS US TO THE END OF OUR SPOILER.<br/><br/>Yes, this isn't as affecting as ""Groundhog Day,"" and yes, it does have some weak plot points - but Sandler will always be more appealing than some of his fellow comedians (imagine if this starred David Spade, and shudder). And how can you not adore Drew in this one? <br/><br/>Plus any movie where a Beach Boys song is crucial to the plot is fine with me."

","Me and my sister went to see 50 First Dates and i thought it was fantastic, i love adam sandler and i cant understand why his films never get a very good rating here in England, I couldnt wait to see this film and i wasnt dissapointed, i'll certainly be adding this to my Adam Sandler collection when it comes out to buy. Drew Barrymore plays the part of Lucy brilliantly and i think the pair of them are great together in films, the wedding singer was great and i hope they do more films together. There are lots of funny moments in this film including Lucy's brother. Sean Astin played this part brilliantly and Dan Akroyd as the doctor was good too especially his comment about the largest mammal ( i almost choked on my drink laughing at that one.) If you are a big Adam Sandler fan like me then this film will not dissapoint you."

Adam and Drew made this film seem very real by their excellent acting. I would definatly go and see it again and buy it on dvd. a couple of the best moment was when lucy played by Drew thought he was getting attacked and she started to hit the man and she ran after him.

"ks4","8","0","0","18 April 2004"," Predictable, though very charming and very romantic.
","Barrymore and Sandler showed with Wedding Singer that they were a great couple with a good chemistry, this was another test to see if Wedding Singer was a loner of if these two just were great together on screen, and indeed, they are fantastic together in this movie too!<br/><br/>Henry Roth is a local womanizer who are afraid of relationships, until he comes along what appears to be the woman of his life, Lucy, there is only one problem here, the girl of his dreams is suffering from short term memory loss, so every day when she wakes up she has forgotten about him, this means he has to make her fall in love with him day after day, however this does make complications.<br/><br/>This is a really good movie, honestly i was glad to see that they still can make good romantic comedies in Hollywood, even though it is the a definition of a romantic comedy, it's not really as stupid as one could expect, it does have its periods where it tries to be stupid, but it's not in front and it doesn't get noticed much, actually the ""dumb"" persons of the movie that could be there to annoy you, they actually work fairly good and even gave me a few laughs, though i hate dumb humour, but this movie was so loveable i guess i got into the mood.<br/><br/>The direction isn't much, it's pretty much a standard movie, a classic one, it has all the ingredients Hollywood loves, and uses all the time, but it's very loveable, however not a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>Now what really makes this movie so good apart from the good story, is the two leading actors, Drew and Adam are just simply great together here, their chemistry is so good that all the romantic scenes goes directly to your head, and heart. I must admit i didn't think that they could do as good a job as they did in Wedding Singer, but this is actually just as good, if not even better, it's been a while since i saw that last, but this is a great performance from both. <br/><br/>Sometimes all these romantic comedies Hollywood produces seems to be manufactured so much that you can almost feel the kliche, they all appear to be copies of each other, and most of them are blatant failures on the box office as well among normal audience, still they manage to release more of these than any other genre, however once in a while there are some that are unique, this is one of them. Even though this is a romantic comedy, it is actually in its own way rather original, well sure it has a few kliches and it is very predictable, but it has a different moral and a more intelligent angle than some of the others i thought, and besides from that it is well done. One thing i liked very much is that they weren't trying to hard on the humour, as many others in this genre does, and fails.<br/><br/>In the later years i have thought Adam Sandler has been running around in a little room, doing only the same roles over and over again, just in a different scenario, i guess this is yet another one of those, but what is there to say, Drew makes him shine as a star. And he returns that and makes Drew shine as well.<br/><br/>The movie works mostly because the romantic part is so good, that makes the dumb humour that are there to fade very far into the background, which makes it a loveable movie, rather than a dumb movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

I think if Ben Stiller had done this movie it would have been a very similar film and he would have acted exactly as Sandler did.<br/><br/>The only thing I can say for Sandler in relation to this movie he has shown that he has some other creative talents besides acting which he put to good use in the making of this movie."

","I normally steer away from Adam Sandler movies - his gauchey manner, whiney accent, and gross-out humour turn me off. But he was tolerable in the recent ""Anger Management"" and I enjoyed ""The Wedding Singer"" which he made six years ago with Drew Barrymore. So, the lack of anything more appealing at my multi-plex and the re-uniting of Sandler with Barrymore, persuaded me to give him another chance.<br/><br/>It was not a mistake, but it was a pleasure of distinctly limited proportions. We see a gentler side of Sandler in this romantic comedy when - shades of ""Groundhog Day"" - the inveterate womaniser falls for a woman who can only retain new memories for 24 hours and therefore does not recognise him each morning and needs charming all over again. There are some silly characters and adolescent humour, although some of the animal scenes are cute. However, far the best feature of the movie is Barrymore who has come such a long way since ""E.T."" and is by turns utterly winsome, genuinely funny, and quite moving."

The story is pretty interesting, a girl who has no short term memory falls for a guy but can't remember him the next day. Some really funny performances here, particularly that of Sean Astin as Barrymore's workout crazed brother. Not the worst date movie I've ever seen but certainly also not the best.

Anyways, this is basically a comedy, and succeeds as that most of the time, but it's not ambitious enough to make us think a little. It entertains, but nothing more. Another complaint is the ending. Too forced and implausible, plus it kind of contradicted some things that had been said during the movie (can she remember her dreams????), and it just left us with many questions. It seemed that they just wanted to end the movie right away, and solved things the way they could. I give it a 6.5/10.

","Adam Sandler has really done a great job with his recent string of movies and I think this is definitely one of the best so far. Anyone who has seen The Wedding Singer will know that Sandler and Drew Barrymore have undeniable chemistry on screen.  In Fifty First Dates, Sandler plays Henry Roth, a complete player.  He's practically a professional at one night stands with the tourists who visit native Hawaii.  However, one day, after a boating accident, he meets lovely Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) and feels that the first time he actually has a strong emotional connection with a woman. Though the next day Henry finds out the horrible truth about Lucy-after a car crash nearly a year before, she has lost ability to form new memories. Henry realizes that his entire life from then on will be devoted to meeting Lucy and making her fall in love with him every single day.  This movie is funny, sweet and at times even thought-provoking.  You will leave the theater feeling good with a huge smile on your face.  It's filled with a healthy mix of crude, smart and witty humor and the latter is delivered hilariously by Rob Schneider. Schneider and Sandler make a great comic duo in the movie-Sandler's performance being very believable and subtle, while Schneider's being ridiculously funny and adding a touch of comedy. This movie does an excellent job of holding true to its comedy without compromising the seriousness of the heroine's situation.  The intricate directing touches the viewer's heart when it portrays the emotional distress Lucy's family has to go through every single day.  Barrymore handles her somewhat sensitive and sort of funny role perfectly, with feeling and heart-wrenching emotion and once again proves that she earned her recent star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  I would definitely recommend this as a feel-good romantic comedy, in which the ending won't leave you disappointed. 7/10"
"antisprite","Null","0","0","2 April 2004"," It's a matter of expectation.
","I have been reading all the viewer feedback and something strikes me about whether or not you will like this movie. Expectation.<br/><br/>I am willing to bet that almost everyone who goes to see this movie, will be expecting Big Daddy, Billy Madison or other trademark Sandler comedic moments. Add to the mix Drew Barrymore and the more discerning viewer in possession of the temporal lobe will call to mind The Wedding Singer.<br/><br/>On that premise, they go to see the movie and are sorely disappointed. People aren't evaluating the movie on what they see and how they feel when they leave the cinema, they are comparing the movie to their expectations and that is a huge mistake.<br/><br/>So what did I think? Personally I loved it. I think it was one of the best movies of it's genre that I have seen in quite some time. Everyone has commented that it is ""Memento meets Groundhog Day"" and so on, but I see past that. I see a metaphor.<br/><br/>Think about it. In today's society, everyday we get up, go about our day, go about our lives in the same old way. It's no wonder so many marriages end in divorce. What this film provide a context. If we don't make an effort with our relationships, our partners start to forget the good things and the relationship ends. In Sandler and Barrymore's case, it's just a much quicker process.<br/><br/>I admire the movie because to me it sends a message that every relationship should be this way and we should all treat our lovers this way. Even if they don't have a brain disorder.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie seems to be what other people hated about it. That Sandler, while still doing what he does best, has toned down his trademark crudeness and proven that he can play a serious role. That Barrymore was as cute and fresh and I think one reviewer described her as 'flower-girl.' Personally, I have long been a fan of Drew Barrymore and while I hated the Charlie's Angel's sequel, I think that she is a serious actress and people aren't always willing to look at that.<br/><br/>Last week in Australia we were fortunate enough to have Drew Barrymore interviewed by our own Rove McManus and prior to seeing the film I was thrilled to hear Barrymore's thoughts. They echo my own. That the movie is powerful because of the inevitable futility.<br/><br/>Something I have since realised is that accepting the challenge of making someone fall in love with you every day, is a proclamation of love in it's own right. The same thing that helped Sandler win over the father and brother in the film (God, Astin cracked me up!) is the same lesson I think alot of people need to learn.<br/><br/>I think (and I know people will hate this) is that people who don't like this film can be sorted into several categories.<br/><br/>1. People who can't be bothered to/or are afraid of showing extreme signs of love to someone<br/><br/>2. People that are functioning on 5 brain cells and just spent ten dollars to watch Sandler chase a penguin, chase someone with a golf club, or chase his ever escaping childhood. (Don't get me wrong, I loved all of those movies, but if Sandler can grow as an actor, why can't we grow as viewers?)<br/><br/>3. Bitter and twisted people who have been hurt to the point of never trusting again.<br/><br/>I think what also confuses people with this film is that while they compare to Memento and Groundhog Day, it doesn't fall into an immediate formula. Let's try it. Boy meets Girl. Boy likes Girl. Girl likes Boy. Girl forgets Boy. Wow it's easy when you try, isn't it?<br/><br/>Make no mistake, it is worth watching, but clear your mind before you do."

","...""50 First Dates"" is about a sleazy dude (Adam Sandler) in Hawaii who again and again tricks tourist women into sleeping with him (he doesn't like commitment...clearly).  This all changes when one day he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) and basically falls in love with her at first sight.  He talks to her.  They hit it off.  The next day, though, she doesn't know who he is. He's told that she can't keep short term memories for more than a day (think ""Memento"") because of a car crash so her father Marlin (Blake Clark) and brother Doug (Sean Astin) must recreate the same day over and over again (think ""Groundhog Day"").<br/><br/>That's basically what this is, ""Memento"" meets ""Groundhog Day"".  The resulting fare isn't as impressive as either of those films, but it isn't bad either.  Lately you could say that Sandler is flushing his career down the toilet (with stinkers like ""Anger Management"" and ""Mr. Deeds""), but this redeems him.  There is lots of good comedy - specifically from Sandler's friend ""Ula"" (Rob Schneider) and Astin's Doug - and even the romance avoids being too sappy.<br/><br/>One mentionable thing is Blake Clark's performance.  We haven't seen the guy in anything except small roles, but he shines in this one.  His performance as Lucy's dad is subtle and touching and funny, I want to see the guy in more.<br/><br/>So, nothing amazing, but a considerable date movie, I give it a 7/10."

He should just do what he is good at mindless, pointless COMEDY. I mean look at the movies that made him famous Happy Gilmore, Waterboy, Anger Mangement, Little Nickey, what did they all have in common, thats right comedy which didn't involve any romance at all.

Although this is not the typical Sandler movie, I did bring my boyfriend to see this and he liked it too. I must admit that it's more of a romantic comedy just like The Wedding Singer but still fun for everyone.<br/><br/>(Spoiler) I love Sandler and how funny he is but the fact is, is that I cannot picture how the movie begins by portraying him as a major player who sleeps around with different women until he meets Barrymore's character. Despite that, I love the way he transforms his ways and becomes devoted to her.<br/><br/>I also like how they expanded Rob Schneider's character in this movie than in the other Sandler flicks. Everyone whose seen all of Sandler's movies knows that some of the actors have parts in every one whether it's big or small. So seing that Schneider was one of Sandler's best friends and had more scenes in it than, for example his cameo in The WaterBoy saying ""You can do it!"", was a riot!<br/><br/>As a surprise, Sean Astin's character plays Barrymore's older brother. He buffed up quite a bit from his role in LOTR as Sam. (Spoiler) However, he does wear alot of fishnet tanks, has a speach impediment, is addicted to heroine and has many ""wet dreams"". So even though his character is a bit of a looser, I do admire Astin's courage and acting skills to play this demeaning part.<br/><br/>(Spoiler) The story turned out to be very sad in a good way. Because you're hoping that she'll regain her short-term memory by the end of the film but, like in real life, it'll never happen. Sandler obviously learns to live with that but it must be extremely hard to live with. Just picturing how she wakes up every morning and not knowing that she's married or that she has a little girl, that just touches your heart.<br/><br/>My final words, I love the concept of the storyline and thinks it should be watched with an open mind and not be disappointed when there's not much gross jokes and gags.

","This is only the second Adam Sandler movie I've actually looked forward to seeing. The first was _Punch-Drunk Love_, and that was something I was eager to see more because of P. T. Anderson than Sandler, but was pleasantly surprised by Sandler's performance. <br/><br/>This time around, I went in knowing that Sandler had it in him to entertain me, and he did a good job. His schtick is much more in evidence here than in _Punch-Drunk_, and I imagine from other comments that this is much more of a typical Sandler vehicle. However, it is a very sweet story with a lot of humor and heart, and would be a terrific first Adam Sandler film to see if you don't like him.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore is delightfully fun as Lucy, believably delivering all kinds of unexpected character details like ""feelski"" and the way she asks questions about all her old friends. Blake Clark and Sean Astin do the best they can with their rather thinly drawn characters. Clark, as usual, lets his voice do most of his acting for him, but he's a treat here as Lucy's father; likewise, Astin takes a turn at using a distinctive vocal style to give his character depth, but unfortunately misses the mark and winds up being just another caricature in a movie that already has 3 by the time we meet him (Alexa, Ula, and Nick the cook).<br/><br/>It is really in the relationship between Lucy and her family that the main weaknesses of this story come out. It seems to me that given how much time the filmmaker spends showing us what a user Henry is, everyone is entirely too trusting of him, though that is probably just a side-effect of the way the movie skips over time as Henry becomes part of their lives. Still, after Marlin's ""anybody who's alright with that ain't alright with me"" comment, he seems amazingly quick to accept that Henry means well.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed that we never got a payoff from Marlin's photographing Lucy's paintings before painting over them each night. I wonder if that got left on the cutting room floor, and if so why. I thought it showed a real sense of appreciation by him for who she really is. I was also a little disappointed that once the idea is introduced that Lucy can be told the truth, it apparently *never* occurs to anyone that she might be most comfortable hearing the truth *from herself.*<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that from the first time I see the trailer, I start wondering, okay, good set-up, but can they end it right? Well, here's where this movie really does remind me of _Punch-Drunk Love_, because for one thing the ending is very satisfying, and for another it arises out of the character's own strengths instead of relying on something out of the blue.<br/><br/>Original grade: 8 out of 10. Very good: something I'll want to see again.<br/><br/>Revised grade (3/7/2012): 7 out of 10. Worth seeing, but once will probably do."

Well, not me.  Schneider, and even Sean Astin, provide fantastic laughs, and of course so does Sandler.    <br/><br/>For the dramatic areas, I actually found myself positively moved by one of the scenes, towards the end.  I was glad that there was no hollywood-type medical miracle/cure, as well, which may have plummeted the film's credibility, in my eyes.  <br/><br/>All in all, it's no epic, but a romantic comedy (emphasis on the comedy) that I positively award a thumbs up.

"Ronin47","6","0","0","6 March 2004"," Ok, but not a Sandler classic (**1/2)
","Once again, here's an Adam Sandler movie with a nifty idea, a likeable cast and all the potential in the world to be a good, fun comedy. But it doesn't quite get there. <br/><br/>I really like Adam Sandler, both as a person and a comedian. The problem is, only three of his movies are any good: ""Happy Gilmore"", ""The Wedding Singer"", and of course ""Punch-Drunk Love"". The first two were just good comedies, plain and simple, while the third was a spellbinding, artsy, dark romantic comedy that utterly confused his core fans (maybe they were wondering why Rob Schneider never turned up in a stupid costume).<br/><br/>
""50 First Dates"" is by no means as terrible as Sandler's worst films, like ""Anger Management"", ""The Waterboy"", the hideous ""Mr. Deeds"", or ""Along Came Polly"" (oops, that was a bad Adam Sandler movie that happened to star Ben Stiller instead). But it's not nearly as good as it should be.<br/><br/>
Sandler plays Henry, a ladies' man living in Hawaii who meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in a local restaurant and they like each other. So he's surprised the next day when she doesn't even know who he is. The deal is that over a year earlier, she was in a bad car accident and has lost most of her short-term memory due to a head injury. She remembers everything up to the accident, but can't remember anything afterwards for more than a day. In an effort to keep her happy, her family and friends try hard to keep her re-living the same day over and over. There are a lot of good qualities in ""50 First Dates"". The ways in which Lucy's family and friends try to keep her happy is really very touching, especially on her ""bad days"", which they are also prepared for. And as they proved in ""The Wedding Singer"", Sandler and Barrymore have good, goofy chemistry. They have a few genuinely sweet and romantic scenes together.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, the negatives almost equal the positives. There are tons of jokes and lines that fall dead flat (you could have heard a pin drop in the theater during some of the ""funny"" parts), several annoying secondary characters, and the uneasy feeling you get when a movie is trying to be really cutesy AND cram in unnecessary toilet humor at the same time.<br/><br/>
Still, it's not a bad time. Even the worst Sandler movies have great soundtracks (this one features Bob Marley, the Beach Boys, and some Cure covers), and there is surprisingly bittersweet ending, given a huge emotional boost by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's gentle ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World"" (which was also used for the closing credits of ""Finding Forrester""). <br/><br/>It's not all that good overall, but still, I have generally warm feelings about seeing it, which means the good stuff is staying in my mind longer than the bad, so I guess that counts for something."

","One thing is for sure, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have the most realistic and genuine chemistry with each other that I have ever seen. Thinking back to all of the movies that I have seen, I have to say that this one takes the top as far as romantic comedys go. To all of the critics out there who thought the movie was stupid, I really think you should take a minute and ponder the excellence of the two main actors in the movie and realize just how truly fantastic they both really are. It truly was the best movie I have seen in a long time. The greatest thing about it was that it had a little bit of everything in it. There was comedy, romance, drama, and downright seriousness to the whole movie. When we see that Adam Sandler can really have a heart of gold and that Drew Barrymore can be as truly sensitive as she was in the movie, it really makes us realize that acting from the heart is the best way to go. I have seen this movie five times and each time that I watch it, I get that much more attatched to it. When it comes out on video, one can be rest assured that I will own at least one copy in both VHS and DVD of it. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have become my two most favorite actors. I hope with all of my heart that they are in another movie together soon!"

Even more juvenile than most Adam Sandler movies.

He and Drew have good chemistry in this movie and it's believeable that they have feelings for one another. Sean Astin is very funny in this movie even with the annoying LISP.  I still find the movie to be a bit sad and was hoping that some miracle would happen and her memory would come back.

","I will tell you now. I am not a big Adam Sandler fan. I mainly saw this because Sean Astin is in it, and last night, gave it a shot with my friend. With in the first 5 minutes, we were cracking up. Incase you don't know, the movie is about Henry Roth is a guy who normally has one night flings with the tourist visiting Hawaii. That is until he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) and falls in love with her. The only problem is that she suffers from short term memory loss, that doesn't last through the night. Every day she wakes up, she thinks it's the same day as her accident. Her father, Marlin Whitmore (Blake Clark) and her brother Doug (Sean Astin) try to keep the secret from her by doing the same thing everyday, like watching the same football game, painting the same room... you get it. Henry will stop at nothing to get Lucy to remember him, but Doug and Marlin tell him to give up and stay away from the local diner which Lucy has breakfast at... everyday. This sets up for a 10 minute series of comedic events that will have you falling off your seat, including one moment where Henry's good friend, Ula (Rob Schneider) get beat with a bat by Lucy.<br/><br/>Now, the acting is great. Sandler provides comic relief at all the right times. Schneider plays Ula, who has smoked one (hundred) too many joints, and plays the character great, and makes for some good shark bait. Sean Astin... I can't say enough. To go from the nice, humble, slightly overweight hobbit sidekick, Sam Gamgee to a buffed up, steroid user with a lisp here, he has proved he is an actor, and may just get a best supporting actor nod for a Comedy/Musical for the Golden Globes, next year. Drew Barrymore is a fine female lead in the movie, playing the forgetful Lucy. Also, she kicks Rob Schnider and Adam Sandler's butt in this movie.<br/><br/>My final word: If you want a great comedy movie, or need a movie for a first date, this is it. I'm giving it 5 out of 5 stars due to the great acting by the trio of Sandler, Schnider and Astin. Bravo Adam, Bravo!"

","This was probably one of the better times I've had at the movies.... Now I am not saying this because this movie was filmed in Hawaii, but I truly enjoyed everything about it.. From the soundtrack, to the cast, to the directing, to the writing.  This movie made me feel so good when it was done, I caught myself smirking at its quirkier moments.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this film rocked my reggae socks off.  It comprises of neat reggae-fied remakes of popular 80's tunes.  One of the prominent songs I like is ""Hold Me Now"" performed by Wayne Wonder.  It's amazing, catchy, and upbeat which is conducive to this movie, and was no doubt inspired by the 2 lead characters of this movie.<br/><br/>I believe that one of the elements that made this movie work for me was the casting.  You absolutely could not go wrong with casting Adam and Drew. These 2 had so much chemistry going on between them.  I know for a fact alot of people were expecting The Wedding Singer 2.  But in the end, you've got to realize that the characters and situations in ""50""  are totally different than ""Wedding.""  I've also got to say that both Rob Schneider and Sean Astin shined in their supportive roles.<br/><br/>As for director Segal's directing,  it is by far one of the most beautiful I'd seen for a romantic-comedy .  I loved how the tempo of the film worked. Many of the elements of why I like the film so much is attributed to how well this movie was directed, especially in a scene I would like to call ""Reenactment on a daily basis.""  As we all know whenever there is a good movie, one can attribute that to the excellent screenplay.<br/><br/>The screenplay of this film was extraordinary.  I am a self-proclaimed romantic, so the premise of having to make your girlfriend fall in love with you on a daily basis attracts me.  But what you've got to know here is that the girlfriend here has amnesia - so to make her fall in love with you, it is all the more challenging.  It is something that if I was in truly in love I would do for her, but would certainly not wish this situation on anybody. That being said, I thought the screenplay handled the situation rightly. And then you add all the elements of a screwball comedy, and you will get something that will resonate in people(it sure resonated on me!!).<br/><br/>Anyways, to put things in perspective, this is a movie that stands on its own to feet, and certainly one I'd see at the theater again before getting it on DVD."

","One can pretty much predict how bad an Adam Sandler flick can be. His last major big-budget movie, `Anger Management,' although having Jack Nicholson, could not keep itself afloat. After all, jokes and great actors cannot outweigh a lack of reasonable plot. Nonetheless, Sandler's flicks for the most part are big money makers and his fans are always there for him. With his new movie, `50 First Dates,' Sandler brings back his brand of slapstick and pubescent humor to actually make a film that is somewhat good. In fact, `50 First Dates' has a surprising bit of sentiment to a love story that seems like it came from the Farrelly brothers. 	`50 First Dates' tells the story of Henry Roth (Sandler), a sea-park vet who meets a woman at a local restaurant whom to his chagrin has lost her short-term memory. He realizes this when after meeting her, he goes back to the restaurant and finds that she does not even remember who he is. He learns from a waitress that the girl's name is Lucy (Drew Barrymore) and that she was in an accident about a year ago in which she sustained a head injury. As such, Lucy's father, brother, and the workers at the restaurant all make Lucy think that she's living the same day over again.<br/><br/>	Lucy's father and brother warn Henry to stay away from her feeling that his presence will only confuse her when she forgets about the day. But everyone knows that letting go of love is not an easy process. As such, Henry puts together a video in which he shows Lucy pictures of the crash and gently lets her know what has happened to her, and has happened during the previous year that she has missed. But the problem is that Henry will have to do this day in and day out-constantly reliving first dates for Lucy.<br/><br/>	Although the premise seems fallible if not insulting to those who suffer from forms of memory loss, this film's heart is in the right place. One can tell that the characters genuinely care about each other. Sandler provides his shtick of making up songs about a pretty girl that he loves who has lost her memory. Furthermore, the video that he keeps remaking for Lucy describing the changes in her life and in the world that she does not remember is actually heartfelt. 	On to the comedy aspect-it did not start out well. A perfect example that this film was heading in the wrong direction happened in a scene where a walrus vomits all over a fellow veterinarian. As an audience member, one cannot decide whether to laugh or be disgusted. Moreover, it would not be a Sandler flick without some character getting beat up-in this case its Rob Schneider who plays Henry's pal Ula, a burned out shark catcher. <br/><br/>	It was nice to associate Sean Astin with something other than `Lord of the Rings.' He plays Lucy's brother Doug, who is obsessed with perfecting his body-especially with the help of steroids. Other than his gross display of peck flexing, Doug speaks with a lisp and cannot fight to save his life. His funniest scene occurs when he discusses a supposed friend's problem of having wet dreams and his fear that it could be related to steroid use. The doctor, played by Dan Akroyd, simply says, `Get off the sauce!' 	`50 First Dates' is not a great movie, but with its surprising blend of a decent sincere love story and comedy, the film succeeds in entertaining us. ***"

His kids were always with him and though he made cracks about his wife they were together. Like so Lucy's family and friends supported her and took care of her the best they new how.

Sandler is in his sweet and lovable guy mode (think Wedding Singer or Big Daddy). Barrymore is radiant and charming.

In this case, Sandler did an excellent job at the romance part of it, and, as always, does a good job at the comedy part.  I think the producers should have laid off some of the physical comedy (that Sandler is excellent at, but in this case nearly all of it is done by the supporting cast members) for this film.  As a matter of fact, the romance alone could have carried it very well.<br/><br/>In short, with just the right amount of romance, and a little less comedy, this would have rated even higher."

Although I thought the on screen couple had formiddable charm in The wedding Singer it still seemed like a Adam Sandler film which are usually duds.  My expectations weren't very high but they were more than met.  The couple display extremely likable, gooey, chemistry and the film is Sandlers best it's heartfelt and more of a romantic comedy than just a dumb comedy. Drew Barrymoore stars as Lucy a young woman whom suffers from short term memory loss after a horrific accident with her father. she is prone to relieve the same day over and over again courtesy of her father and his friend's gimmicks. That is until Sandler enters the picture as a player of women but whom falls for Lucy at first site and doesn't give up when it comes to her disability. Many funny scenes ensue but he learns ways to make her fall in love with him each and every day. These two have sparkling, remarkable chemistry.  Individually they give some of their most heartfelt and emotional performances as they struggle day to day with the situation. And the humor which there is alot of is very, very funny and totally on key. The director treats the situation with suprising delicacy and heart. he doesn't teter on juvenile humor but instead embraces the romance as to ask what kind of sacrafices would be made for a perfect love. Rush out and experience an instant romantic classic and by far the best film of the year. 50 first dates is 50 Great dates!!!!"

","Shoot me, because I think Adam Sandler is pretty much a funny guy. I like his movies and I think they're funny, and he's enjoyable on SNL, and even in his more dramatic work () he still was funny. However, I was a little trepidatious about going to see his latest movie, 50 First Dates, mainly because it was released in February. While I didn't expect it to be a hysterical masterpiece, a la Happy Gilmore, it was an enjoyable romcom, a perfect early year release.<br/><br/>Sandler plays Henry Roth, a vet living in Hawaii. His typical relationships are with tourists; he's afraid of commitment (which movie character isn't?). That is, until he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore). The problem is that she has short-term memory loss, so every day he has to impress her again and again. It's not as easy as it may seem, though.<br/><br/>This movie plays like a cross between Groundhog Day and Memento. It's like the former because he has to change something every day. And it's like the latter because of the short-term memory loss. But it's nowhere near as good as them, because it doesn't have the charm nor the intrigue of either of them. Instead, it's some typical Sandler humor (including a vomiting walrus!), some other types of humor, and a simple, sweet story. The plot is relatively simple, with just that one twist, which not only is a cheap gimmick but adds to the plot.<br/><br/>Personally, I liked Sandler more as a loose cannon than mild-mannered nice guy. Some moments of his are really great (the aforementioned walrus was so overdone I actually laughed), with a couple moments of true hilarity. Some jokes, however, fall flat, and it seems that they forget that Sandler is a comedian, not a romantic. Their romance isn't completely believable, but it sufficed. His movies that have the romance on the back burner always seem to work better, but that's just my opinion. As is usual Sandler fashion, Rob Schneider comes in for a supporting role, and to tell the truth he's great. As a drugged-up Hawaiian guy, the material writes itself. It did disappoint me, however, that the trademark line ""You can do it!"" wasn't in there at all.<br/><br/>Everything I learned about antereo-grade memory loss I learned from Memento, but I'm ecstatic that they didn't go for the cheesy ""she remembers him after he says he loves her!"" Hollywood stuff. In fact, Barrymore did convince me that she had the ailment, and Sandler played his usual self. Sean Astin, as a steroid-using lisping body-builder, is just too odd to comment on, and Dan Aykroyd, in a small role as a doctor, has one great line, but that's it. 50 First Dates is a simple movie, nice to sit through, with some good laughs in the middle of it, but nothing that'll stay with you throughout the rest of your life.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 on appeal for crude sexual humor and drug references."

","The Latest from Adam Sandler is no Punch Drunk Love, but it's better than Happy Gilmore and is in the same vein as The Wedding Singer. In similar fasion to the latter, this movie stars Drew Barrymore as Sander's love interest, with a slight twist in the state of her character's short term memory.<br/><br/>This film has some great interaction between the two characters in their first few scenes, but eventually it disintegrates into predictable slop. I nearly fell asleep.<br/><br/>
** MINOR SPOILER ALERT **<br/><br/>
However, the ending of this movie redeemed much of its value. Instead of some magical resolution where Barrymore's character regains her memory ability and they live happily ever after, Sandler's character makes the decision to stay with his love even though her condition remains the same. That spoke volumes to me regarding true love... something that his former movies lacked even with a love story."

","Like him or not, Adam Sandler is a talented guy.  Like many of his films, ""50 First Dates"" is a combination of frat-house humor and luke-warm romanticism.  The object of his desire is once again Drew Barrymore, and to the filmmakers credit, this is the least annoying she's been in a while.  All of the Adam Sandler Players are present, and Sandler does a fine job of allowing his co-stars some of the biggest laughs of the movie.  He is unselfish in that way, and it makes his movies more enjoyable.  The benefactors in this particular case are Rob Schneider and Sean Astin.  Producer Sandler's true talent though is what he can get away with.  This may be the dirtiest PG-13 movie I've ever seen.  There is no nudity. There is cursing, but it's innocuous.  The movie is riddled with explicit sexual innuendo from start to finish.  It's amazing what the ratings board let go.  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't offended in the least.  I actually think movies are better when they're unfiltered and not watered down to get a specific rating.  This could have very easily been rated R though.  Taking pre-teens may not be a great idea.  If you do, you'll have more 'splaining to do than Lucy Ricardo."

I'm not particularly an Adam Sandler fan nor am I particularly anti-Adam Sandler.   I do, however, like well-done, funny films, and much of the low-brow comedy that is out there usually falls flat.  This movie, in that area, was no exception.  I often found myself nearly falling asleep at the jokes (I was also a little tired, admittedly, but good jokes usually keep me awake).  That is unfortunate too, since beyond the unfunny potty humor, the film is actually quite sweet and smart enough in the romantic areas.  It is also endearing to see a story where a guy tries over and over to restart a relationship (literally) that seems very hopeless.  Like the last good Sandler film, ""The Wedding Singer,"" the two leads, Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler, have good chemistry.  If this film had decided to drop the usual cheap humor, or heck, had just been a PG film, they may actually have had to resort to ""wit"" to make the film funny.

","This movie is one of Mr. Sandler's glimmering jewels among dead weight rocks. In my opinion it ranks up there with The Wedding Singer, also co starring Drew Barrymore. Maybe its her characters' innocent charm that brings out Sandlers better, romantic side. The problem for me comes with way they romanticize the situation. Many married people split after one of them goes through the trauma Lucy has, and yet according to the movie, it is appealing to have to get your lover up to speed every day of their life. I admire the person that can do that, and only the best of wishes for those like Henry who know what lies ahead of them and they still make that commitment. But in reality, its not so exciting and uplifting. In that respect, it is good of them to have Lucy feel like she is inconveniencing Henry. The scenery is beautiful, the editing/styling on segments like the pineapple intro and crash scene were marvelous; really displaying what the company's/producers are capable of producing. aside from the 'birdies' (not including the penguin), the film is incredible! i love it!"
"gerrythree","Null","0","0","16 February 2004"," Lame Comedy
","`50 First Dates' is bad, a comedy romance that is totally unreal.  The stars portray caricatures, not characters.  This movie supposedly takes place in Hawaii, but the main exterior shots, lasting a total of about 8 minutes, seem to have been filmed in Waikiki by Chinaman's Hat Island and on either an isolated road in the Oahu's interior or in Maui by former pineapple fields.  In any case, Hawaii never looked worse, with the movie having a consistent muddy picture that was probably not a projectionist focus problem.  In Hollywood now, you can have a career even if you have no talent, look strange and have a crummy voice e.g. the career of Owen Wilson. If Adam Sandler continues to star in unappealing comedies like `50 First Dates,' he will end up with a core audience of teenagers who will watch almost any swill for the first weekend in release.  This movie represents a precipitous decline in quality from `The Wedding Singer.'"

So intermixed with the great scenes, they inserted cut away shots of walruses doing some trick, or a one liner from a secondary character like Rob Schneider or Sandler's coworker.  Most of these feel tacked on, aren't that funny, and they all take away from the timing and either the romance or existing humor of the scene.  <br/><br/>In the end this movie suffers, although not fatally, from an identity crisis.

","50 First Dates is the funniest movie of 2004 to date. It's hard to believe that there are people in the world who have short-term memory loss, it's even hard to believe how funny and original this movie is. For Henry Roth his life usually consists of hanging out with his friends, working with the animals that he now calls family, and preparing for a big trip that he plans to take in his boat. One day while out testing the boat, the boat breaks down and he is forced to get to land. He enters a nice little diner where the characters inside are as colorful as it is outside. This is where he meets Lucy Whitmore, a beautiful woman with a carefree attitude. After one change meeting the two make an instant bond, after hours of talking and laughing the two decide to meet again the very next day at the same time. Sounds good rightwrong, to Henry's surprise Lucy has no idea who he is. He soon leans that Lucy suffers from short-term memory loss, now Henry is out to make the woman of his dreams fall in love with him everyday.<br/><br/>50 First Dates is a laugh out loud comedy that will have everyone in a good mood. The re-teaming of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore is awesome. The two have great screen chemistry, if this time around is as successful as The Wedding Singer one may expect to see another film featuring the two actors. And if the amount of people that were at the theater that I saw this at is any indication as to how big this film is going to be, then I'm getting in line now for their next movie. The always-funny Rob Schneider is the funniest I have ever seen him. His portrayal of Ula, one of Henry's friends is in short a performance by a comic mastermind. Sean Astin came out of nowhere and turned in a very funny performance as Lucy's muscle bound brother.

","Yes, I know this is just one person's opinion, and I'm sure you'll disagree and radda radda, yadda yadda etc. But hear me out.<br/><br/>I was a fan of Adam Sandler's earlier movies. 'Billy Madison' and 'Happy Gilmour' were funny films, and you weren't expected to take them too seriously. '50 First Dates' is different though.<br/><br/>Let's have a run down of what I didn't like (it's my prerogative, after all). Adam Sandler isn't really suited to the part. He's a bit of a goof, and I find it hard to take him seriously (in 'Anger Management', okay, but I was rooting for Jack Nicholson the whole time :P). Same goes for Will Ferrell and 'Bewitched'. Secondly, the script is uninspired. Mundane. Average. There's nothing special about it and it sort of teeters between the outrageous, over-the-top comedies like 'Billy Madison' and 'Happy Gilmour' that I liked Adam Sandler in and the more serious romantic comedies. It's like it can't decide what it wants to be. Drew Barymore is Drew Barymore. She's just a character, and her role could be filled by anyone, really (ie. Sandra Bullock, Cameron Diaz, Tea Leoni etc.). Rob Scheider is really, really bad comedy relief. He's like Adam Sandler's on-screen stand-in, and it gets old really fast. The concept is, half the time, taken far too seriously and the other half not seriously enough.<br/><br/>'50 First Dates' wants to be like 'Blind Date' (one of Bruce Willis' first films, and also featured Kim Bassinger). In fact, they are very similar films. But in the end, '50 First Dates' comes off more like 1) a TV soap (it's mushy, it's clichéd and we've seen it all before) and 2) like 'Scary Movie' (it's all tongue-in-cheek, we're not supposed to take it seriously etc.). And it just can't make it work. I like Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, but even their presence can't save this movie. It's too muddled, too divided to be enjoyable."

","I knew the concept and stars of the film from the trailer, so I suppose I had to give it a go, from director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps). Basically Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a wildlife veterinarian who lives in Hawaiian paradise, and he is afraid of commitment, and had a string of week long flings with quite a few women. Then he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), both enjoy each other's company, and Henry feels the start of something serious. The next day however Henry approaches Lucy, and she fails to recognise her, and then he finds out about her short-term memory loss, Anterograde amnesia (here called 'Goldfield Syndrome') , so every day she wakes up doing the same thing, thinking it is the same day, and when she does find out the truth, she will forget the next day. So Henry is hanging out with Lucy's dad Marlin (Blake Clark) and brother Doug (Sean Astin) to not only try and get in their good books to date Lucy, but try and help her realise her state, every day she wakes up, with a video tape. For a while it seems to be working, and they do finally sleep together, which causes screaming in the morning, but there is the point when Lucy overhears she is a burden to her family and Henry, so she wants to break up, and she is making sure she can't remember him by removing him from her journal (started it after the first time she saw the video). But thankfully Henry sees Lucy does remember him, she dreams about him, and paints him everyday, so there is a happy ending, and every morning she wakes up with a video of their wedding, and greeted by their daughter. Also starring Rob Schneider as Ula, Lusia Strus as Alexa, Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Keats, Amy Hill as Sue, Allen Covert as Ten Second Tom and Maya Rudolph as Stacy. Sandler is less goofy than normal, Barrymore is a character to have sympathy for, and there are some moments of slapstick and many one-liners, but I think this is slightly more dramatic in terms of the love story involved, but certainly entertaining. Worth watching!"
"beckyandcutie","3","2","5","13 November 2005"," Pathetically Unoriginal
","I did not see ""50 First Dates,"" when it first came out, but a year after that. I was staying in a hotel, and with nothing to do, I decided to watch it. I want those 99 minutes from my life back!! I absolutely hated this movie! Je déteste beaucoup ""50 First Dates""! Why? As the title hinted, it was too unoriginal. I'd like to say that Hollywood is doling out wonderful movies that deserve the many Oscars they are presented with, but they don't. ""50 First Dates"" is a perfect example. The movie has a poor plot that basically moves around this guy trying to win back this girl (who's really rude I might add) every single day because she has short term memory disorder. The video he puts together is sweet, but watching that thing everyday, every few minutes, made me want to gouge out my eyes, or kick the director in the stomach. To fill in the gaping gaps that this movie is filled with are sex jokes. Wow, how original!! Everybody knows that sex jokes make a great movie!! Sex jokes are embarrassing, rude and immature. If you joke about sexual organs, you probably shouldn't hit the sheets for another 20 years! That's how much I hate those people. What's more disappointing is the audience that goes to see these movies are actually stupid enough to laugh and think they're funny without being slightly taken aback or disgusted. It's pathetic. The end of the movie is corny and of course the happy ending you guess. Then again, it was cute, but I just think they should've done something a little different, but have them get back together. All in all, this movie had a lousy plot, lousy actors and horrible void fillers. The only reason it get a 3/10 is because it's in Hawaii. Had they put it in the mainland it would've gotten a 1/10"
"JAKastner","7","4","15","13 February 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of 50 First Dates
","Ah, love! Isn't it grand? Many men find special things to do for the one they love like buy them flowers, candy, or jewelry, while others take them out for a night on the town complete with dinner and . an Adam Sandler comedy? Yeah, it's true, Adam Sandler is releasing his new comedy out on Valentine's Day in an effort to save all adolescent males from being dragged to another Kate Hudson/Julia Roberts/Reese Witherspoon lackluster romantic comedy . Okay, he's not doing it for those exact reasons but you get the idea.  But some movie-goers might be asking, when seeing the trailer for 50 First Dates, `Haven't we seen this before?' Yes, Sandler's new romantic comedy is being released on the exact same day as The Wedding Singer was five years ago, complete with Drew Barrymore as his love interest . Is Sandler in a desperate effort for the good days that film sparked? Possibly, especially after moderate hits like Mr. Deeds and Anger Management and flat-out flops such as Little Nicky and Eight Crazy Nights. Could it be that the movie-going public is getting the same romantic comedy, only repackaged? Maybe Sander is becoming too commercial but only box office numbers will tell.<br/><br/>The story follows a young man who falls in love with a beautiful woman who can never truly love him back thanks to her short-term memory loss. Henry Roth is the ultimate stereotypical ladies' man who woos young women tourists, shows them a good time, but dumps them soon after the have sex. The problem is that Henry has a serious problem with commitment, especially after his college sweetheart dumped for a guidance counselor, and that is why he can never fall in love with a native Hawaiian girl but that all changes when he meets Lucy. He meets her in small restaurant and they seem to hit it off right away but when Henry meets the next day at the same restaurant, she doesn't remember him at all. He learns from one of her friends that Lucy was involved in a car accident a year ago and lost her short-term memory from that point on. Lucy's father and brother try and protect her from men who know of her condition and are just looking for a one night stand but Henry is adamantly determined to make her remember him, no matter it takes. The story for 50 First Dates is . well, you don't know what it is, really. It feels like a combination of Groundhog's Day, The Wedding Singer, and Joe Versus the Volcano, all packed into one film but leaving nothing but mixed reactions. It's hard to tell what the filmmakers really wanted from this film as if they couldn't decided whether they wanted an emotional drama or romantic comedy and, in the end, they just decided to splice the two genres together and make whatever it came out to be.<br/><br/>The two leading stars of The Wedding Singer are back in this new film but the question is whether or not they still have the same on-screen chemistry they had five years ago. And the answer would be, yes, but separately, they are on different ends of the spectrum. Adam Sandler, who started his movie career off with such wacked-out comedies as Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, seems to have matured greatly since his early years as a comedian and has expressed some interesting acting talent on-screen. How is 50 First Dates different for him? For one, he isn't blowing up with anger like all his other films and, second, he continues his level of serious performances in comedies like in Big Daddy. It seems his dramatic performance in Paul Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love did him some real good, which he shows off in the more emotional aspects of the feature. Drew Barrymore, best known for her role in Steven Spielberg's E.T., has really grown up since her early roles but hasn't improved much in the area of her performances. Granted she demonstrates real chemistry with Sandler, but alone she doesn't give anything better then her lower-browed romantic comedy roles like in Riding in Cars with Boys or Never Been Kissed. And, whether this was intentional or not, Barrymore manages to slut up an emotional good-bye between her and Sandler in the rain by not wearing a bra and bearing her soaked breasts, even if only for a few seconds. Not trying to hark back to the Super Bowl, but this shows a serious level of immaturity, if intentionally placed.<br/><br/>Overall, true romantics will find this predictable premise delightful while others will be wishing they had short-term memory loss. The biggest problem for the film is its lack of consistency, in that there is no balance between its heart-warming emotional sequences and its, at times, gut-wrenching comedic moments. While on the subject, were scenes like the barfing walrus or the butt flecking from Sean Austin (never thought you ever hear that, right?) absolutely necessary? Not to say it was all gross-out humor, 50 First Dates manages to actually pack in a relatively decent amount of hilarious highlights that weren't featured in the film's trailer, unlike Sandler's last film, Anger Management. Note, though, the use of the word 'decent' as several comedic scenes went off without even the slightest giggle. And though the film comes in at a not-too-bad one hour and thirty-six minutes, the repetitive story elements makes it feel at least thirty minutes longer then it actually is. If you are neither a fan of romantic comedies or Adam Sandler, save yourself the sixteen bucks (along with an additional fifteen for snacks) and take your girl to a play or a musical or something more entertaining then this.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: C+)"

"MovieAddict2016","5","2","6","30 June 2004"," OK twist on the ""Groundhog Day"" formula -- nothing special though
","""50 First Dates"" is an OK movie that has some funny parts, but as a whole fails to leave any sort of impact. Theday after I saw the film I didn't particularly remember anything noteworthy and found that it's the sort of comedy -- unlike ""Groundhog Day"" (which basically uses a similar premise) -- I wouldn't want to watch more than once, or perhaps every few years.<br/><br/>Lucy (Drew Barrymore) lives in Hawaii with her father and brother. Roughly a year ago she was involved in a near-fatal car crash that damaged her ""temporal lobe,"" meaning that her short-term memory process is disabled, i.e. every day she wakes up thinking it's the day of her car crash.<br/><br/>Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a ""fish person"" (marine biologist I suppose, although he never really specifies) who works at a zoo with a walrus and a penguin. He is a playboy, enticing woman who visit the island of Hawaii to have one-night stands. He then leaves them the next day and escapes. He is afraid of commitment, but when he sees Lucy eating breakfast at a local restaurant, he is unable to resist her charm. Of course, the comedy of it all is that the next day -- when he meets her for waffles a second time -- she doesn't remember him at all. ""I've never even met you"" are the words she yells at him -- and he doesn't understand what's going on.<br/><br/>
Soon he finds out, and decides to help Lucy against the wishes of her family. Her brother, a fitness freak played by Sean Astin, is all-too-eager to beat up Henry (and he fails repeatedly). Meanwhile, Henry's best friend (Rob Schneider in another Sandler-comedy supporting role) helps his pal out in a number of ways.<br/><br/>Sean Astin's scenes were all quite good (and unexpected -- from Hobbit to steroid-taking, swearing, lisp-talking loser) -- but Sandler just muttered through his lines again and Barrymore is doing her usual sweet girl routine.<br/><br/>
Overall this is fairly enjoyable but I think I agree with the majority of bad reviews it received upon release -- I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. It's just not anything special. <br/><br/>However Dan Aykroyd's (surprisingly credited) cameo as the doctor was funny. ""Was your head always shaped like an egg?"" <br/><br/>Sandler and Barrymore fans will find enough to like here but as a comedy it's only sporadically funny. A good film for Valentine's Day but not something I'd want to own or watch very often."
"MorganStable","3","2","6","22 February 2004"," Did I laugh at this? I don't remember.....
","A comedy in which I laughed out loud app four times.  Once I chuckled.  A small guffaw or two.  That was it.  For 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Remember when Groundhog Day took the same concept and found every imagineable laugh possible.  What does 50 First Dates do... use lines like ""Very funny"" as a retort.  Adam trying new ways to impress Drew for the first time, again and again. ""You're the state moron of Hawaii.""  Sean Astin with a lisp.  AND WAY TOO MUCH DRAMA ABOUT DREW'S CONDITION.<br/><br/>
I don't ask much of Adam Sandler comedies.  And this one couldn't even reach the bare minimum.  Hell, even Little Nicky was funnier."

'Groundhog Day' meets 'Memento' via 'When Harry Met Sally' could've been the pitch for this better than anticipated high concept romantic comedy vehicle for the appealing chemistry laden coupling of a womanizing Hawaiian veterinarian Sandler and artist Barrymore, whose short-term memory impaired by a car accident has him endlessly meeting cute and pitching woo to get her to fall in love with him all over again. What sounds like a one-trick pony of a screenplay novice scribe George Wing makes some nice choices for his characters in moving the plot along with a joke-a-minute pacing that surprisingly works from the get go. Nice to see Sandler reign in his frat boy image and his pairing with Barrymore  very sweet by the way  should be a regular thing not unlike Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan of recent memory. Funny and sweet.

"svhot","10","1","2","9 January 2019"," ""50 First Dates"" is one of the best modern romantic-comedies made so far
","This movie, ""50 First Dates"", is Adam Sandler's crowning glory ; it is definitely the best role, and the best performance of his career so far. People who are skeptical about Sandler's acting talent should watch this movie - their doubts will definitely be cleared. Plus, there is the vivacious , dreamy-eyed female Drew Barrymore to watch . The chemistry between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore is definitely worth a watch. In fact, they will be remembered as one of the best on-screen couples in a romantic-comedy (rom-com, as it is frequently referred to these days).<br/><br/>Adam plays Henry Roth, a man who lives in Hawaii, and he is afraid of getting in a permanent, committed relationship, until the time when he meets Lucy(Drew Barrymore). They hit it off almost instantly, but the next day she does not even recognize him. This is due to her short-term memory loss - she forgets everything while she sleeps at night ; when she wakes up in the morning, her mind keeps returning to a particular day in a particular year. Henry, despite the fact that he has the skill to get any woman, decides that he wants to be with Lucy - regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for ""the first time"" everyday. He even helps her to move on by telling her the truth about her memory problem.<br/><br/>This is a really brilliant movie. It is full of fun - for instance, the things that Lucy's family members do to hide the truth about her memory problem, the way that Adam (Henry) intercepts and interrupts their everyday plans to reveal the truth to Lucy, and so on. However, the real flavor of ""50 First Dates"" lies underneath the humour - it is so unbelievably romantic. This quality makes it one of the best ""feel-good"" factor movies ever made."

"Blueghost","Null","1","2","1 October 2015"," Well, I finally saw it.
","I'm not sure what to say about it, other than I thought there would be a different ending to this film.<br/><br/>I remember the ads for this film years back, and I remember thinking what a funny film it promised to be. But, like a lot of Sandler's offerings, I just didn't find it, nor him and his dialogue, all that funny.<br/><br/>Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm just getting too darn old for comedies, but I still laugh at other films that don't have body function jokes, or swearing, or a target demographic audience in mind. And ultimately I think that's why I found this film to be a flop.<br/><br/>To anyone who reads my reviews you'll note that I do have a pretty high standard when it comes to films, but for a film that's supposed to be some kind of romantic comedy, why oh why is there a gag in there about a walrus and its body functions? Why is that funny? It actually isn't, and I'll bet the people in the theatre probably didn't laugh at the gag so much as at the ridiculousness of some director putting something that was sick and disgusting into the film.<br/><br/>Okay, to the film's story before I get too sidetracked; like I said in my opening sentences, I thought there would be a different ending, and a resolution to the main plot device that propels the entire film forward. But none such is the case. Instead we get a circumstance that is never resolved, and a romance revolving around that, which seems just ludicrous beyond belief.<br/><br/>The ""Blue Ghost"" version would have resolved Barrymoore's character, kept old fashioned comedic sense in the film, kicked the target audience oriented script out the window, and then have romance flourish more traditionally after straightening out the plot device. And, it would have been a better film.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I'm not a big Sandler fan, but I think both he and Barrymoore are decent performers when given the right material. Sandler doesn't strike me as any kind of leading man, even in a Jerry Lewis kind of way, and given the grade-level of his material, I am still mystified by people who keep this guy's career propped up.<br/><br/>Then again, the film isn't aimed at me. But, then again, nor were any of The Three Stooges shorts, nor any rom-com made before 1980, nor even the classic WB cartoons. And yet for some reason I find all those films funny."

","Brilliant example of using simple technology to view and live life in true perspective. The movie has a very simple story line yet leaves a powerful message for those who choose to decipher. I found Sandler using video recordings to store memory immensely satisfying. Perhaps we can all selectively store only good memories to help us think with our hearts. In our day to day lives we are accustomed to put all pros and cons on the excel sheet before taking decisions.<br/><br/>Slow easy going movie. Watch it alone, without prejudices.<br/><br/>Yes its a tearjerker. Also ""Paisa wasool"" (worth the money) as they say in India.The lead couple and supporting cast are superb. I loved the movie and Sandler, Dan, Drew, Rob, Sean and easy-going-everybody else."
"TOMNEL","6","1","2","17 May 2008"," Slightly more charming than most Sandler pic's, but that's not saying much.
","Adam Sandler is known for making goofy comedies, where he acts silly, and rude, and somehow this still charms the viewing public. I've come to realize the likability of Sandler's character does not make his movies any better, considering his most likable character was in ""Little Nicky"" and that was a terrible picture. However, he is slightly more likable here, than in most of his other movies, and though this is a dumb, and not extremely funny comedy, it has a charm to it, somewhat from him, but more from Drew Barrymore who plays a good lead to level out Adam's goofiness.<br/><br/>Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a player, and constantly gets with women, only to lie to them to get out of the relationship. One day, when eating breakfast, he meets a girl named Lucy (Drew Barrymore) who he falls for. He soon comes to realize that she has only a short term memory from an accident she had, and she forgets everything after the accident after every day. He tries to win her over everyday, and mildly amusing comedy ensues.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned already, Adam Sandler was okay in this one, but nothing special for him. His character is better than in some of his films, but it's still his typical smart Alec jerk. Drew Barrymore is sweet and works well with Sandler, but she doesn't bring anything huge to the project. Her father is played by gravely voiced Blake Clark, and her brother is played by Sean Astin who has gone from a hobbit to a steroid junkie with a lisp, and both of these actors are good. Rob Schnieder plays Sandler's friend who works with him at the zoo, and he can be pretty annoying, but he makes little kids laugh. Finally, there's Dan Aykroyd who's in this for some reason playing the doctor that helps Lucy. He's not in much of it, and his jokes are pretty stupid.<br/><br/>This is slightly above most of Sandler's other films, but it still only manages to reach mediocrity.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for language, crude and sexual humor."

"MartianOctocretr5","6","1","2","16 May 2007"," Odd premise for a rom-com, but it works
","Drew Barrymore as the amnesiac Lucy, is wonderful in this movie. She's sweet, vulnerable, and yet strong in her own way at the same time. Adam Sandler drops his routine ""ornery annoying dumb guy"" persona, and he adapts well here, playing his Henry character as noble, sensitive, and amiable. The two characters are pleasing and easy to identify with.<br/><br/>The good work of both leads helps this offbeat premise work. A young woman suffers from a condition caused by a traumatic injury where her daily memory is erased each night when she goes to sleep; she wakes each morning thinking it's a day a few years earlier. Her family insulate her in this fantasy, for obvious reasons. This is where suspension of disbelief is necessary, as plot holes dealing with how Lucy's life would be are easy to catch. Most obvious: as time wore on, wouldn't Lucy be shocked, waking to see her parents had aged by several years? And if she sees a mirror, she'd notice her own aging. It's hard to imagine living like this, which is why this movie actually moves more toward a drama than a comedy.<br/><br/>However, in all rom-coms, love conquers all, even the daily obliteration of the relationship. The behavior of people doesn't seem likely, and the ending opens a lot of questions, so giving the movie poetic license again comes into play. This movie is just about romantic fantasy, so for the sake of enjoying the flick, those questions are best left unasked."
"DeSmet","8","1","2","4 January 2007"," A remarkably sweet scenario and cast
","Before watching this movie, and having read in several newspapers and TV guides that this movie was not really worth watching, I expected an all American loves story. Well made, beautiful scenery and a very thin story. But I experienced something completely different.<br/><br/>My feeling about this film is that the story was just so utterly romantic, even sweet and very well laid out. The film has pace, is brave in its dialogue, and the actors do their best to really make it work on screen. With this, the scenario is very original. Seeing loss of memory as a classic theme in the movies, this is a very original adaptation of a well known them that could easily fail when treated as a clichÃ©.<br/><br/>Drew Barymore is so very sweet in her performance renewed surprise, while Adam Sandler is his regular self, but this time filled with love and ambition in going a long way in pleasing Drew.

It's shallow title lulls you into expecting the typical silly chick flick motif. You're deceived into relaxing and expecting the same formula, but midway through you realized this is one of those rare movies that does what it's intended to do: move you. This movie has genuine emotion. You'll turn the DVD player off with a lump in your throat.<br/><br/>It's silly comedic movements (read: Rob Schneider) distracts from the emotion of the film, but Adam Sandler and Drew Berrymore's surprising performances more than makes up for it. Adam finds an environment where his natural wit moves well with the movie, and Drew's shy innocence shines throughout.<br/><br/>Don't be deceived---give it a chance and remember what it feels like to fall in love again for the first time.<br/><br/>Pros: The best movie Adam Sandler ever made (ordinarily this isn't saying much, but this really is a great movie) and the most memorable romantic comedy of this decade.<br/><br/>Cons: This could also translate as a great family film but for the unnecessary PG-13 materials which adds nothing to the film.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A surprising heart-breaker you'll find yourself embarrassingly recommending to your friends."

","Of screenwriter George Wing the IMDb report that he spends months of outlining, telling his story to anyone who will listen, before actually writing anything. One wonders what kind of people Wing had listening and how many they were. One suspects very few and of limited cerebral franchise. One guesses most of these monologues were aimed at cold walls. Add to that the fact that this 'gem' was floating around years before it was picked up and you have something extraordinary, albeit not in a good way.<br/><br/>When Sandler's 'almost good' he's just about tolerable, but this is not talent in any sense of the word. Barrymore is sweet and as with The Wedding Singer (which far surpasses this turkey) she makes the movie by setting the tone.<br/><br/>No movie can run its full length without one or two gags that work, and this one doesn't fail there either, but as you're watching you're bound to ask yourself how many people wrote this schlock (it was only one) and how little contact they had with one another throughout the writing process and why oh why did the studio insist none of the writers be told what the others were writing about?<br/><br/>And as for suspension of disbelief - forget it.

Drew Barrymore is refreshing and the chemistry between she and Adam is very similar to ""Wedding Singer"". A true romantic comedy, there is as much comedy as romance. The soundtrack, a mixture of Hawaiian pop, adds to the movie.""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" should be Many memorable lines. ""Can I have one last first kiss?"" is the best line in the movie. I laughed. I cried. I recommend this movie to every one...even if you have all the love you need."

","50 First Dates is a funny comedy that doesn't deviate from the Hollywood standard. This makes it a standard comedy that can be appreciated for just that. It's fun to see Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in their respective roles, since I enjoy both actors in most movies they have done. They are able take the standard dialogue written for this movie and make it somewhat enjoyable because of the interaction of the two actors works. I must also mention that Lusia Strus who plays Alexa is quite funny in her role even though the jokes centered around her is quite predictable.

","Imagine if Bill Murray's character in ""Groundhog Day"" fell in love with Dori from ""Finding Nemo"" and the story being written by the Ferrely brothers, then you'll pretty much have the plot to ""50 First Dates."" The basic story is endearing, but the crude humor and stereotypes (the patients with brain damage, the sexually ambiguous zoo worker, the obese and emotionally volatile Hawaiians, the goofy hippie) are annoying and even offensive and do detract from the film. Adam Sandler's transition from Lothario to devoted family man is not explored to a satisfying degree and Sean Astin gives an especially disappointing performance, especially after coming off great roles in the ""Rings"" trilogy and ""Rudy."" SPOILER ALERT: To this film's credit, there is no miracle cure for Lucy. She has to live with her condition as do her loved ones.

I really admire how it was made a comedy and yet there was no fun or sport made out of Lucy's condition; that part was handled with care and sensitivity. I get teary-eyed every time I watch this movie. My father and I recently watched it and even he was getting choked.

"The_Void","6","1","2","7 January 2005"," Another miss for the memory loss love story
","I am a big believer that someday, somebody somewhere will finally get this idea of a memory based love story right. The 2004 darling 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' would make too many film fans say that it has already been done effectively, but frankly these people are wrong. Eternal Sunshine should have been so good that it hurts, but thanks to lazy writing and less that great direction, Eternal Sunshine failed. So what about this film then? Well, 50 First Dates doesn't have acting to it's credit like Eternal Sunshine did, but it's certainly a lot more fun. In the end though, it misses the mark just as much as Eternal Sunshine, but for different reasons. Basically, this is a film of two sides; on one side, it's a breezy romance and just about every scene with Sandler and Barrymore on screen together is a delight, as are the scenes that deal with Barrymore's memory loss. However, the other side of the film shows why rom-com's so often fail, and that's the lame joke side. Another thing I believe is that comedy is good way to portray a point, but not this sort of comedy. The silly humour distracts the audience from the central theme and that is where, and why, this film fails.<br/><br/>It's a huge shame that this film didn't hit the mark. There's lots of genuinely touching moments on display, and the two leads regenerate that partnership that made The Wedding Singer such a fun ride. I don't often say this about fun films; but the film isn't serious enough. The comedy angle adds to the film during the scenes when Sandler makes Barrymore fall in love with him, but there's just too much childishness. Adam Sandler has started to mature a little since films like 'Happy Gilmore' and 'The Water Boy', and it shows in his performance. Many film buffs dislike Sandler, but I respect his ability to carry a film, even if he's not that great an actor. He did a fine job in P.T. Anderson's 'Punch-Drunk Love', and he shows some of that here. Ironically, in fact, Sandler is one of the less silly things about this film. Barrymore has basically been doing the same thing for the last decade and she does it again here. Still, she certainly isn't bad and it's nice to see her on screen with Sandler.<br/><br/>I was really expecting to be writing positive things about a film that deals with love in a fun way, but in spite of the fact that it has good elements and a definite point; as I've said already, it spoils itself. The film is worth seeing for it's leads and lighthearted tone (it's set in Hawaii!), but I can't warmly recommend it. Ah well...maybe next time."

","This movie was much better than I expected. For once, Sandler isn't playing this over-the-top annoying character. His character, Henry, actually turns out to be very sweet. The movie is about how Henry must make a girl, Lucy, fall in love with him every day because she has short term memory loss, and her memory is wiped clean every night when she sleeps. Her dad and brother have devised an elaborate scheme to make her think it is the same day every day rather than tell her the truth every morning. Every once in a while she finds out the truth and is very upset till the next day when she has forgotten. Henry gets the idea to make a video for her to watch in the morning that tells her the truth. It helps her to get over the shock in the first couple of hours, then she has the rest of the day to live her life and can finally meet up with old friends.<br/><br/>Of course, we have the inevitable, I'm holding you back speech from Lucy and she wants Henry to stop seeing her. He agrees and decides to leave on his walrus research trip. Does he leave her behind? What do you think considering the type of film it is? Rob Schneider has a small role in this as Henry's buddy. He was good for some laughs, like when he talks about his wife or licks the coconut bra. And Sean Astin is Lucy's brother, who talks funny and is jacked up on roids. He was amusing.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I found this movie to just be entertaining and sweet. I recommend it for all."

","*WARNING--Possible spoilers*: Nice romantic comedy with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in the leads. There are some serious laugh out loud moments, mostly due to Rob Schneider's character, ""ULA."" It centers around an outdoor theme park vet who falls for a sweet lady in a restaurant, in Hawaii. The main problem with 50FD is that how does one overcome the repetitive, proverbial ""One Trick Pony"" joke that surrounds Barrymore's character? Well, outlandish attempts on Sandler's part to keep continually wooing her helps. However, it tends to make the pic drag here and there, and sometimes this gets more than slightly tedious. The chemistry is better than average between them, and it shows. Unfortunately 50FD also commits a droll sin of introducing animals for cutesy, quasi-humorous moments, and tries to play that for laughs, too. Nice try, but doesn't get Nanna a new pair of shoes. Dan Aykroyd is painfully dull as the physician who's treating Barrymore's character, which doesn't help the film one iota. Throw in a few zany locals, and several earnest attempts at poignancy; and you've scored about a mixed bag. There's some crude humor, so early Sandler fans won't be disappointed. The ending was very sweet, yet was a welcome sight, as 50FD also runs pretty long in the tooth at 99 minutes. It certainly wasn't awful, that's for sure. In fact, 50FD would be a pretty smart date movie or a couple of chuckles on a rainy afternoon. In lieu of this benefit, I recommend it. RECOMMENDED."

One of my favorite parts was when Ula (Rob Schneider) is pretending to attack Henry so Henry can get Lucy's attention and it work and so Lucy keeps beating Ula with a metal baseball bat, that part just laughed my ass off! Another part I liked was when Lucy and Henry wake up the next morning and Lucy didn't remember Henry sleeping with her so then she hits him with a lacrosse stick and then later Dr. Keats (Dan Aykroyd) tells Henry that he wasn't going to suffer any memory lose but asked him that if his head was shaped like a melon before she hit him.

That poor husband. Not only would he have to introduce his wife to their daughter every morning, but he would also have to deal with someone every morning who thought she had gone to bed a young carefree spirit and woken up three months... six months... nine months pregnant. Can you imagine walking up one morning and realizing that you were about to go into labour, and not only could you not remember conceiving this child, but you have no memory of the entire pregnancy?!?

","I went to this movie expecting to like it.  I usually enjoy Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler had good chemistry with her in ""The Wedding Singer"".  50 First Dates starts with a sad premise (a person with short term memory loss), and then adds a ridiculous idea (that someone would try to meet this person and ""reromance"" her on a daily basis, after she forgets him) to attempt another ""romantic comedy"", which, as usual, was not romantic and not funny.  Fortunately, Rob Schneider (who is usually weak) is quite hilarious in his sidekick role, to keep the film from being a total waste of time. The rest of the cast seems to realize this film is a lost cause and sleepwalks through the whole affair.  I gave this film a 5/10 for Schneider's antics, plus some good performances by the trained animals (and, no, Sandler is not included as one of the animals).  Probably best to wait for cable on this one."

","Watching 50 First Dates is about as funny as watching your grandma suffer from Alzheimer's. The main problem is that a film about short-term memory loss is more heart-wrenching than amusing, and the fact that 50 First Dates is being marketed as a light-hearted romantic comedy is more than somewhat deceiving.<br/><br/>Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a veterinarian at an aquarium in Hawaii with commitment phobia who manages to bed attractive and naive female tourists every night of the week.<br/><br/>Then he meets cute and quirky Lucy (Drew Barrymore) at a local diner.<br/><br/>
Apparently captivated by the way she builds houses out of her waffles, he is smitten. Likewise, she is smitten by his hands that smell like fish, because her dad was a fisherman.<br/><br/>Henry and Lucy plan on meeting the following morning for breakfast.<br/><br/>However, when Henry shows up the next day and greets her by asking her to smell his fishy hands. She baffles him by calling him a pervert. We soon learn that a year ago on her father's birthday, Lucy was in a car crash that caused her to lose her short-term memory.<br/><br/>Each night when she goes to bed, she wakes up to remember nothing of the previous day, but remembers everything up until the time of the accident. Apparently, short-term memory loss works like clockwork.<br/><br/>Lucy wakes up every morning thinking it's her father's birthday and proceeds to start out every day the same way, even in the same outfit.<br/><br/>
It must get pretty old for Lucy's family and friends seeing her wear the same pink T-shirt and white Capri pants every day. Her loving and protective father (Blake Clark) and little brother (Sean Astin) try to perfectly recreate each day. The two even go so far as to order hundreds of the daily newspapers that came out the day of her accident for her to read every morning.<br/><br/>It's unlikely that someone who was as commitment-phobic as Henry suddenly wants to marry someone without a memory like Lucy, cute as she is. He talks her family into being open with her about her memory loss by setting up a tape of the past year's events for her to watch as soon as she wakes up. Lucy cries every morning as Henry consoles her. Sounds like fun.<br/><br/>Sandler and Barrymore do have good chemistry together during their 50 first dates and 50 first kisses. It's the same chemistry that made the pairing work well enough in The Wedding Singer. Sean Astin provides some pretty funny scenes as Lucy's little brother who has a steroid problem and lisp.<br/><br/>However, the audience could mostly do without Henry's pot-head best friend, played by Rob Schneider, who has a terrible Hawaiian accent and wears impossibly short shorts.<br/><br/>The way Henry uses the aquarium animals to woo Lucy (including dressing up some kind of penguin in a floral shirt to sit in the middle of a road as Lucy speeds by in her Jeep) would surely have his management calling PETA, but that's overlooked.<br/><br/>While 50 First Dates has the feel of an ultimately serious movie, it still relies on juvenile humor such as walrus vomit and genitalia to appeal to Sandler's fans. For those looking for a light-hearted comedy like the commercials for 50 First Dates advertise, you may be getting into more than you bargained, unless you find tragic brain-damage amusing."

","I fully admit that I had very low, biased expectations coming into this. I've never liked Barrymore. She's had the world of movies in her hand since birth, with a famous lineage and many friends in high places -- and what does she do with that power? <br/><br/>Well, she has no respect for herself or her audience, nor for the art or mechanics of movie-making. By age 14 she was already out of control with drug use. I would argue she popularized the very notion in our society that we have to 'sympathize with' and 'pity' the spoiled, wayward, self-abusing elitists, because they shape so much of our culture cinematically (who can forget ""E.T.""?).<br/><br/>Having written that, I have to comment that she's the only reason for watching this. Even though this is Sandler's movie, she's the only one here with either an innate or learned sense of what it means to live within movie roles. She controls the picture, though the narrative was intended to lay the control elsewhere. Sandler cannot and never will escape his TV-skit/shtick. That goes double for Schneider.<br/><br/>As for what this is, it's mildly clever in how it resolves itself through constructed representations of the world surrounding movies -- that is, through diaries, murals, watercolors, home movies, etc. Think of it as the inverse of ""Groundhog Day"", leaning heavily on ""Memento"".<br/><br/>I've seen far worse movies...more offensive ones than this, too. But this one will never be great. Contrast this with a smart self-referential vision and construction such as ""Eternal Sunshine..."", and this fades into complete irrelevance."

","50 First Dates provides viewers with a hysterical comedy about a man who lives in a woman filled life. Henry Roth, played by Adam Sandler, portrays a veterinarian who sleeps with a lot of women, all tourists, then makes up a story and never talks to the tourists again. Many movies could have a man doing this the whole movie and have perfect ratings, but 50 First Dates somehow keeps all of its viewers interested while Henry falls in love with the amnesic Lucy Whitmore. After being told to stay away from the café where Henry first made an impression on Lucy, he gets creative and comes up with crazy ways to get to talk to Lucy for an hour or two each day, even though he almost kills his pet penguin. Alexis, a co-worker of Henry's, is my favorite character, watching the movie, it is hard not to laugh anytime she is on the screen. When Henry tells her to reach down and get a cold fish, she jumps head first into the fish bin to get a cold enough fish. Alexis adds an element to the movie that is hard to be seen in many movies, being a supporting actor it can be hard to have the effect Alexis had on this movie. <br/><br/>My only dislikes of the movie were Henry and Lucy's dad, Marlin's sidekicks. Henry's friend Ula, who was bitten by a shark and believes they are not dangerous unless you touch their private parts, is over the top and takes away from Henry's character at many points throughout the movie. 50 First Dates would definitely have been funny enough without Ula and Lucy's brother Doug. As Marlin Whitmore's sidekick, Doug is worthless. He adds comedy to the movie very rarely, a brother who has a lisp and takes steroids, in theory sounds like he could be funny, but I think Sean Astin was not the right character to play Doug. The character of Doug had a lot of potential but was poorly played by Sean Astin.<br/><br/>Compared to The Waterboy, another Adam Sandler movie, 50 First Dates seems to have a pretty good story line and a lot more sexuality. While The Waterboy begins with a lot of sexual tension, there is only about forty to fifty percent based off of the relationship between Vicki Vallencourt and Bobby Boucher. 50 First Dates is based solely off of Henry and Lucy's sexuality and that is what brings the comedy to the movie. In his attempts to talk to Lucy everyday, many things go wrong such as Ula getting beat up by Lucy with a baseball bat. I would not say that 50 First Dates is better the The Waterboy, but the competition is close, both are very funny and have the means to succeed as movies in Hollywood."

","Adam Sandler film also starring Drew Barrymore and Rob Schneider. The film is about a guy who thinks he has found the right women ( played by Drew Barrymore) but then finds out she forgets everything after one day. So he sets out to win her heart every single day. The movie is extremely funny and does not re lie on the fact she only remembers stuff for a day for all its good humour. The movie is a must watch for fans of Adam Sandler and even for people who do not like him will probably enjoy this fine made piece of comedy. Overall I think this film is a must watch for fans of good comedy as it has every cast member at their extreme best ( cameos standard lower down excluding Rob Schneider) and the humour KICKS ARSE.

"harryelsucio1212","8","0","1","18 November 2007"," An quite unforgettable movie
","I really don't know why some people have said that they found this film sad, and one even referred to the ""melancholy ending"". The tone of the film is, in fact, upbeat throughout, and if I had to suggest an alternative title for it, albeit one that wouldn't help much at the box-office, I would say ""Love Conquers All"". Despìte the inadequacies of her short term memory, Lucy, played by Drew Barrymore is cheerful. friendly, creative and positive in her outlook. She never gives rise to gloom.<br/><br/>As regards the smooth-talking Lander, his social career as a gigolo is shown to us so briefly and in such an amusing way (he escapes from his last adoring and gullible tourist by literally hopping on to a passing jet-ski in the manner of James Bond whose persona he was aping at the time), that we don't really have time to find his conduct despicable. From the moment that he meets and falls in love with Lucy/Drew he is absolutely sincere, except for corroborating the white lies her doting father has to keep up, so as not to upset her. He is also supportive, and self-sacrificing for the sake of her love and happiness, taking some hard knocks both physical and emotional.<br/><br/>Lander's Hawaian (in real life half Filipino) side-kick, Rob Schneider, very funny without being as gross as he usually is, with his innumerable offspring and mountainous native wife, shares both Lander's troubles and triumphs as the resident buffoon, in contrast to Lucy's lame-brained brother who is just pathetically stupid and not funny at all. Schneider helps his buddy and boss, the veterinarian Lander to care for the highly charismatic aquarium animals: walruses, penguins and dolphins, whose exuberant antics are endearingly spontaneous. At one point, when the sporadic lovers get round at last to mating, a pair of inquisitive dolphin voyeurs, watching the couple with noses pressed against the wet side of their glass-walled tank, have to be shooed away before the act can be consummated discreetly after the fade-out of the scene.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the scraggy, androgynous Scandinavian assistant with braided blond hair and a frosty face looks and sounds like a wardress from Dachau, and does not fit well into the story.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, we have the weird situation where every morning Lucy has to be briefed by video and scrap book diary on her life since the accident that caused her odd complaint, and particularly now that she has a husband and children, whom she has quite forgotten since she fell asleep the previous night. However, she does appear to dream about her husband and has painted some good likenesses of him from memory.<br/><br/>Films frequently require the audience to watch unlikely events with suspended incredulity, and this is no exception. Assuming that such a medical condition actually exists in which the memory of each day's events is regularly blotted out on falling asleep, it is still hard to swallow that Lucy has gone on for so long with her daily routine, oblivious of the passing of time, until a cop gives her a ticket for an expired road tax licence. The equable winter-less climate of Hawaii might help with the deception, but surely she would have spotted a calendar, the date of a newspaper or watched recent news on the TV or heard it on the car radio, that would have contrasted with the same video that her dad played daily on their own set to keep her in the dark. But it is better not to think about such details and just sit back and enjoy a pleasant and wholesome love story. Having Drew Barrymore fall in love with you every day for the rest of your life is not an entirely unenviable fate!"

","""50 First Dates"" features Adam Sandler in a more subdued comedic role than he has previously exhibited in films. His performance in ""50 First Dates"" is much akin to ""The Wedding Singer"", which is a pleasant deviation from his recently zany roles in outrageous comedies. He is teamed once again with Drew Barrymore, and, they once again develop a romance- yet is a romance really a romance when one of the partners cannot recall your name the following morning? Lucy(Drew) appears to have a memory problem, short-term amnesia, where she cannot recall any events of the previous day. This is a sweet, charming, sometimes too sentimental, sometimes too implausible, and even smart, romantic comedy, featuring some delightful performances by Sandler and Barrymore, who once again prove their status as a romantic team in movies. The ending lacked much resolution, but at least it ended on a good note."

","Since the first Sandler movie i watched, i -felt- the movies of Sandler. They were always very funny, adorable and a kind of dramatic. Of course on a very light level, but everything always fitted together. The best part is, that he doesn't take himself or one of his characters he is directing to serious. Movies that takes themselves to serious make me sick. That's why i like Bollywood movies, if you see Sharukan ( i know, its 3 words..) acting, you realize that fast.<br/><br/>In 50 First Dates we of course don't see high-level acting Hollywood Giants, i don't want to compare him to Clint Eastwood or Al Pacino. But in his way, he his delivering a message to me and i'm receiving it. Enjoy live, be honest to others and laugh a lot. Thats a feeling all of his movies left me with.<br/><br/>In this movie, additional to the usual funny and weird characters surrounding Sandler, one can experience a very good acting Drew Barrymore, which perfectly fits into this movie. She is fitting to the other characters in this film in a very sweet way: They all don't fulfill common expectations. I really enjoyed the movie and think its one of Sandlers best - IF you are in the mood for a love story."

","Against my will, my own good reason, and all else that is dear to me, I was forced to watch this film. Before seeing this movie, I honestly thought that, at its best, it would be yet another Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore chick flick (and please excuse the seemingly misogynistic use of this term) that is funny, but mostly just sweet enough to make Kleenex manufacturers rich and boyfriends all over the world miserable. Needless to say, I went in believing, with all my heart and soul, that it was a capitalist ploy designed to ruin my day AND charge me ten bucks for my misery.<br/><br/>But I was wrong.<br/><br/>Well, I mean, I was right about the Kleenex thing (my girlfriend cleaned out two boxes before reaching for the beach towels), and true, it was incredibly saddening, but for altogether different reasons than I could ever have imagined.<br/><br/>""50 First Dates"" succeeds because it is sweet and charming and all the things that a good chick flick should be, but more importantly, because it has an incredible message beneath its epidermis-thin layer of pop-culture gloss. Yes, it is about love, and yes, it has moments of cheese, but never so much that it makes you beg for crackers; it is, above all, a movie about the tragedies that befall us and what we do to overcome them. It is about believable miracles in life, the things we do to make life worth living rather than the magical things that happen to save us from having to fight for our own happiness. And it is about fighting for happiness. How do you find a way to live your life, to love, to have a family, and to learn about the most important things when your condition forces you to never remember any of those things? If memory is all that we have of our small, sometimes pathetic, lives, then what happens when we don't even have that? And, as clichéd as it may appear, this movie does an incredible job showing us that life does go on, and that all you really need is, and please hold your gags, LOVE.<br/><br/>This is a film about a man who loves a woman so much that he's willing to spend the rest of his days making her fall in love with him - day after day after day, and he does this for the simple fact that she brings meaning to his life. For every day he loves and needs her, he will do everything in his power to make her feel the same way about him. Are you soaked in cheese yet? Because I am. But who cares? Sandler and Barrymore make it real enough for the audience to ignore the layers of dairy product and still appreciate the powerful feeling of love that transcends this movie beyond the usual Hollywood fromage that keeps guys like myself at a safe distance.<br/><br/>Watch it. Bring tissues and towels and boyfriends. As for you apprehensive men's men out there - good cheese is always healthy for your diet.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"

The reason why I can't bash this movie as some of the people on the message board chose to do is because it really made me laugh all the way through and brought tears to my eyes at the end.

Basically it's the story of a local in Hawaii who picks up cute tourists but is afraid of any commitment, so he tells every girl he meets silly lies to not have to talk to them anymore.

Even though there seems to be a lot here in common with other Sandler films, this one has something a lot of his other romantic comedies didn't: a really great story to go with the gimicky premise. <br/><br/>As for the characters, Sandler plays his basic lovable-loser and Drew Berrymore is her usual sweet self and Tom Blake and Hobbit emeritus Sean Astin (who was basically a character designed for a running gag) also deliver in solid supporting roles.

Forever after we wince often for fear Adam Sandler will pull an over-the-top Jerry Lewis moment, disturbing our attempt to understand  or at least ponder - Drew Barrymore's problem.  And her problem, one of a permanent short term memory loss rendering her incapable of recalling her yesterdays, is pretty fascinating.   <br/><br/>
	Lucy Whitmore's (Barrymore) father and brother have built a world for her that is as touching as it is odd  they preserve a particular day for her to relive every morning.  Since, like Guy Pearce in the phenomenal `Memento' of a few years back, she cannot create new memories and every day is a new day. Thus they go through tremendous effort to see that she is not made upset by essentially anything new in her life. <br/><br/>	Alas, this is not `Memento'.  Absolutely none of the gritty realism, sheer guts of the main character as he searches for truth, none of the mystery or in particular the drive on the part of the memory challenged person to compensate for their new-found handicap is ever presented.  Lucy just wafts along, borne on the breeze created by the fanning of the spectators in her life.	<br/><br/>`50 First Dates' is a disappointment in that generally films not offered for wide release yet starring some really talented actors often have a chance to be very good.  So we suspected this might be a sleeper, perhaps in the vein of the very interesting 2002 Sandler effort `Punch Drunk Love'.  But no, Sander has reverted to form.<br/><br/>Granted, he shows some real talent and even sensitivity in acting as a talented and caring young aquarist.  But when it comes to comedy Sandler has one dimension, and it is from the Jim Carey School of Goofiness.  So we get totally inappropriate outbursts, sort of juvenile and most definitely silly. Consider two particular examples of this in the film.  At the very beginning Henry (Sandler) concocts an enormously unbelievable tale designed to assist in brushing off a one-night stand.  Later in a restaurant he illustrates (in front of Lucy) the hammiest crying jag recorded by anyone in recent memory.      <br/><br/>Drew Barrymore, on the other hand, is such a treat to watch.  She has a few energetically comic moments and plays her character very believably, given her opportunities.  But for the most part Sandler acts as a moth to her flame, which has the effect of diluting, not enhancing, her performance. Ms. Barrymore can equal the best work of any of the good young actors available today and can be admired for trying just about anything role. <br/><br/>
There are enough quality moments in `50 First Dates' to allow that it has some appeal.  But in no way is it of the caliber of `Memento', and it should be quickly forgotten.<br/><br/> 	Rating: 2.5 Stars."

","SPOILERS HEREIN:<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is supposed to be one of the most popular comediens in America these days and therefore his movies hit the box-office.This was my 3rd Sandler movie and I can't really say that he's brilliant.After watching ""Happy Gilmore and ""Anger Management"" and not liking it,I was a little bit cautious in my choice to watch this film.<br/><br/>But I have to say this is his best yet (from the ones I've seen of course).Some of the jokes are really funny and Drew Barrymore is always a joy to watch. The story has got the basics of the comedy classic ""Groundhog Day"" with the genius Bill Murray.Adam Sandler doesn't even come close to Murray but that's a whole other story.The tale is about a guy named Henry (Adam Sandler) who falls in love with a girl named Lucy (Drew Barrymore).The girl has no short time memory,so each day she experiences the same sunday,her father's birthday no less.To make life tolerable for her,her father and brother (funny role by Sean ""Band of Brother"" Astin) recreate the same sunday each time. Yes,it looks a lot like ""Groundhog Day"" but from another perspective.<br/><br/>Anyway,the jokes are not bad.Some are a long time a-comin' and some have very lame endings.Especially the ones concerning sex.It always seems that the American's are so prudish yet sex-obsessed that the jokes always seem childish. My favorite laugh comes when we see Lucy doing her daily routine with her family.Because she always thinks that her father has his birthday she gives him the same present everyday:A video tape of ""The Sixth Sense"".This is truly a good joke since that movie is not a movie you have got to see more then twice (since it has such a brilliant climax that only blows you away once).The fact that her father and brother have to see this movie everyday is a good joke,but only when you've seen ""The Sixth Sense"".<br/><br/>And that's the problem with a lot of the jokes.Some are very American,they are based on American culture like baseball and American News.For Europeans like me that is hard to understand.<br/><br/>The movie goes on too long.It should have ended when Lucy decides to break up with Henry.But hey,it is an American movie and all American comedies have to end uplifting because of the contemporary global situation.That is a shame,cause the movie would have been more powerful with a downbeat yet realistic ending.<br/><br/>PS: The supporting roles by Roy Schneider and Dan Aykroyd are great!<br/><br/>6/10"
"walzking1","8","0","1","20 June 2004"," Cary Grant? Rock Hudson? William Powell? Hell no - ADAM SANDLER!
","That Adam Sandler will become known as the 21st Century's king of romantic comedy by subsequent generations of filmgoers is not, I submit, cause for mass lemming-like stampedes of film buffs off the nearest palisades. Like him or not, the guy can really do this stuff in his sleep, and, if anything, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and this picture showed that he might actually enjoy doing it enough to start messing around in interesting ways with the genre's ground rules. One major hurdle remains: Sandler must be able to appeal to women in a more direct, salacious (but not offensively so; Grant is the paradigm here) manner than he's presently capable of (or comfortable with). Sandler's still putting himself forward as the cute little boy who eventually evolves into a more adult partner, and his appeal needs to be a little more, well, grown-up. But only a little.... 1998's ""The Wedding Singer"" (which first teamed Sandler with Drew Barrymore), ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and this film show how confident Sandler's become as the heir to Cary. And Sandler's already got his core audience locked up and on his side. Now all he needs to do is win over a few more egghead cineastes and he'll join the immortals, whether we like it or not...."

","I have never gone through so many tissues in a long time! It is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen... Jocko & Rob Schneider alone deserve Oscars!<br/><br/>    Most guys in Henry Roth's position would have either taken advantage of the situation or given up right from the start, after his womanising ways wore out on him here was a challenge for him - after all the women who never forget him here's one who doesn't even recall their first ""Hello!""<br/><br/>   How he chooses to overcome that to make the ultimate commitment(s) is a viewing well the worth the effort and the Kleenex!<br/><br/>   http://tinyurl.com/3464k/"
"johnnymonsarrat","5","0","2","19 April 2004"," Jon Monsarrat review: too sweet to be goofy
","A lot of films start with a silly premise. For example, Face/Off has two characters switching appearances. And The Butterfly Effect has this weird time-travel thing. The trick is not to dwell on the goofy premise, but to move past it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 50 First Dates does dwell on the memory problem of Drew Barrymore's character... and it gets tiresome. The characters get caught up in the seriousness of her illness and it loses the goofy cartoony character of a good comedy. You know, like in Something About Mary, there's plenty of pain but it's all cartoony pain, not real.<br/><br/>The awkwardness of dating the same woman in different ways got repetitive, I don't know, the film didn't work for me.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Only fans of the actors, on a rainy day<br/><br/>I'll give ""50 First Dates"" a wasted-my-time 5 out of 10."
"kibler@adelphia.net","Null","0","2","10 March 2004"," Drew and Adam are likable, but this movie isn't
","50 First Dates (2004) Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Dan Aykroyd, Rob Schneider, Sean Astin, Blake Clark, D: Peter Segal. Sandler plays a genuinely sweet guy: a fish veterinarian in Hawaii (if you can believe that one) who has a real aversion for commitment. That all changes after he meets a pretty art teacher (Barrymore), but when he finds himself falling in love with her, he's shocked to discover she has short-term memory loss after a past car accident. Now that she only remembers the memories that took place before the crash, he figures he'll try to keep getting her to fall in love with him every time they meet-which is every day. It's a sweet, far-out premise and Drew and Adam work with the chemistry they had in THE WEDDING SINGER, but the juvenile gags linking to vomit, body parts, and androgynies make the cloying sentimentality standard Sandler. Running Time: 96 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude sexual humor and drug references. **"
"DJAkin","Null","0","1","7 March 2004"," Decent flick...same actors as Waterboy
","This movie was good but I get kind of  bummed out when Adam Sandler gets a little bit too mushy.  Yet, that was ok.  This movie had lots of funny part. Even that darn Walrus who pukes in that hermaphradites face!!  Speaking of her, she was creepy!!!<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore played herself, no big impact on my viewing pleasure.  Sean Aston, otherwise known as SAMWISE the HOBBIT was the best part of the entire movie!!!  He kept getting roid rage and saying the funniest things to Adam!!<br/><br/>I give this movie a few good marks.  This is average but maybe I will see it again.  Ten Second Tom is great."
"Drew-Barrymore-Obsessed","10","0","1","2 March 2004"," The best Sandler and Barrymore movie
","Fifty First Dates was without a doubt the best Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore movie they have acted together in. The plot outline was great so I may say it was the best comedy with those actors together like Blake Clark and Sean Astin as Doug (Sean Astin)the steroid user in the movie was funny along with Marlin (Blake Clark) the funny and unharmful dad was funny too. Drew Barrymore who plays Lucy was funny along with Henry Roth the animal vet who is played by Adam Sandler who is so funny. The rating out of ten was a A+ and 10/10.Rated \PG-13 on appeal for crude sexual humor and drug references. People who did not see the movie should see it now in theaters.Believe me you will love it."
"jlancaster-1","Null","0","1","1 March 2004"," 5 minutes away from an all-time classic
","As surprising as this sounds--especially to anyone who knows me and the kinds of films I normally like--but for the lack of a little restraint this good movie could have been a great one.  Instead, we are left with nothing but a near miss and the promise of what might have been.  Imagine a movie like Casablanca with a fart joke thrown in.<br/><br/>I was furious when I left this movie. Except for a handful of ridiculously unnecessary scenes/plot points, this movie would have been near perfect. I can't remember being this mad since I saw ET and was surprised by the now infamous 'p@#$!-breath' comment made by the little boy Elliott, played by Henry Thomas. Note to Hollywood: STOP IT ALREADY!  I'm not a prude.  I don't mind R-rated movies, nudity, or foul language in the right context.  I even been known to laugh at potty-humor.  But dammit, this time it did not work.<br/><br/>At various times, 50 First Dates touched me in ways that few movies have. The wonderful poignancy of it. The near flawless performance by Drew Barrymore as Lucy made the devotion of her father and brother all the more believable.  Adam Sandler, as Henry, has a goofy ""everyman"" quality to him that works well here. And he and Drew have a kind of quirky chemistry that works. As wildly implausible as the plot sounds on paper, it works too.<br/><br/>I just wish someone had taken a stand during the production of this movie and fixed the 5 minutes that keeps it from being an all-time classic. (Example: Why was it necessary to have Rob Schneider fondle his coconut falsies?)<br/><br/>As Maxwell Smart used to say, ""Missed it by THAT much!"""
"triple8","8","0","1","21 February 2004"," Charming romantic Barrymore/Sander movie with some great moments and gorgeous scenery but not as great as wedding singer.
","Let me start by saying this movie was actually much better then the previews made it out to be which is a plus because it's usually the other way around in movie land. Secondly,I found there to be both positives and negatives about 50 first dates. On the plus side, this movie works solely because of the chemistry between Barrymore and Sander which is so wholesomely natural and real that it wouldn't surprise me if they have a movie number three in the next few years. This is a movie that varies a bit from wedding singer in that the true hilarious moments are few and far between(though there are some.) This succeeds more as a romantic comedy but more on the romance side then the comedy. The premise of Barrymore's Lucy's problem is a unique one and Sandler and Barrymore play their roles with style demonstrating their chemistry is still as strong as ever.<br/><br/>The main negative of the movie actually isn't really a negative, more an observation that has already been noted by several IMDb reviewers. Many of the times the movie tries for wit, particularly in the beginning, it falls a bit flat. Not to give anything away to people who have yet to see this, but some of the mildly gross stuff just wasn't funny-and I didn't hear next to anyone laughing either. These jokes try WAY to hard and are actually more of an annoyance, detracting from the storyline rather then adding to the movie in any way. Anyone who goes into this expecting the exact kind of humor as wedding singer maybe disappointed, this errs way more on the side of romance and sentimentality then true hilarious comedy, whereas wedding singer had both. In my opinion, this movie was much better then expected, way above average and delightful in many respects, the romance played out between the characters was wonderful due to the reasons listed above. And there are few screen couples who have such a natural and honest screen chemistry as Barrymore and Sandler.<br/><br/>The scenery I must mention as well,because it is absolutely wonderful. This movie could also serve as a tourism advertisement for the state of Hawai, the setting was that beautiful. All in all, I am glad I saw 50 first dates, it was a delightful and very good movie with some very poignant moments, but I still prefer wedding singer, which is one of my favorite movies in the world. But 50 First Dates, all in all, is a great movie and I'm sure I will watch this again at some point. My rating is 8, maybe even 8.5 of of 10."
"papaya94","Null","0","1","16 February 2004"," I'm appalled
","Okay, Adam Sandler is adorable, and Drew Barry More's face could make you melt, but this movie was simply unexceptable.  Last night my friends and I went to the movies and I wanted to see Lost in Translation, however they complained that they didn't want to have to ""think"", so instead I was forced to sit through a movie that made me fall apart in tears afterward.  My father died two years ago of severe brain damage.  The concept of having to woo some girl with short term memory loss every single day, and than eventually impregated her, and have her meet her child for time whenever she wakes up is just not funny.  I was so offended.  I mean ""ten second Tom"", the fact that people find brain damage funny takes away all my hope in the human race.  I'm not just saying this because I'm a bitter teenager without a father, but I'm saying this because it's depressing that sick people and hermaphrodites are now the target of jokes and laughter.  It's sick. I hated his movie and whoever decided to make it should be ashamed of themselves."

","Adam sandler's movies just keep getting better and better. The early ones are good, like happy gilmore and billy madison. Yet, they have lost their appeal. We all have warm fuzzies about how good both those movies are, but odds are, if adam went back to the style of said movies, he would get blasted worse than he is now. More than likely if you watched billy madison now, you wouldn't find it so funny! I challenge all of you to watch and see. He's made such major advances, that it's astonishing he's been able to put together such a cohesive movie collection. It's good, real good. Just stop hating, and start complaining about the really bad movies, like anyone with julia roberts in it! Mona Lisa Smile! Come on! Blast that!"
