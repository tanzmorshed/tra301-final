"MR_Heraclius","10","54","59","24 February 2020"," ""Every man dies, not every man really lives.""
","The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally, the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war."
"jaredpahl","10","97","122","11 May 2017"," Mel Gibson Fights for Freedom in Braveheart, A Full-Throated Epic of Overwhelming Emotion and Intense Beauty
","Braveheart is a rousing adventure, a passionate romance, and a soul-stirring drama. In short, Mel Gibson's 1995 classic is everything a great Hollywood epic should be. Gibson's second feature film as a director was a revelation. Who knew that Mel Gibson, an established action superstar and leading man, would be capable of helming a grand Medieval epic with the artistry of Braveheart? The story of William Wallace's legendary fight against English tyranny in Medieval Scotland works as a strong action spectacle, but more than that, Braveheart is a heart-rending, almost spiritual experience, a rare film of bellowing passion that earns every towering emotion it conjures.<br/><br/>Braveheart tackles the ambitious task of retelling the legend of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a Scottish warrior who led a revolt against the English occupants of Scotland in the early part of the 14th Century. After his secret love (Catherine McCormack) is killed by English noblemen occupying the Scot's village, Wallace begins a rebellion that eventually leads all the way to King Longshanks (Partrick McGoohan) of England. The story is not a historical retelling of the real William Wallace, but an account of the mythic figure of William Wallace, the larger-than-life Scottish hero. Mel Gibson is at his charismatic best as Wallace. His presence on screen conveys every bit of the folk legend that Wallace has become. It might not be an accurate portrait of a real historical figure, but it is an exquisite visualization of a fabled warrior. The movie is, after all, based on the epic poem written by Blind Harry in the 15th Century. The choice to treat the story romantically rather than realistically is treated as a negative by some, but it is actually a brilliant decision by Gibson and screenwriter Randall Wallace. The romantic approach opens the film up to more emotion, more drama, and more action than a straightforward docu-drama would. Braveheart relishes in the romance of a time and place. The story is massive in scope, and it plays to all those time-tested notes of classic Hollywood adventures. Braveheart is a sentimentalized version of William Wallace, no doubt, but it is also surprisingly authentic. From the muddy village huts and crude stone castles to the close-quarter violence of the battle scenes, Braveheart is a legitimately unvarnished look into the cold, cruel world of Medieval Scotland. This marriage of idealism and realism strikes at the heart of what makes Braveheart so special. It works just as well as a tear-jerker and an action adventure.<br/><br/>One of the standouts in Braveheart are the battle scenes, which Mel Gibson stages with tremendous scale and violence. The action is appropriately chaotic, but the way Gibson and editor Steven Rosenblum cut between the indecipherable mayhem and punctuative killshots gives the battles orientation. The violence is effective. Every brutal blow is wince-inducingly severe. This is not typical Hollywood sword and sandals action, this is real, visceral action, and it carries a purpose. Braveheart brilliantly captures the strategy, as well as the barbarism inherent in Medieval warfare.<br/><br/>Braveheart is a fantastic action epic, but it outclasses those trappings. There have been many historical epics that have come and gone before and after Braveheart, but precious few of them can compete with this film's craftsmanship. What Gibson has achieved here is almost miraculous. He takes what might be groaning clich√©s in the hands of a lesser director, and injects them with a poignancy that they frankly do not deserve. We get the obligatory love stories, the death scenes, the speeches, the evil kings and the treacherous allies. It's all been done before, but never with such unbridled passion behind the camera. The characters are archetypes, but they show what influence a great director and great actors can have on a character. The supporting cast is so filled with personality, you just cannot help but root for what could have easily become two-dimensional placeholders. James Cosmo's Campbell, Brenden Gleeson's Hamish, and Sophie Marceau's compassionate Princess Isabelle are excellent, and Angus MacFadyen as Robert the Bruce does Oscar-worthy work as a man who's loyalty balances precariously between the English and the Scottish sides of the conflict. <br/><br/>James Horner's music may be the under-appreciated key to Braveheart's success. The mournful bagpipes and spirited Scottish melodies of Horner's score are downright essential for the film's emotional climaxes, of which there are many. When those climaxes hit, they hit hard, and that is thanks in large part to the music. Horner's score carries the same earnest spirit of the rest of the production. The music of Braveheart is precisely as big and bold as the story demands.<br/><br/>Braveheart is a masculine story, a simple-minded tale of heroes and villains executed with brute force. Of course it is an exciting action movie, we might have expected that from the star of Mad Max and Lethal Weapon, but the real discovery in Braveheart is its beauty. For all its violence and primitive mayhem, Braveheart never lets go of its absolutely rousing grandeur. It doesn't just allow you to look on it with appreciation, it demands it. Braveheart is cathartic in the way it overpowers you with emotion. There are shots in this film that nearly brought me to tears by their sheer beauty alone. When the story, the characters, the images (filmed by cinematographer John Toll), and the music crescendo, it hits like a wave of overwhelming gratitude. The admirable thing about Braveheart is how Gibson and company stick to their guns. They don't conceal the drama or play it subtly. Gibson allows the tragedies, the treachery, and the triumphs of the William Wallace legend to be extravagant. The story is sprawling, the romances are passionate, and the emotions are let out with uninhibited fury. Braveheart is a man's movie, a brutal action epic that will satisfy any red-blooded man's desire for violence and carnage. The remarkable thing is that Braveheart is also a movie that moved me like few have before. <br/><br/>95/100"
"heisenberg12","10","31","36","4 August 2019"," It's a Masterpiece. Best Movie of All Time
","Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.<br/><br/>Telling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.<br/><br/>Although its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.<br/><br/>On this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.<br/><br/>Without trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.<br/><br/>James Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.<br/><br/>There isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.<br/><br/>This is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.<br/><br/>The final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.<br/><br/>In addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.<br/><br/>When you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece."
"rutan07","10","909","1295","13 September 2005"," Best movie ever
","Most on this site pick the Godfather, or the Shawshank Redemption, but this is it, this is the best film ever made. People will complain, will argue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who played Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at. The slow motion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants, the entire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera. Braveheart is artwork, it is as good as any picture. That the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films."
"high_voltage_41","10","364","530","19 November 2005"," Simply amazing
","I remember seeing this movie for the first time in late 2003, and I was impressed. I saw it again last night, and I was even more impressed. The acting is amazing, and the ending was brilliant. For me, all my guesses were incorrect. Everything that happens in this movie in unpredicted. The last half hour itself was highly unpredictable, and it had a powerful message. When a scene was meant to be dramatic, they did a great job at it. I don't know about everybody else, but the ending did make me cry. The message the movie sent kept me thinking for a while. The amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was barely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of 1995, they did a great job.<br/><br/>I absolutely guarantee this movie to anybody who enjoys action and war with a bit of drama mixed in. One of the best, or maybe even the best movie of the 20th century."
"riddler_1138-3","Null","387","585","19 November 1999"," For he had only one life to give for Scotland.
","On my list of the greatest movies of all time, BraveHeart ranks as number 3. It is by far one of the most epic stories ever told.  Mel Gibson deserved all the credit he recieved and more. His portrayal of William Wallace, one of Scotlands most mightiest warriors, was spot on.  The only part that lacked was the romantic affair of Princess Isabella and Wallace.  It historically never happened.  This movie also has other historical errors but WHO CARES!<br/><br/>The Battle of Stirling has to be the second most graphic piece of footage ever shot next to Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. I love the part where the English Commander gives the order to charge and Wallace sees this and raises his broadsword into the air and starts yelling.  He charges the field with the Scots and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens next.<br/><br/>Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational and I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel Gibson portrayed him.<br/><br/>My hat goes off to Mel Gibson.  I hope he makes a few more movies like this one.<br/><br/>Out of ten............10/10!"

","This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. I recently purchased it and have watched it at least five times since then, and each time i pick up on things I did not see the other times. The fight scenes are great, the plot is both interesting and thought provoking, there is romance and comedy. This is a movie that any person can appreciate at some level. <br/><br/>True, the historical content may have been distorted, but even though, this movie is meant for entertainment. It is not a history lesson caught on video.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely superb, this movie is guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat for the entire three hours."
"zwei","10","355","546","17 November 2004"," Je-ne-sais-quoi-ly great!
","Unfortunately, I wasn't able to watch Braveheart till 2003 when it was on TV. However, the lack of theatrical effects never stopped me from being mesmerized by this epic for one moment. So mesmerized, I literally sat motionlessly on the couch for two minutes after the movie. Any normal audience would likely to cast his/her sense of reality away and be captivated by this distant Celtic saga. <br/><br/>Beside proving himself as a brilliant director, Mel Gibson more importantly gave life to a historical hero whose superb gallantry, vivid character and magnificent spirit shall never be history. Along with the unforgettable 'Alba gu bragh!' and the unprecedentedly heart-stopping 'Freeeeedom', Braveheart unquestionably is one of the greatest movies ever made."

"suiko","10","185","282","13 December 2004"," A flurry of emotions to move you in every direction (at least once)
","Unfortunately, I have yet to find a film of quite this caliber again. Braveheart contains elements of Romance (several heart- wrenching and warming instances), Epic/Action (spectacular scenes), Mystery (can take a few viewings to put it all together), History (albeit romanticised) and of course Drama (perfectly unravelled). This level of uncompromised multi-tasking allows the film to move you to laugh and cry, love and hate or even to think and be taught. I'm trying to avoid the clich√©s of glowing reviews (almost as bad as entirely negative ones) - but this is one of the few movies that I feel deserves one.<br/><br/>The witty banter between friends/foes/lovers/relatives is, in my opinion, flawless and aids the film's claim as a true classic. The soundtrack is similarly top-notch and encapsulates and refracts the patriotic theme during several key moments. The political sub-plot and gorgeous scenery also serve as refreshers during otherwise heavy areas of the story. Perhaps Braveheart's only flaw (but if you share my sentiments it's actually a bonus) is its length so you'll want to prepare a comfy seat and maybe even two pots of tea (complete with cosies!).<br/><br/>I suppose it's also relevant to touch on the historic inaccuracies as I expect this is what people might dislike most about this film. However, ""History is written by those who have hanged heroes""; also, the overall sketchiness of such periods coupled with the right of artistic license are enough for me to personally dismiss such thoughts. On that note, I hope you also enjoy what, to me, is the greatest film created (so far)."

","Set in the late 13th century, 'Braveheart' is the story of one of Scotland's greatest national heroes Sir William Wallace. leader of the Scottish resistance forces during the first years of the long, ultimately successful struggle to free Scotland from English rule...<br/><br/>Crucially charismatic in the title role, Gibson plays the heroic figure and emerges as a remarkable hero with wit and romantic soul, determined to rid his country of its English oppressors...<br/><br/>Wallace's revolution was set in motion, with great obstacles from his countrymen... Many Scottish nobles lent him only grudging support as most of them were more concerned with wealth and titles than the freedom of the country... In fact, the Scottish leaders are in favor of revolt-or not-depending on English bribes... Wallace, by comparison, is a man of honor, incorruptible and righteous... He was knighted and proclaimed 'guardian and high protector of Scotland,' but as much as he railed against the Scottish nobles, submitted to Edward I, King of England, he was astonished and in shock to discover the treachery of the leading Scot contender for the throne¬óRobert, the Earl of Bruce¬óto whom he confided , 'The people would follow you, if you would only lead them.' Sophie Marceau is exquisite as the distressed princess Isabella of France who ends up falling in love with Wallace, warning him out of several traps...<br/><br/>Catherine McCormack is a stunning beauty who ignites Wallace's revolution...<br/><br/>Patrick McGoohan is chilling, brutal, and vicious as the ruthless Edward I, known by the nickname 'Longshanks.' This king remains simply the embodiment of evil...<br/><br/>While Angus McFadyen moves as a nobleman torn between his conscience and political aspiration, and Brendan Gleeson brings strength and humor to his role as the robust Hamish, David O'Hara is very effective as the crazy Irishman who provides much of the film's comic relief from even the most tensed moments...<br/><br/>Mel Gibson has reason to be proud of 'Braveheart.' It is a motion picture that dares to be excessive... Gibson presents passionately the most spaciously impressive battles (yet staged for films) even excessively, and it is his passion and excess that make the motion picture great... The horror and futility of massed hand-to-hand combats are exciting rather repulsive... It is epic film-making at its glorious best...<br/><br/>Gibson's 'Braveheart' focuses on the human side of Wallace, a character so immense, so intelligent, and so passionate, exploring the definitions of honor and nobility, pushing us to follow the hero into his struggle against injustice and oppression...<br/><br/>There is a great shot of the lovely mountains of Scotland covered in mist with beautiful bagpipe music... James Horner's beautiful score, calls up memories of his work for 'Titanic.'"

","This enthralling movie Braveheart takes a viewer's breath away. The invigorating battle scenes, the incredible acting, and the fierce power of love all captivated me when I first saw this movie. James Horner's music is a masterpiece--it adds elegance and dimension to the magnificent film. Mel Gibson's zealous passion as his character William Wallace is truly an inspiration. Scots are very dignified, highly revered people, and this movie really presented Scotland's pride.<br/><br/>Everything in this film was done tastefully. Even the ending, which by the way is heart-wrenching, was done artistically, as Wallace sees his wife during such a traumatizing event. Of course, nothing was better than the rich satisfaction of watching Wallace scream for freedom, freedom and not mercy. This epic film must be watched again and again."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","115","185","21 April 2002"," One of the best modern movies of time
","I'm talking just in the 90's. The 90's were a great time for the movies, we had so many memorable one's and there is no doubt that ""Braveheart"" is one of them. ""Braveheart"" is one of my favorite movies that never gets old. Despite it's long running time, I will watch this movie any day.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson has come so far in the movie business and he not only stars but directed Braveheart. He did a terrific job and deserves a lot of credit for this remarkable film. Despite it not being totally accurate with history, anyone can enjoy ""Braveheart"". Based on the life story of William Wallace, a town peasant who just wants to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children. But when the British king of England, Longshanks, is sick of Scotland ""being full of Scots"", he comes up with a way of bringing them more into a British land by ""breeding them out"". Promising any British soldier to a Scotish bride on her wedding night before her husband can have her. Wallace won't hear of it and marries his love in secret. When a British soldier notices his wife and attempts to rape her, Wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in their village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away from the soldiers, but they catch her and kill her right in front of her family.<br/><br/>Wallace has had it and wants war for not only the murder of his wife and love, he wants freedom for Scotland and will shed blood to do it. ""What will you do without freedom?!"", this is one of the most memorable speeches of all cinematic history during their first major battle with the British. Through countless battles, friends, traitors, and bloodshed, all Wallace just wishes for is freedom. As Robert the Bruce says to his father ""They look at him and fight by his side."" He describes Wallace's bravery and what everyone feels in wanting to be him. I love Robert's last line ""You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed with me!"" and the army stands and continues their struggling battles for freedom! This is such an inspirational movie with a powerful message ""Every man dies, but not every man really lives"" to a tearful ending that will make anyone shed a tear to a terrific heartfelt sound track, it's no wonder this won best picture with other Oscars. This is a movie, a terrific one that everyone should enjoy and watch.<br/><br/>10/10"

The cast performed very well as this well written tale was told. Even though it is over 10 years old now, it still holds a place in my heart as one of the best. The accuracy of the battle scenes are only eclipsed by the expressions of the actors faces as they share this story. Stephen the Irishman steals the show with his plucky comic relief. Hamish the sidekick does a great job playing against the over the top performance of Mel Gibson. The predominantly European cast does a great job of not needing to fake accents and mannerisms.

","In this spectacular, historic movie a young Scotsman becomes the hero of his country, after his wife gets killed by the members of the English occupying force. In the beginning of the movie young William Wallace experience the death of his father and brother. They get killed by the English Kings Soldiers. After this he grows up with his uncle. Years later Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns back to the farm of his father to fall in love Murron (Catherine McCormack), the same girl who gave him a flower after the burial of his father and brother years ago. Because the English noblemen have the right to deflower every new married girl, Wallace marries Murron in secret. But the young luck won't last forlong. A few English soldiers try to rape Murron at a marketplace. Wallace tries to rescue her but the agressors can catch her and kill her right on the marketplace. When Wallace finds out about it, he takes revenge. He executes the murderers of his beloved. This ation is like a wake-up call for his fellow countrymen. They see him as their Leader to defeat the English occupying power. In their first battle the highlanders accomplish to defeat a numeral superior English Force. Wallace becomes an inspiration and more and more Scottish people follow him into war. Meanwhile in England the tyrannic King Edward the Longshankes (Patrick Mc Goohan) takes notice of the triumphs of Wallace. But this is not his only problem: His and heir apparent is a mollycoddled coward, who doesn't behave like his father would like to see it from a Prince. At least Edward the Longshakes arrange the marriage between his son and the lovely Princess Isabelle of France (Sophie Marceau). Besides this the Kings health is not the best anymore. But not only the English have their problems: The Scottish Landlords betray each other for more land and try to get more land for themselves from the English King. During the movie you'll see a lot of great filmed battles, two heart breaking love storys (first between Wallace and Murron, later in the movie young princess Isabelle falls in love with Wallace) and an exciting story about love, hate, patriotism, deception and heroism all in front of a wonderful landscape (the movie was actually set in Ireland). When you watch this movie, you'll be carried away by this powerful and always haunting epic and unterstand why there was no other chance than giving this movie 5 Oscars (including the award for the best film). It is a film who has it all: A great story, perfect filmed battles, one of the best soundtracks ever made (it is a shame, that the score didn't win an Oscar) and a hell of a cast. The role of William Wallace fits Mel Gibson perfect: heroic, romantic but always in a down to earth kind of way. Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack are lovely from their first appearance until the end of the film and Patrick McGoohan gives the most despicable (this is meant as a compliment) interpretation of an English King ever seen. This movie you can see over and over again and it never looses his magic and it is a movie you can watch with men and women as well: Men will love the great staged battles and women will love the lovestory."

I'm sorry the latter had such a short role as her beauty captivated me very much. All the characters in Wallace's ""army"" are fun to watch, too.<br/><br/>For those a bit queasy with bloody violence, this is not a movie for you. There are lots of gory action scenes that includes limbs being hacked off. This is not a film for the feint of heart. The only objection I have to the violence is the ending. Seeing a man tortured is not my idea of entertainment. I now fast-forward through that part but otherwise thoroughly enjoy the rest of the three-hour film, an ""epic"" adventure, if there ever was one.<br/><br/>The most memorable scene in the film, for me, was not any of the action scenes but just the absolutely stunned look on Gibson's face when he discovers his trusted ally was anything but that. To discover that the key people in the country that you are fighting for are not backing you must have been indescribably crushing to, although since this is the movies I don't know how accurate this was to the real story.

","Someone really missed out on a good story here. The William Wallace story is exceptional so why do Hollywood have to ""improve"" it and turn it into a second-rate, overlong mess of a film? How can you have the Battle of Stirling Bridge _without_ the bridge? Producers have claimed that the bridge ""got in the way"". Funny, the English army discovered that too. And why demean the hero by having him up against such a pantomime villain - sure Edward was a twisted b*****d, but the filmmakers might as well have given him a sidekick called Igor and have him cackle at choice moments throughout the film, he was that unsubtle. Most importantly, however, it seems a real shame that it should be this film that should have captured the hearts of the Scottish nation, they deserve so much better. Would you believe there is now a hideous statue of Mel Gibson at the foot of the Wallace Memorial in Stirling? Would you believe people are leaving flowers beneath it? This film is a travesty of both a good story and history itself. Scotland deserves so much better."

"Jakethemuss","9","76","143","27 November 2005"," Wallace's courage is inspiring
","This epic tale of patriotism, love and conflict opens with a birds eye view which takes you through mist and air out onto an open loch with scenic mountains in the background. This is accompanied by stirring bagpipe music, and shortly by the start of a narrative by Robert the Bruce.<br/><br/>After a short introduction of a young William Wallace, involving his fathers death and his first step into warrior-hood, we are taken to present day England where Edward Longshank's tight rule over Scotland is getting increasingly harsh. Enter a fully grown Wallace (a rugged long-haired Gibson) who is back to start a family and a new life. He soon meets Muran, a girl who he remembered from way back. He and Muran fall in love and shortly get a private nighttime marriage, as a public one would result in the 'Prima Nocte' rule being enforced.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, one of the English soldiers controlling their village confronts a scared Muran and forces her into a quiet spot. William leaps to Muran's rescue and all hell ensues. The commanding officer executes Muran promptly for assault on one of the King's men as she bit him whilst defending herself. She was supposed to meet William at a secret spot after she was rescued but was knocked off the horse.<br/><br/>William returns to the village on horseback to give himself in, but he has other plans. The uprising that ensues is one of the most pulse racing and exciting fights that has ever graced the silver screen IMO. This is the spark that starts off the Scottish revolution for freedom. Soon, other clans join Wallace, then whole towns stand by him. He soon finds himself on the fields of Stirling for a real showdown. I thought I'd give you the first hour in a nutshell, the rest of the movie revolves around Wallace, Longshanks and the Queen of France as they all fight for their own cause.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are ground breaking and upfront, the senses of comradeship, love, patriotism and courage all take a stand throughout the film. The music adds further to the epic, be it sad and haunting tunes, or strong and stirring bagpipe anthems. Wallace is portrayed as a beacon of strength and power, not to mention a much honoured leader. Sometimes Gibson takes his character a little too far, but the title Braveheart is one that is implied to Wallace's qualities. The films dramatic and moving ending is a good finish to a superb and powerful film."
"ma-cortes","8","20","33","7 February 2015"," Epic recreation about a notorious Scottish hero who purposes to free his country from the tyranny of Edward I
","In 14th Century Scotland, when his secret bride is executed for assaulting an English soldier who tried to rape her, William Wallace begins a revolt and leads Scottish warriors against the cruel English tyrant , the nasty ruler Edward I (Patrick McGoohan)the Longshanks (as he was called ""The Longshanks"" -long legs- since he was uncommonly tall for a man of the time , Edward I was at least 6 feet, 2 inches) who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself , ruling Scotland with an iron fist and succeeded his effeminate homosexual son Edward II Prince Edward (he was indeed the first English prince to carry the title Prince of Wales, although he did not marry Princess Isabella until 1308, after both Wallace (1305) and Edward I (1307) had died) . As William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. There took place several battles such as Stirling , York (though the sacking of York was invented for the movie ,Wallace never got as far south as York during his invasion of northern England) and the famous Battle of Falkirk (July 22, 1298), in which the English army was personally led by King Edward I, who decisively defeated the Scots , the real-life King Edward I was a military genius who learned combat tactics while fighting the Mamelukes during the Eighth and Ninth Crusades . There also appears Robert the Bruce , though many Scots were offended by the film's portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus McFayden) , who is considered a National Hero of Scotland . <br/><br/>This epic movie contains thrills , emotion ,romance , breathtaking battles and being based on historical events . However , some reviewers often cited as the least accurate historical epic of all time and more than 90% of the movie is fiction. This is the classic story about confrontation between good guys , the Scots , versus bad guys , the Sassenachs . A simplistic and pure tale with rude stereotypes and offering a stew of Hollywood clich√©s , being overlong but well played and directed by Mel Gibson . Interesting script by Randall Wallace , this screen-writer had been visiting Edinburgh in 1983 to learn about his heritage when he came across a statue of William Wallace outside Edinburgh Castle; he had never heard of the 14th-century figure who shared his name but was intrigued enough by the stories told to him about ""Scotland's greatest hero"" to research the story as much as possible. The film was heavily fictitious but Gibson claimed the changes had been made for dramatic purposes , he also admitted he had always felt he was at least a decade too old to play Wallace. Impressive production design , including thousands of extras , a majority of the actors and extras in this film were actually Irish - members of the Irish Army - although they are supposed to be Scottish or English, as many as 1600 were used on a given day. The film is very crude and brutal , including bloody battles , strong tortures with disembowelment provoking brave grimace and violent scenes as when Edward I threw his son's lover out of a castle window was particularly criticized for inciting homophobia , the lover was based on Piers Gaveston, who was allegedly Edward II's lover. Colorful and glamorous cinematography by John Toll , showing marvelous outdoors , including glamorous opening shots , snowy peaks , silvery lochs , dark mists and many other things . Evocative and sensitive musical score by James Horner ; despite the film being set in Scotland, and based on the life of a Scottish folk hero, the primary instrument heard throughout the soundtrack -most notably at William's father's funeral- are the Uilleann pipes, which are a smaller traditionally Irish version of bagpipes rather than the ubiquitous Great Highland Bagpipe.<br/><br/>This motion picture was very well directed by Mel Gibson and he picked up two Oscars for Best Film and Best Director ; though this film has been accused of promoting Anglophobia. Mel said that was influenced by various classic and historical flicks , among the films Gibson watched in order to prepare to direct ""Braveheart"" were Polanski's ""Macbeth,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Chimes at Midnight,"" ""Alexander Nevsky,"" ""A Man for All Seasons,"" ""The Lion in Winter,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" and ""Throne of Blood"" . Rating : Better than average. Worthwhile watching . The picture will appeal to Mel Gibson fans ."

"pwfinch","1","204","423","13 February 2007"," Medieval superman takes on evil empire in revisionist epic
","Shockingly one-sided portrayal of real, tragic events that left thousands of innocents dead on both sides of the Anglo-Scottish border.<br/><br/>Previous historical epics have dealt very maturely with the subjects of conquest, rebellion, repression, etc - 'Spartacus' being one good example, 'El Cid' another ¬ñ so for that reason alone, this self-indulgent, schoolboy fantasy rates as a big disappointment.<br/><br/>Basically, Mel Gibson throws the history book away, and makes Scottish knight William Wallace into a Geronimo-like hero, constantly on the run, constantly outwitting (and brutally slaughtering) his cruel, pompous, haughty, tyrannical, cowardly, ignorant, 'pagan' (!) enemies. Rarely is it mentioned that the real guy killed anyone who understood the English tongue, and often skinned and burned alive his prisoners ¬ñ many of whom were taken during Scottish raids into England (yes, it happened both ways, though this film would have you think differently).<br/><br/>Does it work? Sure it works, on a very simple level. The scenery is lovely, the battles are probably the most convincingly filmed to date (though if you look closely, you'll see that they mainly consist of brawny Scotsmen bloodily butchering screaming, squawking Englishmen). But it does work. It's pacey enough, it's entertaining and it has as raw, gutsy feel.<br/><br/>If, however, you're like me, and you prefer at least a little bit of historical accuracy, then it's a dog's breakfast. To begin with, the armies Wallace led are portrayed in the movie as poorly-armed highlanders, whereas in reality they were lowlanders, easily as well equipped as the English armies they fought. The battle of Stirling Bridge was decided by the collapse of the bridge under the weight of the English cavalry, most of whom then drowned in their armour. The Scots did wreak some butchery, but mainly on the small infantry vanguard who'd got to the other side ¬ñ the English 'heavy horse' were never involved. At Falkirk, the Irish didn't side with their fellow Celts (they despised the Scots), and though the battle was indeed won by the English because the Scottish nobility fled the field, Wallace also fled ¬ñ how else did he survive? The characterisation is extraordinarily weak. Gibson himself, though his performance strikes a convincingly muscular, patriotic note, speaks in modern Glaswegian and sports blue woad and Celtic plaits that predate the Dark Ages never mind the Middle Ages. Sophie Marceau's beautiful French princess is totally one-dimensional as an abused innocent (in truth she was a scheming harpy, who later connived in the savage murder of her own husband and then an attempted coup). Patrick McGoohan (who steals the show for me ¬ñ at least he gives his character some charisma), concentrates mainly on the stern, unyielding side of Edward Longshanks ¬ñ we don't learn that he founded Parliament, or revised countless laws for the benefit of the underclass, etc.<br/><br/>It's a big missed opportunity. The same story could still have been told, painting Wallace as a hero, depicting Scotland as an oppressed society, but a bit of balance and political back-story would have made it much more interesting and, dare I say it, more adult.<br/><br/>It sill works, but only the way a pre-1960s cavalry vs Indians western works: as a bit of rousing fun, anachronistic in a more educated age."
"classicsoncall","10","15","24","13 September 2014"," ""Every man dies. Not every man really lives.""
","This movie is almost two decades old now and as is often the case with blockbuster films, I'm just now getting around to seeing it for the first time. My timing is kind of serendipitous too because Scotland will be voting on leaving the UK next week on September 18th, 2014 as I write this. It's pretty much a toss-up on how it goes, though whatever the outcome, the geopolitical consequences will be felt for a long time.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson and Kevin Costner are a couple of names who frequently find themselves involved in controversy for their projects. In recent years, Gibson has been at the center of some embarrassing personal exploits, but there's no denying he's had a major impact on film making with movies like ""Braveheart"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"". Both films offer an epic sweep and are cinematically dynamic. The battle scenes in ""Braveheart"" are among the most expansive and realistic as you'll see anywhere.<br/><br/>But as with most historical films, and I've learned this all too well by now, what you see is not necessarily what the world got at the time. I don't think such departures from accuracy are always meant to be made for the sake of revisionism, nevertheless they detract from a film's educational value. So one's approach to ""Braveheart"" probably ought to be made from the standpoint of an epic period drama with it's attendant personal stories thrown in as human interest. That's what you have here with this Best Picture winner and the award is well deserved on that score. Personally, I have my doubts whether the Scots ever mooned the British at the Battle of Stirling."
"teacherlogan","10","19","32","23 February 2007"," A Great Epic; one of the best
","On the surface Braveheart is an epic film of medieval warfare. A band of Scotts, lead by William Wallace, surges against a cruel and unscrupulous King. They get farther than they should, but ultimately fall short of their goal of a free and independent Scotland. But this movie is far more. It is a story of the human spirit. It is a testimony to the power of conviction; that drive and desire can achieve more than strength of arms. The simple belief that Right triumphs over Evil is the center of Braveheart. As a result, it bands us, as the audience, together for the common good; victory.<br/><br/>William Wallace is a compelling historical character because it was never his intention to be a freedom fighter. He left his homeland as a small boy amidst family tragedy and spent many years abroad. He returns to Scotland a new man. He is smarter than his brethren, not that he flaunts it. Initially, we do not see an idealistic Scottish rebel. He is a simple man with simple desires; to live in peace and raise a family.<br/><br/>Circumstances make that impossible. The circumstance of living in an oppressed country makes a simple life unattainable. This leads to tragedy, which leads to rage. Rage leads to conflict, which leads to victory. Victory leads to purpose. This is where the movie takes shape. The movie takes shape when Wallace realizes that his purpose is no longer exacting revenge. He is meant to lead an uprising.<br/><br/>Braveheart, for all its battle scenes, is a political picture about a desire for ""something better"", as Wallace describes it. He has seen his people suffer. He has seen the Scottish people accept their place as a second class society and settle. There is no belief that this will ever change. While the uprising begins as a product of revenge, we get the sense that Wallace's initial actions are just an outward expression of the misery all of Scotland is feeling. They're ""Mad as Hell"" and their not going to take it any more. And while the pen may be mightier than the sword, in 13th Century England the sword was the only means some people had. Scotland needed the courage and will to stand up and fight. Wallace gave them that.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is at the forefront of Braveheart. He starred in and directed this picture. While he was rewarded by the Academy with Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, his acting role as William Wallace cannot be overlooked. Braveheart is, after all, the story of William Wallace. It could not have succeeded without a tremendous performance from the film's leading man. Mel Gibson was not nominated for his acting, but should have been. He captured the spirit of Wallace. His rousing speech at the start of the first great battle is now a classic in cinema. A scene in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is eerily similar. Every scene he commanded. He not only earned the attention of the characters on screen, but of the audience as well.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a masterpiece. The rolling countryside makes for a beautiful backdrop. The battles are like expertly choreographed ballets. The meetings in the great halls have an ancient flair. Every set built is detailed and breathtaking. Costume, lighting, make-up; everything comes together flawlessly. In a world where computer effects are used so rampantly, Braveheart still has the feel of a classic epic project where every detail is given expert personal ""hands on"" attention.<br/><br/>Epic pictures are a credit to film-making. They are many times very big budget productions with a lot of extras, a lot of props and a lot of details that need to be accounted for. To make a great epic is to get everything right at the same time, take after take. Braveheart is one of the best of them."

"alainenglish","Null","32","61","26 April 2004"," Simplistic but superlative action film (spoilers)
","Those who lambast Mel Gibson for his supposedly anti-Jewish sentiments in his recent production ""The Passion of the Christ"" would do well to remember his anti-English, and indeed anti-gay, portrayals in this otherwise superlative action film.  Gibson's epic, bloody romance was never meant to be a factual account of Scottish legend William Wallace, but has stimulated more interest in the real thing than a mere documentary ever could.<br/><br/>Set in Britain in the 13th Century the plot, based largely on myth about the Scottish renegade, sees a young William Wallace (James Robinson) witness the brutal murder of his father (Sean Lawlor) at the hands of English occupiers. He is taken under the wing of his wise Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox) and grows up under his guardianship.  Wallace (now played by Mel Gibson) returns home an educated man, falls in love with a beautiful local girl Murron (Catherine MacCormack) and marries her.  However, when English soldiers rape and murder his wife, Wallace mounts a rebellion, bringing him into conflict with both the English King Edward Longshanks (Patrick MacGoohan) and duplicitious Scottish nobles, led by Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFayden)...<br/><br/>The film makes no effort whatsoever in regards to historical accuracy, and the the characters come off (with variable success) as simplistic stereotypes.  There is nothing wrong with most of this, but some stereotypes could have been avoided, in particular the portrayal of King Edward's son as a snivelling homosexual fop.  By necessity the English are the villains, with the Scots either passionate warriors or double-dealing nobles. Whilst the anti-English sentiment is a touch overdone (a character exclaims ""Excellent!"" when he's told he'll get to kill the English), it doesn't seriously harm the film.<br/><br/>Gibson has thankfully not Americanised his tale by asking American actors to assume fake Scottish brogues.  With the exception of Gibson himself, almost everyone's accent here is natural and the film is better for it.  Gibson delivers his all as Wallace, managing a passable Scottish accent.  His Wallace is a Scottish Mad Max, only savvier, more sentimental and with a powerful patriotic streak.  The character, though, lacks the ambiguity to make him a realistic personality.  The film sees nothing questionable in Wallace invading England, effectively lowering himself to the level of his former oppressors.<br/><br/>As for the supporting players, Patrick MacGoohan quietly evinces menace as the ruthless King, and Sophie Marceau makes the most of her limited role as the Princess of Wales.  Angus McFayden gives a sympathetic portrayal of a torn Robert the Bruce, and Brendan Gleeson and David O'Hara provide solid backup as Wallace's trustiest allies.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in the film are frenetically staged, with lots of quick editing plus copious amounts of blood and gore.  They are well put together, but the endless slicing, dicing and skewering becomes repetitive after a while.  Woven into the tale is a gentle Celtic score by James Horner.<br/><br/>Whilst it has stirred interest in Scottish interest and heritage (including the life of the real William Wallace), taken on its own terms, ""Braveheart"" is an enjoyable action film and should not be taken any more seriously than that."

But I do insist on credible - don't insult my intelligence with a pantomime villain and romanticised plot developments. William Wallace was the father of Edward III? Give me a break, Edward II having other um, 'interests' doesn't mean he couldn't father a child, or that his wife is likely to sleep with Scottish outlaws.<br/><br/>As for Edward, the ruthless, brilliant strategist and general; getting his archers to fire on his own forces in a m√™l√©e - yes that must be how he was so successful a military commander.

"hitchcockthelegend","10","21","38","6 January 2010"," Historical flaws aside, Braveheart is a rousing spectacle.
","So it comes to pass in the year of 1995 (not a year of our lord I think) that Mel Gibson would craft the award winning epic that is Braveheart, a film that is historically bent in the extreme, that is directed by a man who would go on to have a less than favourable character reputation, and a film that has a heavy handed approach at times. It's also as choppy as a boat ride during a tidal wave, so yes, Braveheart is far from flawless folks. Yet the structure, the epic emotional swirls and sheer spectacle of it all marks it out as a rousing treat.<br/><br/>It's a lavish gargantuan epic that somehow seems out of place for the year it was made, perhaps the secret of the films' success is because the 90s were crying out for an epic to get us hankering back to those halcyon days of Spartacus et al. Or just maybe the film punched the buttons of the public psyche because it is a great and grand thing to see the little people rise up and kick some ass? The oppressed and the bullied strike back as it were, surely that theme works for the normal human being? It's a sweeping tale that involves love, loyalty, honour, dishonour, treachery, death & heroes and villains. In short it ticks all the boxes for the genre it sits in (clinical bloody battles superbly full on). Gibson is William Wallace, and although he may struggle to nail the Scottish accent to fully convince at times, he more than makes up for it with his verve and vigour when delivering his lines - with the Sons Of Scotland speech at Stirling a particular iconic highlight.<br/><br/>Patrick McGoohan is pure egotistical villainy as Longshanks, King Edward I, and the supporting cast also do sterling work (or should that be Stirling?). Brendan Gleeson, Tommy Flanagan, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen, and the wonderful James Cosmo all add flavour to the delightful scotch broth on the screen. The score by James Horner is appropriately tight to the themes at work in the piece, and the cinematography by John Toll was rightly awarded at Oscar time since he captured the essence of the film. Be it the lush rolling hills or the blood stained field in the aftermath of battle, Toll's work is critically in sync with the unfolding mood of the picture.<br/><br/>So yes, damn straight, flaws and all, pic has the ability to lift and inspire many a discerning viewer. It does kick you at times, but as it does so, it also emotionally engages you from start to finish - to which the film deserves every accolade and award that it won. Because the grandiose epic had seemed long gone, but Gibson and his army brought it back to the modern era and made a genre piece fit to hold it's head up high with the greats of years gone by. 10/10"
"freemantle_uk","1","141","322","29 March 2008"," Awful, AWFUL Film
","I hate Braveheart! As an Englishman and as a history student I am insulted by this film. It is obvious that Mel Gibson has a hatred for England and Britain as whole and Randell Wallace only looked at a basic history of the Scotland war and I mean really basic!<br/><br/>The film is about William Wallace's rising against the English in the late 13th Century. They are many historical inaccuracies in the film. I can understand minor things just to make the story flow better but Braveheart takes the biscuit. William Wallace was a minor noble and he wouldn't have lived in a shack, and most of the Scottish nobles in the film also were living in poor conditions which was not the case. Scottish nobles were well-off and wouldn't have been must different to English nobles. Many Scottish nobles tended to own land in England as well as Scotland. The film make out that England had invaded and occupied Scotland for a long time, what really happened was Edward I wasn't too interested in Scottish affairs at first and he was later invited to help the Scottish to solve the crisis in picking a new king. However, Edward I became upset when his ally he made king tried to flex his muscles. Braveheart also makes out the Scottish army ran around painted themselves blue and defeated a superior army with ease. The Scottish army in the late 13th century wouldn't have been much different to any army in Western Europe and would have been as well armed and armoured to as the English army. The only different between the English and Scottish armies were the Scottish army was more infantry based whilst the English army was more calvary based. I personally think this film is pretty insulting to Scotland as well as England! William Wallace would not have fought for revenge or freedom but for his own personal interest, believing he would have got a better deal any an independent Scotland then under semi-English rule. They was no idea of nationalism or the nation-state in the medieval period. As well as already mentioned many Scottish nobles had land in England and many had English names like Campbell. The film also ignores that William Wallace was also a brutal man, not some heroic revolutionary. They are other things such as the Battle for Stirling Bridge was not fought at a bridge and that it was implied that Queen Isabel was in love with Wallace and that he fathered Edward III, which couldn't have been possible because at the time Wallace's death Isabel was six-years-old and lived in France. Some people have praised the acting in the film, I ask why? I don't think its anything special. Mel Gibson's performance wasn't particularly good, and only Sophie Marceau stood out to me. Edward I was a one-dimensional villain, showing he takes joy out of violence and death, in real-life he was an experience commander, but he was no different to any other Christain king at the time. William Wallace was a simple man who was driven to going to war, against this did not happen. Prince Edward was effeminate, weakly wimp: he was bisexual and not a good military commander, but he was not weak willed and he couldn't have lasted in medieval society if he was effeminate. He was also famous be being a fit man. The portrayal of Prince Edward was homophobic.<br/><br/>This was a hate-filled movie that shouldn't have been made. If it was made as a fictional film set in an made-up country it would have called unrealistic. This was a weak film and should not have won Oscars for best Director or best Film, the Usual Suspect was hundred times better and should have won those Oscars. The only good thing to come out of the film was some good action and the costumes of the English army. But this is not enough to save this film and people have seen Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace for what they really are for making films such as the Passion of the Christ, Apocalypto and Pearl Harbor. If you have any taste at all don't watch this film!"

The film goes nowhere towards motioning that the Scottish invaded England constantly in their spare time, this is the reason for England invading and taking over.<br/><br/>I'm surprised the king of England didn't have a hump.

","I saw this for the first time recently and wow.. I was very impressed! It's not perfect and the good (Scots) against the evil (English) is a bit too black and white. What I mean by that is that the English and King Longshanks are historically portrayed as completely cruel and evil. I know some of the history and in spite of being English myself I think the Scots had every right to defend their land and fight for independance. The film just makes out all the English characters to be comic bad guys and the Scots, of course, the good. I am not saying there were no bad English, I just think the real history would have been more conveluted. But I am not one of these anoraks, that pick out the helmets being the wrong diameter. It's entertainment and it serves that at a premium throughout. There are few boring parts in this great film.<br/><br/>Patrick McGoohan, in what must have been one of his last roles (RIP), is brilliant as the dry humored nemesis to Mel Gibson's William Wallace. I think the sets and the filming was all done superbly. You can really feel that wet Scottish landscape & the art director deserves praise. The action scenes are also excellant and very gritty. They use a lot of close ups of faces and nasty pointy weapons. This really makes you feel among the battles. None of the Alan Ladd-esque pantomime violence. There is plenty of blood and guts and soldiers (as in reality) not simply keeling over and being whisked to heaven. But lying in agony, painfully waiting for the reaper. This gritty style has been copied since. But this, along with Kenneth Brannaghs Henry V were among the first wave.<br/><br/>Charecter development is second to none. You really feel for the characters, I liked big hamish. A slightly simple, but good natured Scottish giant. When his father is cut down in battle and he weeps, it really resonated with myself.<br/><br/>As I said before the action and film direction is top notch. Yes the history is not as black and white. Yes Longshanks is a bit of a pantomime villain. But you can still take in most of the timeline of important events. Including the fact that Wallace was tortured horribly once caught. His severed body being sent to the four corners of England.<br/><br/>Well worth a look if you haven't seen it and like me, an old fashioned bloke that loves action and beautiful women (love interests)."

Also princess Isabelle was 6 at the time and in France.

"jdkraus","10","15","27","12 July 2006"," The Best film of all time!
","There are many criticisms about how inaccurate this film is to the real William Wallace. But i have to say to the by-the-book historians to shut up and enjoy the greatest film ever made! Braveheart is obviously about William Wallace's tale against the English in the medieval days. Mel Gibson's direction is beautifully done, with countless aerial views of the fair land of Scotland, which pulls the viewer into the film's romantic vision of a wonderful land and gives them all the background information you need to know about the land, with the help of the cinematography by John Toll. The music composed the famous James Horner fits the vision with a powerful flow that deepens the story into something amazing. <br/><br/>Now, Mel Gibson plays the legendary role of Wallace in such a believable performance that is up there with Russel Crowe's for Gladiator. The accents may jump around with his tone when he speaks, but his voice is firm and strong for the role, as is the rest of the cast which were all excellent. Patrick McGoohan portrayed Longshanks very viciously and as a hateful villain. Sophie Marceau is the stunningly attractive, but naive lady who is drawn between country and what she truly believes in.<br/><br/>The best part about the whole film though, is the two epic battle sequences that are not choppy, nor has the shaky camera like so many other films nowadays do, avoiding all the blood and gore a battle really contains. This movie surely rubs it in your face, and is needed to make what these men believed in, for what they were fighting for...freedom! it had to be as realistic as possible, and not to mention the slow-motion images again by John Toll, the sound mixing, and the uplifting score of James Horner, which makes them all the more intense and moving.<br/><br/>And last but not least, the film, despite all the art it values, it has a great story that is powerful and stands strong alone. it is easily my favorite film, and is the best one ever made. I am incredulous that IMDb holds it at #93 on the top 250. It should be at least on the top ten. If only more epics were made this way, Hollywood would not be in the mess they are in."

Now, a little older and wiser the main issue I have with this movie is; it is a work of fiction masquerading as fact. You can't search William Wallace on the internet without it making reference to Mel Gibson's character. The movie is littered with blatant one sided inaccuracies; However I'm not going to list them here; many of the reviews have, so read some of them because I don't want to add spoilers. I realize a lot will be thinking I need to lighten up a little and just enjoy it as a movie... but Hollywood, it is NOT your history to be re-writing. How would an American audience react if the British made a movie about Vietnam, or the American Civil war, or the Indian Wars, and then depict all the American inaccurately as lying, murdering, rapists cowards. There wasn't a single honourable Englishman amongst them. As far as I'm concerned this was a missed opportunity to tell the story of William Wallace accurately while still making a great movie. William Wallace is a national hero to some in Scotland so to retell his story inaccurately is an insult to the ancestors of both sides.<br/><br/>Freeeeeeeeeeddddooooommmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!

Although against the best recommendations of British historians, millions of Americans still view this movie as accurate history.  Thanks Mel - you've rewritten in 3 hours a nation's history that took thousands of years to form.  Some strange facts about this fiction were that the English king actually spoke English, as did his soldiers, who themselves identified as English, when historically you're looking at a would-be further Norman conquest further into Britain.  Also, it appears that many Americans, and now many other nationalities (thanks Mel) seem to think that Scotland and Britain are separate entities.  If ever there is a Braveheart II, which portrays Scottish raids and invasions into pre-Norman Northumbria, Cumbria, Yorkshire, which shows how the Scots conquered the English city of Edinburgh and made it their capital, which awakens in 50 million Irish Americans a sense of their English heritage (hahaha), I'd watch it.  Trouble is, Hollywood doesn't make those sorts of reality films as they're just too real.  The English as victims?  Perish the thought!"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","10","17","28 June 2014"," History brought to life in a mesmerizing and brutal way!
","Fighting for freedom an't always go the peaceful Gandhi way. In order for true freedom in brutal times to come as peaceful as possible, revenge was essential. During the 13th century a war hero from Scotland named William Wallace experienced the cruelty and corruption the English enforced on the Scottish. Violence, corruption, rape, and rule were all used to take complete advantage over the Scottish until Wallace started a powerful rebellion to become a war hero and lead the Scottish to fight against the English in order to restore freedom and peace. William Wallce's incredible story is shown through the eyes of director Mel Gibson. Gibson envisioned the history of the tension between the two United Kingdom provinces beautifully, as he captures groundbreaking film-making to portray a biography and historical film like no other film has ever gone. Every shot is so intriguing and relevant to the story. The film-making aspects such as cinematography, setting, costumes, and editing are superbly made to make the history come to life. The filming of the Scottish highlands is magnificent and beautiful and really gets a feel of what warfare in the 12th century looked like. Historical films can often be dragged out and too biographical to tell a story as if it came from a history book. Writer Randall Wallace gives great background that is timed perfectly and developed the struggles and inspirations for William Wallace that leaves Mel Gibson to direct and portray William Wallace beautifully. He nails the Scottish accent! As for themes, freedom is a virtue that is a gift! Freedom is something that is a privileged to have and should be fought for if needed. Gibson and Wallace also get the message of fighting for anything. Not violently like William Wallace had to, but fighting in any way in order for good outcomes to be released. This is a classic film that is one of the best of the 90's, and is the greatest historical biography film ever directed."

","IMDb Review<br/><br/>Brave heart Mel Gibson ‚Äì William Wallace Catherine McCormack ‚Äì Murron Sophie Marceau ‚Äì Princess Isabelle Patrick McGoohan ‚Äì King Edward Longshanks <br/><br/>Theme of Brave heart I believe is FREEDOM. The movie starts with young William Wallace watching his father and brother go speak about peace with King Edward. So come back but William Wallace father and brother have died in fighting. William's uncle picks him up after the funeral and teaches him to use his head before teaching him how to use his weapon. William comes back to start a normal peaceful life however he is drawn to a woman name Murron. They secretly marry to avoid having to share her with an English Nobel lord of their first night of marriage. They hide their marriage but when she is attacked by an English solider William defends her and tries to ride off together and meet up, but Murron never showed. Her throat has been cut and now the English wait for Wallace to come to them. Wallace does just that killing all soldiers of England in the village. He inspires others when just wants to be alone to fight. However more and more people will join in his fight. William Wallace even draws the attention of Princes of France , which is the wife of King Edwards longshanks son. Wallace even wins heart heart and her body. Even though it seems William Wallace doesn't know but she is pregnant with his child and not the kings son. Wallace wins many major battles and takes the fight to England attacking YORK. Some of the fight scene reminds me of 300 or Spartacus battles where they run full blast into each other. The Camera angles in the battle scenes and motif of rainy weather, weary soldiers, make you feel the pain of being the underdog. At the height of battle he is betrayed and almost killed. Trying to build the trust with the next king of Scotland and rebuild his army through alliances, the father of the king betrays William and is captured. On the deathbed of the king (which cant not speak) the soon to be queen whispers to the king that she may kill William Wallace but his line will live on and the kings line will die with his son. She then lets the king know she is carrying Wallace unborn child. He is tortured and his last words are FREEDOM. Through his death he inspired more people to fight against the English."

","Just doesn't get any better! This is a truly worthy film of a best director and best film Oscar, cause apart from Se7en and Murder in the First this is the best film of 1995 worthy of an Oscar (not counting action vehicles and sci-fi here, cause they are not going to get an Oscar for best film). The actors are all great, up front of course is Mel Gibson himself as William Wallace but there are other great actors in here. For instance (I believe it was) Tommy Flanagan as the crazy Irishman, Angus MacFayden as Robert the Bruce and of course Sophie Marceau as princess Isabelle. Here I really must compliment the casting director or whoever it was who picked these people. The best thing though about the characters is yet, that you feel for them and with them, especially Mel Gibson of course. This film, it's direction and it's music a few times really brought tears into my eyes and I'm not ashamed to say, that in the end I cried (not what you'd call crying, with sniffing and stuff, but yes, tears rolled and my nose became all runny.<br/><br/>What makes this film such a treat for young and old, is that it contains everything that makes a film worth looking at it for three hours. It contains comedy, romance, revenge, brutal war scenes (which is the only thing you may dislike here), betrayal and a good and basically true story about a freedom fighter in time in which his homeland was brutally ruled by the British. OK I know most of the surrounding plot is probably made up, but that's what is so great, uniting a true story with fiction and there is nobody around today, who can tell you how it really was, so let your imagination rule and be not too rational.<br/><br/>What I also liked is that in this film you get the sphere of being in middle age. There are for instance saga's told about Wallace that make him 7 feet tall and say that he slaughters men by the hundred's. Also this film has a great moral it tells us that freedom is one of the most important things in life and that it is not treasured enough by those who have it and don't know what it is like living without it. Also there is something that can be applied to this time also, and that is that everyone dies, but not everybody really lives. These two things ought to be bared in mind by many people on this earth.<br/><br/>A great feature of Gibson's directing career, although it is only his second and a masterpiece that follows well in the footsteps of the good and underrated The Man without a face. I urge Mel Gibson, to again direct a film and make it at least as good as the past two. I know he will, cause he takes his time on choosing his director projects as you could see, cause Fahrenheit 451 still has not been made until today and is now I presume officially cancelled although it had been planned for about 2 or three years.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","Congratulations to all concerned with the making of this excellent film.  I can only think of words of praise. The background set in the highlands of Scotland with its gripping scenery in the barbaric 13th Century brought both the realism and conditions under which people who lived in those times had to endure.  The film did not rely on gimmicks, but pure storyline and professional acting.  Even the brutality of mediaeval warfare was handled with accuracy and not used to shock but to portray reality. Essentially based on the power of love,freedom and national pride, Mel Gibson takes the character from the boy who sees his father killed, his new wife murdered and his country controlled by a foreign power through Scottish nobles who were only concerned at protecting their own selfish interests and survival. For me it was the last scene when Wallace endures public torture and death before giving up his principle - the importance of Freedom which embodies everything that drives the human spirit.  Again an excellent film.  This is what film making should be about.  I look forward to seeing the sequel."

","Where shall I start? How about the French princess? She was only 12 years old at the time. And it is ludicrous that William Wallace was the father of Edward III. The Irish could not have changed sides at the Battle of Falkirk for the simple reason that they were not there. Edward I did not order his archers to shoot his own men in the back. They had already discharged their arrows before battle was joined. And that final wild charge by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn, when everybody knows that the Scots fought defensively arranged in schiltrons armed with long spears.<br/><br/>And the English armour? Some of it looks more like birdman costumes. The archers have better helmets (basinets) than the infantry, while their bows are just branches with the bark stripped off and a piece of twine attached. Looks like the film makers reached the bottom of their purse with the archers, because they couldn't kit out the English army's Gascon crossbowmen, who are conspicuous by their absence on Falkirk field.<br/><br/>The English may have been guilty of some atrocities, but prima nocte was not one of them.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I won't.<br/><br/>But I suppose Shakespeare took liberties with history too. And they call him a genius!<br/><br/>Having said that, Mel Gibson makes a believable Scotsman, and James Cosmo is terrific as Campbell, and I liked the princess's oversexed maidservant. Also brilliant is Patrick McGoohan. His scene where he throws that guy out the window is the best bit of the film.<br/><br/>I know this film stirred up a bit of Scottish nationalism. I don't have any problem with that, but if you are going to get worked up, get worked up over the facts.<br/><br/>I should know: it's MY country. It belongs to ME."

What Mel Gibson tries to teach us from this film is how much of a hero that William Wallace was in real life at the time he was alive.

There's no excuse for this. If you want to make a hack/slash film, either make the characters fictional or make them at least kind of historically accurate, not neither. William Wallace and the princess didn't even exist in the same time period, let alone fall in love. What the h*ll is going on here? The film itself really isn't bad.

","Why is Braveheart regarded as a great movie? It's a serious question.<br/><br/>I'll grant the soundtrack is fine - probably the last effective work by the now increasingly insufferable James Horner.<br/><br/>Aside for that, Braveheart belongs with Gladiator and Titanic to the Hall of Fame of ""Bafflingly popular, but nothing special"" pseudo-historical movies (and I'd argue it's the weakest among those three).<br/><br/>So, why is this great? Characters? Set-pieces? <br/><br/>The human drama is laughable. Director Mel Gibson and writer Randall Wallace never met a clich√© they didn't like. The true historical events would be interesting enough without spicing them up with nonsense; see the fictional romance between Wallace and princess Isabella, something so mawkish it would make a soap-opera writer blush with shame (note that the real Isabella was about ten years old when Wallace died).<br/><br/>Characters are painted in broad strokes: Wallace = flawless hero, giving Gibson the chance to play the umpteenth messianic figure of his career; Edward Longshanks = Satan, with Patrick McGoohan having a blast as the moustache-twirling villain; Isabella = romantic princess yearning for real love, so lovely Marceau can make puppy eyes at Gibson and have ludicrous ""Oooh, he looks so hot!"" chats with her handmaiden. The only one who is given some depth is Robert Bruce, allowing Angus Macfayden to walk away with the movie. <br/><br/>Other low points include the racism inherent in making every British character a sneering monster and the odiously homophobic portrayal of Edward II - who was just a little boy at the time - as an effete, mean-spirited buffoon (think how the murder of his lover is played for laughs!). <br/><br/>Battle scenes, while featuring a certain visceral intensity, are not great. There is no sense of complex tactics or spatial relationships; Gibson's notion of medieval warfare seems to be ""people running and screaming"". Incidentally, swords are MELEE WEAPONS. They cannot be thrown at a great distance with a whirling sound to impale an enemy far away... unless you are in some cheap sword and sorcery flick.<br/><br/>The funniest thing about these battles, though, has to be our heroic Scots using both face paint (which was a Celtic practice hundred of years BEFORE) and kilts (invented much LATER). It's the equivalent of a WWII movie with soldiers carrying both medieval armors and iPods. However, while ridiculous, this is a non-issue compared to clich√©s and paper-thin characters.<br/><br/>Still, this is per se a watchable flick - just don't try to sell it as the next Lawrence of Arabia. <br/><br/>6/10"

That Wallace killed off half of England screaming FREEDOM! all the time because some jackass killed his wife. Pure nonsense, I'm telling you.<br/><br/>Secondly, all the action scenes were filmed with this horrible shaky handy-cam view to give you the feeling you are 'in the battle'. This is the point were I really lose all my interest. Why would you make blurred shots, that shake all the time, if it does not truly enhance the visual style of the movie in any way at all? Of course you're not in the battle! And even if you were, you wouldn't shake like that all the time! Honestly, get a clue.<br/><br/>Then the acting. Good god, all the drama and nonsense. I really hate the overacting they sometimes put in movies. It was okay in Lord of the Rings, but here it was dramatic. Bland expressions and faces, people getting angry for no proper reason, no person in the movie tried to say something a bit realistic like: let's try to think out a normal solution instead of fighting in terrible greyly coloured landscapes. No,everyone was screaming, and/or looking as stupid as possible.<br/><br/>This movie lacked so many things, was so gray and boring, overlong and with a lot of irrational actions, I really disliked it.

The blood and gore of the battlefield, the glorious Scottish highlands, the medievel castles and villages.<br/><br/>Gibson thoroughly desrved the Oscar for best director, the imagery and camera work is stunning.  While the direction itself is not innovative it is far more than merely effective.  The battles are well depicted, using thousands of extras.  A personal highlight is the depiction of the battle of Stirling as for the first time in living memory cavalry is defeated by infantry.<br/><br/>The dialogue feels great to listen to, and the plot is cohesive and flows well.  While the movie could quite easily down without the Princess sub-plot - it does add to the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson takes the lead role with a fire that was absent in some of his other historical work, for me the pick of the acting is Angus McFadyen as Robert the Bruce, the young would be king torn between yearning to follow William Wallace into the teeth of hell, and the brutul common sense of his ailing father.  A young man yearning to be a warrior while being forced to become a politician.  Also veteran British actor Patrick McGoohan is a joy to watch as King Edward the Longshanks.

","''Braveheart'' is one of the greatest movies I already watched in my life. Really, it will be hard to find the exact words to write a review about it, but I will try. It's the story of the Scottish hero William Wallace,and Mel Gibson, even being older then the expected for the role, is great as director and actor, and I think this movie totally deserved to have won Best Cinematography,Best Picture and Best Director.<br/><br/>The movie itself has many MANY inaccuracies. Things like kilts were not worn by the Scottish and British soldiers had no uniform during that time,the fact that the Princess Isabella never met William Wallace and was 8 years old when Wallace dies, prima noctis never happened, Wallace died before Edward I and the blue body paint for battles had stopped being used 800 years before the events of the film are some examples. But I think we cannot be very angry with this, since William Wallace's records almost doesn't exist, and many of the facts were taken largely from an epic poem by a man called ""Blind Harry'', who possible wrote many things that never really happened.<br/><br/>I think this movie is a masterpiece, even that the real connection with Scotland from about 1280 to 1305 is not right.

"matthewpr06","1","44","99","15 April 2008"," Not Such A Brave-heart
","watched Braveheart for the first time in many years recently and it's fair to say that I was genuinely surprised by how utterly and irredeemably bad this movie actually is. If you need reminding it won a whole host of Oscars way back in 1995 (including Best Picture). <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson, not just because he hates me, but because he really doesn't float my boat in a dramatic sense. I think Braveheart is a really good film¬Ö to highlight his chronic lack of on screen charisma and the notable absence of any real acting ability (that doesn't involve looking solemn or crazy). His performance in this movie is almost a parody, at points I felt like I was watching something from the people who made the likes of Date Movie etc. (which incidentally is probably a better movie than Braveheart!). <br/><br/>Mel's lack of charisma and ability are just two of the reasons I dislike this movie. There are however many other reasons. Firstly we are supposed to accept that it is perfectly fine for William Wallace to express indifference at the English occupation so long as his wife is with him. When wifey has her throat slit by an evil Englishman (more on them later) suddenly Wallace catches the highly infectious 'freedom at any cost' disease. He gets rival factions of Scottish tribes together and with no real chance of victory, he murders the English and drags his countrymen into a evidently and ultimately futile war in which thousands will perish and all to avenge the death of his wife; whose memory he abandons/desecrates half way through the movie when he sleeps with Princess Isabelle (who of course finds his ruggedness irresistible). <br/><br/>Wallace is portrayed first as an abject coward unwilling to oppose oppression and then as a selfish madman who gets off on butchering people with a large variety of obtusely shaped metal objects, and finally as a man-whore who can't keep his genitals concealed under his kilt for more than 5 minutes. And we are supposed to believe this man is a hero and that his acts are heroic? Come on! <br/><br/>Now I'm not really that fussy when it comes to historical inaccuracies in Hollywood movies; however I think artistic license is probably taken a little to far in this movie, particularly when every English character is represented as an inept, bloodthirsty, paganistic murderer and every Celt as a loyal, rugged, family orientated, God-fearing freedom fighter. Also Gibson, as director, seems to present, with the Prince Edward character, homosexuality as either a) a weakness or b) as being part of a type of madness. Seriously, this is straight from the Rambo textbook of social and geo-political representation. In other words; the complex Anglo-Celtic relationship is dumbed down so much that it becomes a laughable parody of a serious and interesting subject. <br/><br/>On a technical level Braveheart also falls foul of anything resembling a coherent narrative structure. As I have mentioned, Wallace's motivations are at the very least muddled, at worst incompressible. One event (usually a big battle or a shot of Mel's arse, or Mel stood on a mountain, or Mel holding a sword, or Mel giving a monologue about those pesky Jews, sorry English) leads to another with no real logical progression or explanation or fathomable reasoning. It's like watching a movie with every other scene missing. <br/><br/>Overall, I would love for someone to explain to me why they like this movie because I'm totally baffled as to why anyone would."

Group 1 are the people (i'm ashamed to say often my fellow Americans !) who write ""this film is great and is about how the Scottish beat the British"" this may be a small point but Scotland is a part of Britain as is England. Therefore the Scottish were not fighting Britain and anyone who writes a review featuring that statement is well worth avoiding. Group 2 are the people who will mention the historical accuracies. Whether or not you read those reviews is very much up to you. If you want mindless entertainment dont bother with them. If you want educating read away as you might learn something.

Firstly Edward I behaved no differently to any other monarch of the time in protecting his interests. He was arguably the most effective ruler during a turbulent period of civil war in England itself. His son, the unfortunate Edward II was lucky to have outived his father at all, the crown had to be protected at all costs. The Scots as well as the English perpetrated some terrible deeds, but this was typical of the time and practices such as 'breaking on the wheel' continued in France into the 18th Century.<br/><br/>As in most conflicts no party had a moral high ground. It was inevitable that Scotland would become a vassal of England, in the same way that France was eventually enlarged. At the time Wallace may have represented an ideal of Clan freedom and independence but the Nation State was already becoming the currency of power within Europe. <br/><br/>A more balanced and investigative approach would have yielded more satisfying results and left a less bitter aftertaste for viewers of an English disposition. <br/><br/>I"

","Review: This is one of those types of movies which will give you the 'good goosebump' feeling after watching it. It's a typical epic that details a certain hero fighting against all odds for freedom of his/her country. Although the story is pretty typical, its ability to entrance you in it is not. Not many movies are able to accomplish this. Mixed with a powerful musical score (which also won Best Score at Academy Awards for information sake), the movie delivers an amazing experience to viewers satisfying epic lovers, and action seekers. Acting by Mel Gibson is spectacularly superb (he has an edge since he IS partly Scottish). It loses 0.5 points however due to the constant playing of the musical score in some situations which do not seem to fit well with it. What many people complain about is that it is historically inaccurate, I don't remember this movie being brandished with a ""True historical story"" or even a ""Based on a true story"" logo.

So much for 'Freedom'. More like ""I can't control my temper and the English are after me,so I'd better get some help"". He was about as popular with the Scots nobles as he was with the English.

"FilmSnobby","3","25","53","14 November 2004"," Long-winded; simple-minded; ultimately disturbing.
","I had liked Mel Gibson's *Braveheart* a bit better 9 years ago when I first saw it; but that was 9 years ago. 9 more years of experience in both life and movie-watching has revealed to me this film's inadequacies upon a re-viewing on a TV broadcast.<br/><br/>Gibson shows no particular talent for framing, camera placement or camera movement. Blocky, centered compositions dominate. Like all amateur directors, Gibson relies on slow-motion to increase the significance or suspense of a scene. There's one particularly egregious sequence in which Gibson's Wallace, returning to a village in which he attacked some English soldiers, SLOWLY approaches some infantry who are ready to take him into custody. One soldier's chain-mailed hand SLOWLY takes hold of the harness of Gibson's horse. Gibson SLOWLY raises his arms above his head. Gibson SLOWLY reaches behind his back for his weapon. Gibson SLOWLY bashes the soldier's head in with the weapon. Look -- this is really incompetent film-making. A good director, in order to increase suspense, would find NARRATIVE solutions to achieve his aim, rather than simply assume that slowing the film's speed to a crawl will put us on the edge of our seats. Slow motion: the hallmark of lazy, unimaginative, and incompetent film-making. *Braveheart* is riddled with it, to the point that the entire film seems to consist of it. Run the film at normal speed, and the movie's no more than 2 hours long . . . and it would also become abundantly clear that there's not much to this simple-minded epic, after all.<br/><br/>There's certainly very little complexity here, an unforgivable sin, in my opinion, for a historical epic. We're given to understand that King Edward the First feels that he needs to subjugate Scotland in order to create a united ""Greater Britain"" against the competing imperial aims of England's Continental neighbors (particularly France), but why make such a comically satanic figure out of this character? ""My greatness will be better demonstrated when Scotland lies in ashes,"" Patrick McGoohan hisses -- all that's missing is the villainous chortle. McGoohan functions as a sort of Evil Stepfather in this castle-and-moat fairy tale. It works both ways, as well: because the English are such slave-masters, any and all terrorist tactics against them by Wallace's army of Highlanders is meant to be applauded. They burn forts, slit throats, lay siege to York (""When we invaded York, you would not support us,"" Wallace reprimands a council of Scot nobles), send the head of York's commander, via a basket, to London, trap English soldiers in a wooden hut and burn them alive . . . all for ""freedom"". Gibson and screenwriter Randall Wallace (no relation to the subject of the film, presumably) manage to find nothing contradictory about all of this. Acts of murder are Bad when the English commit them, Good when the Scots commit them. However, perhaps unconsciously realizing the murkiness of this type of morality, they give Wallace an added motivation designed to checkmate those who question if murder is washed clean by patriotism: the English brutally execute Wallace's wife (married to him secretly in order to avoid Longshanks' proclamation of ""prima noctis"") on a trumped-up insurrection charge. Therefore, Wallace's butchery is sanctioned by a divine sense of retribution above the laws of men. One unforgivable act makes a thousand revenges forgivable. Such ontological morality is as easy as it is totally insane.<br/><br/>It's not Christian, either -- but Gibson has demonstrated with his most recent film, *The Passion of the Christ*, a religiosity that's not merely misguided, but mired in ignorance and neuroses. He conflates his own masochistic impulses with that of Christianity itself. In *Braveheart*, we get a foreshadowing of his *Passion* in the sequence in which he's tied to a wooded cross and tortured. (Though the cross is laid out horizontally, we get the heavy-handed point.) In Gibson's theology, spiritual transcendence is achieved when your body is getting cut open. ""FREEDOM"" is the triumphant battle-cry after your entrails are piled in a steaming heap. Only through pain suffered in its extreme can true victory, and therefore happiness and peace, be found. Watching one man's pathologies play out in such a public manner -- e.g., a major motion picture -- is a merely pathetic spectacle; more alarming than that is the ecstatic response this sort of thing has received from the movie-going public. Both *Braveheart* and *The Passion* were big box-office hits.<br/><br/>Well, the battle scenes are still pretty exciting, and have been justly imitated over the past decade. For that reason, and that reason alone, *Braveheart* earns a generous 3 stars out of 10."

Braveheart is one of those ilk and as a Scotsman and student of history, I can't get past the blatant revision of important events in a vain attempt to make up for a terrible script, distinctly average direction and an accent that would get you killed if you used it in any bar in Scotland.<br/><br/>This film is rescued by some great cinematography, but there is really no need to redo the story of William Wallace, as the truth is every bit as dramatic as this pandering to an American audience's need for the hero to be a glorious warrior for justice and almost without sin.

Character development is poor; you meet card board cut outs of people but you never seem to connect with any of them. He has all the Celtic nations represented with the thickest accents they are able to muster splattered in woad and draped in fur but little is mentioned about their motivation they meekly follow offering nothing. The battle scenes while well done, don't leave you routing for them, they just wash away in to the back of the battle scene. Although Gibson seems to take particular pride at portraying any English man as either twisted and evil or weak and effeminate, what happened did the Queen forget to send him a Christmas card?

","someone previously attacked the English for being Norman/Saxon in origin and for being invaders. That is a very simplistic view of things. For a start William Wallace himself was descended from a minor Norman lord. Does this mean he too was an invader ? most of the lowland Scots had Anglo-Saxon blood in them. The easiest way to view Englands invasions is that England was a potentially powerful nation but as long as it had enemies who were able to mount serious raids (and often did) She could not influence the world. it is no coincidence that when the British Isles were united they went on to forge the greatest empire the World had seen. So when you slam someone for being proud of Englands military achievements bear in mind that those military achievements laid the base on which the cultural achievements lay."

","Mel Gibson, instead of stirring up trouble in the UK, should instead go back to his own country and perhaps make a film about Aboriginal oppression and their struggle for land rights. The Americans love this movie because it is a simplistic and factually incorrect representation of freedom fighting that they think fits in with their own struggle against the British. Why are we always the bad guys?<br/><br/>Britain abolished slavery before America, Britian has the oldest democracy in the world, yet we always represent the evil West so the Americans dont feel guilt. Anyway, onto the film... Factual inconsistencies: The English king outlived William Wallace and the Queen only gave birth YEARS after Wallace died. The portrayal of the homosexual prince as weak and incompetent is completely offensive and probably inspired by Gibson's sense of machismo. The homosexual men of the Roman Empire were weak, weren't they? No, no they were not. Much is made of English cruelty but when the Scots sack York no mention is made of English suffering in the film. The fact is, life in those times was cruel, and the Scots would gladly have enslaved the English if they ever got the chance (Mary Queen of Scots, anyone?) This film is over-sentimental, predictable and depressingly obvious. I gave it 1 out of 10 and was thoroughly bored when watching it."
"TheLittleSongbird","4","17","35","3 September 2010"," Visually stunning with a wonderful score, but deeply flawed
","Before you flame me, I tried to like this film, I really tried. While it does have its strengths, and far from the worst film ever made, it is deeply flawed, and no it is not just the historical inaccuracy.<br/><br/>I'll start off with the good things first. Braveheart is very well made, the scenery and landscapes are beautifully realised and the cinematography is beautiful. The music is absolutely wonderful and gives plenty of dramatic and emotional weight, easily one of James Horner's best scores. The battle scenes are very well staged, while James Cosmo, Brian Cox and Sophie Marceau among the cast do good work.<br/><br/>However, to say this film is inaccurate historically is a understatement in itself. Granted I am no historian, but I took an interest in the subject and even I could tell that any history text-book was literally thrown out of the window. Like I said with The Patriot, the inaccuracies are the least of Braveheart's problems. How about the hackneyed dialogue, the uneven pacing and the stodgy story? And don't get me started on its presentation of some of the characters, especially King Edward I, and sorry but homosexuals being stereotyped as wimpy and effeminate didn't bode well with me either. While some of the actors did a good job, some didn't do so well. Mel Gibson, who I personally don't care for though he has done some films I like, did a better job directing than acting. Here he comes across as very monotone and his hair doesn't fit the period I don't think. Plus he reminded me too much of Mad Max. Patrick McGoohan didn't work for me as Longshanks(King Edward I) either. McGoohan certainly was NOT a bad actor, I loved him in the Columbo episodes he guest starred in where he plays one of the more interesting murderers, but he overacts quite wildly here. It doesn't help that Longshanks has been turned into a sneering clich√©.<br/><br/>All in all, not completely terrible but a deeply flawed film and I am sorry but I didn't care for it. That said, I can understand both viewpoints, there are those who love it and Braveheart certainly has some great assets to it, but there are also those who dislike it for its presentation of the characters and its ""distortion"" of history, both of which are understandable. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

I have only cried for 2 movies, and almost cried for another two. The almost crying one was when Don Corleone died in THE GODFATHER and when Morgan Freeman met Tim Robbins on the beach in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. The other one was when Kong died in KING KONG. And then there is BRAVEHEART.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is stunning. Mel Gibson was made for this role, he puts his heart and soul into Wallace. I believe William Wallace was possessing him during the ""Sons of Scotland"" speech before the Battle of Stiriling. That's how convincing he was. Brenden Gleeson and David O'Hara give great performances as Hamish Cambell and Stephen. O'Hara in particular lightens up the movie by being silly after battles.<br/><br/>The score is very moving.

"vanhail","9","7","12","10 April 2006"," The epic story of William Wallace
","Around 700 years ago, the brave Scotsman named William Braveheart Wallace rose out of oppression by the tyrannical and pagan king Edward Longshanks of Briton, and united the people of the north (Scotsmen, Celts, Irish, and Picts included), driving the English out of Scotland and onto their own lands. Mel Gibson's portrayal of this warrior was next to perfect, he showed savagery, compassion, love, and hatred, all key elements held by any true Scot. During the fight scenes, he showed the heart of a warrior, and in the many love scenes, showed his deep and everlasting adoration for his deceased bride. During the opening of the Battle of Stirling, Mel gave the speech that would set in place the standards for many movies to come, including Aragorn's speech before the Battle of the Black Gate in LOTR: The Return of the King (this only includes the actors actions, as it is obvious that this speech was already told in J.R.R. Tolkeins book). The true brilliance of this movie ends with the remarkable and heartbreaking torture and then execution by means of beheading of Wallace, and then the narrator telling the prologue with scenes of Robert the Bruces army preparing for the final battle against the English, that would result in Scotlands freedom from British rule. The final scene shows Campbell (Brendan Gleeson) hurling the legendary Wallace claymore into the battlefield, sticking into the soil, representing the separation of Scotland from England, and an eternal reminder of the great deeds William Wallace did for his country and his people."
"NEFARlOUS","1","26","60","18 July 2001"," Enjoyable romp but oh, the inaccuracies!
","This is a well-constructed film with many fine performances - I truly enjoyed it the first time I saw it. In fact I enjoyed it so much, I was curious to find how much of it was true - unfortunately very little.<br/><br/>There are too many inaccuracies to list here, but I will limit myself to a few main ones:<br/><br/>1) Robert the Bruce was no traitor. Portaying him as such is quite   simply wrong and disrespectful to his accomplishments - particularly in Bannockburn (a far more tactical affair than represented in the film. ) - his father, who did not betray Wallace either and was not a leper - and his memory as a whole. Confusion with John Balliol perhaps? Or deliberate ""artistic licence""<br/><br/>2) The Irish fought against the scots - not just during this period but also for the next two centuries - and the crazy Irishman character in the film is the only truly annoying one in the entire length of the picture.<br/><br/>3) Edward the second (Longshank's son) was 13 years old during the time portrayed in the film and his bethrothed was 5.<br/><br/>4) Mel is about 11"" too short - Wallace was exceptionally tall and usually wore metal armour.<br/><br/>5) His followers were not a bunch of wild men from the hills - the majority would have been kitted out very similar to the English irregulars.<br/><br/>6) Wallace's first kill was not in retribution, in 1291 the son of Shelby, an English knight with control of Dundee Castle - approached Wallace in the marketplace and demanded his dirk. Wallace stabbed him through the heart although he was much larger and his opponent had no weapon drawn.<br/><br/>7) Wallace continued attacking anything (or anyone) English - Soldier, commoner or merchant. In Lanark he fell in love with Marion, who was 18 years of age. This did not stop him from attacking the English in Lanark, a battle during which he and his men fled back to Marion's house and continued to fight there before escaping. Unsuprisingly, Marion was put to death as an accomplice. Wallace returned to Lanark during the night where no guard had been kept (foolishly), killed the Sherrif in his bed, killed his son and then burnt everyone else in the house to death, including women and children. By the time he finished in the town, 240 people were killed, armed or unarmed - only the priests were spared. (Wallace almost ended up in the priesthood)<br/><br/>8) The battle of Stirling. During the filming, Mel was asked by a local why they did'nt film on the original site. Mel responded saying that he felt that the bridge would get in the way. Ay - said the local, That's what the English found....<br/><br/>9) Who in reality betrayed Wallace? Sir John de Mentieth, one of his friends.<br/><br/>This film could have been so much more, without losing ticket sales - never mind....."

We see the pain in the eyes of our friends, who are watching us dying....and the last word...FREEDOM.

","Right, firstly, it truly scares me that the majority of people actually think this is a good movie. It makes me question my belief in democracy quite frankly. To all my ""fellow Scots"" who seem to think this film defines our supposed ""struggle"" against English ""oppression"" should realise that it is actually about Mel Gibson's personal anti-English vendetta. I do believe in an independent Scotland, but I feel that this film is more of a hindrance than a help to this cause, because it makes it easy to label those of us who hold this belief as racist idiots. Anyway, the way I see it, the ""bad guys"" if you look at the history of this period is that the English aren't necessarily our enemies, it's the feudal lords of Britain in general. Why is it that this film hasn't caused a class war? I'm getting off the subject anyway. My advice to all these people who say this movie is ""inspiring"" and scream ""freedom"", no doubt while wearing a Jimmy hat, is that they should get off their fat arses and do something about gaining independence for Scotland, if they truly believe in it. Otherwise, shut up about it being such an inspiration."

Will see highs and lows of relations that too in the era of kings-politics. Rebel dies and his last word- Freedom, that's enough to stand against the wrong. Believe me a long speech before war- we have seen it all.

It remains one of the handful of movies that he will watch over and over again.

","To be fair, viewed as a cinematic project, this was good with very realistic battle scenes and overall landscape. However, from a historical point of view, it is utter tripe. On 25 January 1308, Edward II married Isabella of France, yet the movie purports to have Wallace impregnate the princess of Wales at some point before he died while she is married to Edward II. Yet the 'fact' is, Wallace was executed three years before the Princess was even married. Given that the princess didn't give birth until 1312, that must have been one heck of a gestation period, 7 years to be exact. Also, at the battle of Stirling, or more accurately 'The Battle of Stirling Bridge', Wallace did not defeat heavy chivalry using lines of disciplined troops carrying long stave's. He defeated the English because the English were forced to cross a narrow bridge, and once penned in, they were easier to kill. This was compounded by the rout into the cavalry and the collapse of the bridge leading to many troops drowning. Wallace was a guerrilla fighter, not a strategist. This might have been a great movie if Mel Gibson had kept to the truth, as it is, it is a seriously marred piece of sensationalist anti-English hokum that would be more at home as a work of fiction that one supposedly based on fact."

"Wulfstan10","5","9","17","11 March 2005"," Crude and Inaccurate
","This film is thoroughly overrated. i saw it when it first came out and have never liked it. I shan't spend much time on it, but there are a few key issues that I think seriously hurt this film.<br/><br/>It is violent in an unnecessary, and exceedingly crude manner that adds nothing of value to the film. It is not artistic and serves no valid purpose. I have no problem with violence, even graphic violence, per se, but it should be done artistically or at least serve some purpose. Good examples are Saving Private Ryan, which was, needless to say, exceedingly graphic and disturbing, but there was a strong point to it all. Similarly, Reservoir Dogs had much violence, but it was well done and had an artistic purpose. The Wild Bunch is another example of violence that serves artistic purposes and is used to make valid points. Here, the violence has none of that and it is simply off-putting.<br/><br/>Another serious problem is the extreme license that Mel and the others take with history. I don't expect films to be totally truthful or accurate with history and facts, but there is a limit and this goes far beyond that limit. With some of his films, Mel certainly seems to be on an anti-English (here) or anti-British (elsewhere) crusade and he takes it to unrealistic and unfounded levels. There is also too much nationalism/patriotism here in a way that is anachronistic for the time, even allowing for natural sentiments against invaders or assuming that a nascent nationalism was in fact arising in the British Isles at the time. Moreover, the events themselves and the portrayal of the characters (like Edward I as some sort of Hitler/Stalin-type) are often very inaccurate. He portrays the English as Nazi-like sadists while failing at the same time to reflect the fact that people in general (not just invading English) back then tended to be a little freer with human life, etc., so that torture or execution, while perhaps angering people, was not exactly an unusually barbaric thing at the time. To top it off, the whole thing between Wallace and the princess Isabelle, with the film claiming that Edward II's offspring (presumably the future Edward III) was in fact Wallace's son, is absurd. There is simply no legitimate reason for any of this."

"SlipGun","2","15","32","11 September 2004"," Energetic and well produced, but why praise it so much?
","First off, unlike most reviewers who give this a lukewarm or low rating, I'm not interested in the politics of this movie. That said, what's up with the reviewer who said the only people who dislike this film are thin-skinned Englishmen? I certainly am not one.<br/><br/>People here have praised this film for it's acting. Mel Gibson's 'Scotsman' would be a poor attempt at serious acting, if it weren't for the fact that he seems to realize that the role is far above his abilities and so he plays it, literally, as a cocky 1980s American action hero in a medieval British setting. The story reads like it was written by someone who read a book called ""Shakespeare 101."" The themes are laughably simple: Freedom! Love! Fight for your country! - but to his credit, this is just the sort of one-dimensional fluff Gibson directs so well. The images and music may be stirring at first, but the schmaltz is so thick this film does not stand up to repeated viewings.<br/><br/>Two years later came another big-budget overproduced 3-hour 'epic', with similarly simple themes - this time though, with the love angle at the forefront. It won some of the same Oscars and even had a score by James Horner. That film was Titanic and just like Braveheart, it was well done and just 'worked' for many people. But over the years people were smart enough to look beyond the surface and see it for what it was - a childish, poorly written story that just looked and felt right. Why have so few been able to do the same for Braveheart? The answer: It's violent and bloody enough for people to think they're watching something important and life-changing. I could say the same for Gladiator.<br/><br/>That said, Braveheart is worth a viewing, but it certainly doesn't deserve to be rated an 8 or have a place in the top 250. It's just Hollywood cheese at it's best - and worst."

","Why this passable but completely forgettable film has apparently garnered a reputation as a classic in the last decade is beyond me. There's really not much to write home about here. <br/><br/>There's no complexity or levels or anything, just good vs. evil, fight fight fight, freedom freedom freedom. Gibson, of course, is as limited an actor as he's ever been. His corny pre-battle speeches have become wildly popular, to the point where you might be fooled into thinking they constitute great moments in cinema, but in actuality they're somewhere above Bill Pullman in ""Independence Day"" and below Al Pacino in ""Any Given Sunday"" on the scale of dramatic pep talks. And in case you're wondering, no, that's not a prestigious slot to be in.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to say it's unwatchable like ""The Patriot"" or anything--it's OK. Probably about as good as, say, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."" But I don't think anyone who's seen a real epic with real actors would consider it anything special. This is a classic example of how the Oscars can inflate the reputation of undeserving movies in weak years (see also, ""Gladiator, The"")."
"Alanfrize","Null","13","27","22 June 2004"," A travesty
","Complete and utter dross. The film decides to bypass the actual story, and go along with some made-up rubbish that Randall Wallace came out with. It's interesting to note that the film originally hired Professor Tom Devine of Glasgow University as the historical consultant, but then sacked him because his version of what happened (based upon the facts) was completely different to what Randall Wallace was spouting.<br/><br/>As to the film itself, Mel Gibson's accent is execrable, and that's just the start. Other problems occur - the Scots wear Woad and tartan - the earliest recorded wearing of tartan is in 1595. Woad had disappeared not long after the Roman invasion, over 1,000 years earlier. They also wouldn't have had the plaids or Great Kilts - these don't appear until the latter years of the 16th century.<br/><br/>The film takes more liberties with historical fact than is good. The battle of Stirling Brdge is moved onto land without the Bridge in sight. At the end Robert the Bruce throws William Wallaces' sword onto the field, and Scots charge in. Yet Wallace had introduced the use of 'Schiltrons', which were huge blocks of spear men, and which were instrumental in Scottish victory at Bannockburn.<br/><br/>All in all, terrible. If you want a good film about Scottish history, watch Rob Roy with Liam Neeson. While it has many mistakes, it doesn't try to portray itself as fact."

It is overly long and not well paced, it is exceedingly simplistic. Some of the battles are so unbelievable they grate.<br/><br/>But it has a beautiful woman, beautiful scenery, then-novel grittiness, and likeable star, The scots have an appealing attitude, transformed for modern tastes. It is photographed competently and edited expertly. All of its art resides in the Peter Weir tradition of multiple speeds of the camera superimposed on multiple paces in the edits. I guess that's enough to garner tickets and awards. But on seeing this a third time, one notices how thin this scaffold is.<br/><br/>But I suppose it is much better to have a visual awareness and some character in the images than not. Mel is not an intellect, simply an energetic man in show business, but I do give him credit for trying on Hamlet and here working on a visual awareness.

","A stunningly beautiful move that has no historical merit at all Mel Gibson has won the adulation of the world and most importantly the Scots. It captures the honour of the Scots. By today's standards the stereotypes are all in there. The prejudicial Irish, the dastardly English King so if your easily offended stay away from this film. But this film is about landscape, tragedy of lost romance and lots and lots of bloody violence. The action and costumes alone is what makes this film incredible. The movie is a giant re-enactment of ancient Anglo- Scottish rivalry. All Gibson did was point the camera at a beautiful countryside and have fun. So it is a truly exciting film."
"cdjh-81125","10","5","8","13 October 2016"," A Masterpiece That Pulls No Punches
","As a proud Scotsman I can easily say that Mel Gibsons Braveheart is without a doubt one of my all time favourite movies and one of my favourite best picture winners. By far the most common compliant I see about this movie is the fact that it isn't very historically accurate, well the film is not a history lecture you can only judge the movie itself and I support any changes they made to this movie from real events as it makes for an extremely compelling story. The story of Braveheart is simple William Wallace (played perfectly by Mel Gibson) leading a rebellion with his fellow Scotsman against England and its King Edward I. It's a story that's impossible not to get behind because it's all about freedom and from fighting for equality. The violence in this movie is bloody and gory but not in an unnecessary way it serves a purpose of truly showing the way in which the battles, rape and torture scenes took place. Mel Gibson took home the Oscar for Best Director for this film and it's very well deserved he knows just how to film the action scenes just right to put the viewer right into their situation, he succeeds just as well in front of the camera as well because I believe that to this day this remains his best performance he knows exactly how to portray Wallace's internal turmoil, unwanted fame, inspiration attitudes and overconfidence. This movie does not paint Wallace as a perfect man there are scenes where he recklessly puts himself and others in danger to settle his personal vendettas and anger and in that regard this movie is very accurate to real life. The late Patrick McGoohan is excellent here as King Edward he strikes just the right balance between imposing menace and brilliant strategist and is always a pleasure to see him on screen. Peter Hanly is also fantastic as Prince Edward because while he does and excellent job at being a hateful character it's really not as simple as that he's got a character character arc to him that shows him feeling unimportant and struggling to cope with failures and living up to his fathers legacy. The scene of Wallaces execution is one of my all time favourite scenes in a movie it is just such a heartbreaking and inspirational scene that never stops giving me chills. Braveheart could have easily be a simple war film but it's got excellent characters with excellent arcs and motivations and succeeds just as well when it comes to the battle sequences delivering some of the best I've ever seen. I will fight anyone that calls this Masterpiece underrated: A+-100%"

","words cannot explain how in love i am with this movie, i had chills throughout the whole 177mins including the credits- there was just something about the way those names rolled down-. movies are no longer made like this unfortunately this movie had a message and a purpose to it beyond just entertainment. its a true story following the life of a man named Williams Wallace and how he goes about fighting for Scottish freedom from king Edward also known as longshanks who had invaded and conquered Scotland. i have watched this movie at least 5 times and one of the perks is you learn a bit of history and that the freedom we have today didn't always exist and its thanks to people like Williams Wallace who were willing to fight and die for the cause that we have such freedoms in this day and age. my favourite part of the movie would definitely be the part where Mel Gibson screams freeeedom! that was both orgasmic and chilling i don't know why so don't bother asking. coming in as a close second was one of the speeches he gave to the scotts men before going to battle where he didn't try to sugar coat the situation, number wise they were screwed. anyways if i this review has not convinced you on why you should watch this movie then....i dunno i just don't like you now."

"ScottAmundsen","5","5","8","4 March 2012"," When Director and Star are the Same Person, the Results are Often Disappointing
","Generally speaking, it is not a good idea for an actor to double as both director and star of the same film. Orson Welles did it, and was good at it, but he was a special case. And Jodie Foster had a qualified success with LITTLE MAN TATE, but her character was on the periphery of much of the story.<br/><br/>With BRAVEHEART, Mel Gibson, an actor of exceptional presence rather than talent, has bitten off more than he can chew, and the result is a bloated and overlong mixed bag of moments, some quite good and others simply dreadful, rather than a coherent film.<br/><br/>This highly fictionalized biopic of 13th century Scottish hero Sir William Wallace is, almost predictably, at its most engaging when it is dealing with things that either never actually happened or are not in the historical record. The first hour of the film is the most compelling part: Wallace as a child (James Robinson) loses his father in some unspecified act of war; after the burial, his uncle Argyle comes and takes him to someplace in Europe (Rome?). During the funeral, a little girl, who cannot seem to take her eyes off William, approaches him and hands him a flower.<br/><br/>Years pass and Wallace returns to Scotland, fully grown and played by Gibson, intending nothing more than to settle down and raise crops and a family. To that end he seeks out Murron, the girl who gave him the flower, now a lovely young woman who still carries the memory of Wallace, who also remembers her and wants to marry her. As a token, he gives her the flower, which he has kept all this time.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in England, King Edward I is scheming to conquer both Ireland and Scotland. He decides to reinstate primae noctis, a custom whereby an English nobleman may have sex with a newlywed woman under his rule, as a way of subjugating the Scots, whom he fears are getting too rebellious. (This is the movie's first big goof: the English never used primae noctis in Scotland.) Wallace and Murron marry in secret to avoid the English, but Murron is acccosted by one of them anyway; he attempts to rape her and she fights him off; Wallace puts her on a horse and she attempts to escape, but she is caught and her throat cut before Wallace can do anything to stop it.<br/><br/>The funeral scene is quietly devastating. Gibson's finest moment may well be when he falls on his knees before Murron's father, who had not given permission for the marriage. The older man clenches his fist for a moment, then gently places his hand on Wallace's head as the young husband and the parents grieve together.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the rest of the movie is nowhere near as good as what has gone before, and worse, there is too much of it. We've already been watching for over an hour; Gibson decides to drag it out for two more, and most of the two ensuing hours contain protracted battle scenes and a lot of milling about. There's a subplot involving the English king's supposedly homosexual son (Gibson's homophobia is a bit obvious here; the Prince and Princess of Wales actually managed to have children) and his young wife, who appears to form a relationship of sorts with Wallace (this also never happened since the king's son did not marry until both the king and Wallace were dead).<br/><br/>That's probably the worst thing about this film; Gibson plays fast and loose with the historical facts because he wants to sell tickets, and the result is an overly commercial film obviously designed to showcase its star and attract the sort of audience that likes war movies.<br/><br/>I don't understand the Academy sometimes; this isn't a terrible film, but it certainly wasn't a candidate for Best Picture. In fact, once his young bride is killed and buried, a good portion of the rest of the film is one big yawn."

The simple fact that the main character was played by an American actor was the first thing that really got on my nerves. But even if you were to ignore that the sheer number of Irish actors who were supposedly putting on ""Scottish"" accents just added to the insult. The problem with this is that it is so blatantly pandering to the American audience that it ruins the film for any Scottish person who managed to avoid being caught up in the awful attempt at inspiring some level of patriotism in Scotland. Also looking at the ""most helpful reviews"" I found it laughable that the main people hailing it as ""educational"" were in every single case American and will have absolutely no insight into this whatsoever. <br/><br/>The incredible level of narcissism which shows through almost every aspect of the film from him playing the main role to him twisting events so that the only two female characters end up having sex with him despite the fact that one of them was actually a child at the time that this took place. <br/><br/>The thing that i find quite uncomfortable with this film is that Gibson tries to hand off his own homophobia to portray the Longshanks' son as a negative character simply because he is gay despite the fact that it was most likely not even true and that any reasonable person would be perfectly fine with this. <br/><br/>One final point is that the name ""Braveheart"" which is supposedly given to Wallace was actually a name for Robert the Bruce which perfectly illustrates the inaccuracy of this film despite it claiming to be factual.<br/><br/>P.S sorry if this turned into an angry, incoherent rant but this film is truly an infuriating piece of filmmaking"

","The film may have a memorable quote. It may have a well known actor. But that in my mind does not redeem this film. Here Mel Gibson pushes forth quite extreme prejudices, showing Anglophobic and Homophobic ideas. The Film has a very black and white morality and the villains are quite one- dimensional. It badly alters history, exaggerating what the British did. The myth of Primae Noctis was established by this film. The chronology is quite poor, Isabella was nine when Wallace died and Edward III was born seven years later. William Wallace committed some atrocities in his fight for 'Freedom' and raided England. You could make a good film out of this by showing the moral dubiousness of his actions, but instead a quite one-sided portrayal is given. Not only does it install bad ideas but it increases a quite negative stereotype of the British. Not all Americans think like this, but such films reinforce the stereotype of them thinking in such basic terms. I feel that this film has often been overrated, even as a film it can be quite poor. The only joy the film give me is venting out my rage at those who tarnish history."
"stuart-halliday","4","8","15","9 January 2012"," Hollywood History
","Having watched this film for the first time (we had some Scots friends staying and they wanted me to see it) I have to say that I was not especially impressed. Having read some reviews calling it the greatest film ever, I was surprised by how inadequate it was in terms of the production. The battle scenes gave full opportunity for Mel to vent his hatred of the English in graphic form (I bet he wished the swords were real!) but I still found it largely lacking in both sentiment and reality. Oh, I know we complainants are constantly exhorted to look on this as a film (i.e as a fantasy and not as a documentary etc), but I'm afraid can't, entirely. There is a strong political subtext and message in this film which does have modern implications for people in the UK. For these reasons alone, we do need to take it seriously. I think the effect that the movie has had on people, especially as regards the liberties taken with historical characters, concerned me a lot more than the film itself. The opinions appearing in some of the reviews reinforced my worries.I was really concerned by the way people seem to have established very fixed opinions about events and characters of which they admittedly know little, apart from the information they are given in the course of this film. This is totally bizarre. History seems to be the only academic discipline in which this occurs and which is accordingly trivialised to such an extent. Few people would take such liberties with a topic involving other subjects - Science or medicine,for example. Some of the opinions about Edward I, for instance, are quite extreme - 'epitomy of evil','monster' 'tyrant' etc. Don't you think people should maybe do a bit of further reading before applying such epithets? Edward I deserves better than this pathetic bit of character assassination. He was a strong medieval King -intelligent, personally brave, ruthless, learned, pious and a positive and faithful husband (both his wives absolutely adored him). Like most people, his character was a mixture. Most of his successful counterparts, Phillip IV of France and Robert I (the Bruce) of Scotland were equally determined and certainly just as cruel when the need arose. If we're talking about more recent comparisons I think Abraham Lincoln might well fit the bill. Lincoln was basically a good man, but was driven to extremes by the political position in which he found himself. Like Edward I he was equally determined to protect his country by the establishment (or re-establishment) of a state of union, and definitely was, despite his wit and geniality, equally ruthless in achieving what he saw as necessary for the good of his country. I do realise that this is a film and that films need heroes and villains. That's fine as long as they are mythical villains such as Lex Luthor or the Riddler; my point is that if you want to assess a proper historical character, and publicise those assumptions on a public forum, maybe you should do a bit of background reading and not base your opinion entirely on a highly biased, third-rate Hollywood epic"

","This movie is the best movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It's a combination of several things that made this movie so epic for me. First of all, the uniqueness of the story is what made me love seeing this movie over and over. The story of William Wallace has got to be the most heroic and captivating story I have ever seen. What amazed me is how from the beginning to the end, William Wallace fought for his freedom and for his love. He yearned for a peaceful life after years of war and misery, yet this wasn't a path that had been set out for him.<br/><br/>This is all wonderfully brought into picture by Mel Gibson, who was the perfect match for a character such as William Wallace. The music in this movie has yet to be beat by any other score in another movie. It really makes you feel the atmosphere of Scotland in the brutal age this movie was set in. The combination of the breathtaking music, the Scottish highlands (Irish, Scottish, who notices the difference? :D) and the epic battle scenes are one of the best things in this movie. I also think the character playing Longshanks deserves an honorable mention, he was just utterly fantastic in this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, if you haven't seen Braveheart, I suggest you order the DVD, because you will be wanting to see it over and over again."

His portrayal of William Wallace is really awesome and his acting really moves the viewers. I love the part in the Battle of the Stirling, where his face is painted blue with his shield and up. I have to admit, there is some funny parts in the movie that could make people go nuts. The mooning part (it is only a brief scene of nudity), makes people go crazy, laughing and crying. The scenes of the Battle of the Stirling and the Battle of Falkirk, were amazing and the cinematography is absolutely amazing. The scenes are brutal and barbaric, but the violence supports the story-the want of freedom from the evil rules of the King. Edward the Longshanks is an evil king who is a seriously corrupted person in the movie, but the acting is really great. I'd have to say that the movie is a fantastic achievement and people should watch it, (people who can stand brutal war scenes) because this movie is 100% AWESOME!"

I think best scenes were execution and betraying scene. I loved the dialogs between Robert De Bruce and his father. Gibson worked hard to make everything real as medieval England. Scottish people speak with their accent as same Irish and English people. Also he did well in Passion of Christ on making everything exactly in 2000 years ago. For example, I liked the gladiator but Ridley Scott made roman people speak English not impressive, not real !!. As I want say ,I m expecting Gibson to direct more movies, he has a talent on it."

It was soooo boring, and Mel Gibson was not at all convincing as William Wallace. He was looking like a 40 year old man that was still desperately trying to be young. He was supposed to be just a little bit older than the beautiful girl (whose name I forgot), but it was obvious he was much older.<br/><br/>The story was boring, and some parts of the movie were well acted, but I was so irritated by Gibson and the story line, that that did not make up much."
"jte6451","10","3","4","30 January 2019"," Braveheart Review
","""They may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!"" - William Wallace<br/><br/>When it comes to movies that reach epic proportions and manages to surpass it to legendary status, one film personifies that, and that is Mel Gibson's Braveheart. From its production values, to its beautiful cinematography and excellent direction, this epic defiantly deserves a spot among cinema's greatest pieces of filmmaking.<br/><br/>In 13th century Scotland, it tells the story of William Wallace, a Scotsman who, after witnessing his wife being publicly executed by the English, wages an all-out rebellion against the tyrannical English rule. Soon, his rebellion grows from a small group of farmers to, eventually, every clan in the country as he leads them to war for the freedom of Scotland.<br/><br/>While, sure, it may not be entirely historically accurate, like the love connection between Wallace and Princess Isabella. But even with some of the historical inaccuracies, it doesn't get in the way of the overall narrative and spectacle. Gibson, who is also the director, shows off his cinematic vision with its authentic production design, gritty and dramatic tone, and sheer spectacle. I especially love the cinematography here, especially the sweeping shots of the Scottish landscape (even though some of the scenes are filmed in Ireland). For a film that is nearly 3 hours long, it felt like the movie had just the right amount of time, and that's mostly due to the film's steady pacing and good editing, especially the quick editing shots during the battle scenes.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the battle scenes are amazing. Right up there with Lord of the Rings, these are among the best battle scenes ever put to film. I'll never forget the Battle of Stirling Bridge scene (historical inaccuracies aside though) for being a brutal, bloody, and badass sword fight. You have heads being decapitated, blood splattering everywhere, impalements, people getting stabbed, people being set on fire, tortured, and getting shot by raining arrows; this is as brutal as medieval warfare could get. Lastly, the epic score done by the late James Horner is so good that it is the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The casting and performances are excellent: Brendon Gleeson, the late Patrick McGoohan, the gorgeous Sophie Marceau, among many others. But the real star is Mel Gibson, in probably one of his best, if not, his best performance, even better than Mad Max. He perfectly shows how any epic hero can be both badass and emotional at the same time.<br/><br/>Overall, Braveheart is everything that I wanted in an epic film. A great story, phenomenal filmmaking, A-List performances, lush production values, and an epic score makes this a milestone in cinema history. After more than 20 years, it still stands as one of the best movies ever made. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? Go check it out.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 10/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness"

My opinion has never changed since back in 1995 when I first watched it, I've seen it many many time and never been tired of it. This movie works on so many levels (Plot, script, cast, action sequences) but the main one is the acting of Mel Gibson because HE IS DIRECTING HIMSELF. He knew exactly was he was doing. BRAVISSIMO. Mel's best recitation ( his second is ""The Man Without a Face""). Masterpiece. Excellent.

I did appreciate the battle scenes between the Scottish and the English. Moreover I think that's a beautiful way of thinking as William Wallace did, the vengeance for Murron and fighting for freedom and die young instead of dying old in your farm. It teaches us a certain way old life. But with hindsight there have a lot of inaccurate facts. The first is simple, it's about Scots' clothes, at this time they didn't wear kilts and tartans as they do in the film. Secondly the love between William and Elisabeth of France is just impossible because she was only four years old when Wallace came to France and even if he asked to see her, he couldn't. For all these reason I admit that Braveheart was a great film with a good story and battle scenes so congratulation to Mel Gibson. But what a frustration about the real story, the gap between the film and the reality. At least it's still a good movie to watch with friends or family."

""Braveheart"" is not perfect, has rhythm problems, and even development of some characters, not to mention his first act, and lack of completeness with the real history of William Wallace, but even so, ""Valiant Heart"" is A movie far, far above the average and deserves our respect."

A lot of endearing authenticity is also thanks to great acting and costume designs as well. It's hard to find a war film that's so focused and emotionally driven as this one. The only flaw I have is that there's a love scenario that develops towards the end of the movie that's totally unnecessary and even takes away from some other emotional tendencies that occur earlier in the film.

","This film by Gibson is very imaginative, but should never be interpreted as being historically accurate. Personally, I disliked the graphic violence, the awful details of guts being ripped out, etc., but this degree of violence seems to be the norm for Gibson - he seems to think it adds realism or impact. When he has the Scottish rebel seducing the English queen - well, I'm an Aussie Republican, too, but do we have to resort to this level of dishonesty to make an impression? I think it was a great pity the account did not stay closer to the facts; that would have been sufficient because the ancient truths of the era were impressive enough."
"ironhorse_iv","9","4","6","3 March 2014"," Great Scots! Watch this movie! Every man dies, not every man truly lives to see a great film like this.
","Braveheart is one of the best medieval films ever made; but also been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films of all time. Directed by Mel Gibson, the film is about a 13th-century Scottish warrior, William Wallace (Mel Gibson). King Edward I AKA 'Longshanks"" (Patrick McGoohan) of England invade Scotland in 1280, murdering many of Scotland's people. Patrick McGoohan is just chilling as Longshanks. What a great performance from him. In the film, Wallace, at first, tries to live a normal life with his childhood friend turn wife, Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), but the horrors of life under Longshank's reign became too much for him. With his fellow Scots, he launched a revenge attacked against the English causing the First War of Scottish Independence. Randall Wallace, the writer of the screenplay, has acknowledged that Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem 'The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie' as a major inspiration for the film. The film takes creative license on the piece, to make the film, more gripping like the like the hanging of Scots nobles at the start of the film or Wallace's getting help from Princess Isabelle of France (Sophie Marceau). I have to say, Sophie Marceau was a great actress for this role. In real life, Isabella was 3 years old and living in France at the time. She was not married to Edward II until he was already king and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died. This aspect of the plot may however have been inspired by the play, 'Wallace: a triumph in five acts' by Sydney Goodsir Smith, which historically has adult Isabella present at the Battle of Falkirk longing for a real man. Yes, it's a bit historical inaccuracy, but it's brings something to the table that works. Little things complains like the Scots not wearing kilts at the time could be passed over. The belted plaid (feileadh m√É¬≥r l√É¬©ine) was not introduced until the 16th century, 500 years after Wallace's death. Things like Jus Primae Noctis plot that supposedly allows the Lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serf's maiden daughters is still up to historical mystery. Still, there were some historic inaccuracies, I couldn't accept, like the film showing England's occupation and rule of Scotland being much longer. In fact, the English occupation of Scotland was just 2 years old before the battle of Falkirk. Prior to that, the Kingdom of Scotland was separate and fully independent. It was the Scots that gave power to Longshanks when they couldn't decide a king. I will defend the film for the depiction of the Prince of Wales, Edward II (Peter Hanly). His appearance in the film as an effeminate homosexual drew accusations of homophobia against Gibson. In real life, Edward II was believe to be bi-sexual who was very unpopular with his wife, the royals and the people of England. Many historians believe Edward II wasn't gay at all and that it was made up to discredit him. One of the few things, the film go semi-right was the portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen). Angus's performance is amazing in the film and my favorite character in the film. Some Scottish people got offended of the negative portrayal of Robert the Bruce whom is more a Scottish hero than Wallace. Even, the title 'Braveheart' is often refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, not William Wallace. He got to play second fiddle. Other key figures in the war of Independence was cut out in the film like Bishop William de Lamberton and Andrew de Moray. They were replace by other characters such as Brendan Gleeson as Hamish, and the Irish Steven (David O'Hara). Madman Steven has some of the great one-liners of the film. A lot of Scots might hate the film, due to this misleading history, but in my opinion, a lot of Scots should be thankful because the movie brought a lot to tourists to their country. Some of the English media accused the film of harboring Anglophobia. Yes, because there is going to be a negative portrayal of antagonists in any war film. Doesn't matter if English or not. The action scenes were great. The battle of Stirling was missing the bridge part. The war tactics are not historical right, but it was still well done. It was brutal, bloody, and in close quarters. It's scary to think that men fought this way for years. Even the fake horse dying look real, that even Animal Welfare investigated the film. Gibson toned down the film's battle scenes to avoid an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, with the final version being rated R. Some gory scenes are still disturbing, and disgusting for some viewers. Not a film for any young children. Still, there is some beautiful scenes in the film. I like the way, he shot the landscape even if it's Ireland, not Scotland. Braveheart theme song by James Horner is just beautiful to listen to. It's a very smart film. Then there is the famous quotes that continue to be overplayed whenever, the film comes on such as ""They may take our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOM!"" The film quote capture the spirit of Celtic heroism. The quote 'Every man dies - Not every man really lives' is from 19th century, American poet, William Wallace, no relation to the William Wallace in the film. I still love it. Overall: it was worthy of winning the Best Picture at the Oscars in 1995. It's still worthy to watch even with today's films."
"prrffft","Null","4","6","1 October 2008"," I found this DVD in the library classed under non-fiction....
",".....finally I watched Braveheart for the first time. <br/><br/>Is it true that the Scots watch this each year on the day Scottish parliament opens? I bet it's effective in getting them baying for English blood. Gibson has a gift for directing bloody action. But why make a historical film that is so inaccurate? <br/><br/>I'm no historian, but I do recall a little history from school books. Enough to know that Wallace didn't live in a thatched hut. That Edward II was manly and not a limp-wristed girl; his favourite hobby -- apart from hanging out with Piers -- was rowing.....and swimming and shoeing horses. And Wallace did not father Queen Isabella's child, the future king of England, because he did not ever meet her. (Isabella was in France, about 13 when Wallace died, and Edward II only married her 2-3 years after Wallace's death, and after Edward I's death.) Sorry for the spoiler. <br/><br/>Do these 'errors' in historical films matter? Some will say they don't, that film is just for entertainment and legend. But many people who watch films never voluntarily read a book. These films replace history books. They become the common, accepted knowledge. Isn't this dangerous?<br/><br/>I know a non-reader who is obsessed about popular history (i.e. he mainly likes the bits where some guy is slaughtering some other guy). All his knowledge is taken from films and he believes he speaks with ultimate authority, even when he announces that Wallace was very likely father to England's royalty.. I've seen him a few times locking horns with someone who knows his stuff, and it's just embarrassing. And sad. For why should he suspect that Mel is fiddling with the facts to this extent?"

","In the 13th century, Scots battle to overthrow the English and gain independence. This is nothing but a big, bloated turkey that seems like it's never going to end. It is not clear where Gibson is worse - the hammy performance in front of the camera or the inept direction behind it. Gibson often has the camera linger on himself as he strikes heroic poses. Too much screen time is devoted to bloody battle scenes, causing the film to become increasingly tedious. The only respite from the repulsive bloodbath is romantic scenes that look like shampoo commercials. We also have Gibson to thank for showing us what's under those kilts."
"jhobson1","2","10","20","30 May 2005"," More unhistorical than many
","Braveheart really messes up the history. For example, it has Robert the Bruce starting the Battle of Bannockburn within minutes of hearing of Wallace' death. I know that news traveled more slowly in those days, but Wallace was killed on August 23, 1305 and Bannockburn was fought on June 23 and 24, 1314. The report of Wallace's death did not take nine years to get from London to Edinburgh. There was a battle fought between the Scots and the English a year after Wallace's execution, but the Battle of Methven on June 19, 1306 was a decisive victory for the English.<br/><br/>King Edward I, AKA Longshanks, did not die simultaneously with Wallace. He died on July 7, 1307.<br/><br/>The movie suggests that Wallace had an affair with Isabella of France, and that she was pregnant with his child at the time of his execution. As the real Isabella had been in France all her life until she married Edward II in 1308 -- and Wallace was never in France -- that would have been impossible. There is also the minor matter of Isabella being a child of ten when Wallace died<br/><br/>That whole bit about English lords having the right to sleep on the ""first night"" with any newly married woman before her husband is crap. There was never such a ""right"". For one thing, can you imagine anything which would be more likely to incite revolts? For another thing, marriage law was determined by the Church. The Church has always supported marital fidelity. Any king or lord who tried to push this ""right"" would find himself excommunicated.<br/><br/>The Scots did have legitimate complaints against the English. But this pretended Prima Nocte was not one of them"

And so we have Mel as William Wallace, in reality a rogue and vagrant, who even the nobles of Scotland would not tolerate, as he was a commoner and beneath their contempt; and we have Edward I, who some historians have dubbed, ""the greatest English King"", and ""the English Justinian"" because he was a lawyer, statesman, soldier, etc.  In other words, a stellar King, and an admired and effective ruler.  But, wait: in Mel's hands, William Wallace (who he conveniently portrays) becomes a democratic model spouting egalitarian principles totally at odds with the England of 1299 and more redolent of America, 1776: and -- BIG SURPRISE -- as Mel's opponent, Edward I is trashed by Patrick McGoohan, who plays the character as a combination of Darth Vader and Heinrich Himmler.  Mel wears the White Hat and his enemies wear the Black Hat - get it??  Some films, like ""Spartacus"" and ""The Lion In Winter"" and ""Glory"" are fairly faithful to history; others, like ""A Man for All Seasons"" and ""Anne of The Thousand Days"" contain nuggets of truth, couched in gorgeous scenery and period costumes.  And then there's, ""Braveheart"" - a film that might fascinate Mel's fans, but which leaves everything to be desired where historical truth is concerned.

Some of it was just laughable - at times I was expecting them to come into a clearing and be greeted by the Knights who say 'Ni!'. The love story stretched credibility, and was blatantly made up so we could get some steamy action between the sheets, as, it would seem, a film without isn't worth the effort.<br/><br/>We also had the unseemly spectacle of a Young Scotsman being played by an middle aged American who seems to have decided after all these years that he would give acting a go, and not making a very good job of it. His accent was poor, and he tried to do emotion and stuff, but it really didn't work. Go back to what you are good at, Mel, Lethal Weapon X or whatever. It still dumbfounds me that he won best Director.

The accents are so bad by every single actor that I cant help but cringe my arse off (you know that really bad kind of cringe like when you remember farting extremely loudly in a job interview). The fact that the whole thing was filmed in Ireland with Irish actors was also a rather big factor in sealing this movie the 'Worst Scattish movie based on Scattish people but made by Americans' title. For a start the film was based on a POEM. Randall couldn't have just researched a few separate history books and built up a decent picture of what really happened. Too easy. He based it on a poem written by a guy called Blind Harry two decades after the events happened. Completely logical. You know what I can see why people like it. Its got romance, adventure, violence. I would be fine with that if (stupid) people didn't take this as complete historic proof that Wallace was an all round hero. He wasn't. He raped and murdered his way to the top. Fair enough he did fight for Scotlands independence, but where has that really got us? Were still part of the UK being controlled by England so the whole revolutionary tale in the movie is balls. I don't get why an American or Australian would make this movie. Surely their countries cant be so dry of culture that they have to start stealing other peoples? I know every one says their 'half scatch' or 'three quarters Irish' but their just kidding themselves. Leave the Scottish movies to the Scots.

","Most people when thinking of such a great movie as Braveheart think of the main character played by Mel Gibson, William Wallace. As a leader he is a noble, brave, and charismatic general. But one of the most over looked characters in the film is not even a Scotsman at all. It is Stephen the Irishman. He is one of Wallace's most trusted officials and is willing to give his life for the Scottish Cause. Stephen is known for being the egocentric Irishman who talks directly to God, simply to ""find an equal"" to an Irishman.

","Braveheart is a wonderful blend of action, romance, and drama.  Mel Gibson is amazing in his portrayal of William Wallace, the Scottish hero who inspires men to fight for freedom.  Although this movie does not give a very accurate description of historic events, that shouldn't make it any less enjoyable.  If you want an exact description of Scottish and English history, or you tend to be critical and analyze historical accuracy in films, then this movie is not for you.  However, if you want to be thoroughly entertained and inspired and feel every range of possible emotions in a 3-hour span then this movie is definitely for you.  I have never before or since seen a movie that can grab hold of your emotions and keep them captive for the full length of the film like Braveheart can.

"vespasian79","1","15","35","7 December 2007"," What a Tartan Horror: A Travesty of Scottish History
","One of these days I'll write some good comments about a decent movie. But not this time, and not this travesty of Scottish History. It was awful. Not from an acting or technical standpoint, I had no objections to the performances or the production values. My criticisms lie with the historical veracity of this overblown, ridiculously distorted epic. Just a few for now. Sir William Wallace was always a 'Sir', he was a baronet, and he was born with that title. He was not a commoner. He was a Scottish Border Lord, and as such made his living by fighting for either the English or the Scots, but only if there was something in it for him. My grandfather, who was born in the Highlands of Scotland, always called him 'Scotland's Pancho Villa', implying that he was a bandit, and my subsequent research has borne this out. Also, he was NOT a Highlander. He probably never wore a kilt or a belted plaid in his life, and definitely not while riding a horse. Try it sometime, riding a horse while wearing a kilt. See how your balls stand up. And the bulk of his army were not Highlanders, unlike the movie, which shows everybody with a claymore to grind against the Poms rushing hither and yon all wearing kilts of Macabre tartan. The evidence - and the Major, me grandfather - are adamant in insisting that Wallace was betrayed on purpose by Robert Bruce, something I have no problem agreeing with, as Bruce founded the Stuart Dynasty, and had more than a suspicion that Wallace wanted the Scottish Crown for himself. The conclusion of the movie shows a grim-looking Robert Bruce and his Army supposedly waiting to pledge their fealty to the English Crown, then spontaneously, just for the hell of it, deciding to attack and start the Battle of Bannockburn. Well, sorry, Mister Randy Wallace. He'd planned that battle for months. It's a pity they didn't show it. On its credit side, Patrick McGoohan's portrayal of Edward I, the Hammer of the Scots, was outstanding, and quite accurate, and the saving grace for this Goebbel's-like celluloid propaganda. <br/><br/>Peace for now. We're aye comin back tae see ye. Cruachen!"
"MpCavic","1","11","24","24 July 2001"," Mel Gibson has to be realistic.
","To start off with, this film has many inaccuracies, but since many other users commented on that, I won't spend much time on that.  Rather, one of the major inaccuracies is of Sir William Wallace himself.  Gibson portrays him as a loving, sweet man, when in fact, when you want to free your country from tyranny, you can't have any of those personalities.  You have to kill, not negotiate.  Although William Wallace might have been sweet, he wasn't when he turned into a leader.  Anyways, Robert the Bruce wasn't a traitor, which is very disrespectful of Gibson.  I would suggest that Gibson and Randall Wallace, the idiotic writer, first read a biography of William Wallace called ""William Wallace: Braveheart,"" by James MacKay.  Also, the only good thing about the movie is the acting, not by Gibson but by Patrick McGoohan, Edward I, Sophie Marceau, Queen Isabella and Angus MacFayden, Robert the Bruce.  Also, Catherine McCormack, Murron was terrific."

OK, a comparison between thousands of barely armed desperate rebels being slaughtered in the hundreds by giant rolling balls of burning hay to fifty dudes in skirts with maces on a muddy field is JUST NOT THERE.<br/><br/>The problems run deeper.  The ""freedom"" theme in this movie is overly simplistic.  OK, I'm an idealist, but if a movie's gonna be anything more than entertaining, if it's gonna have pretensions to being relevant in some way to real life, as this movie does, it better not have no meat on its bones.  This movie's theme goes nowhere beyond pure shining heart idealism that nobody could really believe in.  IN war, everybody gets dirty.  I know that, everybody knows that, but this movie of good guys vs. bad guys is NOT a great movie. It's just not.

"Eilidh77","Null","7","14","21 October 2002"," Average film, nothing spectacular...
","This film does not do the story of William Wallace justice.<br/><br/>Yes, everyone always says that it does not matter that the film wasn't fully accurate in Historical terms, but I feel it was not adequate enough to make this a very good and enjoyable film, amongst other weak points.<br/><br/>Firstly, I don't feel the acting was good enough to carry `Braveheart' along. Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace was not, in my humble opinion, good enough. Firstly, he cannot do a convincing Scottish accent. I thought his accent was awful. His attempts at a decent Scottish accent made me cringe throughout the film, and often distracted me from what was going on. That said, I do not have problems with a non-Scot playing a Scot, I just think Gibson was the wrong choice for many reasons. I think he put a lot of effort into playing this role, but the effort does not pay off. However, some acting from the supporting cast is good, notably from Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks), and Catherine McCormack (Murron) {who did pull off a good Scottish accent!}.<br/><br/>Secondly, like I mentioned above, I feel the storyline was too historically inaccurate. I wouldn't have minded if the film was slightly inaccurate, but this is just a joke.<br/><br/>That said, the film does have some strong points. The scenery is wonderful. Note, I believe the film was shot mainly in Ireland, so it is Irish scenery, not Scottish scenery, but I believe the two are similar, anyway. The battle scenes are well shot, also. I think Mel Gibson's directing was better than his acting.<br/><br/>Therefore, I believe this is an average film. It does have it's good points, but these are weighed out by it's many weak spots.<br/><br/>Please note, the whole William Wallace era was BEFORE Scotland and England were UNIFIED as Great Britain. Therefore, these were battles between Scotland and ENGLAND, NOT Scotland and Britain! Britain didn't exist in this point of time! Also, in the modern day, Britain, or England, does NOT rule Scotland - they are UNITED in the British Union. I just wanted to make that clear. *Wink*.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I rate this film 4/10."
"jpgburnett","3","7","14","17 June 2001"," Wallace or Gibson? (possible light spoilers)
","If anybody who reads this has ever read one of my other reviews, they will know that they tend to be long and that I always have lots to say.<br/><br/>Not so with Braveheart. The film does not leave much to say. It's the hugely historically inaccurate film of Scottish hero William Wallace's life: the death of his father, his life with his uncle, the tragedy that leads him to fight the English, his victory at Sterling and his eventual downfall. All this sadly directed by and starring the ever-awful Mel Gibson, boasting an absolutely pathetic accent. I should know, my family's Scottish!<br/><br/>It's a shame, because apart from Gibson, it's quite an enjoyable romp. It's no Oscar-deserver (1995 should have gone to The Usual Suspects and The Cure, the latter didn't even get any nominations, a travesty!), but it's fun. But Gibson manages to cross time and become Gibson of the 13th century. Wallace is just a Scottish Martin Riggs of Lethal Weapon or Porter from Payback. And they were suspending belief for the 1990s, he becomes ridiculous here.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, on the hand, is quite good. Ian Bannan gives a good, albeit unbelievable performance as Robert the Bruce's leper father, the kid who plays his son is marvellously expressive (one to watch) and Robert the Bruce is well-played by Aidan Quinn, I believe it is (forgot to check, I'm afraid). But Gibson is still just Gibson, and is looking silly.<br/><br/>I would like to end by noting that it is historically inaccurate, all that stuff with the Princess of Wales is laughable. The battles are inaccurately portrayed (there were no longbows at Sterling), Wallace did not dress like that (he's a knight in every picture I've seen of him) and Robert the Bruce's dad wasn't a leper. And those bits with the Princess really are stupid, just a chance for the public to see Mel kissing a girl, what poor cinema! And the portrayal of the evil English is exaggerated, they were evil, but not that evil!<br/><br/>It's a shame, with a bit of finesse and work and without Mel Gibson, this could have been a very entertaining historical drama, along the lines of Elizabeth. The locations are fantastic, the music is touching and it's pretty entertaining during the battle scenes. But with Gibson directing, it becomes unbelievable and cheap. It feels less like a tribute to Wallace as one to Gibson himself, which takes away the point of a historical drama. I give it 3/10.<br/><br/>Uppers: 1)The cast (except Gibson); 2)The backgrounds; 3)The music; 4)The battle scenes<br/><br/>Downers: 1)Mel Gibson's big-headed filming and attitude; 2)Totally inaccurate historically; 3)Full of exaggerations; 4)Gibson's accent; 5)How can they make a Hollywood flick about British History?"
"williampsamuel","9","5","9","6 December 2014"," An Inspiring and Exciting (If Historically Inaccurate) Epic
","At the sixty-eighth annual academy awards, Mel Gibson's Braveheart won five awards, including best film, and it deserved every one of them. With epic battle sequences, rousing speeches, remarkable performances by some of Hollywood's best actors, and its inspiring tale of man's quest to liberate his homeland from tyranny, Braveheart is as great a film as has ever been made.<br/><br/>Following the (mostly) true story of Scottish outlaw, hero, and martyr William Wallace, the film takes us from the childhood events that would shape him, through his war against the English, and to his betrayal and execution at the hands of Edward II. In any hands this would be an exciting tale, filled with violence, treachery, and intrigue. And in Gibson's hands, with a script based on the writings of the 15th century poet Blind Harry, this is truly a tale to inspire. It is inspiring because it is the story of a man who wanted only to live and work in peace, but who was willing to take up arms to avenge the woman he loved.<br/><br/>It is inspiring because no matter how high the odds were stacked against him, and no matter what he was offered in return for halting his crusade, he would not give up his struggle to free his beloved Scotland. And it is inspiring because unlike other men, who would have sought to use their military success towards their own rank and status, Wallace fought under the banner of another, Robert the Bruce, even when Robert did not deserve it. For Wallace it was not about power, or wealth, or even his own honor, though this mattered to him greatly. It was about seeing Scotland free and independent under the man who rightfully held claim to the throne.<br/><br/>William Wallace, as depicted here, is one of the greatest heroes in any film, and only Mel Gibson could have done the role justice. Despite the scandals and alcoholism that have plagued him in recent years, there can be little doubt that Gibson was, and is, a great actor. And when this film was made, he was at the very height of his career and acting ability. Earnest and charismatic he brings both the gravity and experience of a veteran actor and the energy and enthusiasm of a younger man. Few actors will ever give a performance as great as the one he gave here, and it was unquestionably the best of his career.<br/><br/>The other cast members also performed excellently. Patrick McGoohan is the very epitome of ruthlessness as Edward the Longshanks. Sophie Marceau likewise performs very well as the noble princess Isabella, whose romance with Wallace, although wildly historically inaccurate does much to give the film an extra emotional pull. Angus Mcfayden is particularly compelling as Robert the Bruce. He is a good man who genuinely wants to do the right thing, but who lacks self confidence and is plagued by evil council. It is with great anticipation that we await the moment he will break free from his fears and doubts and take up the cause.<br/><br/>From a technical and cinematic standpoint, Braveheart is exceptionally well made. No expense has been spared on the sets and costumes, and the film utilizes some of the most beautiful settings in Scotland and Ireland. And the battle scenes are among the greatest ever to be put on film. The scale of the battles is something to behold, with hundreds of fully armed and costumed combatants on both sides. Nor have the filmmakers shied away from the sheer brutality of medieval warfare. Watching the axes and claymores strike their mark, the hard part is believing that people weren't harmed. This violence alone, without the later execution scene, is enough to earn the film a hard R rating, but it is absolutely what's needed.<br/><br/>It may be graphic, it may be suspect in its historical accuracy, and I admit it has cast aside much of the complexity of the real William Wallace for the sake of a more compelling narrative. And of course it's a vanity production on the part of Gibson. But Braveheart is absolutely the kind of rousing epic that audiences crave. It is well acted, well crafted, and contains a compelling story and an uplifting message at its heart. Wallace's cry of ""Freedom!"" will resound with you long after the film has ended. There is no doubt in my mind that this was the best film of 1995, and it has lost none of its impact since."

","Let me get this out of the way first. I am a descendant of a famous(infamous?) Scottish border clan who fought in numerous battles between the Scots and the English, sometimes for both sides depending who paid the most money. The original Turnbull (Sir William de Rule) was knighted by Robert Bruce for saving his life on a hunting expedition, hence the new name and the Turnbull motto, 'I Saved the King'.<br/><br/>The Turnbulls fought at Bannockburn and right through the English invasions of Edward Longshanks and his son. Scottish history is littered with deceit and treachery through this period including the murder of one of my ancestors 'the Red Cummyn' supposedly by Bruce himself, in order to solidify his legality for the throne. This preamble is only to mention I know something of the history of the period and to have a distant connection to it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie (and the book from which it is derived) is little more than a sensationalist, revisionist rewrite of the facts. Some of this I can forgive in recognition of entertainment but Wallace was a lowlander and his troops did not dress as shown, and most certainly did not daub their faces blue. Wallace was no country yokel and was a member of the Scottish nobility. He had no claim to the Scottish throne but was dismayed that others who did, such as Bruce, would not stand up to Longshanks. In many respects he was an accidental hero.<br/><br/>But what annoys me most about this movie is the utter fiction that is inserted such as Wallaces affair with the future Edwards wife and her impregnation. That is just preposterous nonsense. I don't see why the movie could have not been historically accurate. It would have been just as exciting and gory, and more fitting of Wallace the man, who did after all die a horrible death, and did much to energise the Scottish nobility to eventually carry the day at Bannockburn.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks. He was a cut above all others. As others have commented, he was a complex person; at once a lawmaker and King, but also a tough cookie to boot. His tomb bears a simple inscription (in Latin, deciphered as): Edward Rex, hammer of the Scots."

Set in the Middle Ages, the character of Scotsman William Wallace may be interpreted at two different levels: he is a historic figure, on the one hand, who does not only talk about goodness for his nation but really fights for it to the last breath - he is a real hero in the historical meaning of this word; on the other hand, however, he is a universal representation of all men of courage, of all who dared say ""no"" to the tyranny, slavery, any sorts of humiliations, dignity deprivation, and, what is more... of all men who have been able to love someone else in truthfulness. Anyone who is straightforward may identify with Wallace, may say ""Yeah, that is what I also feel nowadays..."" Therefore, the content of BRAVEHEART is very touching, very up to date and makes it a real tribute to three major treasures of humanity: Love, Courage and Freedom. Yet, it appears that Freedom is step no. 1 among these three since ""a free heart"" opens the door for the rest. ""...just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM."" ""Freedom' is the word that Wallace shouts out desperately not only before battle of Stirling but just before his death - an undeniably powerful moment that you will never forget. <br/><br/>BRAVEHEART is a real masterwork of epic productions: <br/><br/>This aspect concerns both visual effectiveness, including battle scenes, locations, cinematography, historical accuracy, and performances. The movie is filled with such profoundly subtle pictures that they are impossible not to leave any trace in the viewer. Battles (Stirling and Falkirk) are realistic, very brutal but this brutality emphasizes psychology of ""wicked enemy."" It is not brutality just for its sake. Gentle scenes of peaceful locations go in pairs with affections to the nation, they make us realize why Wallace fights so indefatigably. The opening sequence is a must see in this aspect. Moreover, costumes and all historical factors make BRAVEHEART a fabulous epic, one of the best in its genre. However, it would be nothing without performances and there is really much to praise here. Gibson reaches ""the impossible"" giving a truly charismatic performance in the lead. Consider, for instance, his face expressions throughout the film. Really an Oscar worthy acting! Analysing other Scotsmen's roles first, I loved Brendan Gleeson as characteristic Hamish Campbell and Catherine McCormack as gentle dreamlike Murron. Other top notch acting include Sophie Marceau as merciful and wise Princess Isabelle (representing Gibson's idea of woman) and Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks, King Edward I, seemingly the most ruthless king ever to sit on the throne of England.<br/><br/>BRAVEHEART is the demonstration of the director's viewpoints:<br/><br/>What would be a movie if it weren't affected by the thoughts of the director, that is what he/she conveys in the message. Mel Gibson, here, shows a wonderful image of what it means to be a Man, what it means to be loyal, what it means to be noble in the true meaning of this word. Like in his later movies, he makes a clear contrast between simple men who live their lives in truthful patriotism and court ""peacocks"" and ""nobility"" who rather look for more riches than care for the nation. The symbolic leprosy of Robert's father draws our attention on the rotten decadence of materialism and immoral search for power by all means. For Robert's father ""All men betray. All lose heart"" however for Wallace ""slaves are made in such ways."" Another point where the director demonstrates his viewpoints is young Wallace's relation with his father, Father as someone who teaches to live, who knows that his son can fight but that it is the wits that make the boy a real man.<br/><br/>BRAVEHEART is, finally, one great emotion: <br/><br/>It is really unusual to watch such a long movie and be filled with emotions at almost every single scene. That proves an exceptional respect that Gibson has to the characters he presents as well as the viewers. There is a true development of characters, a true possibility to feel what they feel. A clear picture of what a person is like. Perhaps, some people would have doubts that if Longshanks is bad, he is wicked throughout or Wallace good, he is noble throughout. But what touched me here is the moment of their deaths when the contrary values they lived for are revealed. This is the scene when everyone would probably agree with Wallace that ""Every man dies, not every man really lives"" <br/><br/>BRAVEHEART is one of the very best films that have ever been made, truly great among the greatest in spectacular, psychological and artistic sense. Gibson, by making this movie, provided himself a place in the history of cinema and spoke loudly on behalf of precious aspects of humanity. BRAVEHEART will be watched as long as there are people who will understand what it means to fight for something one loves. 10/10"

","I loved this film. I know a lot of people feel that you can question a film based on the integrity of a film maker like Mel. But I say, if this film is a slice of who Mel is then he must be an amazing guy! You must see this film as a man to experience what it must have been like in the old days to fight for what you believe in. Love a woman so much that it hurts too lose her like nothing experienced before. To know the feeling of being betrayed by those you trusted! These are sentiments shown so well in this film and show that Mel is a filmmaker that has seen the other side and tapped his primal man side as well. Watch this film if you want to touch the sense of what most of ""Metro"" guys today are missing! It will teach you again a thing or two about good films and good manhood!"

","My comment, to all of those who say that this movie is historically inaccurate, is that the opening lines ""Narrator: I shall tell you of William Wallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes."" explain why it is not the story that the history books tell!<br/><br/>Arguing over the historical accuracy of a movie is a pointless. Movies are notorious for being inaccurate when ""following"" the plot of a book or the events of history. My advice is that if you enjoy a movie watch it again don't research it because you'll only be disappointed! <br/><br/>Braveheart is a fantastic movie which encompasses all the best genres! Mel Gibson may be a bit greedy by being the director and lead role but his portrayal of the character is astounding. (Some of the inaccuracies actually add to the movie, for instance Stephenn the 'crazy' Irishman who is a wonderful character and fits in perfectly!) <br/><br/>This should be in the top ten movies of all time!"

","I heard of this movie long long ago, but today is my first time to watch it, and it is not just in name only, but also in reality, a great movie, now and forever. Through all the movie, my heart always hung in the air. When ""Mel Gibson"" smiled, I smiled too, while when he was sad, so did I. This movie took me back to the history, and made it a real history, in my opinion at least. The music is very beautiful, and it appeared always in a proper time so was the graceful sound of Scotland bagpipe, sometimes sorrowful and sometimes solemn and stirring. It is ""a Mel Gibson film"", but other actors and actress also did a good job, they all made this movie a great one."

WALLACE! WALLACE!"" at the end. The story line is a great one, the fight scenes memorable, and the soundtrack top notch. The London Symphony Orchestra did a tremendous job on the music, as I could listen to the Main Title and the Freedom Theme all day long. Gibson's performance of William Wallace is memorable. It is also a comedic film, especially when all of the Scotsman lift up their kilts on the English right before battle. The English then try and shoot them with their arrows and after the first round, all of the Scotsman once again lift up their kilts. The scene with the Irish is also a memorable one, where they all charge at each other, then stop and shake hands. At once, they all attack the English. This is also when Wallace is captured. The memorable line of the film is when Wallace is tortured, then wishes to speak. He shouts out, ""FREEEEEDOM!"" Once again, this film can be watched over and over."

The story is so exciting and the acting so incredible, that you sit tight throughout the entire movie. Besides that the fact that it is an authentic story makes you think about it even more. This is a classical fairytale about the evil force against the underpowered good in an epic fight for freedom, but it is not a fairytale, it is a historical fact.

The evil caricature of King Edward as a rabid and cruel monster is particularly unconvincing. The movie somehow never really explains what the freedom for which Wallace is fighting is really about.<br/><br/>Some of the battle scenes are pretty impressive and very well done, though. On the whole, however, a rather boring, plain and uninspiring film, certainly not something I'd want to watch more than once. Also far too violent, especially the torture scene in the end."
"Servo-11","2","5","9","16 October 2001"," Overblown and overrated
","I finally watched this movie after hearing about it for years and I really wish I'd spent my time watching something else.  Braveheart ranks right up there with Titanic and Pearl Harbor as prime examples of what's wrong with Hollywood historical epics.  They take a rich and complex history or event and dumb it down for the viewing public into a shallow tale of revenge, love and death.  Emotions are over-the-top and characters are either good or bad. Strangely enough, considering its reputation among some people as being mindless entertainment drivel, I feel Gladiator is a much better film, despite all the sneers that Gladiator aped Braveheart.  Gladiator took the elements that floundered in Braveheart and made it much more satisfying, visually and dramatically.  Compare Maximus's quiet death, as he finally reaches his family on the other side, with Wallace's leatherlung scream of ""FREEDOM!"" delivered on the soaring wave of a pulse-pounding, throat-catching orchestral surge that you would find only in a Hollywood epic.  I look at Braveheart as a supreme egotrip by a moderately talented actor.  Mel Gibson needs a good director to keep him in line so he doesn't grandstand, and Emmerich succeeded to some degree in The Patriot.  Throw in the shameful historical inaccuracies and the blatant gay-bashing (Mel has a few personal agendas) and you have a long film that bores and exasperates.<br/><br/>Still, I gave it 2/10 for the cinematography.  The scenery is beautiful. Oh, and the gut-wrenching bellylaugh I got from Wallace's final word made the rest of the movie much more enjoyable.  Too bad it didn't come earlier in the film.<br/><br/>If you want to see Braveheart summed up in about 5 minutes, watch the ""Starvin' Marvin"" episode of South Park.  It's infinitely more satisfying."

Instead, they felt it necessary to give the award to Nic Cage for kissing Elizabeth Shue's breasts.  That is a shame!"

While I did think it was ""cool"" to see William Wallace wielding a military pick at one point in the film, it seemed pretty nonsensical.  It seems as if someone on the set said, ""You know what would be really COOL?  We could have Wallace smash in some guy's head with a big HAMMER!  Yeah, YEAH!""<br/><br/>As for the rest of this film -- let me simply say that I probably would have found it to be wonderful if it was about a man named Elphed Beeblebrox and his life-quest to gain freedom for his nation, Goonia, from the evil imperial Shanta and King Twazel II.<br/><br/>However, as this movie is simply an exercise in making history as two-dimensional and misrepresentative as possible, I have to give a big obscene gesture out to everyone involved in the more important aspects of making this film.  I'm sure I don't need to go into details about this -- if you actually cared, you'd probably go pick up a book to read about the history of this period.  Let me just set three things straight: both England and Scotland were horrible ""sports"" during this entire protracted war, Edward I died about ten years after Wallace was executed (Ed continued to pound Scotland throughout this entire time),<br/><br/>."

The IMDb guidelines ask us to refrain from being nasty, but surely I can say that this is a deeply fascist work, one that offers only one point of view, reduces to caricatures anything that opposes it, and is filmed in a bludgeoning, wearing style.  The treatment of the English is appropriate and probably accurate, but the response is brutal, ugly and reprehensible.  The homophobia is horrific, and the film's bigotries and allegiances seem aimed at football hooligans, republicans and thugs.  Worse than any of this, though, is that it is a very dull film, which is badly made when it isn't reiterating cliches, and its cod-Celtic, very fascist sentimentality is nauseating."

","Sad to say that Mel Gibson got a very big budget to make a very big epic about
the English-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Sad because he got to indulge two
of his biggest prejudices Anglophobia and Homophobia.<br/><br/>The film is technically most impressive and Mel Gibson makes one virile heterosexual martyr who gets to bed the Queen of England and the big joke
Gibson is playing on us father English royal dynasty down to today.<br/><br/>Gibson directs himself and acts as William Wallace who was the peasant leader
of the Scots who resisted England's invasion of their country. The King of England at the time was Edward I who was nicknamed Longshanks. Patrick
McGoohan plays Edward.<br/><br/>No one ever accused old Longshanks of being a nice guy. Among other things
he did was expel the Jews from England and they did not come back until
Oliver Cromwell let them back in. And no doubt he was disappointed in his
son the Crown Prince who was as gay as green shoes as an English friend of
mine used that expression.<br/><br/>He did not however throw Edward's boyfriend Piers Gaveston off a tower battlement. Gaveston came to a far more grisly end when the Crown Prince
became king. That is a fiction of Mr. Gibson's prejudices.<br/><br/>As for Sophie Marceau she's gone down in English history as Isabella the She
Wolf. No doubt she was a woman with needs, but as history has it Edward II
did his kingly duty and did begat an heir who became Edward III. Edward II
reigned from 1307 to 1327 and the royal prince was born considerably after
William Wallace met his grisly end described accurately here. A product of
Gibson's stated homophobia.<br/><br/>As impressive a cinematic achievement as Braveheart is I won't give it a good
review. God knows there have been historical films done quite inaccurately
for the sake of drama and done well. But an appeal to bigotry I will not
endorse. I would suggest a reading or a viewing of Christopher Marlowe's play
Edward II for a more accurate telling of that tragic tale.<br/><br/>I see very little difference between Braveheart and Jew Suss produced by Joe
Goebbels to stoke Anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>Shame on you Mel Gibson for your lies and distortions."

","William Wallace loses his father at a young age. After going away for a while, he returns (now as Mel Gibson) to raise a family. That dream quickly comes to an end when his wife is assaulted and killed by English soldiers. He becomes a patriot in a romantic rage, not resting until England gets its boots off the throat of Scotland.<br/><br/>Historian Sharon Krossa notes that Scotsmen did not wear kilts at this time, saying that this is akin to ""a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits"" and further that ""The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate -- in short, just about nothing is accurate""... which more or less sums up my primary complaint about this film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it as a story about an oppressed people rising up against their masters, even if it didn't really have any basis in reality. I was a bit confused about Gibson as Wallace, with hair styled by the same person who helps Dog the Bounty Hunter. And I'm not sure how this received ""Best Picture"" or ""Best Director"". I do not think it's a bad film or bad direction, but I have to believe the other films this year must have been considered pretty bad for Mel Gibson to enter the list of legends and giants. I would say, for example, that ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is a better film.<br/><br/>I had the film presented to me as ""chick flick"", and I can see that. Despite the violence and political message (about freedom and independence and nationalism), the underlying theme is that Wallace loved his wife and fights in her honor... though he doesn't really take issue with hooking up with his enemy's wife. I guess two wrongs make a right?<br/><br/>I see this film as a bridge between ""Spartacus"" and ""300"", as a story of a small number of people fighting against a much larger enemy. Like Spartacus, Wallace is to some extent a slave. Like the Spartans, the Scots have everything against them when fighting the English. Despite the parallels, the sad fact is that ""Spartacus"" is the best film, and ""300"" the least... seems that uprising films are becoming less grand."

The script is simple but extremely effective, the rhythm does not decline at any time, combining with great assertiveness the epic and massive battles (at the time really innovative by the realism given to the actions) with more intimate moments.

It isn't as bad as in something like, say, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES but it isn't mastered to the extent it was in GLADIATOR either. Although history is sometimes rewritten and distinctions are blurred, this is a moving masterpiece with a sweeping score and splendid visuals to boot.<br/><br/>War is hell here, literally; bloody and violent, with limbs flying and bodies torn asunder. Yet for a film chock full of gruesome violence and obscene torture, it's remarkably good-natured, focusing on the characters foremost and being successful with it. Gibson is fine in the leading role ‚Äì if a little too old ‚Äì and the supporting cast are great. The plot is complex and wide-reaching and the characterisations and script are both spot on.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","4","7","27 October 2014"," A well executed epic though not exactly historically accurate
","Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" tells the story of William Wallace, a near-legendary 13th century Scottish hero who fought for his country's independence. While based on actual people and events, the story departs from history in some respects as it hews closer to myth than to reality.<br/><br/>The Oscar-nominated screenplay by Randall Wallace was admittedly written with more attention paid to creating dramatic situations than to being as factual as possible. I won't argue with dramatic license when it produces a story as compelling as this but I do think that Wallace stretched the facts beyond the point of credibility on at least one occasion. Others are even less forgiving. So, if you get hung up on stringent historical accuracy, this is assuredly not the movie for you.<br/><br/>If you can get past that, you'll find that Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning direction is surprisingly well-handled, particularly given his relative inexperience at the time (""Braveheart"" was just his second directorial effort). There's no doubt that renowned first assistant director David Tomblin also proved a valuable asset to the production. Furthermore, the film is also impressive from a musical standpoint, with James Horner's Oscar-nominated score effectively utilizing Scottish and Celtic influences.<br/><br/>Apart from directing the movie, Gibson also delivered the goods with his portrayal of the larger than life lead character. He didn't do it all on his own, though; he had a fine cast supporting him. Patrick McGoohan played King Edward I with villainous relish, Sophie Marceau was stunning as Princess Isabelle and Angus Macfadyen gave a complicated portrait of Robert the Bruce. Among Wallace's men, Brendan Gleeson & David O'Hara both stood out. Catherine McCormack was also notable as Wallace's secret lover.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Braveheart"" amounts to a well-constructed epic the likes of which we don't see enough of these days. It may take some liberties with history but they don't detract too much from the overall picture as I see it. While Gibson has fallen out of favour in recent years (through no fault but his own), this movie shows him at his best and deserves to be fondly remembered."

"Silent_Cal","4","4","7","28 September 2013"," ""Every man dies"" -- especially in Mel Gibson movies
","In typical Hollywood fashion, ""Braveheart"" delivers a sturdy tagline as a sort of moral: ""Every man dies, but not every man really lives."" That is particularly true of Mel Gibson movies, where you can be assured that nearly everyone will die in very bloody and gruesome Medieval fashion, and that most of them won't be given the chance to really live. (Although the film's portrayal of 13th-century Scotland looks so miserable, I can't fathom why any of them would bother.)<br/><br/>But what about Mel? History dictates that Mel, as the eponymous -- sort of -- hero, will have to really die. But does he really live? Let's see what Mel and his screenwriter, Randall Wallace, offer as a definition of ""really living"":<br/><br/>1. William Wallace's wife is murdered the day after their wedding.<br/><br/>2. Wallace's rampage of revenge incites a bloody insurrection. <br/><br/>3. A pitched battle is fought, leading to hundreds of dead Englishmen and horses and hundreds of exposed Scottish backsides. <br/><br/>4. Wallace has a clandestine affair with the French princess -- who, according to history, was nine years old, but never mind. <br/><br/>5. Wallace is betrayed, captured, and messily tortured and executed in an extended climax that reaches a sort of feverish apotheosis with Mel screaming ""FREEEEDOM"" as blood and spittle flies from his lips.<br/><br/>Gosh. If that's what they think ""really living"" is all about, I've got a long way to go. Messrs. Gibson and Wallace (Randall, not William...) have settled on a rather ruthless and violent idea of what life is all about, and their concept of ""freedom"" seems equally brutal. Revenge, philandering, pedophilia, gory disembowelings -- is that sort of freedom really worth it?"
"erinnpayne","10","4","7","12 April 2013"," Amazing and entertaining
","I absolutely love this movie! It won Oscars and deserved them. The cinematography, acting, directing and general feel and theme of the movie is fantastic. It really allows people all over the world to learn about the great Scottish hero, William Wallace and Robert Bruce although i disagree with The portrayal of Robert the Bruce in the movie. Yes, it is not historically accurate but historically accurate does not make a movie, entertainment factor does. Despite the inaccuracies I believe the movie deserves only the highest of appraisal and is a huge accomplishment in film making. The soundtrack is breathtaking and really sets the mood. The acting is among the most believable performances ever and there is of course the occasional lighthearted comedy to lighten the mood. I must congratulate Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson and how can I forget Stephen The Mad Irishman played by David o'hara. I've watched this movie more times than I can count. As an English person I still love the movie despite the bias towards Scottish, but hey, there has to be a her and a villain in every movie, right? Loved it"
"jrtedrick","10","4","7","6 April 2013"," Braveheart: A Tale of Love and Passion Unlike Any Other
","I'm very sad to admit that I was ""late to the party"" for this movie; VERY late, at that. And now, I am punishing myself for not having the inclination to see this movie sooner. This is, of course, because if I have ever seen a better movie than this, I cannot recall it at this time.<br/><br/>I will not spoil much of this film for you, and will only tell you the minimum about the story: based on historical events and Scottish legend, Braveheart is the tale of William Wallace (the excellent director/star Mel Gibson), a Scotsman who sees firsthand the cruelties of King Edward Longshanks as a boy, and loses his father to the English King's tyranny. As a man, Wallace falls in love with a woman from his childhood named Murron (played by Catherine McCormack, who is very beautiful here). However, when tragedy tears them apart, Wallace can bear no more, and leads a rebellion of oppressed Scotsmen to claim their freedom from England.This journey that they undergo is near impossible to beat, and stands triumphant as a tale of iron will.<br/><br/>I will try my best to tell you everything that is right about this wonderful film, but the fact is that it's an almost perfect movie. All the elements, the writing, the cinematography, the acting, the design, and especially the moving score by James Horner, came together to do something I didn't think a movie could do: it made me believe. When Wallace fell in love with Murron, I could feel myself falling in love as well (as much as I could without being pathetic), which made the pain of her death even greater. I felt something, some strong emotion, for every character in the film. It has been said that in every great movie, every laugh must have a tear, and this is the case with Braveheart. There is a surprising amount of humor in the film (I guess with all the strong emotions and death, it had to be this way), and I found myself invested in this film with nearly every emotion I have: happiness, sadness, anger, shock and even fear. All this is punctuated by what is perhaps one of cinema's most emotional soundtracks, at least in my book. <br/><br/>Many people may dismiss Braveheart as a film about war, and while I can see where they may get this impression ( the film is rated R for some intense and bloody war violence), I firmly believe that this is false. Braveheart is not a war story, but rather a love story, which starts as a tale of Wallace's love for a woman, but then grows to an epic of Wallace's love for his countrymen and home, and of how a man's love and passion can prevail,even when faced with great adversity, and can inspire others to pull on to the end and fight the good fight. All this I felt within me as I fell in love with this movie; I was inspired, and I believed to the very end. I think I will continue to do so for a long time. You have probably already seen this movie, and may feel as I do, but if you haven't, you should definitely make the effort to experience it. As for me, I will continue to be inspired by what may be one of the greatest movies ever made."

","Let's get this straight from the start - I am a very poor historian and know very little about whether the events portrayed in this novel are closer to fact or fiction, except for what I have read from other reviewers who complain about the historical inaccuracies in Braveheart. I guess that is part of why I was so open-minded when I saw this film - I didn't really mind (or should I say notice) any deviances from the reality of what happened, really all I was looking for was a good film to watch with perhaps a little history thrown in, and that's exactly what this film provides.<br/><br/>Following the story of William Wallace who, after his (secret) wife Murron MacClannough is killed by Englishmen who are supposedly keeping 'order' in Scotland, Wallace decides to be the one to stand up and fight against the English for Scottish freedom. It's an incredibly interesting (and moving) story portrayed brilliantly (the film is close to 3 hours in length but doesn't feel it) with parts that will make you cry, make you laugh, inspire you, and infuriate you with the injustice being shown. Mel Gibson plays Wallace to perfection, in fact, the entire cast are faultless - the children at the beginning, Murron, the princes and kings, princess Isabelle - absolutely everyone, including the extras.<br/><br/>The film was made in 1995, but doesn't show it's age at all, in fact, it could be shown as a new film in cinemas today and nobody would notice. Mel Gibson also did the directing for this film, showing that not only is he an incredibly talented actor, but a brilliant director to. He is a man of many talents!! This is an incredible film that is definitely worth a watch. If you're a historian though, just go into it with an open mind. Fantastic stuff."

","i must say that i am very surprised to find that this film is currently ranked no. 96 on IMDb and that it gets 8.3 out of 10. i think that this film deserves at least 9 out of 10. and ranked 96, is that all it gets? it should at least be in the top ten, i don't know if it's the best film ever made but it's certainly up there with the best. this film has everything, the music score is great, the actors are great (some of them i've never even heard of before and never seen since, but they're good anyway) and the story is extremely well done, even if it is historically inaccurate. the film is so good that the three hours go by ever so quickly and the fight scenes are good and bloody, normally fight scenes in other films are boring and/or hard to follow but this isn't. what's really good is the battle of wits between king edward (longshanks) and william wallace. it's almost like a game of chess on film, wallace controls the Scottish and the king controls the English and what's really amazing is the sense that without their leaders each country would be lost, as longshanks says' they're sheep, merely sheep, easily dispersed if we strike the shepard.' i could be here all day just telling you why this film is so good but if you've already seen it then you already know, if not then get it because you will keep it, trust me. i haven't seen mel Gibson's latest work, apocolpyto but if it's half as good as this then it will be excellent."

"general-melchett","9","4","7","27 October 2006"," A top-hole film - Braveheart is medieval epic film-making at its best!
","Braveheart is a truly cracking film - easily the best of 1995. Toy Story may have done better and earn more fame, but this shall always come before it in my mind as the better film - it was actually made for a purpose, and wanted to tell the story of Scotland's greatest medieval hero. Yes, the film does look a bit dated now, and offers no fancy sword-fighting moves or excessive blood, but this helps it stay more realistic, and brings us closer to the action. The two big battle scenes during the film were brilliantly done, and define the word ""epic"" - they were perfectly realistic, yet obviously done on a high budget. There was also some great acting - despite a disappointing, slow start, and it remains to this day as one of the most realistic non-WWII epic movies to this day - no magic dragons or glorious pre-battle speeches - just character and honesty. Braveheart didn't fear about being hated by the English - it tackled the rough subject with honesty and brutality, and made its point perfectly well. Braveheart shall not be forgotten - it was the best thing that happened in Mel Gibson's career (he isn't at his best now), and was the first great sword-and-sandal epic - Jason and the Argonauts was just pathetic. The fact that it looks old now only makes it more realistic - I doubt that there was blood flying like it was out of buckets (Kingdom of Heaven) or hugely melodramatic sound and visual effects (Lord of the Rings) in medieval battle. A truly cracking watch - Braveheart is a film that shall not be forgotten for its character, strong script and originality. A stunning job! 9/10"

","This is the most amazing film I have have seen and having taken several course on Film, I have seen many. Please anyone who has not seen this film yet do your self a favor and ignore the comments of the people who hate BraveHeart and see it.<br/><br/>The claim made from the detractors of this film are not only ignorant but quite hypocritical. So in defense of this great film here is my response to those who hate this film.<br/><br/>The film from a historical aspect is not 100% perfect, but it is still very accurate without becoming a preachy documentary. The film itself was never meant to be a documentary, most of you who consider yourselves educated know that it was originally a book, written on what we know to be fact about William Wallace and the rest written from the authors heart. And as for following the book it in many cases follows it to the letter( with the exception of Wallace Travelling to France and Itally. Still without being a documentary, it follows the facts we know about Wallace's life closely, though admittedly not fully. Yes, there was a bridge at Sterling, it was not put in the film due to low production cost, and yes Long Shanks died some time after the film depicted, beyond this though it is accurate to what we know. Since in reality, we know little of Wallaces life, the author put what he felt moved to write, in the story. Yes we will never know for sure if Wallace and Princess Isabell ever met and so on. This part of the film is only speculation. Other the the historical, I find it funny that some people would complain about the violence in this film and yet find movies like the mindless gore-fest by Tarrentino fine ( no this is not ever Braveheart hater, but a lot of them are that hypocritical).<br/><br/>Now that I am done defending this film all I can say is that it reach down to the core of every human emotion. As another reviewer said before me, "" this film will make you cheer, love, laugh, cry; but more importantly it will make you think and measure what you have done with your life"". Every award it won it more than deserved and it deserved more. The score is one of the most moving and beautiful I have heard, the Mis-en-scene gritty realistic and unapologetic, and every actor and actress creates such a moving character, you can not help but be moved. This film is a once in a century masterpiece.See it!"

(I can't seem to find a number 1)  Based on actual events, (with the exception that princess Isabella was really a toddler when this was going on). It takes a hold of you by the shirt and dosen't let go until the last line is spoken.  The 3 hours it takes to watch this film is well deserved.  Supurbly cast and acted, and not only by Gibson.  But I believe the supporting deserves a standing ovation.  <br/><br/>    Sophie Marceu looks like a princess even when she doesn't have to play one. She is so poised and proper, statuesqe almost. And plays a woman who is not loved by the man she married, which is all she wants, to be loved.<br/><br/>    Angus Macfaden was brilliant as Robert the Bruce, a man torn between what he knows is right and doing what he has to do to stay loyal to his titles and family name.<br/><br/>    David O'hara as Stephen. The crazy Irishman who saves Wallaces life on several occasions, he really brought the charator to life.<br/><br/>    Brendan Gleeson also did well as Hamish, Wallaces childhood buddy and one of his right hand men.  <br/><br/>    Randall Wallace the script writer did an exceptional job by not concentrating on one thing too much.  It wasn't constantly serious, the romance was there but not overly exploited and the comedy that pops out at the oddest times.  And though the blood shed was tremendous it was tastefully done, for the story line reminds us constantly of the tyranny and persecution these people were facing, therefore making the slaughter seem more justified.<br/><br/>  I recommend this movie to everyone.

"Corleone-29","9","4","7","4 June 2000"," Fiery!!
","Clint Eastwood needs to take lessons from Mel Gibson who did a great job with this semi-epic rumble. Braveheart is a movie that is filled with great emotion. In fact I find it difficult to believe a person could watch this movie and not feel anything for the main character William Wallace. Sure the plot is your basic revenge for love destroyed good guy bad villain standard but that is not what makes this movie tick. Great landscapes, score driven, and violently picturesque battles and added with a touch of romance make Braveheart scream down the film highway. And once again it is the supporting cast that I feel overshadow Gibson's performance. Especially Patrick McGoohan as the ruthless Longshanks. In my opinion this is the part that makes or breaks this movie and it definitely made it. If you are going to have a villain in a movie not only do they have to achieve that hated look their actions need to match. Longshanks behaved how like a King trying to enforce his rule should. He was smart, cunning, and rarely did he lose his temper unless it was needed. If this sounds familiar then watch the Godfather and Michael Corleone. The comparisons between their actions are very similar. Wallace's fellow Scots and soldiers were also well chosen and added characters that made Wallace even stand out more. I am impressed with the way Gibson chose his shots. From the ground shot with the sword appearing fifteen feet on the screen to the shot at the end with the cloth he understands that when there is a defining moment in the script you need to do something even more to emphasize it. Make it stand out in the audiences head. This is where Eastwood sorely lacks as a director. His films have potential to be more than he puts into them. Especially Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil that just screamed from every page of the screenplay for a director to drive it like a Ferrari on an open road. Gibson rightfully deserved the Oscar and he understands how difficult and restless the directing experience is. But he is also unwilling to take a great script and let it go to waste and for that I give him his do. Braveheart is a grand movie that will be a classic for years to come. It invokes volcanic emotions and returns to a time when men fought for love and freedom with fearless passion."

To begin with, the movie was unduly long; so long that as soon as the first half ended,I thought the movie was over !! And during the next half, I had my most boring hour at the theater. However, to my great relief, the movie ended after about an hour. My boredom is on account of the slow flow of the events and the lack of interest and excitement in most of the scenes ( more than half of the movie ).In fact, Gibson should have placed more emphasis on the crucial events which were supposed to be a milestone in different periods of the life of William Wallace. Unfortunately, Gibson did not seem to have given the enough expression to those crucial events; that's why , most of the time, the movie was monotonous except the spectacular war scenes, which were- I think- the greatest accomplishment of Mel Gibson as a director; not an actor. The breathtaking war scenes could not prevent the dullness of the movie, though.<br/><br/>As for music, I think it went perfectly with the ""Scottish"" atmosphere of the movie. Though not as successful as his wonderful work in Titanic, James Horner did a great work in Braveheart, too.<br/><br/>Finally the acting was OK, but not very outstanding.

","Braveheart (1995): Dir: Mel Gibson / Cast: Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen: Here is a salute to freedom and the price paid. It regards William Wallace whose father and brother were slain when he was a boy. Taken in by his uncle, he grows to lead a rebellion against England after his wife is publicly executed. Mel Gibson presents impressive battle sequences as Wallace aligns with other villages in an attempt to form an army to overthrow King Edward 1 of England. Gibson portrays Wallace as a man bent on freedom to the point of death, and he is faced with many victories as well as betrayals. When he yells out the word, ""freedom"", he does so during his darkest moment. Sophie Marceau plays the Princess to the King's young feeble Prince. She is sent as a form of information and decoy but she becomes enamored with Wallace and warns him of danger. Patrick McGoohan as King Edward 1 is a thunderous villain ruler bent on conquering opposition until he lay on his death bed with words whispered into his conscience that embed worse than his greatest defeat. Catherine McCormack plays Wallace's wife who falls victim to the King's rule that enables his bids on newly brides. Angus Macfadyen is featured as someone whom Wallace seeks assistance from. Well crafted excellence about freedom and its very nature. Score: 10 / 10"
"GrowMagicBeans","10","5","10","11 August 2008"," It's gritty, dirty but also beautiful
","A tight script with very few holes, a wonderfully full-bodied score, great panoramas and characters we can immediately sympathise with; Braveheart tells the story of a true protagonist resisting a cruel, tyrannic and insurmountable enemy.<br/><br/>When we witness the very brutal murder of William Wallace's wife in an up-close and personal way, we cannot but feel emotionally invested and so we share in Wallace's blood lust, not just for revenge, but for justice also. What a great evil villain Patrick McGoohan portrays as Long Shanks, the King of England! His sudden, swift deliverance of rage or the foreboding tremor is his voice, makes him truly terrifying. How we can so easily loath everything about his tyrannic kingship. This character has no redeeming features other than you LOVE to hate him. He is a wretch who's only motivation is to maintain absolute and total power and he has no qualms about the suffering of others to maintain it.<br/><br/>Oh really, who cares if the movie itself is grossly and historically inaccurate! Perhaps it embodies the original spirit of the man become myth... or perhaps it elaborates too much for some... I guess normally I would detest such liberties on historical accuracy and shy away from the forced elements of the blockbuster, but in this case I allow it licence simply because it has managed to seamlessly forge all the elements of good storytelling together. It is the perfect movie for the escapist; acting near like opera, Braveheart plays off deep inherent feelings, plucking at our heart strings to feast upon our most basic and primordial emotions. It is a gritty movie -especially the battle scenes- yet also sweet and sentimental. The movie will take you... and you yourself will fall willingly into it. Let it sweep you away..."

","i watched this film last night for the first time since i was a young girl and i have to say this is the best film ever made no matter what anyone says Mel Gibson is the greatest actor in the world and he has the most endearing beautiful eyes i have ever seen his wife is a lucky woman love him so much. All the cast were excellent Bruce was great and the princes was brilliant so was long shanks. Mel Gibson is the greatest ever and he is also brilliant in forever young. For a man his age i think he is just brilliant. Anyone that thinks Goodfellas or whatever you call that film is better than Brave heart there is something wrong with your head. My favourite scene was the one were William and Pricess Issabelle kissed I think both actors were very convincing and you could see the William really did love his first wife. This film will never be forgotten i also think Mel added good humour into the film especially the scenes at the battlefield were they flashed at the enemies. Mel is a brilliant actor as well as a brilliant director.and all yas English people that are saying that mel Gibson made the English to evul well he didn't mak them as evil as they really are he portrayed this film brilliantly and his Scottish accent was just brilliant and everyone from Scotland that dissapproved of Mel in this film and mocked his accent should be ashamed of yourselfs Mel did your country proud so stop your yapping. Mel is the best in the world and the irish love him especially me x x x"

","Mel Gibson shows his true talents in 1995's ""Braveheart."" He acts, produces, and directs.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" tells the tale of Scottish hero, William Wallace, who led his people in a revolt against England in the 13th century. He wins many battles, wins enemies and alleys, and is feared and revered. Until his capture and execution. Wallace remains as Scotland's national hero and this film glorifies him as well as the human concepts of freedom and liberty.<br/><br/>Little is known about William Wallace. The major source of this film was Blind Harry's poem, which is debated for historical accuracy. Well, this film is a Hollywood film, and as we all know, Hollywood cares little about history. Inaccuries are many, including the first battle being fought on Sterling ground whereas sources say it was fought on a bridge and the use of kilts for men (the clothing didn't exist at the time). But the most inaccurate is the romance between Wallace and the French-born princess of England, who was a little girl at that time.<br/><br/>Historical inaccuracies aside, this a great action-packed film that can be enjoyed by anyone old enough to swallow it. It's a raw film, featuring tons of violence, ranging from really bloody battles, as so on and so forth (this was, after all, a violent time). Gibson, known for violence issues, such as in ""Lethal Weapon,"" portrays the battles realistically with no remorse. He brings us to the reality of that harsh time. He manages to make the battles very violent yet emotional. Viewers can feel as if they're not watching a re-enactment of the battle but in the actual battleground itself.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" is a beauty to watch. Other than providing lost of gut-wrenching action, it also has some lovely cinematography. Filmed in Ireland (though not in Scotland, where it takes place in), it offers lots of gorgeous scenery thanks to cinematographer John Toll. There's also great music from James Horner, who uses the most of Scotland's instruments, including bagpipes and flutes. The music is emotional and the mood is perfect. The script fares well under the writing of screen writer Randall Wallace. Although having no relation to the film's protagonist, Randall Wallace shares the same last name with William Wallance and this coincidence inspired him to write the script. Under his storytelling skills, the script tells the story of the struggle to win freedom from a tyrannical power.<br/><br/>The direction is great. Mel Gibson not only is a good actor but talented producer and director as well. This film was not Gibson's directional debut, however, since his first directing experience was during ""The Man Without a Face,"" but he is talented, nevertheless, and his skills are even featured on his third directional attempt, ""The Passion of the Christ."" The directing makes this films good. In this film, Gibson, as the protagonist, battles the English, an attempt later repeated in ""The Patriot."" Of course, no film would be good with its cast of characters and the talented actors and actresses to portray them. Mel Gibson stars as Wallance, alongside Patrick McGoohan as a great antagonist Edward I ""Longshanks"" of England, Catherine McCormick as Wallace's tragic bride, Sophie Marceau as the French-born English princess, Brian Cox as Wallace's uncle, Brendan Gleesan as Wallace's childhood friend, as the list goes on.<br/><br/>Released in 1995, ""Braveheart"" has gone to win 5 Oscars even Best Picture. It revived the epic film genre that was later done in 2000's Gladiator. Today, this film is remembered as an great epic tale of the strong will of an oppressed people to win a deserved freedom from a tyrannical power."

","Congratulations to Mel Gibson for managing to fool nearly everybody into thinking that this is a great movie.  It's actually quite silly.  The whole theme of ""Freedom is good"" is not exactly groundbreaking and it doesn't help the cause that Gibson portrays William Wallace as a self serving bully. Also the violence is overdone for a supposedly serious movie.  Sure it really was bloody back then but the style chosen indicates that Gibson is getting-off on the carnage much in the style of a Dead-Alive type splatter movie.  Also there was so much slow-motion that I often thought Mel Gibson was trying to sell me soap."
"GoonerMan","7","5","10","19 December 2000"," A decent enough film but a historical joke
","I am a fan of this particularly period in English History and when I initially saw Braveheart I recognised that this whole story is a complete fabrication and bears no resemblance to the truth at all. But I didn't worry too much - surely everyone would recognise that this is just a film? But no - it seems that a lot of people have swallowed this drivel and think that its all true.<br/><br/>This film is not just a little bit inaccurate, its a complete and utter joke historically. Just because Edward I (or Longshanks as the film constantly refers to him) died nearly seven hundred years ago is not an excuse to assassinate his character and to depict him as a coward is a complete disgrace. Edward had another nickname apart from Longshanks - The Lion of Justice - now I doubt he got that from being a tyrant!!!! This film makes the classic mistake of judging historical events and characters by todays standards rather than the context in which they existed. The political and social environment of medieval Europe was a lot different to modern-day USA, and do not be thinking that the Scots themselves were averse to invading weaker countries - they attempted to invade Ireland while Bruce was on the throne under the pretence of 'helping' them (they lost!). Now, I have the utmost respect for Wallace, but to depict him as a moral crusader is way off the mark - he was certainly capable of acts of brutality and barbarism himself. The character of Robert Bruce is equally inaccurate - being depicted as feeling guilty over changing sides when in fact all of his actions were for his own gain - and this is a man who murdered another Scottish claimant to the throne in cold blood - hardly a nice guy!<br/><br/>The storyline and characters in the film are also terribly one-dimensional. Every single Englishman in this film is evil and cowardly - there are no good English people to create a conflict in the English camp that would have made things more interesting. The English, like all European and World powers have been guilty of their fair share of atrocities in the past, none of which I am proud of, but to cast us as complete villains is clearly racism.  Also, the plot has far too many holes and the characters do not behave logically - for example a royal French princess (Isabella) falling for a common Scottish peasant (although in reality Wallace was not a peasant and Isabella was only a child when Wallace died anyway and she certainly never met him). Edward also behaves illogically - loosing arrows on his own troops and throwing a young nobleman out of his castle window. The barons in England were immensely powerful at this time, and the king could not just do as he pleased without repercussions. However, perhaps the best joke of all in this film is the suggestion that Wallace was the father of Edward III. Apart from the fact that Edward III apparently looked very similar to Edward I and every bit a Plantagenet, he was born about 7 years after Wallace died anyway. There are enough historical inaccuracies in this film to fill a book.<br/><br/>As a piece of cinema this film is highly entertaining, if a little simplistic in plot. The battle scenes are exciting (although not accurate re-enactments of the battles they represent) and the story interesting enough to keep you watching. So, watch it and enjoy - but please treat it as a work of fiction, as apart from the names of the characters this is clearly what it is. History has always contained more exciting stories than fiction ever could - but the fact that the scriptwriters of this film needed to be so economical with the truth tells its own story - Wallace's life, although historically important, wasn't that interesting at all in reality."

","Braveheart is an over-rated historical epic which is much over-rated. The film stars Mel Gibson, and the film seems to portray him in one of these idolised images of heroes that is so common in the majority of films he stars in. I don't know why the mainstream have embraced this film. Maybe they thought it sounded good to say that they had seen it and they enjoyed it. Maybe Gibson does excel in alluring mainstream people to the cinema to watch historical epics. Whatever it is, I had a lot of problems with this film. It is a typical Hollywood blockbuster, and maybe that is what the problem is. Too much action, a rushed story, and a long film that seems to lack in direction but uses cheap and tacky dialogue to bring Mel Gibson up to a hero status, particularly when he gives a moving and emotional speech about freedom. (I am sure that these words can be compared to other events, particularly in American history, and maybe these are more reasons why the film was so loved.) As a film, I had trouble sitting through it because it was not interesting, and I found several areas to be comical (unintentionally, I don't think the director wanted this to be a comical film). My verdict: over-rated and not recommended unless you like Mel Gibson or you disagree with this post."
"anonreviewer","7","6","13","1 February 2005"," good movie, but it panders to Scots-Irish socio-politics of America
","This movie is a well made and rousing movie. It is a gritty movie.<br/><br/>And it taps deeply into the Scots-Irish socio-political background of America. And I would know--I am an American of mostly Scots-Irish descent.<br/><br/>The Scots-Irish socio-politics is maybe the biggest single problem with America, and the biggest problem with the world, at least right now.<br/><br/>There is a massive reservoir of cultural stupidity in the Scots-Irish culture. You can see it ALL OVER this movie. It is central to this movie. What it is, is the idea that fighting and dying for this ephemeral concept, freedom, is a Good Thing. What a sad sad idea that really is. Better to live and sabotage and fight a low profile cultural fight, rather than fight and die as they did in this movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Scots Irish has bought into this fantasy time and time again. But throughout history, it has never been the brave warrior-patriot-citizen who has exhorted the Scots-Irish and the American people to war for fight for ""freedom."" No, indeedy. Instead, it has been the rich, the powerful, and the corporations who have used this subterfuge in order to persuade the SCots Irish to fight and die. Corporate profits and more riches and estates for the wealthy have almost always been disguised as ""freedom."" Those Scots Irish wound up immigrating to America, and now they form the base of the Republican party. And now we have yet another faux warrior-patriot-citizen in George Bush, exhorting the Scots Irish to die for freedom. And once again, they are falling for the manipulation. Well, at least most of them. But not this old Scots-Irish...."

","Not good. Mel Gibson just itches for an excuse to act in bloody, violent movies (such as Patriot) and this one is no exception. A heavy historical drama falls short with its shallow characters, macho Wallace and predictable, boring battle scenes. For some reason I kept thinking ""Highlander"" and ""Conan the barbarian"", which were much simpler, yet tremendously more enjoyable movies. If ""Patriot"" is your thing, you might probably enjoy this one; otherwise see Mad Max, Lethal Weapon and Payback instead."

","Mel Gibson has a death wish and is an exihibtionist - he shows it every chance he gets. He regularly enjoys being beaten to a pulp on screen. Although I am a believer I think he went over-board with the suffering of Christ in his OTHER MOVIE and not enough said about the triumph of Christ and supernatural intelligence that could only be divine. And you have to trace the root of Gibson's penchance for self-mutilation to this movie. In addition,being subtle and thought-provoking is obviously not important to Gibson. The only virtue in this movie is that we get our first look at the beautiful French actress Sofie Marcel, luscious green scenery, melodic score by Horner, but Mel ? No thank you."
"Quinoa1984","9","6","13","28 April 2000"," Gibson's best as director- melodramatic in better than expected measure, with bloody violence
","It was too much to take in upon first trying to watch Braveheart when I was younger. It's story is not terribly complicated, in fact it almost resembles (when taking it out historical context, which is not completely accurate to the film anyway) a 13th century Scottish version of the Mad Max series- Wallace's wife gets killed by the English, he gets revenge, and then some; he faces off in battles to finally gain freedom for Scotland. Clad in blue make-up, using his ""they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"" speech, charging ahead, and getting into a truly bloody battle that is only rivaled in 90s war/epic movie-making by Saving Private Ryan, this was what I remembered most from Braveheart when also first writing my comments. Seeing it today it's a totally different experience, as taking in the story it's very well told, with excellent performances that emphasize- unlike in Gibson's Passion of the Christ- that he can really get belief out of melodramatic performances. And when he does get his cameras up into the nitty gritty of violent confrontations, be them small (when he first takes his vengeance on the British after his wife's slaughtered, which itself is a very powerful scene) or large (previously mentioned battle), it's with a vitality and viciousness that rarely gets into Hollywood productions. There are even moments of fun (flashing the British, to 'kiss arse') and close-to-poetry (Wallace's death). It's a handsomely done work that should stand the test of time in Gibson's oeuvre. One of the best films of 1995."

","I know this film has its flaws. Sure, some of the accents are bad due to the lack of actual Scottish actors, and it's historically inaccurate, but every time I watch this I always end up feeling thoroughly entertained. Mel Gibson said on the director's commentary that films are made first to entertain, then teach, then inspire. I couldn't agree more, it's a far more rewarding outlook on films. He put everything into this, and it shows. I remember the battle of Stirling scene being the first time I had ever seen a large scale battle played out realistically on screen, using no computers, just lots of extras. It's immense and is a fine example of directing skills. Gibson himself plays the part really well physically, but in terms of excellent acting, Patrick McGoohan stands head and shoulders above everyone. His portrayal of the tyrannical villain is brilliant. I also believe that James Horner's instantly recognisable score rounds out the film perfectly. Uilleann pipes have an incredible sound and can invoke a great sense of rebellion and courage, which suits nicely"

First of all, the actors have been perfectly chosen, Mel Gibson was made to play William Wallace even though he isn't Scottish a all. While watching Braveheart, i've been though so many feelings: joy, sadness, anger, excitement. Joy when Wallace achieved to make Murron his, sadness when Murron's throat was slit, all the sadness and anger that Wallace felt, I felt it too ! I almost cried when Wallace was tortured at the end of the film, during all the battle between Scottish and English, I was as excited as them, I wanted them to kill them all ! But when Wallace and Isabelle got ""married"" I didn't understand Wallace, how could he do that to Murron but anyway ! Braveheart is very well played, the actors are great, the story is wonderful, when you watch it you can only be focused on the film, it's so fascinating.

It was so gory but I enjoyed it because Wallace killed all these men without heart. I'm crazy about films with love because Wallace was in love with Murron. They got married but in secret because he was scared that she had to live the primae noctis with this horrible king. At a moment, his beloved was almost raped by these Scottish occupants.But, Wallace, as superhero, saves her! This action was my favourite because it was adorable!! Unfortunately, she was killed by the sheriff, it was so sad...But! Wallace took his revenge. I liked the way as even in jeopardy, Scottish were funny and courageous, and even if they had less weapons and less clothes to protect themselves, than the English. What's more, I admire courageous men (like Wallace) who can feel so sad if someone has made something bad to the girl they love. Braveheart was very admirable because it gave a moral, a lesson: ""fight for what you want"""

"aleyro-89845","10","3","5","16 January 2017"," A beautiful, tragic, sad, yet funny tale!
","You would have to look very hard to find a more complete movie than this one!<br/><br/>1. It's romantic - and I am not only referring to the love between William and Murron. (And later the short romance between him and the princess.) I'm also referring to the romantic aspect of being passionate about something and fighting for that passion, even when you've already lost everything and have little to no chance of winning! This movie has that and I find that aspect more romantic than anything else on screen! I know that this story is not a correct adaptation of what truly happened (the real story is very different in fact), but it is a very beautiful version of it!<br/><br/>2. It's funny! Despite every horrible thing happening it still finds time to crack some jokes every now and then and it doesn't do it inappropriately. The comedic touches are perfectly fitting and some lines are very quotable! <br/><br/>3. It's about love, family, equality, but most of all friendship! The chemistry between the characters is great! You believe they share a history! You believe their pain and their stories. You feel for them and want them to reach their goals! They make fun of each other and you can see the dynamic between William and his friends and understand why they are friends to begin with. Every character makes sense and there are no caricatures! <br/><br/>4. Every scene is relevant to the story! The story doesn't drag out in order to fill empty spaces with unnecessary scenes or dialogues. As a fan of ""A song of ice and fire"" and now also the TV-series adaptation - I think that ""Braveheart"" is the closest thing you can get (in a currently existing movie) to the feeling you get from watching GOT, so if you're a GOT fan like me - you'll like this movie! <br/><br/>5. It's tragic! Some people don't like tragedy in their movies - but a tragic story is an emotional one, and to me emotions are crucial when it comes to make me care about a movie as much as I do about this one. It makes me cry, it makes me laugh, it makes feel anger and disgust all at the same time! <br/><br/>6. The acting is great! The dialogue's are good, the characters are realistic! Even the English king - who I despise has real human weaknesses, which makes him a very believable character despite his person!<br/><br/>7. It's action-filled! And the fight-scenes are well done and don't look at all tacky as they so often do in so many other movies! I don't like ""modern"" war movies to be honest (they're too current and chaotic for my taste), but I love medieval battles, and I've seen enough of them to know what I'm talking about! <br/><br/>8. The landscape! And the costumes! And the structures! And the overall beauty of the scenery! It's perfect! I developed a sense of affection for the Scottish culture thanks to this movie!<br/><br/>9. It's history! (Although not entirely true.) It teaches us a little bit about what happened and how life used to be around 700 years ago. It's not based on fantasy (although I love fantasy) - it's based on reality! (And I want to emphasize the word ""based"" I because I want to make sure that anyone who reads this knows that I realize that the real William Wallace was far different from his portrayal in this movie. But the essential parts are still true) We owe it to ourselves to remind us of that history!<br/><br/>10. It's medieval! It has got swords, ""knights"" and kings!!! It has got strategy, intrigue, boldness and wit! It even addresses the struggles of being a homosexual in a society that doesn't accept it!<br/><br/>So there you got it! It's an action, war, romance, drama, medieval, tragic, comedy and historic movie about love, passion, friends, family, social injustice and the struggle for freedom and equality! I can't recommend it enough!"

","**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED, I SUGGEST VIEWING THE FILM BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU!** <br/><br/>Not only is this movie one of my favorite movies, it is one of the EXTREMELY FEW movies I had given an A+ grade from my point of view. Braveheart is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>When the movie begins, it starts out in William Wallace's childhood. As time progresses, he grows up and joins the war to free Scotland from English rule. One thing I like about the movie, is that it doesn't only tell the main characters story. We get attached to all the characters, and their stories thoroughly describe their purpose. The audience is able to make an emotional connection to all the characters, as well as to William Wallace (Mel Gibson) as leader of the Scottish rebellion. The story is well described. The movie shows how the Scottish people had been beaten, raped, and murdered, with very little they could do.<br/><br/>Scotland was so divided among the nobles, that the structure of the country was in fact no structure at all. The nobles were so worried about their land and getting rich that they didn't care about what the people of Scotland wanted. It's kind of sad, because that's how most of the world is working now days. Money is everything now. There is no REAL sense of value or life. William seen this as he grew up. After losing the love of his life. It really crushed me during this part. I made a connection to William, and how he must have felt. Not only did he fight because of this, he did it because of the people. He cared so much for his country, and his people, that he was willing to die for them. You feel this connection to William in this movie very strongly.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, there are lessons told as well. One that I got out of it was, ""no matter how great the challenge, anything can be accomplished no matter the situation, as long as you believe in it enough."" I got this sense from the first war between the Scots and the English. William led the Scots to annihilating all of England's northern army, with just a handful of people. The main message the plot sent me is love is the strongest thing we have. If you believe, and love something enough, you can do anything. If a love is taken from you, then you become the most dangerous thing to that thing who took it from you.<br/><br/>I had to hold back shedding tears during William's death. He believed in the freedom of the Scottish people so much, that not even torture could subdue his outlook. He would not bow to English rule. Even after his death, he had an effect on the people of Scotland, to the point that they continued to fight for their freedom. They seen clearly that it was possible, after William had shown them. They then eventually won their freedom, even when they were starving and outnumbered. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The acting is A+, the story and plot is A+, it's just an A+ movie all around. This is probably one of the best films of its time. Sincerely."

","It is simply wrong to pervert history in the way this film does. Reading the reviews, the many American reviewers seem to believe it as an accurate representation. It isn't. It takes more liberties that a Walter Scott novel The acting is also very mixed. The Irish accent of the actor playing the father of Wallace shines through for instance, and Gibson's attempt as a Scottish accent is almost on a par with Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Beautifully filmed with some fine performances (eg Brian Cox) it also has a haunting score, and it has entered movie history with so many of its effects and sayings entering popular culture, like Scots sports fans painting their faces blue. But it is tosh. Hardly any of it happened, the time line is way out and Gibson is far to short to play Wallace who was a giant of a man. For me, the reaction of Americans who constantly seek imaginary roots only goes to prove that as a nation they are on the dimmer side of average. Enjoy the film as a fairy tale but just remember it is a fairy tale."

","Mel Gibson in ""Braveheart"" not only received the deserved appreciation towards his direction (that he didn't received in ""The Man Without Face"") but also as an actor and managed to make one of the most beautiful and majestic epics ever made! ""Braveheart"" as I mentioned before is a majestic epic in so many details to be appointed, but all have one similarity, they were all made by the hands of Mel Gibson in a magnificent way.<br/><br/>The story is based on the great Scottish hero William Wallace (Mel Gibson), which after the death of his father and brother as a child and later the dead of love of his life Murron (Catherine McCormack), all by the hands of the British that at the time nurtured a cruel power in Scottish lands, at least until the great revolution that Wallace began not only in the name of revenge but for the beloved freedom for all the Scottish people.<br/><br/>Randall Wallace (script) manages to maintain the film in a good fit to historical characters and events that really existed. But Gibson's hands were everywhere, the film not only serves as a biography of the character and the human hero that Wallace was but thanks to the influence of Gibson the film manages to bring out a powerful message of freedom and what it means to be free. We see it from several good dialogs between the characters throughout the film and also the powerful speech that Wallace gives before the battle of ""Stirling"" (that wasn't actually very historically accurate but was Awesome as hell).<br/><br/>Not only in the script that Gibson put his hands and gave a beautiful message of freedom but also its magnificent direction that leaves all simply superb. His camera movements that show beautiful Scottish landscapes and scenes filmed beautifully leaving the film purely epic.<br/><br/>Not only landscapes and scenes that its direction stands out but mainly in the excellent battle scenes. Mel Gibson can leave all the battle scenes made with a great realistic feel without overrating it, by that I mean that when the battle starts and the armies collide we really feel that we are watching true humans smashing each other.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" not only manages to be the masterpiece of Mel Gibson in both direction and acting (PERFECT), but happens to be one of the most beautiful epics ever made. With a superb realistic feel without exaggeration and a beautiful message of freedom through a good writing and with a beautiful cast with terrific characters and a memorable soundtrack, ""Braveheart"" is far from perfect, but it is a magnificent epic to be remembered."

","Is there anyone who wouldn't have seen this film? I like to think there isn't. If there actually is, then you've missed a masterpiece, you must go and watch the movie and see the excellence with your own eyes. This movie was a born legend when it came out and the soul of it will never die. A story about courage, love and freedom.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie many times before and this night I watched it again, as I am the proud owner of the DVD. It's definitely in my personal Top 10 movies of all time -list. This movie's just perfect, honestly in any imaginable way. Mel Gibson's best role performance yet to date and also his best directing yet to date. Talking about the acting, this movie shines with amazing role performances from everyone who's in it. Mel Gibson as William Wallace the Braveheart himself, Patrick McGoohan as the mean evil king, Sophie Marceau as the princess whose desire of love makes her so likable, everyone in this movie performs their roles flawlessly, a real pleasure for the eyes indeed.<br/><br/>This movie has one of the best soundtracks ever composed to a motion picture, composed by the all mighty James Horner. That legendary bagpipe music makes my skin tremble every time I hear it and it's just so beautiful and fantastic it almost makes you cry. It's used in the exactly right places, with its raises and lowerings, just superb.<br/><br/>Not forgetting the battle scenes, which are among the best I've ever seen in a motion picture. They're just shot so realistically that your eyes freeze and you can't miss a second from them. From the emotional shoutings to weapons colliding together, from the Scottish bravery to the English strategies. The battle scenes are definitely not forced to be in the movie, they're also remarkable when it comes to the plot. Not just any fight scenes which would make the movie look like it's cooler, they really are in an important role. Just brilliant.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very well written, which makes the whole story so excellent. Almost 3 hours of excellence go in a blink of an eye. From loosing a loved one to fighting against England for freedom and for the whole Scotland it just progresses itself in a brilliant way. The movie is also very emotional and touching, the ending is genius in its own way and after all I like to think that the movie ends in a happy way rather than a sad way.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is perfect, or at least for me. How courage is described through the screen is just one of the best ones I've ever seen, all the emotions connected to it just makes it so magnificent. How it is to fight for something you really desire, it's just shot in a perfect way. Mel Gibson's directing won't let you down, as all the scenes are significant for the film itself. It's just so odd I haven't got a single bad word about this movie, usually there is something, but in this case it's so far from any bad word. If you haven't seen this movie, just do it already and stop wasting your time reading my review. Do it."

","It was among swords, sandals and battlefields that Mel Gibson truly found his directorial niche. 'Braveheart' proved a polarizing force ¬ñ a rare amalgam of war, heroes, romance and comedy (yes there is a surprising amount of fun to be found) ¬ñ that arguably catalyzed a series of sweeping epics including Gladiator. Undoubtedly, the aforementioned movies are typically seen as Oscar-bait and even more so when interwoven with historical references like Braveheart is. Unsurprisingly the film boldly snatched five heavyweight Oscars at the 1996 Academy Awards...<br/><br/>Yet it needs to be said that this was rightly earned, for Braveheart is an excellent film in which nothing feels missing or incomplete. It tells the heartfelt story of revenge ¬ñ not served as coldly as The Bride, rather with fierce intensity ¬ñ of William Wallace of Scotland against the corrupt Englishmen who long plagued the Scots for land, money and women. William grows up something of an intelligent brute; he is long-haired, scruffy, kilt-wearing and Sco'ish-drawling warrior, whom, upon the death of his beloved young wife by English lords, swears bloody revenge. He becomes so committed to vengeance and freedom that he rallies all Scottish clans under one banner ¬ñ for freedom! His appeal? He is exuding courage.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is busy navigating both a layered performance as national Scottich icon William Wallace and the direction of the film. Perhaps this is why the latter is kept relatively straightforward. This can be seen through the highly black-and-white image he projects of his characters. In other words, the English are almost exclusively corrupt, greedy and evil while the Scots are a lovable, brave bunch. It does not leave much room for interpretation, but then, this is a sweeping epic about a hero and not an elaborate character-study. Nevertheless, Gibson undoubtedly glosses over history in search for his perfect, idealist protagonist and the good news is that he truly finds him in this William. Gibson also portrays him with remarkable emotional transparency.<br/><br/>Stepping away from its characters, the battlescenes in 'Braveheart' are nearly unrivaled (well, they were until LOTR showed up) and deftly showcases the film's striking cinematography through the now-obligatory kinetic cutting of frames. The end result is fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping, graphic and gory. There is also a thankful poignancy of sorts that follows these fierce, outnumbered battles ¬ñ dynamic, escalating sense of patriotism among the Scots that translate well for the viewer as William raises his sword and cries out. It is owing to these moments and an assured centre from Gibson that regrettably shifts Angus MacFadyen's character Robert the Bruce to the backseat in the story, even though he inhabits a vital main role. You'll see.<br/><br/>'Braveheart' is an easy story to sell when you have the budget and actors ¬ñ its heartfelt and heroic content purposely jerks you for reactions: the dead father, the dead wife, the patriotic buddies, the evil villains, the pretty princess, the wailing 'epic' score by James Horner. It is spelled-out and extremely effective, making Braveheart into a worthwhile swords-n-sandals adventure.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

"sadrec1","10","3","5","20 June 2006"," A film that makes me proud of my heritage, history and name.
","I'm an American (hate me if you must). I am primarily of German descent, with some English, Swiss and Irish thrown in. But a good deal of my father's side is Scottish. I am descended from the Murrays, the Turnbulls and the Jacksons, and I am proud of it. This movie has only further cemented my pride. Mel Gibson (say what you want about his world-view, his directorial style, his factual accuracy) has created one of the greatest epics in cinema since ""Spartacus"" (I know, I know, usually it's ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but I've never seen that. I have seen ""Spartacus"", though, and loved it.) The story told is of one of the greatest national heroes of Scotland, William Wallace. He, like many, wanted a peaceful life; love, land, and a line, but he was willing to sacrifice that so that others may have that and something else as well: freedom. He lead an army of commoners against the mighty armies of England and King Edward ""Longshanks"" the I, and struck fear in the heart of tyrants and those who blindly serve them. Gibson plays this hero with courage and passion, bringing to life this man whose real life is still shrouded in uncertainty and mystery. Ultimately, he dies (in a fashion reserved for the highest traitors, but Gibson goes light for the sake of those who have already weathered over two hours of the bloodiest 14th century combat.) but his death inspires the men of Scotland to fight and die for the one thing Wallace chose to cry out for in his last breath. There are great performances across the board by Patrick McGoohan, the pagan king of England, Peter Hanly, his weak, homosexual son, and Angus Macfadyen, as the powerful Robert the Bruce (who is not officially my namesake; my grandfather's middle name was Robert, but I would be proud if Bruce was my namesake.) Macfadyen portrays a man born to power and authority, torn between his conniving father and Wallace. Ultimately, he chooses to follow in the footsteps of the fallen Wallace, saying the film's most powerful line: ""You have bled with Wallce, now bleed with me!"" Braveheart, though a hard film to watch due to it's sheer brutality, is now one of my favorite films. It makes me proud to be a (part) Scot, it makes me proud to be named Robert, and it makes me proud that my ancestor William of Rule (purportedly) saved Bruce from a raging bull, thus earning his clan their name."
"crabbtruxuk","10","3","5","11 June 2006"," Just a few thoughts ....
","...about the Scottish hero, William Wallace.<br/><br/>In reality a relatively privileged Frenchman from a noble family.<br/><br/>The reason why the Scottish nobles didn't unite behind Wallace was that Edward I was generally regarded by historians to be a wise and just King (although I have to admit, there are allegations that he might have been 'in touch with his feminine side').<br/><br/>The wars which escalated into the battles portrayed in the film, started as border skirmishes in which minor figures on BOTH sides had a crack at expanding their lands.<br/><br/>The princess who becomes Wallace's lover in the film, was 9 at the time he died. Today that would be illegal, presumably it was frowned upon even then! So then, A French pikey, greedy for extra lands with a penchant for little girls. Helluva national hero! ....mind you, Saint George was a Maltese knight, so perhaps we've all some some explaining to do?"
"MerryRane","10","3","5","18 April 2006"," Who says Braveheart isn't great?
","I've seen Braveheart over a million times and I still watch it to this day. It's a great movie with some amazing cinematography. Mel Gibson really saw something in the not-so-specific story of William Wallace and so he took that and ran wild with it, which is a good thing. Sure Braveheart is rather gory, but what if it wasn't? It wouldn't be so great, I can tell you that much. Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks, Kind Edward I) and Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce) portrayed their characters in a spectacular way. They showed perfectly how greed over power can force a man to do whatever it is in his will that lets him do so. Then there's always the good character, which here is William Wallace, but sometimes the/a good character can be tricked or persuaded into giving himself to the other side, for his life, or for something of lesser value. But Wallace (Gibson) didn't want that and he obviously didn't care whatever it was that was going to happen to him, because he wanted it not only for himself, but for his people. And that is a grand quality, and a grand character."

"pekinman","10","3","5","13 June 2005"," A rare great film
","It isn't often that a masterpiece emerges on the silver screen and even less often that it is directed by an American, but happily Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' is one of them.<br/><br/>It's basically a rip-snorting yarn about factual events in 13th century Scotland. Along with the blood and guts, realistically but not obnoxiously nauseating, is a stirring story of integrity and love. What makes this bit of history so fascinating is to also know the story of Edward II, the Prince of Wales in this film, and his Queen, Isabelle, a princess of France who later took hold of the reigns during Edward II's feeble reign. Remember, he's the one who died by having a red-hot iron inserted in his rear-end. A fitting, if extreme, conclusion to his life. Marlowe's play presents Edward II as some kind of victim of a conspiracy, which is true up to a point, but he was also a very corrupt and irresponsible monarch who needed to be removed. Those were rough times indeed.<br/><br/>The comparison between Tilda Swinton's Queen Isabelle in Jarman's film 'Edward II' and Sophie Morceau's Princess is telling. I was left thinking that she was a woman starved for love and affection in a court of ruthless betrayal and cold-heartedness. There is much food for thought of this nature in 'Braveheart.' <br/><br/>Mel Gibson is superb as William Wallace, the great Scots hero who died horribly at the hands of English torturers. The supporting cast is equal to Gibson's intensity.<br/><br/>This film was so good I didn't even notice the score or cinematography or editing... but all technical aspects are very fine. Maudlin sentimentality is also avoided; this film could have been a real wallow in lesser hands and would have lost a great deal of its impact as a result. <br/><br/>The makers of more recent epics like 'Alexander' and 'Troy' could learn a much by studying Gibson's film. Those recent duds pale into insignificance by comparison with this spectacular film.<br/><br/>Buy it!"
"jofitz27","9","3","5","29 May 2005"," Just about the best acted and most exciting film ever
","It's hard to believe 'Braveheart' a fantastic, emotional and hugely involving film, is ten years old. I only realised yesterday, when I re watched it, and noticed what a splendid film it is: not yet has there been a sword/medieval film so emotionally involving, brutal with a true message. Lame recent attempts such as 'Troy' haven't shown this, and don't even get me talking about the dreadfully box-office aimed 'King Arthur'; this is a great revenge flick, and an even better medieval sword classic.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is just a small child named William when his father dies. Already the film has your emotions running. Then, when he is an adult, his wife, whom he obviously deeply loves, is raped, beaten and killed, all in horrific detail. What a light opening thirty minutes.<br/><br/>No. This film isn't light. If you expected some clich√É¬©d fairytale classic you were wrong. This is stark, brutal cold: a mean, but effect, medieval film.<br/><br/>So William kills them all in surprisingly brutal fashion (pushing the bars of the films '15' certificate) and immediately changes his choice of revenge; he now wants to free the whole of Scotland.<br/><br/>His unexplained change in motives is fine. No-body cares since the sets are so realistic, so well done, you feel you are taken into this world. Mel Gibson acts with all emotion, as do the others: they really do, in their own modern lives, probably want some freedom. It may sound preposterous, but how on earth could these actors act so convincingly? Maybe Merlin waved his wand and had a say?<br/><br/>The fights are brutal, graphic, squeamish may well want to look away. But it is commendable and fine enough. Gibson, who directs, wants to show how terrible, dirty and down right insane these times were. He even admits, as his character, that both sides are savages. Despite the bias is towards Scotland, it carefully weaves in another message: no side is better, or right or wrong.<br/><br/>The love story between Gibson and the French princess may be a little short and unnecessary, but it can be forgiven.<br/><br/>***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)"
"walldavid","10","3","5","8 April 2005"," My Favourite Film of all time
","I didn't get to see this till '96 and always wondered what all the fuss was about. When I finally got to see it I was so disappointed I hadn't watched in on the big screen. I loved it. I loved it so much in fact, I've now watched it 52 times. Every time I watch it, I love it. It has everything a film should have. Great acting, amazing story, awesome sets and nice humour. I'm not the kind of person who can watch films over and over. There are a few, but when it comes to Braveheart, each viewing is like the first time all over again.<br/><br/>What I do have a problem with is the attitude of some people to the historical inaccuracies, the homophobia and the anti English tilt to it.<br/><br/>1. Every film can't be 100% historically accurate. It's not possible. The whole idea of a film is to entertain the audience. If history is missing something that makes a story even better, then the film makers are going to add that something to appeal to the masses. It's just common sense. Unless you're a low budget, independent, historian who wants to make an historically accurate (what is historically accurate anyway? We only know about history based on the writings of Men. Men who could very easily write what they want) film. He doesn't want to make millions on the film so he doesn't care if historical facts get in the way of entertainment. When millions is spent on an epic like Braveheart, you have to expect historical inaccuracies. We all know Wallace never met the Princess of Wales, but it makes for a great story.<br/><br/>2. The Homephobic angle - Well, what do you expect? This was the 14th Century. Do you think being Gay was accepted in society? Do you think Longshanks would have welcomed his sons Boyfriend into the family? The film needed to portray the Prince as a weak and useless man. It also opened the door for the King himself to do any procreation as the prince wasn't interested in sex with the princess. This makes the scene when the King is dying even more appropriate as she get's to tell him that she's pregnant, but not with his child.<br/><br/>3. The Anti English flavour - Duh! It's a film with a Scottish Rebel as the hero. Of course it's going to have an Anti English flavour to it. Do you think it should have been more sympathetic to the English? Why? Should Shindlers List have portrayed the Nazis in a better light? the audience needs to feel some of the feelings the hero's felt. To do this, we have to also hate the English as they are in the film. It makes it a lot more enjoyable watching soldiers getting their legs chopped off etc etc :) <br/><br/>All in all, Braveheart for some is an excellent film, for others it's the greatest film of all time and for some reason, some people think it's crap. We are all entitled to our opinions but please don't try to tell us that it's the worst film ever, just because you don't favour it's anti English feel or it's portrayal of it's gay prince or it's historical inaccuracies. These do not take away from the fact that the film is excellently made, brilliantly acted and very well deserving of all it's Oscars!"

"PhilipJames1980","10","3","5","22 August 2002"," All men lose heart...and this movie will give it right back to them!
","Although hundreds of good comments have already been posted for this movie, and mine will probably not be a stand-out among all the others, I still felt compelled to add my own; because after seven years, Braveheart is still my favorite movie, and still one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I saw Braveheart for the first time in June of 1995, at a local theater; and it was one of the most satisfying moviegoing experiences of my life.  Not many movies cause me to feel a little transformed after I've seen them, but Braveheart certainly did: From its opening scene of breathtaking landscapes and stirring music, to its final shot of a sword planted in a seemingly endless field, it truly was and still is a tour de force of storytelling.<br/><br/>Braveheart is a movie blessed with many qualities, but more than anything a dual sense of achievement: on the one hand William Wallace, a legendary figure who accomplished the impossible by leading the Scots when no one else would; and on the other hand Mel Gibson, who demonstrated with this movie a directorial talent that we (or I, at least) never suspected he had. Previously, I had Gibson pigeonholed as a likable but goofy action hero from the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon series: his flip personality never indicated a passion for directing an intensely romantic and dramatic epic.  The Man Without a Face proved that Gibson could direct a good movie; Braveheart proved that he could direct a great one.<br/><br/>Gibson's greatest accomplishment in Braveheart (besides the battle sequences) is that he elicited excellent performances from the entire cast: every actor and actress (even those who appear for only a few SECONDS of the movie) hits exactly the right note.  In fact, I'm outraged that Braveheart received no Oscar nominations for its acting: Why honor Gibson as Best Director of 1995, yet ignore the performances which are the fruits of his labors?  I'm not saying that any particular person in Braveheart (Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Angus McFadyen) SHOULD have won an acting Oscar: it's the fact that NOBODY WAS EVEN NOMINATED that bothers me.<br/><br/>But I love this movie too much to waste my time complaining.  Before I can mention more of what I love about Braveheart, however, I must address one more inevitable topic.<br/><br/>I am aware that this movie is historically inaccurate: Even in 1995, when I first saw Braveheart, I knew enough military history to know that the battles of Sterling and Falkirk were not being accurately presented.  But this awareness did not and does not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie, because Braveheart exists outside of history: like Dances With Wolves, Robin Hood, The Last of the Mohicans, and The Three Musketeers, it is an emotionally rich epic inspired by history yet not confined to it, less concerned with accuracy to every detail than with the eternal struggles of good and evil, love and hatred, freedom and oppression.  And isn't that enough?  Braveheart is one of the most stirring movies I've ever seen: If you can't reconcile yourself to its inaccuracies and simply enjoy it on its own terms, then I feel sorry for you.<br/><br/>Patrick McGoohan's performance as Longshanks has, in my opinion, not received nearly enough praise: After seven years, it remains the best (and most entertaining) villainous performance I've seen in any movie.  He masterfully plays the king as a man who embodies the phrase 'absolute power corrupts absolutely'; he commands an entire nation, yet covets what he does not or cannot have.  He answers to no one, and can barely restrain himself: he does not even try to conceal his contempt for his homosexual son, his lust for his daughter-in-law, his rage against any obstacle to his will. The performance is also physically impressive (Significant SPOILER): we see the king gradually consumed by tuberculosis through the movie, and McGoohan makes the ordeal so believable that, though Longshanks is unrepentant to the end, we are moved to pity for him.<br/><br/>Besides McGoohan, Angus McFadyen (as Robert the Bruce) gives the most impressive performance in Braveheart.  When I first saw the movie, I identified with William Wallace; but now I identify with Robert the Bruce, who is in fact the key figure of the story.  He is not a great man like Wallace, but he wants to be great, and he idolizes Wallace so much that he is almost overwhelmed to hear Wallace tell him ""If you would lead us, I would follow you.""  But the Bruce is warned by his sly, leperous father (played unforgettably by the late Ian Bannen beneath Oscar-winning makeup) to not live a life of action, but rather a life of calculation.  As he wrestles with the dual influences of Wallace and his father, he embodies a theme at the movie's heart: the eternal conflict between youth and age, idealism and cynicism, uncompromising heroism and craven opportunism.<br/><br/>When I first saw Braveheart, I was most impressed by the power of its battle sequences; after seven years, I am most impressed by the enduring power of its story.  It is a great movie because it seriously argues that one man's lifelong struggle can make a difference, if not in the world then at least in the lives of others; it is a great movie because it is ultimately an inspiring story of perseverance in the face of considerable brutality and heartbreak; it is a great movie because a thousand words are not adequate to express all its emotional power and impact.  I could not give Braveheart less than a perfect score, even if I wished, because it is much more to me than mere entertainment: It is a constant reminder to me that I must never lose heart.<br/><br/>""You have bled with Wallace...now bleed with me!""<br/><br/>If that moment in the movie doesn't make a Scotsman out of you, laddie, then nothing will!<br/><br/>Rating: 10"

And a great one at that.  If you ever watch it again, look at Gibsons eyes.  There is such rage and passion, and many did not see that because they were busy saying, ""This text doesn't say it happened that way.""

Politicians have their own ways, you know.<br/><br/>As for the movie, which is for me a masterpiece of directing, I saw it more than seven times, and still, each time William Wallace talks to his people, an electric wave sweeps my head and tears flow out naturally. This is because he is the hero we have been waiting for all our lives, and hadn't arisen yet. This is because one man loved more than we could ever hope for. William Wallace didn't fight for honour, didn't fight for money, didn't fight for pleasure nor justice. He fought for Love. He fought for Freedom. But all this relates to the freedom of choice, the liberty of will.<br/><br/>You could ponder about it for as long as you wish, you'll find that this cinematographical achievement has it all. The power of entertainment, the might of words, the logic of situations, and above all, a never ending display of human senses and emotions. It doesn't get any better than this.

Richard III-- uh uh, no way.  <br/><br/>Let's face it-- despite the fact that Braveheart is a better movie than any filmed Shakespeare (outside of Kurosawa)-- it is not historically accurate, either, and if that is the sole standard by which you judge movies then you are going to be sadly disappointed in it.

"bhicks56","9","3","5","24 November 1999"," Masterpiece with a few cracks
","It's a magnificent epic with sad trials of love and the most graphic and realistic battle scenes ever witnessed on film.<br/><br/>But there's one thing that kept getting on my nerves.<br/><br/>I think it was Mel Gibson. You get a different kind of feeling watching Mel in LETHAL WEAPON, probably because he was younger. You get a different feeling watching MAD MAX, probably because it was made before he was a Hollywood leading man.<br/><br/>Here he is the older Hollywood star we are most familiar with. But he has a great talent under those charming looks, and even a great eye for directing, as witnessed here.<br/><br/>But his blue eyes and scraggly wig kept me from believing he was the savage he was portraying. No matter how hard he tried to hide that.<br/><br/>
The best parts of the movie are the battle scenes and the medieval Scotland authenticity. The movie sucks you in a time period that is both brutal and romantic. The supporting acting is superb, especially the breathtaking Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabelle, the ruthless Patrick McGoohan (what a great voice for a baddie!) as Longshanks and Angus MacFading, who I kept finding more interesting than Gibson, as Robert the Bruce. Catherine McCormack had a haunting beauty in the film, especially in her presence as a ghost.<br/><br/>And, yes, Mel Gibson gives all he's got as the lead. But did he really have to bag the Princess?<br/><br/>Oh and one more thing Mel, how about doing a movie where your wife DOESN'T DIE?!! I think you hold the record in that category already."

Director Mel Gibson made it shine like no other could have. There are so many moments of profound beauty and dignity. After 170 minutes you just know that there is so much more to life than seemed to be three hours ago. This movie is about faith, freedom, courage and true love. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, an inspiring masterpiece."
"moviesleuth2","10","4","8","20 June 2008"," One of the great epics of our time
","The best thing about the good epics is that you feel right there with the hero. At every step you want your hero to succeed and the villain to fail. The rousing feeling you get flowing through you is rushing through you at full speed, and everything else around you ceases to exist. ""Braveheart"" is like that. Mel Gibson's medieval epic is bursting with power an intensity, and it is filmed on a grand scale that is both a joy to the eye and the spirit. The characters are larger than life, the action sequences are bloody and exciting, and William Wallace is a man that anyone can sympathize with.<br/><br/>William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is a Scotsman (kilt included), and nothing will change that. But times are hard for the Scots. The English hold an oppressive rule over Scotland, and it's ruled by the tyrannical Longshanks (aka King Edward I, played by Patrick McGoohan). Eventually William Wallace decides he's had enough, so he arouses his fellow Scots in a fight for freedom.<br/><br/>That's the gist of it, though in a very general sense. Yes, I left a lot out, but see the movie! The acting is terrific. Mel Gibson knows what he is doing with William Wallace. Wallace is broadly drawn in the fashion of epics, but Gibson plays him with such intensity that he's always interesting and it's impossible NOT to root for the guy. Patrick McGoohan may not be the BEST villain, but he's villainous enough to really hate. Sophie Marceau does a lot with a small role. Despite not having much screen time, Marceau is skilled enough to develop her character a lot. She's quiet and obedient on the surface, but inside she's independent and intelligent. It's a star-making performance, and it's a pity she isn't as popular as she deserves. Angus Macfayden is arguably the weakest of the main characters, but he's adequate. He ably portrays a conflicted man whose sympathies are torn. Also good are Brendan Gleeson as Wallace's right-hand man, Hamish, and Catherine McCormack as Wallace's lover, Murron. Comic relief is supplied, but thankfully not overused, by David O'Hara as the nutty Irishman, who (literally) talks to God. And it's hilarious to see James Cosmo as Hamish's father, who despite being an old geezer, is a nearly psychotic warrior.<br/><br/>As a director, Mel Gibson clearly knows how to craft an epic. ""Braveheart"" is his best film by far. It's grand, it's exciting, and it's rousing entertainment. Despite being almost three hours long, it never drags. Though his later films demonstrate this as fact, ""Braveheart"" shows that Gibson is not afraid of showing graphic violence and gore (both of which are plentiful in ""Braveheart""). To be fair, Gibson shows the ugliness of violence, but wisely only uses it to enhance the film, not to make the viewer feel guilty or depressed. Part of the reason why this film works so well is that it uses real people as extras (or at least it seems to). Lately, big-budget movies use a lot of CGI to create big crowds, but it's been done so many times that it has long since become boring and overblown. It's refreshing to see huge masses of people that are REALLY PEOPLE.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" is a very good film, but it's not perfect. The development is a little rushed at times in the first half, and sometimes things can get a trite confusing. But this is nitpicking. ""Braveheart"" is a brilliant film, and a must-see for anyone."

Another reason why you might not like the film is that you have actually never seen it or haven't seen the whole film. And finally you cant get passed the gore because you have a weak stomach.

Are homosexuals not like straight people with variations in strength of character? Perhaps the PC brigade only want to see positive images of homosexual men portrayed no matter the truth?

But all is not well in the world, and Mel's wife is murdered smack in the middle of their honeymoon. Mel flips out and seeks revenge, not only on his wife's killer, but on just about everyone else who was directly or indirectly complicit in her death, which includes the entire population of England.<br/><br/>Instead of an awesome car and a sawed-off shotgun, this time he's got a huge sword and blue warpaint. Otherwise it's the same story. It doesn't end too well, and there were no sequels.<br/><br/>However, there are other parallels to earlier Mel Gibson flicks: for example, the English villains are either violent sadists or homosexuals, just like the baddies in The Road Warrior. Like those movies, Braveheart is also pretty gruesome.<br/><br/>There have been rumors that this movie was a historical epic, but don't be fooled: it's a revenge pic, longer and a little more bloodthirsty, but still just a B-movie.

","""Braveheart"" received much criticism from certain History Buffs upon its release. They said that the filmmakers portrayed Scotsman William Wallace as a brave, heroic, good man. History Buffs, however, say that he was just as vicious as the English and spared no one. Well, thank you for that, Mr. History Teacher(s). If I wanted to learn about history I wouldn't be going to see a movie starring Mel Gibson, with the tagline ""All men die. Not all men really live,"" would I? I enjoyed every inch of ""Braveheart,"" and if I wanted a history lesson, I'd go see ""Gods and Generals,"" which turned out to be a horrible film - which just goes to show that historical accuracy can sometimes break a film and not make it.<br/><br/>Gibson plays William Wallace, a Scot who decides to revolt against the British after his wife is killed by a pack of the thievin' scoundrels! The film is LOOSELY based on his life - since no one really knows much about Wallace other than what he did: free Scotland from the English for a while (when I say ""for a while,"" it is because their ""flee-e-e-edom!"" only lasted for a while...), so much of the story is made up. But like I said, I'm not looking for a history lesson when I go to see a movie like this.<br/><br/>This is a first director outing for Gibson, who not only gives us one of his best - if not the best - performance of his career, other than those great ""Lethal Weapon"" movies! He handles the direction very well for an actor-turned-director. He doesn't try anything memorable - no fancy camera sweeps to make us motion sick - but he directs the film like the old epics. One of many great things about the film. <br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent. I can't think of another film that is quite so beautiful to behold. It is truly wonderful to watch the surroundings fly by the screen, purely unadulterated.<br/><br/>As for Gibson's Scottish accent...well...he speaks surprisingly well with a Scottish accent, and doesn't sound like an American-Australian phony (isn't he an Aussie?). There is a great supporting cast in this film, as well, with a man in a rubber nose that you might not be able to place at first glance...<br/><br/>James Horner's magnificent score is truly marvelous to behold. He mixes Scottish bagpipes and emotion into a little bundle that in and of it makes you feel emotional. It plays during the film at just the right moments and makes it easier to feel elated or depressed.<br/><br/>All in all, I think that ""Braveheart"" stands as one of the best films I have ever seen. It is an epic in all sense of the word; I don't care how historically incorrect it is. If I wanted a history lesson, I wouldn't be going to see a film like this.<br/><br/>5/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

","That was great! It's so refreshing to see a genuine portrayal of medieval life without the sugar coating given by other low budget film's that mislead the viewer into thinking that people back then had more of a sense of honor and duty than they do now. This film gets a lot of unnecessary flack from people due to it's violent content, but THATS HOW LIFE WAS BACK THEN! Mel exposes this in a expert and dynamic way. As a director Mel Gibson is nothing shorter then amazing. During the battles you feel as though this is a first hand documentary account dropped on a real life battle. And it's real! There is no CGI. That big army was made up of thousands of extras. It wasn't a cartoon with digital effects running rampant. It's genuine. When it's raining that's not a rain machine. Mel was wise enough to recognize that it would be better to shoot the scene's in the rain if and when it did rain, to give it that authentic look. If the characters were mint clean in ever shot like Orlando Bloom was in The Lord of The Rings that would have looked phony. Mel pulls very few punches except in the scene of William Wallaces execution that doesn't even show the disembowelment. A show of restraint by Mel. However at one point there is hardly even one scene that can go without someone getting killed. In one of those scene's the English kings throws an unsuspecting man out a window just for simply showing confidence, and submitting his advice. There have been few movies I've seen recently where I truly despised a character and was routing for them to get their punishment but BraveHeart does just that in creating a truly despicable character in the British king. The king would later die a much simpler death than the ones he gave other people. Back then if you were a sociopath with power you got away with murder. The royalty had little respect for the life of people they found inferior. The peasants were mere pawns to them. There is one moving scene in which a prince in a moment of self realization is brought to tears by his past actions, in which he tells his father; ""Those men who fight for me, fight cause if they don't I'll starve their wives, and burn their homes."" (That quote may not be exact.) After which he boldly states; ""I will not be on the wrong side again!"", choosing a soul over depravity. This was not a wicked film drunk on blood and gore, it had a true heart, but there are still people who refuse to see that. There are already plenty of watered down swordfests for you squeamish types stinking up video stores like The Golden Compass or Lord of The Rings. However if you want to see something genuine watch this you'll be amazed.<br/><br/>(And to all those people who keep voting down this review... F**K YOU!)"

","One of the best epics ever put to screen.. The story, acting, and directing were great enough, but throw into it beautiful visuals and music and you have a timeless masterpiece. Once again the people with no artistic vision only complain about the historical accuracy of the film and to those again I say this. There is NO such thing as historical accuracy of events that took place long ago. Its all either hear-say passed on,or political propaganda. Last time I checked there was no CNN crews hundreds of years ago. There was no video recording of anything as it unfolded. Only documentation written usually long after events happened. And again because the country you happen to live in has a history book that you read as a child you accept it as proof of something. Please give it a rest.. Braveheart was the telling of a incredible story of a ordinary man who helped his nation overcome extraordinary odds.. It was told beautifully and with great passion on the screen. Thats what we're talking here. Movie-making."

The problem is, most don't and this won Oscars for Gods sake.<br/><br/>First of all, how can anyone give this film a 10/10, the characters are black and white, good vs evil, so completely unrealistic.  The story uses historical characters that actually existed and then makes up the entire story.  Basically you have a violent thug, who somehow can speak French and Latin, who hasn't had a bath ever and he's sleeping with the future Queen of England, come on.<br/><br/>Can you imagine the outrage if the KKK replaced the Scottish and the English were all black, the film would have been banned in a second.  Yet because it's the English that are nasty, that's ok.<br/><br/>If I made a movie portraying Abraham Lincoln as a child molester and a wife beater, who raped and killed innocent children, then claimed it was true, received 10/10 in this site and won an Oscar as best director.  Wouldn't a few Americans find it offensive, oh no it's ok, it's just Hollywood, that's all right.<br/><br/>I can accept that an historical Hollywood film might be inaccurate, but portraying a whole nation as evil and ugly is very offensive and moreover acknowledging it as great film is even worse."

"r-fronimides","7","2","3","21 October 2019"," Nice film to spend your time...
","...but this film is perhaps the one with most historical inaccuracies, ever!!!<br/><br/>First, the NATIONAL HERO of Scotland William Wallace wasn't a poor peasant taken by an uncle to visit... Rome or Paris. There was a Wallace HOUSE, the man was NOBLE. Not too much important, not so much rich, but wasn't a ""simply nobody man"" as the film portraits.<br/><br/>Second, obviously, he didn't had emotional/sexual relationship with the... Princess of Wales, the future QUEEN OF ENGLAND!!!!! King Edward's son was a moron, a stupid arrogant lad,... but there is no evidence that he was a homosexual - as the film wants to mock him.<br/><br/>Third, the Scots did fighting ""painted"" like that. That was the traditional way of fight of THE SCOTTISH ANCIENT ANCESTORS, the ""Picts""; which a nickname from the Latin word ""Picti"" which means ""PAINTED"" (FOLK). The Roman Legionaries started calling them ""Picti""/""Pict"", because the ancient Scots were fighting NAKED with full body paint job (traditional paganistic protection designs)! And the colour was dark-blue or black, nothing like that cyan of Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>Fourth, the modern MARK of Scots, the ""kilt"" skirt with the clan ""tartans"", were found around 17th century, ""just... few"" (four!) centuries later! There were NO CLANS/HOUSES' specific clothing or emblems, in the era of Wallace.<br/><br/>Fifth, the Sterling Bridge battle took place on... guess what?... a BRIDGE!!!! That was the (clever) plan of Wallace. There was a SINGLE semi-stone-semi-wooden VERY NARROW bridge, leading folks from Northern England to Southern Scotland. The English army had to use that narrow bridge to cross the river and invade Scotland and THERE was the place Wallace abused them. The (much more) greater army had to be a narrow line of 2-men-weight and cross the bridge... which was an easy task for the waiting Scots on the other side of the bridge! They also used the ""schiltron"" formation (a pack of men carrying large lances/spears) and they massacre the English army.<br/><br/>In the film, they do have a ""short of schiltron"" formation but they're facing the HEAVY UNDEFEATED ENGLISH CAVALRY... in open field!!!!!! They would CRASH the Scots like a bowl of crapes!<br/><br/>Five, they showing (as the Scots) the English having UNIQUE ONE design of uniforms, as a modern army. Nope. NOBODY HAD unique single design uniforms at that era! Not even in Napoleon's era, they didn't had unique single design, but many many designs (and most of the times, the men were confused who was the enemy on the battlefield).<br/><br/>(Its the same ""classic"" mistake they're doing in US CIVIL WAR films!!!!! They're always showing the North wearing the dark-blue uniforms and the CSA Rebels wearing the Grey! Nope! Everybody was wearing HIS OWN CLOTHING, mostly grey-BROWN clothes. SOME Northern Regiments had the famous dark-blue uniforms, but only at the late of the war. And most of the GENERALS (North & South) had the VERY SAME UNIFORM, the early-days WEST POINT grey uniform, which BOTH (North-South) were wearing the same, since they both were students of the ONE ONLY MILITARY academy!)<br/><br/>...I could write for ever. As I wrote in the start, this film has the MOST historical inaccuracies, ever! But... but... still, remains one of the MOST ENJOYABLE films I ever watched.<br/><br/>And VERY EMOTIONAL!!!! Even if you are not Scot, you'll cry in many scenes! Especially in the very LAST SCENE (no spoils)... which I'm crying like baby EVERY time I watching the film!<br/><br/>Overall? Horrible Historical film... but AMAZING to watch it."

","""Braveheart is a good film? I would put four stars out of five. I'm not a big fan of ""adventure and war"" films like this but it's true that it's a great film, the large landscape scenes, and especially the war scenes which are impressive. I mean it's a big movie so in general who doesn't like big movie like this ? The music, the actions and the part of romance make up a good mix in the film. The music and images put in a good atmosphere, a Scottish atmosphere. Mel Gibson has made a great job in the role of director and in the role of actor too. He passed on a lot of emotion, he succeeded in that and he got a really strong presence that make him credible in the role. However, we can't overlook the fact that the film didn't respect the real story. Indeed, William Wallace existed and some passages of the movie do not respect the real facts, like his death, or his marriage, etc... It is why I would not put five stars."
"slightlymad22","8","2","3","16 January 2017"," An Incredible Second Directorial Effort From Gibson
","Continuing my plan to watch every Mel Gibson movie in order, I come to Braveheart (1995)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: William Wallace (Gibson) begins a revolt against King Edward I of England, after his wife is executed for assaulting an English Soldier who tried to tape her. <br/><br/>I love this movie, it takes a while to get going, we don't see Gibson for over 20 minutes as the movie takes its time showing his early years. But once it gets going it's a sweeping, gripping epic movie. <br/><br/>Brilliantly acted, as well as directed, One of the best compliment I can pay this movie is it doesn't look like a Hollywood movie, it's locations for example, look green, but very muddy and very wet!! There is so much in this movie that is deserving of praise, but it's the battle scenes that stand out in this movie!! Once they start, they are often violent, bloody and very graphic!! But it never feels like shock gore (as so common now a days) it feels appropriate and it makes the world feel real. <br/><br/>It's even more impressive when you consider this was only Gibson's second movie as director!! It's interesting to note Gibson didn't actually want the role of William Wallace, as he felt he was too old, however Paramount would only finance the movie (With a $53 million budget) if he would star in it. <br/><br/>If there is a criticism of this film it is how it handles the love affair between Wallace and Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau), at 3 hours long, the movie didn't need to be any longer, but they meet, they're in love, she's pregnant, she's gone. It's all so rushed and it takes a little away from it all. <br/><br/>Braveheart didn't do as well as I thought, at the domestic box office, grossing $75 million to end the year the 18th highest grossing movie of 1995. I thought for certain this would have topped $100 million domestically!! But as I scrolled down the list, looking for where it ended amongst the years top grossing movies I was very surprised to see it so low, as I thought it would be amongst his top grossers.<br/><br/>I'm sure the lack of box office returns was made up by the fact that Gibson won two Oscars, one for best director and the other for best movie for Braveheart."

The glorification of the Scots and the concomitant delineation of the English as Satan's imps, forgive me, speaks more to Mel being an Australian than to historical veracity. There is this unrelenting demonetizing of the English right out of a comic book. The Lords Of The Congregation who ruled over Scotland, for a time, were not renowned for their heavenly saintliness towards papists. This is the other problem the movie's deep sense of historical unreality about it. You feel right away that you are getting a parallax view, a very biased one sided picture."

The Love story of Wallace and his wife has always been beautiful throughout history and every story told about them its a very historical time during the king Edward Era... I don't know if the story between the prince and and the princess were true but looking it up it seems true..

"joshua-benson38","9","2","3","2 October 2013"," Good Focused Film
","The makers of the film took their history books and carefully tossed them aside so that Mel Gibson could have a free hand to portray a completely virtuous William Wallace and his struggle against the English. Despite this ""black and white"" approach to history, it is still a highly enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The film has great scenes, with majestic shots of the Scottish highlands and sweeping battlefields, castles and towns and an appropriate score to match. The film is well- cast, led by Mel Gibson, who is energetic as William Wallace and handles the action, speeches and drama well. My favorite performance is from Patrick McGoohan, who revels in being despicable to the Scottish and his meek son as King Edward Longshanks. Angus Macfadyen brings out an interesting character in Robert the Bruce. The rest of the cast is solid as well from both the Scottish and English camps.<br/><br/>The story is paced nicely, first focusing on developments in character and then proceeding quickly into action. There are a number of interesting turns in the story along the way. This film is also notable for its large scale epic battle scenes, which are well-staged. ""Braveheart"" is not history, but it is still an engaging film about a struggle for independence in the Middle Ages."

","Mel Gibson has come so far in the movie business and he not only stars but directed Braveheart. He did a terrific job and deserves a lot of credit for this remarkable film. Despite it not being totally accurate with history, anyone can enjoy ""Braveheart"". Based on the life story of William Wallace, a town peasant who just wants to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children. But when the British king of England, Longshanks, is sick of Scotland ""being full of Scots"", he comes up with a way of bringing them more into a British land by ""breeding them out"". Promising any British soldier to a Scotish bride on her wedding night before her husband can have her. Wallace won't hear of it and marries his love in secret. When a British soldier notices his wife and attempts to rape her, Wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in their village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away from the soldiers, but they catch her and kill her right in front of her family."

","This film is perhaps one of the most entertaining stories that Hollywood has produced to date.  It is of course completely historically inaccurate, though it is certainly not the only, nor the most recent, film to obscure historical truths and still be impressively well done.  Gibson does nothing new with this movie, as it is a classic blend of adventure, romance, morality, and comic relief.  What Gibson does do, however, is weave these aspects together with greater skill than most.  To compare this story to history is futile, as is comparing the Bard's tale of Julius Caesar to the actual occurrences in ancient Rome.  While based on historical events the purpose of this and any movie is to entertain.  Education, while a good and noble purpose, is not nor should it be the primary goal of the cinema. While Braveheart will not educate as to the events in medieval Scotland, it will indeed tell a tale that has been told the world over in a million variations.  Some call Braveheart laughable and trite and in some respects these critics are not wrong.  My counter to this argument is that all epics, from The Odyssey to Beowulf to the Lord of the Rings, are by nature laughable and trite.  The story of William Wallace as presented by Braveheart is not the story of the man who lived in Scotland centuries ago but the story of every epic hero.  As an epic, the story must invariably deal with and contain archetypes so broadly ranging that they must be described as laughable and trite.  That Braveheart is a very basic story, which I will admit, by no means qualifies it as a bad story.  Instead it is an epic story, and a very good one at that."

BRAVEHEART is easily one of the best films of 1995. Watching it, you really get a sense of what movies are all about. I've always thought Mel has had a flair for giving audiences what they want. Even when he was working in Australia, doing such projects as The Bounty and the Mad Max films, I knew there was a creative genius behind those great and under-rated performances. His work in BRAVEHEART is exactly what I had in mind. This is truly a labor of love for Mel, showing real pride in the quality of his craft. I loved the power of this film, emotionally and visually. William Wallace is a savage, but he always represents what he consistently stands to achieve: love, happiness, and most importantly, freedom. You can feel the majesty of the story, weaving Shakespearean edges within it without making it seem like it was made for a privileged few. Patrick McGoohan, who got gipped for an Oscar nod, is brilliant as King Edward, despicable in a collected demeanor. There is even a sense of humour to boot in this epic, bringing a bit of Scottish wit to an intensely serious and bloody carnage of a film. In this regard, I would compare it to Shakespeare. The attention to detail, the emotion, the power of BRAVEHEART prove Mel Gibson definitely has a flair for genius and a gift for entertaining the public. This is not to be missed!

	The entire movie is engaging but two scenes stand out: The `gift of the thistle' moment when the beautiful young Murron presents the young Wallace with a wildflower at his father's funeral.  Few tableaus in film history can match the power here as the music swells in harmony with touching scene. The tremendous Stirling battle scene (though vastly historically inaccurate) is also a piece de resistance, from Wallace's rousing speech to his contempt for the English commander, from the comic relief of the mooning and flashing of the recalcitrant Scots and finally the riveting battle itself (that may only possibly be rivaled by Saving Private Ryan's D-Day landing sequence for sheer power in a battle scene).  It's also notable that the script and Gibson's direction provide for a juxtaposition of this violence with the soothing powers of femininity; the bride who eases her husband's wrath sotto voce and gently pushes the adversaries blade from his throat, the lure of a life with Murron in which Wallace initially attempts to stay clear of war and the obvious benevolence of the princess.<br/><br/>

","Throughout the ages, oppression has taken many forms, rearing it's ugly head to deny the liberty and the rights of people everywhere, and the cry of `Freedom' and the inherent longing to be free of tyranny in any of it's many incarnations is universal and older than recorded history.  Man has fought on one battlefield or another and in one arena after another in an effort to rid himself of the shackles that bind him, and he has always paid a dear price for that freedom.  `Braveheart,' directed by and starring Mel Gibson, is the story of one man who would not abide the despotic rule of an unworthy sovereign, and took a stand against it.  A 13th Century commoner and a patriot who loved his country, Scotland, William Wallace (Gibson) burned with an unquenchable desire to be free of the British, who had murdered his father when William was just a boy.  Raised by kin, Wallace nevertheless grew up wanting only to marry, work his farm and raise a family.  But circumstances dictated otherwise, and without knowing what they had unleashed, the British rekindled that fire that burned within the boy, and Wallace soon left his mark on the Monarchy of King Edward I of England.<br/><br/>	Wallace was a man of singular determination, and managed to do what no one else had ever been able to do before him:  He united the clans of Scotland. Before Wallace, the clans stubbornly clung to their autonomy, changed loyalties whenever the mood struck them or the price was right, and endured the domination of the British because of it.  Wallace changed all that, by convincing them that by standing together as one, they could win.  And he proved it.  He amassed an army and made a stand at York, and again on the battlefields of Stirling and Falkirk.  With savage tenacity and courage, he never gave in nor gave up his relentless and heroic quest to make Scotland free.  <br/><br/>	Gibson brings Wallace to life with a performance worthy of the man he portrays.  To achieve what he did, Wallace had to be larger than life, and that's exactly what Gibson brings to the screen.  But he plays him as a man, not a hero; Gibson's Wallace is very real, and someone you can believe would be able to stand before an army and lead them into battle.  In one memorable scene Wallace, mounted on a spirited horse, addresses his men-- many of whom had just joined him-- as they are about to engage the enemy at Stirling. Someone from amongst the crowd calls out, `We heard Wallace is seven feet tall!'  To which Wallace replies, `I AM William Wallace!'  And by the time he finishes his powerful speech (which screenwriter Randall Wallace openly confesses was liberally borrowed from Shakespeare's `Henry V'), spurring them on and preparing them for the impending battle, you believe he IS seven feet tall.  It's an inspired performance through which Gibson shows you the man behind the legend, while at the same time he makes you understand just how and why the legend was born.  <br/><br/>	And, as impressive as Gibson is in front of the camera, what he does behind the camera with this film is even more impressive.  The magnitude of this film is awe inspiring, and that Gibson could carry it as an actor, while directing it as well, is quite a feat, indeed.  He used the bleak weather of Scotland and Ireland to great advantage in scene after scene, creating the perfect atmosphere in which to tell his story; he experimented with different camera speeds, especially when filming Catherine McCormack (Murron), which gave her a more graceful, sensuous look; he staged some of the most compelling battle sequences ever made; and he captured the intricacies of the characters-- all with an eye for detail and the ability to integrate it all into a film that took home the Oscar for Best Picture, while deservedly landing him the Award for Best Director.  It was obviously a labor of love for Gibson, but the hard work paid off handsomely in the end, especially for the audience, for it is they who realize the real fruits of this endeavor-- a truly stirring and memorable motion picture.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks), Sophie Marceau (Isabelle), Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce), Brendan Gleeson (Hamish) and Peter Hanly (Prince Edward).  A film of epic proportions, `Braveheart' is emotionally involving and inspiring, with a message about the irrepressible capacity of the human spirit.  Gibson put everything he had into this one, and it shows; this is his `Citizen Kane,' a pinnacle of achievement that few actor/directors every attain.  With brilliant cinematography (by John Toll), some of the finest editing you'll ever see (by Steven Rosenblum), terrific performances and Gibson's special touch, this is an unforgettable film that demonstrates what the magic of the movies is really all about.  If you love movies, this is one you simply do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10."
"jg167","10","2","3","28 December 2000"," Most romantic movie ever or just most gory?
","One of the most interesting things about this film is how differently people react to it.  When I offered it as one of the most romantic films I had ever seen, several people scoffed, commenting on how much death and gore there was and how could that possibly be viewed as being romantic.  True, the battles are horrific, hundreds, thousands, of men butchering each other in close quarter hand to hand combat.  There is decapitation, dismemberment, and rivers of blood and death.  Yet it is also the story of the power of commitment.  In the story (how true this is I can not say, but the theme works anyway) William Wallace gave up his life, gave himself entirely to free his country.  Nothing else mattered.  There is no cautions planning, no careful conservation of resource.<br/><br/>Every fiber of Wallace's being is spent in every second on defeating his enemy, now, not tomorrow, but now, right now.  He lives entirely in the moment, being his commitment to free his country.   His success is a direct consequence of that total commitment.  And the source of that commitment was the love he had for his wife, his childhood sweetheart.  What could be more romantic than a love that changes the world?    If the tears aren't flowing in the final scene, about both an agonizing death, and the power of love to overcome even that horror, then your heart is made of stone.  This film is among the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Great sound track too (interestingly enough I believe the new release Cast Away uses at least one of the same tracks)."

","My favorite movie is Last of the Mohicans, but Braveheart rates very close too. Granted, the movie is not historically accurate as far as the life and times of William Wallace go, but if I wanted a history lesson, I would be turning on A&E or the History Channel, not paying $6.50 at a movie theater. I want to see a moving story which makes me feel, and Braveheart does just that.<br/><br/>The storyline is awesome, and the cast turn in excellent performances all around. Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau both made me start to hate Mel Gibson since he got to work with both women. Mel himself turned in a very stunning performance. The soundtrack was very moving as well.<br/><br/>Now back to the storyline. Normally when I watch a long movie, I see many scenes which could have been deleted. Postman, for instance, had many such scenes. However, every time I watch Braveheart, I find every scene necessary, and the film never drags. The action is constant, whether it be physical or emotional. I have watched this movie many many times, and am moved to tears every single time I watch it. Great great movie."

The score is one of the most beautiful, and the romance is.... well, totally indescribable. A wonderful film, this.

","""Your heart is free, have the courage to follow it"" Wallaces Father.  This is the only movie i have ever watched that has enlightened and endowed me with something. Mel Gibson is absolutely unbelievable in his unrelenting quest for freedom, however he is just not simply fighting for freedom from bondage to England, but freedom from the oppression within his lands. He is trying to unite the heart of Scotland within itself to stand up to its outside oppressors. This movie is an enigma in filmmaking. How often do you see hollywood make a movie that holds up true value and tru love in the quest for life. i have seen the movie at least 20 times. It also depicts Wallace as a holy man driven with determination, enveloped with loyalty to his countrymen, himself, his country, and his God. If you have seen it and admire it then you will remember when Wallace was in the jail awaiting his torture and he prayed to God to give him the strength to do the right thing after he could've took the poison. Because he knew that taking the poison would only bend his will and give him weakness in the greatest test of his beliefs, and if he couldn't stand for his beliefs fullt sober and aware then how could he ever believe in what he had done. I think this is the greatest film of all time- not just for the story-not just for the direction and the strength that it has-or the effort and attude Gibson and the rest of the film crew put into it, but for the wholesomeness it brought up in me- it made me think of who i am and what i believe and what i will stand up for. and more importantly if i have that courage to embark on my belief. a masterpiece, a milestone for hollywood. Mel Gibson desrves so much credit for this film. The best film ever made by a long shot. Ryan"

This 1995 Academy Award Winning film had everything any film lover could ask for: action, adventure, drama, romance........even a little speck of comedy here and there.  Mel Gibson didn't an excellent job of directing this movie and playing the hero, William Wallace.  This extremely violent tale tells the story of the wars between the English and the Scottish.

Seeking revenge, he starts an army to fight against their enemies and lead a nation.  I could not praise this movie enough.  I admit that I like violence, and this had that.  It was a very graphic movie that showed beheadings and all sorts of barbaric violence.  You fell in love with all of the characters, especially William Wallace.  I have never seen a better movie that tells the tale of such a heroic person like William Wallace.

The women actors cast in Braveheart did not look remotely like the strong, tough, usually dark haired women i know as ""Scottish highlanders""; in fact, the women in this movie had elfish, gamin-like appearance and were considerably skinnier and daintier than any crofter's wife or daughter would have been. these people worked hard to survive, everyone had to be physically strong, not delicate and flimsy. otherwise, an excellent movie. the ""hollywood"" look of the women was a bit distracting as my great grandmother looked down over her big nose and strong hands at me from the family portrait in my living room."

This movie full fills one thing, it hast some good action scenes, and yes, the costumes are fine too...but that's hardly all about this film. Now, from what I read about William Wallace and the historical background, this film is absolute nonsense. So, no entertaining history lesson...maybe in parts entertaining, but never a lesson...it's more like a fictional story about a superhero. Everything about Wallace in this movie is just great. He's the most civilized person in this movie (maybe in the whole world), he's so very just and noble...and his enemies are simply the contrary. Everything in this movie is just so over-the-top-clich√©-based it's hard to sit through this movie....there's hardly any believable character in this film.

That's pure Hollywood-Trash! Of course she gets pregnant from Wallace's first try... Of course Wallace's enemy Edward dies only a few minutes after Wallace himself...so there seems to be a heavenly justice. Of course Wallace's last word shouted out, just before he dies is ""freeeeeeedom"", yeah... ""freedom"" that's a good Hollywood-message!

He leads his people, you see him crucified, he is a martyr and in the moment he dies, his fellows just watch him, and are not willing to die with him for their thing.

For example just prior to the first battle with Longshanks army, Wallace's men moon the British from a distance. Now come on!! Do you really think this happened? And what is with the crazy Scot that says the F-word that we are suppose to find funny. Was the F-word even used in those days? Granted the battle scenes are well photographed but I would think the British army would have held their own better in combat with the Scots rather than appearing like some amateur confused bunch of boobs.

"David_Frames","5","4","9","11 November 2006"," Monty Python's History of Britain
","The colonial chip on Mel Gibson's shoulder is so large in this pure Hollywood re-imagining of English-Scottish history that more often than not it threatens to cave in one side of the director's body, leaving him a crippled, diseased ghoul dragging the divided dead flesh through the mud, trying to say ""Freedom"" through a sore covered, misshapen mouth. Unfortunately this didn't happen to Gibson, instead his survived untouched to give us this take on English aggression, so one sided and ludicrous it could have been filmed by Dr Joseph Goebbels' film bureau ¬ñin fact much like it exists in the Nazi's back catalogue. This skirts around the truth about Braveheart, namely that it's the product of a filmmaker/actor who's an abhorrent anti-Semite, right wing bigot and drunk who's barely disguised prejudice masks what can only be generously described as a selective attitude toward repression and the subjugation of entire peoples. Substitute the Scottish for the Jews for example and it's hard to imagine the pendulum swinging quite so far toward the persecuted. It's okay to paint the English as caricatures of course because it's set in the 13th century and who cares about the contemporaneous message when it's smeared in the long long ago, right? Tell that to the Scots. Gibson's tale of the boo-hiss moustache twirling Anglo-Saxons raping their women, hanging their manfolk and the like, went a long a way to reigniting the fervent and somewhat pernicious strain of nationalism that has always lain at the heart of the Scottish psyche. Finally here was the movie that said that anti-English bigotry was okay, even to be encouraged ¬ñ a green light for the simpleminded. Yes, that's right my wee lads and lassies, all that crap your Mum and Dad told you about the English being arrogant, domineering scum who'd repressed your people for hundreds of years had now received the patronage of film. That's even better than reality isn't it? In any event once it's on film it's almost true anyway surely so even if the film's thrust is dishonest and the stuff of folklore invention it hardly matters. Gibson, with his blue face paint and poster-boy speeches for freedom (as long as you're a gentile of course) waved the flag for imagined tyranny in a country that had benefited from the Union with England financially and culturally for 300 years. The likes of the SNP, the political wing of Scottish bigotry and that occasional patriot, the tax exile Sean Connery all leaped on the bandwagon ensuring Gibson's iconic status from Berwick to Banff. The problem and I'm sorry to break this to any Celtic readers, is that photographing a propaganda piece with reality left to watch from behind the camera doesn't make any of it true. Gibson's film may be effectively packaged, romantically scored and crafted to stoke the fire of audience hatred but beyond all of that its true significance lies in the revealing hand of its director and the reaction of the people it purports to represent. Ironically the only ones to emerge from the film with any dignity are the vilified English ¬ñ a patient audience if ever there was one."

This film will test all your emotions both good and bad, leave you on the edge of your seat and truly if your Scottish, give you a great sense of pride. Well done Mel"

The science and courage to give an impressive fresco of ideal and sacrifice and vulnerability as source of force. A film of a religious man because Braveheart is a Christian film not only for the presence of priests and prays but for its entire nuances of its message. A powerful film. Scene by scene.

Lets not also forget the amazing supporting cast in Tommy Flanagan (Sons of Anarchy), Brendan Gleeson (Harry Potter) and James Cosmo (Game of Thrones). Superb performance from all. The Scottish countrysides, castles, old-English war garments and Highlander bagpipes put together an authentic and historical plot that proves the magic that Mel Gibson can work.

","Braveheart is a awesome, red-blooded movie about William Wallace, the legendary Scots warrior who led his nation into battle against the English in the years around 1300. It's an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery, and avoids the travelogue style of so many historical swashbucklers: Its locations look green, wet, vast, muddy and rugged. And as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can."

","This was one of those classics that I've always heard people speaking great things about, but never got the time watch it. Until now. I finally sat down and watched this movie (quite long, almost three hours), and really dived into a world of meaning and sacrifice. <br/><br/>The story isn't very complex, but it is beautifully developed. We follow the life of William Wallace, a Scotchman who is charismatic and quick-witted. The English have an iron grip on Scotland, due to the king and it all goes bad when Wallace's wife gets murdered by English guards for resisting rape. From then, a movement that started from hate and revenge, soon becomes one motivated by hope and the insatiable wish for freedom. <br/><br/>In therms of photography, the movie is beautifully shot, showing all the greatness and beauty of the Scottish landscapes. The frames and movement feel very fluid and truly makes the viewer feel as though he/she is there. <br/><br/>The late James Horner made an epic soundtrack that is a match made in heaven, as it combines pipes and singing, sounding ever so Scottish but so angelically calm. It takes your breath away in some specific parts and it seems to fuel your passion towards the moments and characters. Beautifully well done, so be inspired and hear it.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson does an amazing role in this movie. Really, the acting blew me away as it was so heartfelt. The accent was spot on as well. We truly feel connected with both Wallace and all the other secondary characters. The three main characters that accompany William throughout this journey are captivating as well, making us feel part of their group. <br/><br/>Overall this movie is a classic of cinema. It is perfect in many ways and I think everyone should see it at least once. I know I'll see it many more times. <br/><br/>My Review: 9/10"
"renatevanderbent","6","3","6","1 August 2016"," Very overrated
","This movie is very overrated. It is in no way historically accurate. It is incredibly one-sided, with the Scots being portrayed as innocent heroes while the English are pure evil who rape women and kill children. The large amount of fighting and gore was unnecessary and quickly became boring to watch. The romance was laughable. Wallace's wife only served as a plot device. She was killed after attacking a soldier who tried to rape her. Wallace was so enraged by this that he kills half the Englishmen. Except then he completely forgets about her when he has an affair with the French princess, which by the way was completely ridiculous. The movie is also homophobic, portraying the very stereo-typically gay prince as weak and incapable of pretty much anything. Lastly the movie is way too long."

The music and scenery added a lot to this riveting saga that includes some of the most emotional performances that I have ever seen. It is intense and some of it can be hard to watch (like most war movies are) and the entire film kept me involved and glued to it.

Just from a technical point of view, ""Braveheart"" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. I want to praise Mel Gibson for the work he put into making this movie. His vision as director was first-class and gave the movie a 'grandness' that it deserved. It is also a great achievement for Gibson to star in the movie, playing the integral character of Wallace, a difficult role. For his direction of Braveheart, Mel won the 1995 academy award for best director. I love all the battle scenes in 'Braveheart', as they are filmed in a big and bold way by Gibson. Death of Braveheart's wife adds emotional touch to the film. Overall the film contains romance,action,drama, adventure and deserves 5 star rating."

","I have no problem with the film as entertainment, what I object to is how the film was used by the SNP in the recent referendum, to condemn the English out of hand: <br/><br/>I should like readers to know that it was Norman-ruled England led by Edward 1 of the Norman line of succession to the throne, that inflicted injustices on Scotland. The English(Anglo-Saxons) before then, had little desire to rule Scotland, yet to the present day it is the England of today that is subject to the vitriolic hatred from the Scots. These attacks are then misguided, by reason of their original premise, that Edward was as English as Churchill.

","Braveheart is an academy award winning historical war-drama movie. This movie tells the story of Scottish war of independence which revolves around the character William Wallace (played by Mel Gibson). It is a film adaptation of the famous Blind Harry's epic poem ""The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Champion Schir William Wallace"". This movie illustrates, very dramatically, how a common villager turned into a ferocious rebel after losing his beloved ones and ignited a whole state to rebel against tyranny. <br/><br/>Besides the powerful performance and direction of Mel, the movie has got a lot of romance, action, comedy and emotions to offer.This movie has the greatest screenplay ever written by Randall Wallace . The unparalleled blend of sceneries of the Scottish highland and local music makes this movie an epic art work. James Horner again proves his worth. The cinematography and editing were simply marvelous. <br/><br/>If we consider the cons, I would say the movie should be a little less dramatic and more realistic. In a nutshell, if you love watching historical biopic or drama, I would suggest you not to miss this movie."

Bruce and Wallace were largely ignored by them until Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace made this cracker.<br/><br/>The huge monument to William Wallace in Stirling shows just how much his memory means to all Scots.<br/><br/>Despite some historical inaccuracies (and although there are a few glaring ones the film definitely gets his horrific martyr's death right) this film definitely did catch the spirit of the fight for Scotland's freedom and independence.<br/><br/>This fight will hopefully end in final victory next year (2014) when Scots will vote on the future of the British union for the first time in 300 years in the Scottish independence referendum which is being organised by our elected SNP Government."

","I am baffled as to why this film has a score of 8.4, and why various people here are prattling on about it being their number 1 film of all time.<br/><br/>The film started off strong, I'll say that much. Directed by Randall Wallace, the man responsible for the cheese-fest that is ""Pearl Harbour"", and the film even Leonardo Dicaprio's boyish charm could not save, ""The Man in the Iron Mask"". Why was I expecting more from this? I'm not going to give a summary of the film, because you're either reading the reviews prior to seeing it, or having already seen it. As I said, the film starts off well, the little William Wallace (James Robinson) is an extremely talented lad and everything where he is a child is emotional and purposeful.The part where he is reunited with his love is charming also, and the entire section until she dies is also purposeful.<br/><br/>The story is a good one - wanting freedom over material goods. Honour, and bravery. After 2 hours it just melds into one. There are too many battles that all seem the same and he she it betrays blah blah blah it's a circle of irritation. Then they kill him. Which just wasted the film for me. Sometimes, the right choice at the end of a film with this sort of theme is to kill the protagonist and leave a poignant message with the viewer. This did not happen here. I kept waiting for him to be saved...and waiting...and waiting.<br/><br/>Also, i'd like to know at what point during all the battles did he have the time to put little plaits in his hair, remove them then do it again."

"PeterJordan","8","3","6","8 September 2008"," Rollicking historical action movie that fires up the blood
","I remember coming out of the cinema after first seeing this film back in 1995 and being so fired up and just enthralled by it. It may in part have been because of the Irish references and the Irish connections and to note that the Scots weren't all that dissimilar to us Irish in celebrating getting one or two over on the ole English oppressors.<br/><br/>Yesterday I visited the Wallace Monument on Craig Abbey in Stirling overlooking the battle site of Stirling Bridge and just had to re watch it when I got home.<br/><br/>Of course Randall Wallace, as well as being responsible for some subsequent awful clangers, most notably Pearl Harbour, took some considerable poetic licence in stretching the fiction of Wallace's life to its very limit and even beyond, but considering that little it actually known about very much of Wallace's life beyond what has been based on Blind Robbie's poem, he succeeded in weaving a powerful and inspiring and both uplifting and harrowing story of the man, who probably more than any other, still lives within the hearts of Scots more than 800 years on.<br/><br/>Possible Spoilers: <br/><br/>Of what we do know of Wallace's life, well of that presented in the museum in the Wallace Memorial in any case, is that he was the son of a very minor Scottish noble, he was educated in Latin and French probably by one or two of his uncles who were priests. He had a disagreement with some English soldier/occupiers while he was apparently fishing and had to go on the run and, the English, in trying to get at him did burn down his house with his wife inside and he did revenge her murder. He did achieve a great tactical victory over a superior English force at Stirling Bridge which was achieved more by the nature of the swampy terrain and the narrow bridge than by what is depicted in the film as a battle on an open plain with a cavalry charge defeated by pointed sticks. The English were supposedly shocked by the savagery of the Scots who systematically slaughtered all the injured English on the battlefield and it is alleged that Wallace himself had a sword belt made from the skin of the English commander of the battle. He was betrayed by the rest of the Scottish nobles at Falkirk, who refused to lend him their support. Robert the Bruce's father did have leprosy which Robert himself ultimately also succumbed to. Wallace never did meet the Princess of Wales since he was dead three years before her arrival in England and Edward de Longchamps outlived Wallace for some three years also and whilst Edward Prince of Wales may have been exaggeratedly or misleadingly portrayed as an exteremely camp weak prince, there is considerable evidence to indicate that he was a homosexual, this in spite of producing a number of offspring with his French wife including Edward III, who ultimately overthrew him with the assistance of his mother. <br/><br/>However, if all these hard facts had been adhered to too rigidly would it have made for near as good of a movie? I don't think so. <br/><br/>There are a number of excellent scenes within the movie, most notably Wallace's visit to the English military camp to revenge his wife's murder, The Freedom speech before the battle of Stirling is probably one of the best in movie history, all the battle scenes are magnificently if gorily realised and the final execution scene is both graphic, harrowing and inspiring and overall the graphic gore developed within this movie was ultimately to become Gibson's trademark and that which was to invite so much criticism in The Passion. <br/><br/>This is a truly inspiring film, perhaps not entirely nor anywhere near historically accurate, but in terms of large scale entertainment and the realisation of a vision in cinema it is a great achievement, right up there with Spartacus and Ben Hur, and well worthy of the recognition it received."
"Seneschal118","8","3","6","10 August 2008"," Good
","And that's the problem really. The battle scenes are well directed, but Gibson seems to revel in making it as gory as possible. Gibson, while not doing a bad job as Wallace, looks like a straggly Kevin Costner from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves who's lived away from civilisation for a while. Mind you, he conveys the wild side of the Scottish rebel's character well, and gives a good performance. There are several historical inaccuracies in the film, such as the ban on playing bagpipes stated near the beginning (about 450 years early). The affair with the queen is ridiculous, but serves as a plot device. After all that, you're probably wondering why I gave this an eight. Despite all its faults, Braveheart is beautifully filmed, attractively scored and the acting of the majority of the cast is positive. I would not go out of my way to see this film, but if it's on television and you aren't busy, I would recommend you seeing this film."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","3","6","2 April 2008"," Simple, graceful and empowering
","When you watch ""Braveheart"" you can't help but feel like you've seen it before. That's because ""Braveheart"" did it first. James Horner's thematic bagpipe music that could make a grown man cry is nearly replicated in his score for ""Titanic"" (although ""Titanic"" won him the Oscar). The highly skilled love and revenge-fueled hero is all that is Maximus in ""Gladiator."" The list goes on, but the point is that ""Braveheart"" set formula for the modern day historical fiction war film. Watching this film today, you aren't exactly blown away by it, but it doesn't do anything wrong.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" is the story of William Wallace, the Scottish farmer-turned-warrior who sparked a rebellion that eventually earned Scotland independence from England. Mel Gibson (director and producer) plays Wallace and does so quite well. Gibson's performance is in his presence on screen. He doesn't do the nuances that well, but I would've gotten off my couch to fight for that guy. The other performances were all good, but no one stands out, though Angus Mcfayden really communicated the inner-conflict of Robert the Bruce quite well.<br/><br/>You certainly don't put on ""Braveheart"" for acting lessons, however. This is a film about emotion, the human spirit, good triumphing over oppression and of course: brutally violent battle sequences. This is where ""Braveheart"" delivers. The script is just one little pearl of wisdom and motivation after another. If I was a coach of a sports team, I'd just quote this film before games, half time, after games--it's just full of great one liners and as much as you want to laugh and say ""that's cheesy"" it just never feels that way. The film is about one man that stood for freedom and never made an exception, which resulted in him killing a lot of people. The romance angle (for added emotional effect) is not as strong, but certainly balances out the mood of the film that's supposed to be about heart (though of course Wallace is a champion of using his head.) The combination of the two make for a film that is both entertaining and touching.<br/><br/>At this day and age, ""Braveheart"" might seem a little stale. There's nothing revolutionary going on (well, cinematically speaking, not plot-wise). Unless you have a fond attachment to the film from when it first came out and was indeed revolutionary, you'll find ""Braveheart"" an entertaining and solid tale of heroism and belief in good winning out. It's hard to watch in an entirely secular light knowing the post-Passion of the Christ Gibson of today, but it will still make you feel good.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

Gibson did a superb job doing both things at once. I liked the acting in this film because it seemed so realistic. I also liked the score. I believe that it resembles Scottish music.

","The makers of the film took their history books and carefully tossed them aside so that Mel Gibson could have a free hand to portray a completely virtuous William Wallace and his struggle against the English. Despite this ""black and white"" approach to history, it is still a highly enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The film has great scenes, with majestic shots of the Scottish highlands and sweeping battlefields, castles and towns and an appropriate score to match. The film is well-cast, led by Mel Gibson, who is energetic as William Wallace and handles the action, speeches and drama well. My favorite performance is from Patrick McGoohan, who revels in being despicable to the Scottish and his meek son as King Edward Longshanks. Angus Macfadyen brings out an interesting character in Robert the Bruce. The rest of the cast is solid as well from both the Scottish and English camps.<br/><br/>The story is paced nicely, first focusing on developments in character and then proceeding quickly into action. There are a number of interesting turns in the story along the way. This film is also notable for its large scale epic battle scenes, which are well-staged. ""Braveheart"" is not history, but it is still an engaging film about a struggle for independence in the Middle Ages."

","I can see why ordinary laymen love Braveheart so much.  What's not to like about spearings, stabbings, slashings, and other miscellaneous pokings with other sharp objects?<br/><br/>Problem is that the film falls too quickly into the whole good vs. evil mentality.  How I HATE that cliche!  Gibson never was high into the ""moral ambiguity"" idea, prominent in much of Kubrick and Scott's work.  This movie only emphasizes his lack of education.<br/><br/>I will give him credit, though, for trying to make Scotland look ugly and dirty.  After watching this, you'll probably want to take a shower.  Gibson is too obvious in his camera, creating scenes and shots that you wonder why they are there other than eye candy for James Horner's music.  Horner has done better (ALIENS), but he's also done worse (Patriot Games).<br/><br/>Overall, Gibson nicely remade this movie with The Patriot and showed how even someone of his stature could screw things up.

Mr Wallace basically lifted a whole bunch of names from the pages of history and then remade events to suit his film.  Sorry, sorry work.  I sat through this thing hoping that Gibson would be captured at each turn so that it would end. Did no one else notice that Gibson's Robert the Bruce was a snivelling wimp?  The real Bruce was a frightful warrior and powerful King who has got to be spinning in his grave over this travesty.  Not to mention that Wallace never got within a country mile of Princess Issabelle...much less fathered her child.  Sorry.  Wrong again.

Exceptionally directed epic about fabled Scottish rebel leader William Wallace (Gibson, who won an Oscar in his sophomore directing gig as well as Best Picture, is in fine form blending stoicism with romanticism) who in the 13th century led a bloody revolt of his fellow countrymen against the vile English King Edward I (sneeringly good Mc Goohan).

"lwjoslin","9","3","6","25 September 2002"," The Highlands Chainsaw Massacre
","""Braveheart"" is overlong, overripe, and overwrought, frequently crossing the line between the dramatic and the melodramatic.  We're an hour into the movie before the butt-kicking starts in earnest; up to that point there's entirely too much footage of William Wallace (Mel Gibson, who directed) and his lady-love making goo-goo eyes at each other.  Still, while this nearly-three-hour saga could have used some tightening up, I wouldn't want to see it pruned to much less than 2 1/2 hours long: there IS a lot of story here, and some wonderful characters, and I like it when a long story takes its time to unfold.  It's mainly the first hour that drags, after which the movie actually gets better as it goes along--a rare occurrence. <br/><br/>
As history, the story mixes in fill-in-the-blanks fiction with what little is known about Wallace the man.  We know Wallace was real--realer than Robin Hood and probably realer than King Arthur--but there's much we don't know about him.  We know he won the Battle of Stirling Bridge against the English, and that he was ultimately executed for treason.  Upon these bare bones is built a feast of red meat, well-researched in its depictions of medieval squalor, and unblinking in its smashing, horrendous, blood-spattered battle scenes.  <br/><br/>Other than the movie's uneven pace, I had only a few quibbles, mostly about the liberties taken with historical fact.  For instance, it omits the bridge from the Battle of Stirling Bridge, which is like omitting the harbor from the attack on Pearl Harbor.  At the time of that battle (1297), the French princess (played by dishy Sophie Marceau) was only 4 or 5 years old.  Nor did she marry the prince until after he had become king, i.e., after Longshanks' death.  The film implies that Longshanks dies on the day of Wallace's execution; in fact, he died several years later... and was on his way back to Scotland, to stir up more trouble, at the time. <br/><br/>
Finally--or firstly--that silly title!  There's no such word as ""braveheart"" in English (a language the Scots have never fully mastered).  Granted, the average history-illiterate American moviegoer (in this land where entirely too many people have been convinced that Cleopatra was black and can't tell you who the American Revolution was fought against) wouldn't have known who Wallace was, so putting his name in the title wouldn't have helped.  So how about something like ""The Highlands Chainsaw Massacre""?  Or ""Dead Men DO Wear Plaid""?  Or ""Mad Macs""?  Or--taking a cue from the image of Hamish defiantly hurling Wallace's sword into the air--""1301: A Scots Odyssey""?"

"emverano","Null","3","6","3 November 2001"," A Good Movie Which Could Have Been Great
","Mel Gibson's movie ""Braveheart"" is a nice crowd-pleaser.  The producer, director and screenwriters of this film had in their hands a perfect opportunity to make a GREAT timeless masterpiece.  The movie has a larger-than-life hero, heroic acts of numerous Scottish men, epic battles and an easy-to-hate foe.  (What more do you expect?) However, they ganged up on this great idea and reduced it merely to an above average movie.  I wonder what they were thinking.<br/><br/>When making so-called `historical' epics, many Hollywood writers have a tendency to rewrite, warp,  sentimentalize, melodramatize and generally dumb up history.  In the process, the story lines often deviate from the real history so much that the movie is not historical anymore.  These screenwriters must think that an average moviegoer is too dumb to understand or appreciate the complexity and subtlety of history.  Randall Wallace, the screenwriter of this movie, did exactly that: grossly rewrote history, deprive the script of subtlety and generally dumbed up the script.<br/><br/>
SLIGHT SPOILER IN THIS PARAGRAPH!!!  IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ IT, JUMP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH. Many people have heavily criticized this movie for its gross historical inaccuracies.  I agree wholeheartedly.   Many aspects of William Wallace's life are shrouded in mystery. Until recently, most historians relied almost exclusively on the biographical poems about Wallace by the15th century Scottish minstrel Blind Harry as the primary source.  However, the movie's script grossly deviates even from what little modern historians know about William Wallace.  These are some examples:  1) Why was the Battle of Stirling Bridge portrayed without a bridge?  A small bridge played a crucial role in this English defeat.  2) Why was Wallace's atrocities committed in Northern England totally omitted from this movie?  Wallace and his men committed numerous acts of atrocities--including rape, pillage and massacre--after invading Northern England.  3) The movie omits the crucial role William Wallace's brothers played in William becoming one of the leaders of Scottish liberation movement.  4) The movie unfairly portrays Robert Bruce as a back stabber even though there is no extant historical evidence to indicate that Robert Bruce betrayed William Wallace.  There are many other examples of historical inaccuracies but are too numerous to be listed here.<br/><br/>As many people have already commented, this movie lacks subtlety just like many other Hollywood movies.  Unlike the complexity of real life, most issues in this movie are conveniently all black and white.  For example, most characters are divided into all-bad villains and all-good heroes. Just like the Imperial forces in ""Star Wars,"" the English are the totally evil villains while the Scots were bunch of fierce but virtuous freedom fighters. Edward Longshank, the English king, is portrayed as an evil and greedy tyrant similar to Darth Vader while Sir William Wallace is portrayed as a somewhat naive but virtuous freedom fighter similar to Luke Skywalker. The extant record shows that real history is not simple black and white like this.  Historically Edward Longshank was indeed a greedy and ambitious ruler, but he did show many instances of magnanimity and generosity.  As stated earlier, William Wallace was a flawed man. He was a fierce freedom fighter but committed numerous acts of atrocities.<br/><br/>The scriptwriters must have thought that all moviegoers have to be reminded again and again ad nauseum that ""freedom is beautiful"" and ""invasion and occupation of foreign nations are bad.""  I think we all got the message after the first or second time. But the movie seems to go on and on pounding into our heads the same message with the repeated portrayals of English brutality and victimization of the Scottish population.   If the screenwriters want to keep on stating the message after the first or second time, they should have done it more subtly from the third or fourth time.<br/><br/>
There are some aspects of the movie which salvaged it from being a total failure.  Mel Gibson did an admirable job of playing William Wallace.  Even though he is about one foot too short to play William Wallace (Wallace was reputed to be almost seven feet tall ), Gibson tried and somewhat succeeded in recreating the charisma of this Scottish freedom fighter. It is too bad that Gibson created an indelible image in the mind of some of the moviegoers that he is a shoot-them-up, blow-them-away action star by playing Mad Max three times in the `Mad Max' series and Sgt. Martin Riggs four times in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series.  However, he is a much, much more competent actor than action stars like Stallone, Schwarznegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris.  In terms of acting talent he is closer to late Lord Lawrence Olivier than to these four amateurs who have the temerity to call themselves ""actor.""  Some people have commented that Mel Gibson focused too much attention on himself in this movie.  He did focus lots of attention on himself, but he is the star of this movie for crying out loud!  I think Mel Gibson focused attention on himself only to the extent of what is expected of the star of a movie.  However, the greatest acting accolade should go to Patrick McGoohan for his portrayal of the evil tyrant Edward Longshank.  He skillfully portrayed this evil but determined ruler.  This accomplished thespian's acting skill just awed me.  Only McGoohan's vast acting talent, which added depth to the character, salvaged Edward Longshank from being a one-dimensional 14th century version of Darth Vader.<br/><br/>The novice director Mel Gibson did a very competent job of choreographing the battle scenes.  Unlike most of the 1950's and 1960's Hollywood epic movies, Gibson portrayed the battle scenes with realistic gore and brutality, the way battle scenes should be portrayed.<br/><br/>
This is a good movie which greatly pleased the audience.  To be honest, I like this movie.  However, if the movie was made with a better characterization of various characters, subtlety of expression and better historical accuracies, it could have been a GREAT movie."
"rexodus","4","3","6","22 August 2001"," Cheesy and ham-fisted
","This film is like a three-hour ad for Mel Gibson. It's pretty good on the technical front: the battles are great, the costumes are neat, and the pictures are stunning (or at least interesting.) But the script is so thoughtless, so blatantly Hollywood-ized, that it's impossible to take any of it seriously. Unfortunately, the actors play it like friggin' Shakespeare. The script is transparent as it divides characters into heroes and villains, then divides them again into superheroes and supervillains. And the ""dramatic"" moments (such as ""They'll never take...our FREEDOM!"" or ""Every man dies, not every man truly lives"") feel phony and jingoistic. Mel Gibson isn't made to play superheroes. His persona is a balance between heroic bravado and self-deprecating charm. In a movie this melodramatic, he feels totally false and out of place."

Great use of locations in and around scotland. Fantastic battle scenes and period detail.<br/><br/>I guess my main problem is with Mel Gibson.  His portrayal of William Wallace while okay just wasn't that convincing for me.  I kept expecting Danny Glover to appear any second to help his old buddy fight the evil British.  And the constant harping on freedom with the long bombastic monologues got old really quickly.<br/><br/>Another thing that bugged me was the lack of subtlety of any kind.  It seems like the filmmakers assumed the viewer wasn't smart enough to pick up on the themes of the movie so they kept clubbing us over the head with it. (How many times do we need to hear speeches on freedom?) Ultimately, Mr. Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace just didn't convince me and I got tired of the complete and utter lack of subtlety in the filmmaking.<br/><br/>

He'd wake up at dawn everyday in order to watch the union jack rise over every house in Scotland. Kilts would have long been banned and use of the Scottish accent punishable by death.

","It's not even close. The directing is A+, Mel Gibson did as perfect of a job as you can do with all the camera-work and cuts, which is really something considering he was the lead role. He also gave an awesome performance as William Wallace. Saying Braveheart is historically inaccurate is nonsense, really; the true life of Wallace has nothing to do with this movie. That is not that hard a concept. When critiquing Braveheart I find two very minor flaws - Gibson's accent isn't the greatest, but, he's not Scottish, so I don't see that as significant, and the extras in the war scenes just suck in some scenes. You can see if you look closely that all of the combat does not appear authentic. These are the only two faults I can find, and they are rather trivial. Everything else works. The story of Braveheart is as epic as it gets, man loses true love, gets revenge on the entire country responsible and frees his homeland and its people in the process. It's presented in exquisite fashion. The pace of Braveheart is impeccable. The love scenes in the beginning in no way are sluggish. They serve as the calm before the storm. The writing is excellent in these scenes, as are the interactions between Wallace and Murron. The love story really jumps forward quickly, and you are soon thrust into warfare. Braveheart is not excessively violent. The gory moments serve their purpose and are not overstated. The overall writing of the movie is very smart. There are no unnatural moments or lines for any characters. The characters are all well portrayed. The acting is subtle and very polished. Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks was outstanding. The cinematography of Braveheart is as good as it gets; it might stand alone as the best ever in this area. The visuals are epic. The music is epic. The score of Braveheart is so, so strong. It continually adds to the viewing experience throughout. The ending of Braveheart is easily the best of any film. Braveheart gives you all the emotions you could ask for and does a great job of mixing light-hearted moments within all the serious drama. No other movie matches the 'epicness' and beauty of Braveheart, thus, making it the greatest movie of all-time! Bow to Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>[!]BEST MOVIE EVER[!]<br/><br/>**********<br/><br/>(Do you realize how many negative reviews there are for Braveheart that only cite the historical inaccuracies as the main reason it sucked? The real William Wallace has nothing to do with this movie!!! Why can't you comprehend that? Is this a documentary?.....What are you talking about! The real, true life of the real William Wallace has nothing to do with Braveheart. Braveheart is a movie, a tale of fantasy!!!! Not a documentary!!! The movie Goodfellas is about real life gangsters, who really existed, but the events happened differently from how they did in real life, so does that mean Goodfellas sucks because it's historically inaccurate? Same goes for about a million other movies, take your pick. Since when were movies supposed to be history lessons? The film doesn't say 'true story' or 'based on a true story' or anything like that in the opening credits or anywhere. Oh I get it, the character's name is William Wallace so that makes it real. Ha Ha, you're entire argument 'this movie sucks because that's not what really happened' is so, so foolish. So ignorant. It holds no water, a completely stale argument. Completely erroneous. The shame is that Braveheart might be the top movie on the Top250 list if it weren't for the strong percentage of reviews saying it's historically inaccurate, but it still rates an impressive 8.4, even with all you blind-to-the-fact haters. Blind to the fact that the real William Wallace has no bearing on Braveheart. None. Completely irrelevant. Again, this is not that hard a concept.....)"

","As a man born in Scotland but brought up in England I am in a position to see both sides of the war fought by one means or another for a thousand years.The Scots,perceived as the good guys by the rest of the world if the comments on this site are anything to go by,have,as is customary for smaller nations,held the moral high ground for as long as the conflict has been going on.Yet the English,for most of the time are hardly aware of the war at all.Only when the two nations played each other at football(soccer )at Wembley Stadium and what the sports media referred to as ""The Tartan Hordes"" descended on London did Anglophobia raise its ugly head above the parapet . Mostly the English can't be doing with the ""Scotland the Brave"" nonsense as sung in English pubs by drunken Scots,glaring round aggressively to deter any gainsayers.""Get a life"",is the usual quietly muttered retort. One would like to think that cockneys singing ""Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner"" would be treated as tolerantly should the circumstances be reversed.And tolerance is the key word in any consideration of Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"".Because the movie is so ridiculously biased as to be almost racist in concept and execution..Simplistic and bad history,Little Mel has allowed himself to make a movie swayed by resentment and hatred,real and imagined grudges and the sort of chauvinism that,had it been expressed by the English,would have been sneered at by Guardianistas all over Highgate. Did a single English person object to this farrago of nationalistic fervour?No.To most it's a matter of supreme indifference that yet another Hollywood director sets out to rubbish the nation.Get a life guys - better yet get a history book.<br/><br/>Hollywood movie"

Visually everything is perfect and the musical score by James Horner is wonderful (For the Love of a Princess is beautiful) and lifts the movie even higher.<br/><br/>The grand and spectacular massive fights are brutal and graphic as well as impressive. And having a few hundreds of under-payed extras fighting each other still looks better than having a few hundred CGI characters fighting, let this movie be a lesson to you Hollywood guys and take an example from it.<br/><br/>Patrick McGoohan was one of the highlights for me. He was perfect and unforgettable in his role as King Edward I and he delivered his line's perfectly and with lot's of cruelty.<br/><br/>The story is impressive, moving and interesting right till the end that might be just a little bit over the top but impressive nevertheless.

","This film tells the story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a champion of Scottish independence that urged the Scots to fight against the attempts of invasion and domination of the English. Directed by Mel Gibson (who also plays the lead role), has Randall Wallace's script.<br/><br/>This film is especially dedicated to those who don't know absolutely nothing of Scotland's history and don't wish to understand anything about it anytime soon. This is because the whole film is a complete nonsense, one slapstick that should never have been filmed, an insult to Scotland and its past. Why am I so hard? Because this film not only ignored the real life of William Wallace, lying about that and inventing the most of things, but also portrays the Scots (and even the English) in a historically inaccurate manner.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing good in this movie. The costumes don't match (even the kilts didn't exist yet at Wallace's time), battles didn't happened that way, Gibson's performance was poor and theatrical, photography is boring and ordinary and the psychological depth of all characters is comparable to a dry river in Summer. Oscars for this film? Yes, he got some (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects and Best Makeup)... but I don't even want to know how it's happened! Even the Razzie Awards are something too good for this movie. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson is usually a good actor. He can be a good ""Patriot"", he may even know ""What Women Want"", have a ""Lethal Weapon"" or even several. I don't care. But making a ""Braveheart"" so bad that even the Monty Python would easily do better is such a shame that leaves me in the ""Edge of Darkness""...

Battle scenes still hold up today but for the time they were amazing. The acting is amazing by everyone involved. Mel Gibson's character (William Wallace) has a scene where he's betrayed and his expressions are for sure the example of the best non verbal acting I've ever seen. The guy who plays Robert The Bruce nails it in response as well. Powerful all the way around. The music adds something too from the get go. Even the child actors were pretty good.

Where a budget of ¬£75M went(compare to the relatively tiny ¬£3M budget of the Infinitely better ""Rob Roy"")one can only surmise but It certainly wasn't spent on Historical study. The fact that Mel Gibson takes the part of William Wallace(who was a ""real"" person) gives the clear and Intentional Implication that this Is a true story - It Is not, and If the main character had been ""Just some brave Scot"" I could stomach It - but real people and real events have been Interwoven with a fantasy with some of the grossest anti-English sentiment I have ever witnessed In a film. The production team couldn't even get the man-skirts correct(The Kilt was Invented four centuries later by Englishman Thomas Rawlinson In Lancashire In 1720)and the ""head-In-a-basket"", the ""princes-boyfriend-thrown-to-his-death"" and multiple other scenes are pure fantasy as Is the age of the homosexual prince's French bride (she was aged 9 when married - not that the marriage would ever have been consummated whatever her age!). The clear Indication that all Englishmen were cowardly scumbags while all Scots were thoroughly decent heroes pervades the whole movie and on a personal note I find this offensive and racist as do many of my movie-loving peers.

"tonyjackie","9","3","7","4 November 2008"," ""They fought like warrior poets"".
","As a piece of film making,'Braveheart' is a fabulous piece of work.Mel Gibson deserves high praise for his performance as William Wallace,his direction, and his determination to get this film made.He should be proud of his efforts as this is an epic,sweeping tale that is gripping,emotional and involving from the very start.<br/><br/>This is the story of Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace.I am ashamed to admit that I had never heard of him until this movie but I can safely say that he is now world famous because of this film.Of course,many people have admired the man for many years,but 'Braveheart' has spread the word in a way that will ensure he will never be forgotten.There are several moments of historical inaccuracy on show here but it doesn't really matter as we are given an insight to the history of this character and we do learn quite a lot about him and the very harsh times he lived in.It is after all a movie and not a history lesson.<br/><br/>There is an excellent cast on show here.Brendan Gleeson(Hamish) and David O' Hara(Stephen)give solid support with a few comic moments thrown in.Sophie Marceau(Princess Isabelle)and Catherine McCormack(Murron)look fabulous and handle their roles perfectly.James Cosmo(Campbell) and Brian Cox(Argyle)are impressive and Ian Bannen(Robert the Bruce Sr)holds the attention brilliantly as a corrupt man that wants the best for his son no matter what the cost.As his son,Angus Macfadyen does a great job as a man torn between what is best for his family and his country.His obvious torment is well told and well handled.I do feel though that the standout performance comes from Patrick McGoohan as King Edward 1st.He is the personification of evil and spits out his lines with relish.He really should have received an Oscar nomination for this.<br/><br/>The cinematography is fantastic and the musical score by James Horner is worthy of the highest praise.The one thing about this movie that I was never too sure about is the romance between William Wallace and Princess Isabelle.It has always seemed a little contrived to me but it does ultimately lead to a great scene towards the end of the film concerning the dying King so in that sense it is perhaps justified.<br/><br/>This is a fine film and Mel Gibson truly deserved the praise that was lavished upon him.I very rarely mark anything as a ten as perfection is virtually impossible in film making.But this does score 9+ and is among my top 10 movies of all time."
"Arenarocker05","10","3","7","8 July 2008"," ""They Fought Like Scotsman, And Won Their Freedom""
","""They fought like warrior poets. They fought like Scotsman, and won their freedom."" Those final words said by actor/director Mel Gibson made this film truly a legendary masterpiece. Not only that, but the film was legendary from start to finish. This movie proved to audiences that Mel Gibson can act and be a successful film director and I truly thought he would be the first man to receive the ""Best Actor and Best Director"" Oscars in 1995, but still no one has done it...yet.<br/><br/>When I saw this film back in 2001, I knew it would go down in history for many years to come and that there will never be another William Wallace film to top Mel Gibson's. However, what won me over as well was the score. It amazes me how not many people have ever heard of James Horner before. The guy has composed countless amounts of films such as ""Troy"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Randsom"", ""The Perfect Storm"", and so on. That final song at the end still to this day puts a tear in my eye. The other thing that won me over was the acting from the supporting roles. Of course Mel Gibson was flawless but I'm also glad to see that David O' Hara (The funny Irishman) is still acting in films and Brendan Gleeson showing a lot of talent as an action star.<br/><br/>This was hands down the best film of 1995 and still today continues to take its place among the greatest of the great action drama's of all time. If you haven't seen this film yet, get off the chair you're sitting in and watch this piece of magnificent artwork."
"pgear83","10","3","7","22 June 2008"," The best war movie ever made
","Mel Gibson's sophomore foray into directing was a triumph of epic film-making and seems more timeless every year. The story of Sir William Wallace and Scotland's wars of independence against England from 1297 to 1314 is based upon a combination of history and the epic poem about Wallace by Blind Harry the Minstrel.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, we see the roots of the conflict between England and Scotland. This conflict kills the father and brother of the young Wallace who subsequently travels throughout Europe and becomes an educated man. He returns to his home years later, hoping to live in peace despite the presence of occupying English forces. He secretly marries his love, Murron, and for a short time everything seems hunky dory. Then Murron is attacked by an English officer who says perhaps the creepiest thing you can possibly say before trying to rape someone: ""You remind me of my daughter back home."" This leads to Murron's death and Wallace subsequently goes berserk, killing all the English there and setting off a nationwide rebellion.<br/><br/>The film really takes off from here with lots of battles, heroics, victory and defeat. The film's depiction of the Battle of Stirling Bridge (minus the bridge) is perhaps the most spectacular battle sequence in cinema history. The entire film displays Gibson's very Catholic penchant for gore, but it is totally appropriate for the subject matter. And this is much more entertaining than The Passion of the Christ (a film I greatly admire, but have no strong desire to see again soon). Gibson does an excellent job of portraying the brutality and dirtiness of the middle-ages (though characters still seem to have far better dental care than one might think) and on both sides of the camera he is the main force behind its greatness. He was only allowed by the studio the make the movie if he starred in it as well and one gets the impression from his recent works that had he made it today with his current influence, it would have starred unknown actors and been done in Gaelic and Middle-English.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that historical accuracy plays second fiddle to entertainment in this movie. We see intimate interactions between Wallace and Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) who never could have met in real life. We know that Robert the Bruce (Angus McFayden) was very much a politician and had shifting loyalties in the early part of his life, but was he really physically with the English at Falkirk? What is that black stuff that everyone uses to burn things with? (though certainly the real Wallace WAS fond of setting things on fire; it was said that he always ""smelled of smoke""). The God-conversing Stephen of Ireland is a great comic relief character who may or may not have been a real person. And on the subject of Ireland, we see that the hard-luck Irish were, even back then, used as cheap cannon fodder by the English - though in this film with an exhilarating twist.<br/><br/>The point of all this is: it is sometimes necessary to change details of history or to modernize motivations to make an entertaining film. Back then, there was likely no concept of what we would think of as ""Freedom!"" today, nor even a well defined sense of Scottish nationalism. Braveheart is a translation of difficult medieval concepts into something regular people can understand. If you don't do this, if you attempt to portray ancient cultures as they were, then you get something else altogether - the best example of which would be Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' (I greatly admire this film as well, but there is no denying that it is grossly misunderstood and unappreciated by the majority of people).<br/><br/>There is a strongly religious feeling that permeates this film, and in the end Wallace becomes Christ-like as a martyr in several ways. But you do not have to be religious to enjoy it, nor do you have to have Scottish ancestry (as I, years after first seeing the film, discovered I did) to feel pride in the heroes portrayed. It is the universal human strength in the defiance of tyranny and oppression that we may take to heart, and that makes Braveheart perhaps the greatest war movie of all time."
"dorotka24","10","3","7","26 October 2007"," May always be my favorite
","I cannot provide an unbiased opinion of this movie, since for over ten years it has been, and perhaps always will be, my favorite. Why? After all, it's almost completely historically inaccurate, and I am a great lover of history. It's incredibly brutal and violent, and I prefer peaceable means to settle arguments in my life. It's not even filmed in Scotland, but in Ireland.<br/><br/>Despite all these flaws, it is after all a movie, and in this it gets almost everything else right. It has passionate romance tempered by passionate violence. It explores the qualities of honor, kinship, and loyalty, tempered with the all too common human traits of deception, greed, and betrayal. Vengeance is also a centerpiece here.<br/><br/>Aesthetically speaking, the film is positively gorgeous to behold. There are grand, sweeping panoramas. The sights, sounds, and even smells of medieval life are brought to the screen, as imagined by its creators. The battle scenes are epic and intense, yet time is also spent on the aftermath, and the often terrible pain and loss of life. In short, the movie is an experience, and a fantastic one at that.<br/><br/>My criticisms are almost completely overshadowed by the overall effect of the film. See it for yourself, then if your interest in the life of William Wallce is piqued, you can learn more about him from a few books and other scant references."

At ten minutes, mutters had become outraged snorts and laughter - couldn't the editor have even *tried* to sync the piper's fingers with the terribly unrealistic pipe music? At 15, right after he said, ""Look!

Gladiator was hard enough to swallow (Maximus fights the Roman Emperor in the Colosseum?). Braveheart was simply impossible. The blue paint was ludicrous for a start.

And I see a whole army of my countrymen here in agreement of tyranny. You have come to Vote as ruled men and ruled men you are. What would you do with freedom? Will you fight?

","I really liked the movie the first time i saw it.I kept many of the scenes and good dialogs in my mind for days, and this happens to me usually when i am touched with a movie.Every time I got a chance to enjoy the movie again in television, I did it.Then, in the year 2000 I saw the movie ""The patriot"" and at some point of the movie I found my own spoiler, ""The Patriot"" became like the reincarnation of William Wallace in Benjamin Martin.You see, for instance all the war scenes, fights,blood,horses and the honor of the 2 different characters were very similar, so I didn't like the Patriot because was like a ""SEQUEL"" of Braveheart. I still think that Braveheart is a wonderful movie but I think in my humble opinion that Mel Gibson wanted some similar impact and success with the movie The Patriot, like he had with brave heart and he competed with one of his own good movies and that was not necessary. I don't think that other movie about wars like Braveheart can be better,Braveheart is good and then you don't want to see similar plots in others movies, because you already know what is good. You can't improve perfect and Braveheart is perfect"

","As a film it is obviously intended for children and retards; looks good but the dialogue and plot are puerile, the directing and acting, especially of Gibson, are over-the-top. Then we come to the story......""I know"" someone said, ""lets take a factual story and rewrite it so that not one single fact remains"". Why?? I've never understood the Scottish fascination with Wallace - he was a useless commander who won one battle in his life by ignoring the code of chivalry and attacking while the English crossed Stirling Bridge and then spent the rest of his life hiding from the English and leading his band of cut-throats over the border to destroy undefended farms and villages. His next biggest victory after Stirling Bridge was against an English Nunnery where he raped all the nuns and killed all their goats and sheep. Not in the film? I wonder why. Eventually even his Scottish supporters got so peed off with him they deliberately shopped him to the English.<br/><br/>And if I was more than 1/4 Scottish I'd be a bit miffed that the Scots were painted with blue woad, more than a thousand years after the demise of the Picts who may have worn woad but were a different race to the Scots"

","Mel Gibson has an awful lot to answer for. Braveheart is despicable tosh that distorts historical truth beyond all decent conventions. So much in this film is a lie that the uneducated masses with no previous knowledge of the period will believe something that just didn't happen. There is so much that is inaccurate in Braveheart that I shall only mention a few key errors, all of them unforgivable. For a start William Wallace and Edward I did not die at the same time, as is implied, in fact Edward died a couple of years later! Also, Willy Wallace certainly did not father the future Edward III that is also alluded to. The English thrashed the Scots in 1298, but in this film it appears that the Scots put up more of a fight. Wallace certainly did not fight with Robert the Bruce after the battle either! Gibson distorts the truth to satisfy his rabid anti-English opinions. The man is a bigoted idiot with no respect for history. Moving on to the film itself, there are a few so-so battle scenes, but the rest of the film is essentially false junk. The dialogue is ponderous and moronic, whilst the first hour is utterly soul destroying so boring is it. There is a nice scene when Edward I throws a chap out of a window, but if that's the highlight of a film you know there are problems! People should not be taken in by this rubbish. Had Edward I survived a little longer in reality he stood a good chance of conquering Scotland so weak was the Bruce dynasty. Anyway, avoid this movie, it is nothing but anti-English propaganda!!!"

Braveheart definitely wows, and it's near perfect. I've watched this film many times over the years and it's always as exhilarating as the first. From the acting, to the writing, to the cinematography, it's cinematic perfection. And, it's stood the test of time and aged incredibly well to boot, being 23 years old at the time of this review. There's been many a film released after Braveheart of the same genre and many films tried to capture the spirit, if you will, of this masterpiece. But Braveheart is yet to be duplicated.

","Excellent Film! 1995 Best Picture! The acting is amazing, and the ending was brilliant. For me, all my guesses were incorrect. Everything that happens in this movie in unpredicted. The last half hour itself was highly unpredictable, and it had a powerful message. When a scene was meant to be dramatic, they did a great job at it. The message the movie sent kept me thinking for a while. The amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was barely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of 1995, they did a great job. Everything in this film was done tastefully. I love Robert's last line ""You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed with me!"" and the army stands and continues their struggling battles for freedom! This is such an inspirational movie with a powerful message ""Every man dies, but not every man really lives"" to a tearful ending that will make anyone shed a tear to a terrific heartfelt sound track, it's no wonder this won best picture with other Oscars. This is a movie, a terrific one that everyone should enjoy and watch. Well recommended! Go see this if you haven't! William Wallace is a Scottish rebel who leads an uprising against the cruel English ruler Edward the Longshanks, who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself. When he was a young boy, William Wallace's father and brother, along with many others, lost their lives trying to free Scotland.

","Braveheart,according to me, is the best film ever made. For me, the film should be number one in the top ten of the best film of 90s. That's awesome I like the film. Some people will say that the film is too violent that the war scenes are gory and boring and that this film has no sense. According to me, violence does make sense in the film. Why would you call the movie ""Braveheart"" if the movie wasn't violent. I think that it would be ridiculous. For me, there are great war scenes in the film, they are awe-inspiring, I like the violence of the wars. they made a really good job on the Medieval's weapons. The performance of the actor who played Edward the Longshanks is absolutely wonderful. The guy has the most bone-chilling look in the movie. Robert the Bruce is one of the best character in the film. His face makes you think that he is innocent but in reality he is a coward, he is a sell out, he sets Wallace up. He is guilty of the execution of Wallace. I think that it wasn't so good that they changed some elements of the true events. In reality, Robert never betrayed Wallace. I was really disappointed by this side of the film. Why change the details of the story when it's already written. They changed the plot in order to make the movie more dramatic."

","Hi everybody, this weekend I watched Braveheart. And I wanted to give you my opinion. In this film, William Wallace is the hero, he defends the Scottish, he wants freedom for himself and for the Scots. I liked this movie but I thought that it was too violent and that too many details were shown. In spite of Mel Gibson, who is William Wallace in the movie, he is not Scottish, he took a very good accent to imitate the Scottish. At a moment, a part of Bravehart was so incomprehensible for me. But at the end, I understood. Bravehart is a synonym of courage. When William Wallace was killed, to take his revenge, his troops set off another war against the English. So, I'm going to stop now for the summary because I'll be able to tell you all the movie... HAHAHA... So personally, I find this movie great, the director has done a good job. The actors allowed us to immerse ourselves completely in the film, it was incredible. Now, Braveheart is one of the favourite movies that I have seen despite the excess of violence there was. The film was interesting. And for me it deserves to be in the Oscar's Ceremony to be recognized by all. I hope that my opinion will interest you. Bye for now"

"quad-40751","6","2","4","2 March 2017"," Don't take this movie seriously
","I'm sure you've heard something about this movie, Braveheart. In Braveheart, Mel Gibson plays and becomes William Wallace, the leader of the Scottish rebellion. This movie takes place in the XII century, I watched Braveheart three days ago and already in the first view, we can see some inaccurate points. First, Wallace was not the children of a farmer. Seconde, he was not the leader and he wasn't appreciated by his people. Third, we can see the faces of Scots were painting in blue like the color of Scotland but this is not the good period. The Scots painted their faces against the Romans, a long time before. Finally, in the movie, Wallace was tortured and decapitated. His last word is ""Freedom !"". But for a men who is being tortured, Mel Gibson didn't play it well because he don't cry, he didn't suffer. And history says we didn't know the last words of William Wallace. In my opinion, Mel Gibson wanted to do a great movie but he didn't care about the history, it's pity. However it's an amazing movie with the effort of Mel Gibson to do the Scottish accent and the battle scenes. If we take this movie seriously, it's ridiculous and I think the website Allocin√© has to change the type of this movie."

"cmacdiamond","9","2","4","17 January 2017"," Not a History Lesson, but a great war film
","The best thing about this film is its battles. That's not to say that there isn't more to like, just the battles are brilliant. They're raw, often gruesome, and feel very realistic (even if they really aren't). The passion of the Scottish contrasted with the English soldiers during the battles perfectly shows what the film is about, and makes it more believable that they could take down such a superior force. At first the Scottish are driven by their love for their country, but as the film progresses, and we see that not everyone in Scotland is with them, the drive is for freedom, that they want not just for themselves, but each other.<br/><br/>The score is great, has an uplifting sense of bravery, played with a highland feel, and it fits perfectly.<br/><br/>There are not too many problems that I have with this film. I think that all of the performances are great, but I would have liked to get some more depth to the likes of Stephen and even Isabella, who could have been really interesting given her horrible scenario. The historical inaccuracies are really bad too, but I was mostly able to look past them by deeming this as a work of fiction. And in that respect, ""Braveheart"" is Great.<br/><br/>9/10"

"tmazzucchi","8","2","4","23 October 2016"," Inspirational and Dramatic
","The film Braveheart shows the epic tale of a hero fueled by vengeance and love, that stands for what he believes in, no matter the enemy. From a village rebellion to a full-scale war against the English, Mel Gibson's William Wallace captivates viewers to follow his journey for Scotland and inspires both the characters and the viewers outside of the film to fight for what they believe in. Watching this movie certainly did inspire me and the work which was done in both acting and capturing the emotion added up to a powerful story. Although many elements of the setting were uncontrollable and hard to manage, John Toll personally did a very good job at turning factors such as rain and natural lighting, into aspects that give the film more life. The overall tone of the movie was that of a burdensome nature. The gray sky and the rain did a really good job at weighing down and making the poor villages seem like they were even more disadvantaged. Starting from the beginning, you see this area that has clear signs of high precipitation. The movie itself takes of slowly, maybe too slowly for my taste, but soon after the story begins to move forward at a comfortable pace. John Toll portrayed this journey that William Wallace had with a very intense outlook. His high key lighting worked to enhance the details on the characters, the mud, the scratches, blood crusts, and cuts which they have. He chose to continue to shoot the film during unfavorable weather and whenever anything that would have been a setback to the camera presented itself, he simply would find ways to incorporate them into the movie and add more to the dramatic look. Although ambitions of John Toll, the issue with shooting everything in natural weather means that there were continuity issues regarding aspects like the rain and the lighting which had to be adjusted to it. Shooting in the rain limits the use of lights but the team did continue to try and run cables through the mud to help with the shots. Personally I believe that this is an inconvenience but it does go to show how invested John Toll was in having the shots be how he envisioned them. Other issues were minimal, although towards the end of the movie scenes like the battle scenes were never perfectly in focus due to the fact that characters were moving about everywhere in a non determined way. It is not that easy to notice but when looking through a critical lens, it is something that should have been adjusted. Overall the movie was great, I really did enjoy it. I felt inspired and passionate after having watched it. The mood and the characters were portrayed to perfection thanks to John Toll's good work as the cinematographer. I recommend watching it if you have not already because it truly does speak to everyone."

","They say one picture is worth a thousand words? Well, here, a million words still wouldn't cover the reality that the cast and crew have put on the screen.<br/><br/>When I first saw it a couple of years ago I only gave it a 9, coz I thought Gibson looked a bit too old, but now, I can ignore the tram-lines on the forehead and just appreciate the excellent performance he gives. And, the interesting commentary he adds to the DVD, - explaining the ""mechanical"" horse scenes! and talking about the Murron (Catherine McCormack) ""audition"". (I wish that had been videoed, and released!)<br/><br/>Of course, I didn't know or care about 13th century history, but here it is, in full colour, and full emotion. With, as Gibson explains, added little bits of drama and humour just to relieve the awfulness of the reality of hand-to-hand combat that was so dramatically displayed.<br/><br/>Some people say it is not historically accurate? 'doesn't matter in my view, it is plausible. (except for the final hung/drawn/quartered scenes? that is simply not survivable, but Gibson does explain that what really happened was even worse.<br/><br/>I was so impressed with so many of the support cast. McCormack as Murron, so sad, yet that is most of the plot, that Wallace was so passionate that he got his revenge, quickly getting support from neighbouring clans, glens and towns. Patrick McGoohan as the horrible King Edward, Sophie Marceau, Jeanne Marine, Tommy Flanagan (with the Glascow 'smile'!) and his bride Julie Austin too, although only very briefly on screen, such a good piece of writing, direction and acting.<br/><br/>England and Scotland, at that time, and for some centuries after, was an awful place to be, full of scheming nobles, treachery, cruelty, civil war - yet somehow, evolution seems to have softened the hard hearts of men?<br/><br/>Braveheart is very close to being my 'best ever' movie, so it's a 10 now."
"The Grand Master","10","2","4","29 February 2016"," Still an emotionally powerful movie over 20 years later.
","Braveheart is still an emotionally powerful movie over 20 years later. Mel Gibson's performance as Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace who believed in fighting for freedom against England's tyrannical rule. Mel Gibson can also proudly add another string to his bow by proving that he is not just a pretty face by showcasing his finest work as a director.<br/><br/>William Wallace's life has been plagued with tragedy. His father and brother died when he was a young child while battling the English and his newly wedded bride Murron (Catherine McCormack) is publicly executed by British soldiers after she tries to fight off an attempted rape. The British state that her public execution will be made an example to those who defy the British. Wallace returns to seek retribution of those British soldiers responsible, and with the help of several villagers slaughter the British soldiers. Swearing vengeance of the British and tiring of the tyrannical British rule under the thumb of King Edward Longshanks of England (Patrick McGoohan), William Wallace inspires most of Scotland to form an Army and lead an uprising against the British which culminates in many victorious yet brutal battles between the makeshift militia and the well disciplined British troops. Edward Longshanks tries to send French princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) to broker peace talks in place of his weak willed son however they fall on deaf ears. In a memorable scene before going into battle at the victorious Battle of Stirling Bridge, William Wallace fires up his troops with his inspirational speech that gives goosebumps to everyone including the audience ""They may take our lives, but they'll never take...OUR FREEDOM!"" The battle scenes are spectacularly brilliant. Without a doubt, besides the storyline, they form the most memorable scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>As an actor and director, Mel Gibson has never been finer. Randall Wallace's screenplay is brilliant and the late James Horner's score is tranquil during quiet moments and inspirationally brilliant during the frantic battle scenes.<br/><br/>Released in 1995, Braveheart has been one of those movies that has certainly held a special place with me for a long time. It is an emotionally powerful and an epic movie that well and truly deserved to be the winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson, take a bow. You will always be remembered for your finest work for Braveheart.<br/><br/>10/10."

","Braveheart. The Oscar winning war drama acted and directed by Mel Gibson. It is the heroic tale of how a Scottish commoner rebelled against an English tyrant. With a grand canvas, absolute stunning cinematography, a water tight screenplay, very well acted and above all directed with such a passion and courage that you want this tale not to end at all even after the three hours of running time. After an emotional twist in the tale, the movie goes to a very high level of film making in unforgettable last hour of it. It's Mel Gibson's show from start to finish as he acts and directs with full love and understanding of cinema. The war scenes are detailed, uncluttered and mesmerizing. Sophie Marceau as English queen looks beautiful and acts smartly. The camaraderie among Scottish rebels is charming and provides the comic relief. Just like Gladiator, Braveheart is the heroic tale worth revisiting again and again and again."

"LeonLouisRicci","6","2","4","6 January 2014"," Cowardly But Entertaining Enough
","There are so many Historical Inaccuracies in this Film, as many Scholars who know such Things have pointed out, that they won't be listed here. A small amount of Research will shed some Light. But here is one, and it's a DOOZY.<br/><br/>The Title, is actually from a Poem Written about and Titled for Robert the Bruce, not William Wallace. Want one more? Robert the Bruce never Betrayed William Wallace. That's enough Egghead stuff, now there is the Movie. Best Picture Oscar Winner, by the way, in a very very Slim Year. <br/><br/>The Movie is Entertaining Enough and has been sighted for Rousing, Bloody, You are there Battle Sequences. OK. But most of the Movie is Over Acted, with Mr. Gibson taking the Worst Actor Honors, but not without Strong Competition. The Story is pure Claptrap, Pulpy, Romantic, Sentimental Nonsense. It is Manipulative to the Point of Dreariness for almost its complete Three-Hour Running Time. <br/><br/>It all makes for some Big Screen Excitement and the FREEDOM Plot Motivating the Movie is a sure Crowd Arouser, but it all Smacks of nothing more than a Big-Budget, Battle Cry Behemoth that is Shallow, Sophomoric, and all Made-Up Underneath. <br/><br/>That's because it is. It is all Made into some kind of Superhero Epic, but even that is Undermined because here the Hero not only gets the Girl, He gets any Female who happens to be on the Screen.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson, Our Hero, not only gets the Girls, He got a few Oscars along with. But at the Expense of an Overrated, Good-Looking Movie that throws History to the wind and is at its Heart not very Brave about Anything approaching Reality to tell the Story."
"WhimsicalVonia","5","2","4","19 December 2013"," Not Even Historically Accurate...
","For whatever reason, I hated almost everything about this film. Yes, I am a girl. That probably contributes a lot. Mel Gibson's accent and acting seemed overdone. The story was constantly overshadowed by an overly dramatic battle scene. The film was pretty much made to flaunt machismo, daring, and flashy firework-battle scenes. <br/><br/>To make matters worse, not even historically accurate. Wallace was not the poor villager the film depicts, but a landowner and minor knight. Queen Isabella, his love interest, was only a few years old at the time period used in the film; the kilt was not worn for another few centuries; Robert never betrayed Wallace; The Scottish did not paint their faces. <br/><br/>Sure, overlooking this, as a film is primarily fiction, this could have been a good film. But I could not see it. Sure, there were some intense scenes, some scenes that made me smile. But, as a whole, Braveheart was a loss. What I take away from this film, actually, is the idea of Primae Noctis, the legendary right that feudal lords supposedly had to peasants' marriage beds on their wedding nights. Sadly, this is not proved fact, but a myth. Still, it is interesting trivia that could be true. <br/><br/>I will say that the landscape was beautiful and lush for much of the film, with impressive costume design and a production element that must have taken some talent. The accompanying soundtrack was also well done, with music played at the right moments in the right amounts. <br/><br/>An ambitious film with an overuse of blood, battle scenes, and paint, Mel Gibson does not impress. I found myself turning away several times either in disbelief and/or loss of interest."
"AaronCapenBanner","10","2","4","11 December 2013"," Freedom!
","Mel Gibson both directed and starred as Scottish rebel and warrior William Wallace in this Academy Award winning (best picture and director) account of how Wallace led a revolt against the ruthless English King Edward the I(Longshanks) who oppressed the Scottish people in his attempt to wear both the crowns of England and Scotland. Wallace had lost a father & brother as a young man, now as an adult, his love was murdered by English soldiers after fighting rape, and an enraged Wallace vows revenge, though Edward I(played by Patrick McGoohan) is not so easily defeated, Wallace's valiant efforts in battle made him legend... Magnificent film is stirring and exciting, and at 3 hrs. is never tedious, but remarkably compelling, with superb performances, direction, and breathtaking battle scenes; a moving(though brutal) ending for Wallace. Some historical liberties are forgivable in modern-day classic."

","To quote the main character William Wallace (Mel Gibson); ""FREEDOOOOOOMMMMMM!"" This is a story of the people of Scotland fighting for the right to be free. From the actions of the self-righteous English King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan), Wallace is forced to take a stand after his wife Murron (Catherine McCormack) is killed for fighting back as an English guard tries to rape her. Wallace, trained by his uncle Argyle Wallace (Brian Cox) after his father was killed holds nothing back in his vengeance on the English. Wallace does not see this fight as needing anyone else involved, but all of Scotland stands with him to rid Scotland of the English. Mel Gibson did a fantastic job taking the legend of William Wallace and adapting it to a modern day representation of what audiences want to see. Forbidden love, heart, honor, and action all rolled into one great movie portraying the underdog fighting back against a seemingly unstoppable foe. Braveheart has even more conflict than just that of Scotland and England. During Wallace's fight we also see King Edward fight with his son's choice of companionship as the attempt to produce an heir to the throne only causes more tension in the kingdom. Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) from France becomes the bride of Prince Philip (Stephan Billington) and finds herself in the middle of the conflict and does a wonderful job of dealing with Prince Philip, Wallace, and King Edward I. Conflict also ensues with Scotland's Nobles fighting with each other for rights to land and succession to the throne. Battle scenes were done quite well by my point of view. Whenever you have that many actors there is bound to be some mistakes, I didn't even notice them until most were pointed out to me. The editing of the battle scenes must have been a long and painstaking task on its own. Matching emotion and lighting, blood stains and wounds, who had an arrow in their butt and who lost limbs, what a mess. Steven Rosenblum did a fantastic job with the editing. Mel Gibson seems to have a thing for the English, if you like Braveheart you need to also see The Patriot (2000). In this he also is wronged and sought out by the English, forcing him to fight back only to have all of colonial South Carolina stand behind him as he fights to protect his family. Braveheart is a great movie and very entertaining. As some reviewers and history buffs pointed out, there are many flaws compared to the original story and time line, but stories are written by those that want to entertain."

The last 5%: in almost every possible genre there are movies that are true masterpieces. Incredible, fast action movies like Inception, or amazing drama films like The Shawshank Redemption. Total devotion from the actors, a world that is touching because of it's realism. Braveheart belongs in that category. Mel Gibson's lifework, after this movie he never made something as great as this one. He directed it and played the main role, and came as close to art as he possibly could. It's not the story that makes this movie so great, it's the complex and realistic characters, their motives and there actions. I was thrown into the movie right from the beginning, all the way till the epic ending. The movie explores the abstract concepts of 'good and bad' very deep, it presents to us a painfully true image of humanity.

","This is a fantastic movie that is factually incorrect. It has an amazing soundtrack, fiercely impressive acting, and adds some wonderful fiction to a mystical figure from Scotland's past.<br/><br/>Some interesting facts: 1. Wallace was a member of the Scottish nobility. He was far from being a peasant or dirt farmer. 2. The movie talks about how nobody can withstand a Cavalry charge. This is untrue, traditionally cavalry charges only work against rabble, against any force that is organized cavalry charges are usually easily defeated by trained foes. They were mostly used for flanking attacks and in formations that help to create refused flanks. 3. The Battle of Stirling Bridge is depicted in the film, but it bears little resemblance to the real battle, there being no bridge (due mainly to the difficulty of filming around the bridge itself) and the tactics resembling the Battle of Bannockburn. The main strategic events of the battle (but obviously not the detail) are followed in Robyn Young's novel Requiem. 4. He was actually captured years after his defeat at Falkirk. 5. The sexual implications between him and the queen are complete fiction. 6. Edward did not die any time near the time of Wallace.<br/><br/>Just some interesting facts."

","I've just returned from a long-planned trip to Scotland, and let me tell you, the legend of William Wallace is EVERYWHERE. Naturally, parts of this movie have received the Hollywood treatment, but that's to be expected. They were making a movie for entertainment, not a documentary. Still, it seems to be fairly accurate.<br/><br/>I spent 2 weeks hiking around Scotland, visiting castles, monuments, and talking to local historians. (The ""Historic Scotland"" employees are fantastic!) Everyone there LOVES this movie, and they have no problem with the bits that got the Hollywood treatment. I discussed the movie several times with locals, and they put certain things into perspective. If the historical accuracy is good enough for them, it should be good enough for the rest of us.<br/><br/>If you are ever in Scotland, be sure to visit the Wallace Monument near Stirling- it is visible on the crag near Stirling Castle. There are about 246 steps to the top of the monument, but on the 2nd level, you will see the sword of William Wallace. This is no museum replica- this is an old sword that has seen some action. It is quite impressive to think that this sword was used in battle."

"deanofrpps","9","2","4","9 February 2007"," The Gospel According to Mel
","It's the late 13th century. Scotland suffers under the brutal occupation personified in the evil King Edward I whom American born Irish actor Patrick McGoohan plays with a diabolic frenzy, the very embodiment of iniquity. ""The problem with Scotland?"" Edward I muses aloud, ""The Scots live there!"" Among the many outrages is the institution of Prima Nocte. <br/><br/>Defeated and dispirited, the Scots argue best with each other. The line of Scottish kings has been broken. The claimant to the throne Robert The Bruce lacks the support of the nobles, many of whom were paid off by King Edward. <br/><br/>How can such a nation bitterly divided against itself produce a hero? Heroes come by strange twists of fate. In the confusion, William Wallace in a fit of rage renders a powerful reprisal to the occupier. Mel Gibson lends all his charisma and charm to the the title role.<br/><br/>Where the defiant Wallace urges revolution, the timorous Scottish nobility busy with wealth and titles have no interest in Freedom and Country. The noblemen try to sucker Wallace himself with the meaningless compliment 'guardian and high protector of Scotland.' <br/><br/>Wallace pleads with the pretender to the vacant throne, The Earl of Bruce to bypass the corrupt nobility and make his case directly to the people: ""The people would follow you, if you would only lead them."" <br/><br/>The Bruce who would succeed to the Throne may be ambivalent but Wallace does have a significant loyal following nonetheless. Brendan Gleeson later to play the dysfunctional father Stobrod Thewes in a different highlands in Cold Mountain brings strength and humor to his role as the robust swordsman Hamish Cambell. David O'Hara brings up the rear with comic relief as the crazed Irishman who threw in with The Cause. <br/><br/>Brilliant in the director's chair, Mel Gibson captured the intrinsic beauty of the Scottish highlands while as an actor Mel at the same time took on the heroic character of a great warrior adding to the dour Scot a breezy Lochinvar charm raising the √©lan of warriors steadying themselves for battle with the unforgettable battle cry 'Alba gu bragh!' <br/><br/>The battle scenes are frantically staged, spilling a bit too much gore in the horror and brutality of massed hand-to-hand combat for an overly sensitive US - er audience functioning with intestinal fortitude on a par with the wicked King Edward's namby pamby son of whom the evil king says: <br/><br/>""Who shall I sent to negotiate with this Wallace? Not my gentle son, his appearance would only encourage an enemy to take over the entire country."" <br/><br/>Yet if Wallace's purpose is to free Scotland under its rightful native ruler Robert The Bruce, in the tangled weave of factionalism, Wallace may have become the stumbling block in The Bruce's rise to power. The movie is about Wallace but the Bruce is by far the more interesting and complex character. Angus Macfadyen born Glasgow, Scotland plays the enigmatic Bruce, ambitious yet cautious and ever duplicit. <br/><br/>Certainly The Bruce's battle-plan at Bannochburn, not far from Fallkirk but on better terrain for the unarmored Scottish troops, was nothing short of magnificent. However, Bannochburn and with it Scottish independence was yet in a distant future, when King Edward I marched on Scotland. Upon the English attack, The Bruce stands next to the demon Longshanks himself whom the Scotts condemn as a pagan. Keltophiles for seven centuries have tried to rationalize The Bruce's choice of friends at Fallkirk. <br/><br/>This film politely adopts a version of the legend which attributes The Bruce's treachery to the machinations of the leper David, Robert The Bruce's father. <br/><br/>Unstated in this movie is the more likely premise that for The Bruce to gain the throne Wallace must be die. <br/><br/>Later at Bannockburn, this movie does show The Bruce to be stroking his elbow guards embossed with the lion of Scotland with the gritty uneasiness of a newly minted butter bar lieutenant. Perhaps the explanation is simple: it takes more than a patriot to be a great leader, it take a bit of a devil. <br/><br/>However in the earlier battle at nearly the same spot, Bruce forgoes Wallace's invitation to lead the Scottish Kingdom. When Edward I invades to restore English rule, The Bruce stands with the enemy at Fallkirk Bridge. <br/><br/>There is an important historical lapse in Mel's otherwise brilliant cinematography of the apocalyptic battle at Fallkirk Bridge. Mel decided against shooting at the original site because the bridge would get in the way. ""Ay,"" agreed a local sidewalk superintendent, ""So too, the English found...."" <br/><br/>Defeated after a spirited battle at Fallkirk Bridge, Wallace takes to the Highlands to re-stir the resistance. Betrayed on his way to a meeting with The Bruce, Wallace is taken to England to be hung drawn and quartered for treason. On the gallows, Wallace echoes that blood chilling scream: 'Freeeeedom.' <br/><br/>A tale of love, freedom and national pride, Braveheart uses a gentle Celtic score as a haunting counterpoint to the blood and gore. <br/><br/>The movie ends with The Bruce throwing Wallace's sword at the English at Bannockburn, but the story of the fight for Independence had an even more dramatic ending in the The Declaration of Arbroath 1320 in which the Scots renounced not merely England but divine right as well in the chilling words:. <br/><br/>""For, as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule."" <br/><br/>The line did run fallow and Scotts would be humbled at Colladen some four hundred years later, ending the independence of their kingdom until Mel revived it in 1996."

","The Scots, the Irish, even the French.......where were the Welsh? A little ironic they got left out, because if anyone had more cause to resent Edward, creator of the British, it was probably the Welsh aristocracy! Still, this movie only uses it's historical setting to create a story of individual physical and moral courage.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson goes into Mad Max mode when his gorgeous wife is foully done to death. How come she was so pretty and clean when all her relatives were ugly and dirty? No matter. Rightly roused, William Wallace foments an uprising. Cue lots of Terry Gilliam style slashin' an' bashin'. The cuttin' an' buttin' pretty much continues on through the film. Fair enough, makes a change for violence to be stomach-churning and filthy rather than clean and tidy, as in so many machine-gun-toting or light-sabre-waving movies. Being butchered in a battle should never look like fun. Well done, Mr. Gibson.<br/><br/>As the story behind the fighting took shape it all started getting a bit biblical. This Bruce fellow - our Rabbie....he's part of some disgusting cabal of Scottish aristocracy. Their meandering meanness and geedy self-interest makes Edward 1st (portrayed brilliantly by Patrick McGoohan) look like a positive beacon of moral courage. So why does William Wallace seem to worship the Scottish lord so much? The answer seems to lie in Mr. Gibson imaging Wallace as being John-the-Baptist to the second coming of the Scots: Robert-the-Bruce.<br/><br/>That seems to be the only explanation for why Wallace, despite being metaphorically as well as literally, kicked in the teeth by these treacherous aristocrats, keeps deferring to the One: the Bruce. Finally, Wallace as Scottish John-the-Baptist suffers his own form of crucifixion, in lieu of his god, strapped to a horizontal cross by the English judges and being publicly disembowelled. ! FREEDOM ! he screams. Freedom for the Scottish? Or freedom for Wallace from serving his Master? <br/><br/>By the end then, we end up with two historical figures possibly being traduced: Edward the First and Robert the Bruce. I don't know much about history.<br/><br/>I do know that, aside from the early romantic scenes of Wallace in love, the only parts of the film I could take a delight in watching were those wherein Patrick McGoohan acted his creation. McGoohan was rightly 're-discovered' by the public as a result of this role. He does of course get most of the best lines. But he still had to deliver them and he did. Brilliant. Unfortunately his character is struck dumb by the end of the movie. It might have been more interesting had he been physically paralysed but still able to speak his defiance of the scheming French witch and all the other useless people he ended up surrounded by. Just as Wallace proved impotent and was superseded by Bruce so his nemesis, Edward, shared the same impotence; as his bloodline was erased by those less 'moral' than he."
"roghache","9","2","4","15 May 2006"," Gripping though unhistorical portrayal of Scotland's legendary hero
","This is undoubtedly a remarkable film and a magnificent tribute to the people, pride, and spirit of Scotland. Few movies involve more gripping emotion, more intense passion, or a more compelling hero than this depiction of William Wallace, a peace loving farmer who just wants to settle down raising a family, and has no desire to fight. However, he is driven to rage against English tyranny and a passionate battle for his country's freedom after the murder of his lovely new wife. <br/><br/>The film depicts the 13th Century struggles of the famous Scottish rebel, William Wallace. As a youngster, his father and older brother, Malcolm, are both killed in battle against the English and he is then taken under the wing of his Uncle Argyle. When he reaches adulthood, Wallace marries a local girl named Murron, but does so secretly in order to avoid the right ('primae noctis') claimed by English lords to take new Scottish brides for themselves on their wedding night. However, an English soldier tries to rape Murron, Wallace intervenes and in the ensuing struggle, she is brutally executed. Wallace is enraged and leads a series of battles against the English, involving conflict both with King Edward I (Longshanks) and the treacherous Scottish nobles, led by Robert the Bruce. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson is constantly compelling as the heroic Braveheart, William Wallace, depicting both his heartbreaking personal story and his courageous struggle to free Scotland from English oppression. He conveys Wallace's intelligence, bravery, integrity, and passion for Scotland. Gibson's face perfectly mirrors Wallace's emotions in every scene. Personally, I found his Scottish accent quite adequate. Patrick McGoohan gives a chilling portrayal of Wallace's ruthless and despicable adversary, the callous Edward Longshanks, and Angus MacFadyen is brilliant as the traitorous Robert the Bruce<br/><br/>So many intensely moving scenes...little Murron handing the grieving young William a thistle, the heart wrenching wedding festivities in which the English lord arrives to claim his rights to the innocent young bride while the enraged groom looks helplessly on, the beautiful romantic scenes of William with Murron, the devastation in Wallace's eyes following Bruce's betrayal. The musical score featuring Scottish bagpipe music is a haunting accompaniment to many of the scenes.<br/><br/>However, it is not a film for the faint of heart with brutal, gory medieval battle scenes involving long pikes, endless mud and blood. There are incredibly effective slow motion sequences of some of the battle charges, especially of oncoming horse mounted calvary. I have read that the historical reality of Wallace's tortured execution was even more brutal than depicted here.<br/><br/>The film should be taken as at least half fiction, since it does feature a wealth of historical inaccuracies, which Gibson himself openly admitted and I'll point out for any who may be interested. For starters, the historical time frame wasn't right for young William to have witnessed the mass hangings of his fellow Scots as a child. Wallace is shown in battle painted blue with woad, a practice that had not been used for centuries. Robert the Bruce did not betray Wallace at Falkirk as shown. The courtship between Wallace and the French Princess Isabelle never actually took place as she was only a child at the time, thus Wallace could not have been the father of the future Edward III as implied here. Also, Edward Longshanks in fact died two years after Wallace, not at the same time. Finally and perhaps most important, while the English are naturally portrayed as completely villainous, the heinous 'primae noctis' law which elicits such outrage in most viewers apparently did not actually ever exist in England or Scotland. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite these inaccuracies and my general distaste for depictions of brutal medieval warfare, this is an amazingly well crafted movie. While it definitely should not be considered an historical source, it provides a passionate and incredibly wrenching portrayal of Scotland's great hero, his personal heartbreak, his leadership in battle, and the just cause that consumes him. It leaves many images unlikely to be forgotten by most viewers, including this one."

","I think braveheart is a great film and is terrifically acted by the lead characters. I think it is a great story about William WAllace a great Scottish man i think it shows that Scotland's struggle for independence was more difficult than it seems. Some of the events in the film are not really true but it makes a good film. I think Mel Gibson is excellent in the film and plays William Wallace brilliantly. I think the way the film is directed is great and the way they show William's own personal struggle during the story. I think the battles are really well done and thought about. All in all i think this is a great film to watch and also a great film for Scotland."

","Braveheart is one film I will never forget. There could not have been a better director or actor than Mel Gibson to helm such a captivating film. The emotions are so intense that I frequently felt ""prickles"" running down my arms and cheeks because I was so touched by this film. I know we have all felt that feeling before in movies we have watched, and that definitely proves that Mel Gibson knows how to reach his audience. He gets our adrenaline rushing when battles begin, he makes us try to hold back tears when a sad event occurs (in this movie there are about a million sad scenes). All of this well-crafted story is made even better by James Horner's masterful music score. Now THIS guy knows how to compose music effectively, fitting his score perfectly with the images on screen. I give this film a 10/10 simply because after you watch it, you will never forget its impact."
"waynec50","9","2","4","5 March 2006"," Epic entertainment, if not exactly historically accurate
","""Braveheart is a very good movie, combining all the elements of a great epic and if it comes up just a bit short of greatness, it's still an entertaining three hours. The movie has everything, evil villains, brave heroes, exciting battles, romance, humor and a message. If the message is somewhat unclear in today's context, freedom is still the goal f William Wallace and his followers, the desire to rule themselves rather than to submit to outsiders. Visually, this is an exceptional picture, from the colorful costumes to some breathtaking scenery. The battles are brutal and filmed with an eye for the spectacular, flights of arrows, the heavy horse charge, the bloody hand to hand fighting and the desperation of the fighters are well filmed. One complaint is that there's no bridge to be seen in the battle of Stirling Bridge. The romance between Wallace and his village bride is well done, and her execution is heart breaking. His faithfulness is doubted in the movie as he sleeps with the Princess Isabella which is extremely unlikely. The climactic scene of Wallace screaming for ""Freedom"" rather than mercy from his executioners is as powerful as anything put on the screen in the last decade at least. ""Braveheart"" is an epic in the old sense and is an very good film."

We both agreed that it was the most enthralling movie we had ever witnessed. We are also of Scottish decent. Mel Gibson really put everything he had into this movie. It is definitely his best work ever! The young actor who played young William Wallace was excellent in this movie. Also the actor who played Longshenks was as evil a character as humanly possuible. The actor who played Hamish is a very good character actor. The young lady who played William Wallace's wife did an excellent job in making both of us cry."

","Quite honestly this movie is just absolutely brilliant. I have never, ever seen a movie that inspiring in my life. Any time I would hear a person talk about how a movie inspired them I would laugh. I mean we've all seen great movies, but I have never thought longer then 2 seconds about a movie after I saw it. <br/><br/>Braveheart is the only movie that i have seen more than 5 times. It is simply an amazing piece of film. The first time I saw this movie, I couldn't even move. It was that brilliant. I am not someone who cares for 99% of movies. And ones like the Godfather, Shawshank, North by Northwest, are all very good, but none, and I mean none even approach the level of filmamking that Braveheart attained. <br/><br/>As far as the movie itself goes, there are much better writers then I here on IMDb who can artfully tell you the brilliance of this film. I don't know too much about all that. But I do know that after watching this film, I felt truly inspired, and I mean I really did. The scenery of this film along with the music truly elevates this movie to a level most films would die to get to. But it is the content of this film that resonates so deeply in me.<br/><br/>This film is crafted to near perfection to touch on the rawest of human emotions, freedom and pain. The freedom isn't some corny word that most lame ass liberal Americans throw around these days, it was a visceral word. A word that was real. A word that stood for more than some college professors rant on Bush. Braveheart elevates the theme of freedom to something to die for. Not only does the film do that, but it introduces love as freedoms only companion. Wallace played by Gibson, rises to the occasion of playing a passionate Scot who wants to free his homeland. That plot alone sounds basic, right? But somehow, it rises to what it is suppose to rise to..brilliance. <br/><br/>I know people have challenged this movies historical portrayals, but that is really not relevant. This film isn't played in schools in Scotland, or anywhere for that matter, to teach them some Scottish history. Please people, this movie is theme based.<br/><br/>Watch this movie A.S.A.P. if you haven't already, and if you have, watch it again. It is truly inspiring."

","Mel in a kilt,long-haired, dirty and painted blue--what more could a woman want? No, seriously, this is a great movie, even through many re watchings. I loved the soundtrack, I loved the sets and scenery, I loved the action choreography, I loved the costumes and makeup--you could almost smell the sweaty men! It never fails to make me cry, either.<br/><br/>I also loved the story, and I have to, regrettably, emphasize the term story. There has been so much acclaim for this movie, and it is so universally loved, that it borders on sacrilege to question anything about it. It is undoubtedly one of the most watchable film epics ever made. Mel Gibson really knows how to take a storyline and morph it into a totally absorbing and memorable film experience. I left the theater crying over the loves won and lost, yet exalted by the sheer heroism and hope the character engendered, even in death. It made me want to yell with Mel,""Albanach go bragh!"" (Scotland forever!) Having gushed over everything from the look, the sound, the feel,and the virtual smell of the movie,I still have to question just a couple of things. I realize that the screenplay takes a lot of liberties with the historical facts, and to be honest, the historical facts are mostly shrouded in mystery.<br/><br/>Yet, I can't help but wonder why the facts had to be distorted SO much in the name of success at the box office. If in the story, Wallace needed a love interest after his wife died, why did they choose the real historical figure of Princess Isabella of France, yet place her in England and involved with Wallace at the time she was only about 9 years old, still in France, and not even yet married to the Prince of Wales, Edward II? <br/><br/>The romantic plot device of her illicit pregnancy with Wallace's child, and her subsequent revelation of it to King Edward I on his death bed is complete historical nonsense! Good Ol' Longshanks lived on after Wallace's execution for several more years--and I think genealogists would be quite surprised to know that the child who was to become Edward III was sired by a Scottish rebel who had been executed years before Princess (later Queen) Isabella was probably even fertile!!! Oh well! Despite these flaws in historical accuracy, it is still an extremely satisfying movie experience. And besides, I realize I am probably in the minority in even caring about the historical facts.<br/><br/>The obvious fact is that Gibson has taken an obscure Scottish hero, and a period in history, and brought them to life for many who probably never would have heard of William Wallace otherwise. If he has sparked interest and further study on the topic through his film,wonderful. If not, he has without doubt entertained us and touched us with this version of Wallace's story."

I shall skip any historical inaccuracies: I am talking about the film in itself, beautifully photographed by John Troll and well backed by James Horner's excellent music. <br/><br/>I shall add no other comment to the hundreds thus far submitted to IMDb. However, this story of Wallace fighting the English was only the beginning. If after seeing this film you would like to know more about Scotland and how the English carried out genocide against the clans, I thoroughly suggest the following reading:<br/><br/>John Prebble: Fire and Sword: the destruction of the clans <br/><br/>I - TheHighland Clearances <br/><br/>II - Glencoe <br/><br/>III - Culloden<br/><br/>In this meticulously documented trilogy, John Prebble uncovers the genocide carried out in Scotland from the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution through to the late 1800s, documents well hidden from the general public. <br/><br/>These books, though dating from the early 1960s, should still be available from Penguin (London), or Penguin-Bantam (USA and Canada)."

"vvanpo","8","2","4","18 November 2004"," Evocative but Troubling
","After watching Braveheart, I can't help but wonder how much of an influence starring in ""Mad Max"" was on Mel Gibson's film making. Maybe the then young actor landed a role that matched his view of good and evil just through good luck. In ""Braveheart"", the suffering icon Gibson plays is William Wallace, who fights to liberate the Scots from the tyranny of their English rulers and the treachery of the Scottish Lords.<br/><br/>Wallace matches cruelty with cruelty but that's alright because he's on the side of freedom. At least in ""Braveheart"" the times and the enemy are more in tune with barbarous methods than that of ""The Patriot"", which I detest as nothing more than a Revolutionary War-era ""Death Wish"". Patrick McGoohan is delicious as the English king Edward Longshanks who treats his allies as callously as his enemies. And I must admit my props to Mr. Gibson for treating warfare as the messy, horrific affair it is although he seems to revel in it.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" has many pluses. It is very convincing in taking you back in time. The stark landscapes of the Scottish countryside are lovely."

It is by far one of the greatest movies ever made.

"nj2","Null","2","4","13 July 2003"," nice popcorn movie with a bad influence
","The cinematography and action is indeed impressive, but that's about it. None of the commentators here seems to have noticed the most obvious and ridiculous aberration from the historical facts: Since years before the movie was made, it was discovered that the right of ""prima nocte"" (first night), in the form the movie depicts it, was a myth. It was completely inappropriate for feudal lords to engage sexually with the 'lesser' people, also, such a right would have caused massive uprisings everywhere. It is said that the parallel to reality is probably that a lord could demand a monetary compensation for someone leaving his reach through a marriage, immediately on the first night after the wedding.<br/><br/>Many of these myths, often dealing with things like torture and oppression, have been established in the 19th century when the people wanted to delimit their time from the ""dark ages"" by depicting the latter in the most gruesome way possible, thus elevating their achievements and the hope for a better future. I think a movie, fiction or not, should not support these myths. Too many will believe it. The 'prima nocte' scenes from Braveheart have already been referenced to by writers dealing with sexual violence etc., so its influence has indeed spread to serious works."

"combatreview","Null","2","4","15 May 2003"," Mad Jock McMax
","One has to concede that Mel Gibson achieved something remarkable in his cinema career of the 1980s and 1990s.  It was, after all, not unheard of for an actor to go through his career playing essentially the same character. John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart immediately spring to mind as having set this precedent.<br/><br/>What Gibson did that was remarkable was to maintain not just the same screen persona, but broadly the same screen character through a large cycle of films.  After three Mad Max films, four 'Mad Max Cop' films, one 'William Shakespeare's Mad Max' and of course this film - which I feel we may in all fairness rename 'Mad Jock McMax' - one thinks it reasonable to argue that Gibson had really cornered the market when it came to playing ultraviolent nutcases with dead girlfriends.  It is only suprising that the lead role in the modern classic 'Mad Maximus' went to Russell Crowe instead of Gibson.<br/><br/>Then again, perhaps Gibson realised that he had taken Mad Max as far as he could with Braveheart.  Braveheart is, after all, a real old-fashioned Hollywood epic, and as good a place to leave the character as any.  It matches its style with a good old-fashioned grasp of history, only surpassed in the cinematic annals by Carry On Up The Khyber.<br/><br/>Patrick McGoohan is especially noteworthy in the role of Mr. Burns From The Simpsons - it is a role he suits down to the ground, and he effortlessly steals the whole show from under the noses of all.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the praise heaped upon this film at time of original release seems now quite unwarranted.  It was, and remains, something of a Robin Hood movie.  Enjoyable and impressive, but not serious cinema.  The liberties taken with history are breathtaking - the most grievious example being the direct link drawn between Wallace's death and the Battle of Bannockburn, which ignores the small gap of 15 years and the Bruce's hard-fought campaign leading up to that final battle.  <br/><br/>It's a pity that one national hero should be so diminished by the praise directed at another.  But then, one suspects that had the screenwriter been called Randall Bruce instead of Randall Wallace we may have been treated to a very different film."
"nealklein","9","2","4","22 November 2002"," ""Ye must've made quite an imprassion ---""
","Mel Gibson understood something really simple when he successfully directed the 1995 epic, ""Braveheart"", that subsequent directors of Randall Wallace stories did not, and that is how to capture and really transfer to the audience that visceral feeling of satisfying revenge through physical vengeance. Every time some villain gets his in this film, we feel it. We also feel the pain and the injustice of William Wallace's world. This is why the movie is a powerful story.<br/><br/>To be sure, look at other films with similar ingredients of high quality. Watch movies with poignant ethnic-themed scores. Watch movies with unparalleled action and battle scenes. Watch movies with heartbreaking love stories. Rarely do they get it ALL right. But ""Braveheart"" does, and it does so gloriously.<br/><br/>The movie also has really BIG flaws, the least of which is that it seems to take a LONG time to get to the point, that being the ending. Historians cringe when they consider ""Braveheart"" because of all of the liberties it takes with historical fact. And the death scene of Wallace becomes inadvertently corny by the very end. (""The prisoner wishes to say something. Quick bring the megaphone! All right, Mr. I-am-loopier-than-a-bowl-of-Froot-Loops, what have you got to say?"" The hero tosses his head back and forth before uttering the ""unexpected"" cry: ""FREEDOM!"")<br/><br/>But minor flaws like those cannot diminish the previous two and a half hours of epic score, grim battles, painfully realized love, ironic humor, betrayals, victories and heartbreaks. And most of all, you do not doubt Wallace's words: ""All men die. Not every man lives."" In many ways, this film is ""Spartacus"" for the 1990's."
"Shoals-3","7","2","4","19 September 2002"," History as seen with an american mindset
","There are many comments here obsessing over historical inaccuracies, but here is one you missed: the overwhelming american ideology present throughout the film.  ""Freedom"" is mentioned again and again to the point where it really gets painful to watch.  I know the primary audience is american, but did Gibson really have to bring out the buzzword time and time again?<br/><br/>Apparently it worked, judging by the number of americans who love this film and who mention the freedom aspect in their comments. Not that this is the ideal place for political arguments, but really how americans unerringly swell with pride at the mere mention of ""freedom"" is beyond me.  If freedom means having one of the highest incarceration rates in the the world, letting 18 year olds carry concealed automatic weapons, but not allowing them to touch alcohol until 21, and keeping a heavy military presence throughout the world to brutally restrict any behavior they dislike, then I want no part of it.<br/><br/>However, there are many good points to this film as well.  It is beautifully filmed, well acted and flows well from beginning to end.<br/><br/>If it weren't for all the chest-thumping ideology pushed down our throats, it would be one of my favourite films."

I can't even remember how many Academy Awards it won, but it wasn't enough. The fight scenes alone are some of the most realistic (and graphic) that you could expect to see. It is also inspiring to see men stand up for their beliefs in the face of overwhelming odds when their very lives were at risk.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with this film unless you are English. *grin*<br/><br/>Two thumbs up, WAY UP!"

","This movie is done very well. Mel Gibson is an excellent director, and a fabulous actor. I feel this movie touches many perspectives in History. Do you see the president out in the battlefield now in days? Yet the Kings of the country were out in the battlefield giving commands, standing there for their country, whether it's in ruins or ruling. The tragedy in this movie is so sad, it makes you want to jump in and fight next to Wallace and do your best to support the inhumanity that's delivered from all those who put them through so much. How could anything have ever gotten this out of control? Well this is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite. The soundtrack is simply powerful and so very lovely. I'm so happy this movie got all these pretty awards. It should be seen at least once by everyone. This is a truly brilliant Movie. 10/10 for this masterpiece. :)"

","The most absurd thing I ever came across in my life is hating a film because it presents a man of another nationality as a hero. What I would really admire in someone would be to admit that he loved the film although he is from UK. This could really prove that he knows about films and can judge a film objectively. Personally I watched this movie twelve times and I will still enjoy it if I watch it again. What is there to say about Mel Gibson? The best actor, the best film. Fine war scenes, great romance, witty jokes, beautiful scenery and excellent music. An absolute 10 for me and I would like there to be made an exception to give it a 20.

","Okay, I'm from England, but before I comment on the film itself, can I just remind you (mainly Americans) of the facts of Scottish history.<br/><br/>The invaders of Scotland at that time were English Normans NOT ""British"". ""Britain"" means England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland fought and kept independence until 1603, when a SCOTTISH king became king of both England and Scotland (James I). This was a Union and not an invasion, further strengthened by the Act of Union of 1707 which united the parliaments and created the soon to be world power, of the United Kingdom. In 1999 a Scottish Parliament was re-established and it has powers over education, health and police, BUT it is a regional assembly, and not responsible for taxation, foriegn policy among other things. Another thing I would like to add, is that the English, as much as the Scots, consider themselves British.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, I give it 4.5/5. It is has action, power, love and emotion and is full of great lines and scenes. As for historical inaccuracy. it can be allowed I suppose. However, people have to make sure they know that they talking about a 50% fictional film here, not history. Hollywood requirements mean that the evil force must be REALLY evil, hence they are English. The acting is good and its a film you can watch many times.<br/><br/>See this film and enjoy, what are realistic elements, but not so good historical accuracy. Still - a great film."

","I have a couple of things i would like to say. Firstly, i have read quite a few of the other reviews here to get a feel of what people thought about this movie, and i am appalled to say that quite a lot of people seem to think that Britain and Scotland are two different countries. Scotland is in Britain, people, its that sticky-out part at the top. Scots ARE British, although a lot of us don't like that fact and would rather be considered Scots before we were considered British. (I'm not talking about everybody here though). Secondly, many of the reviews list all of the historical inaccuracies in this film. It is clear that there are many of these as we can see from the other reviews (i think someone even said that Edinburgh was an English town that the Scots took over? This is nonsense as far as i know - Edinburgh has always been in Scotland! I live there!) Yes, Murron was not the name of Wallace's wife (it was Marion), and yes, the French princess and Wallace never did have an affair and probably never actually met at all, and yes, Wallace did commit his fair share of atrocities against English people too, and yes, he was not a commoner etc etc etc i could go on, but this is not meant to be a lesson in Scots history, and neither is the movie. It never claims to be anything other than it is; a piece of entertainment. It's an enjoyable movie for the most part, although some of the dodgy Scots accents are questionable and sound more like Northern Irish to me, but on the whole, it's an emotional and well directed film. The musical score is excellent too. One small grievance though - after the film was released, they put up a hideous statue in Stirling, supposed to be William Wallace, but it looked exactly like Mel Gibson! Well, it gave us something to laugh at anyway! Well, i'll read some of the other reviews and see if i can find any others written by Scots to see what they think. Bye for now."

And the editing is very fussy, so we don't get any feel for the sweep of the battlefield (perhaps they couldn't get enough extras...). Can't beat Oliver's Henry V on this one<br/><br/>Performances are quite hammy, though Gibson's Scottish accent is not too bad (unlike McFadyen, who really ought to be able to do a more convincing burr than this). McGoohan, an actor I normally respect, seems to think he's Basil Rathbone.<br/><br/>The torture scenes must have been cut for the TV version, because they weren't particularly harrowing. The photography isn't bad - nice rolling green fields and misty moors - but you expect a bit more than that from an Oscar winner.<br/><br/>Oh, of course, in real life Wallace never got anywhere near York, they didn't paint woad on their faces, Isabelle was only 13 when Wallace died, and Edward I outlived Wallace by a couple of years.

Although the movie itself is almost 3 hours long, it is totally absorbing from beginning to end. I first saw this film as a special preview, and had to take the very last seat in the cinema, which of course was the worst possible one. The film was just so amazing that I didn't move a muscle for the entire film, even though I was sat at a very uncomfortable angle.

Everything about this movie deserves the highest praise indeed, including Mr Gibson's Scottish accent.

","Watching Braveheart was an enjoyable experience.  I thought the cinematography was amazing... the fight scenes were some of the best ever filmed... and the story was filled with passion and emotion.  However, they were a few parts of the film that just didn't work for me.  First of all, the story was quite one-dimensional.  If you are looking for anything else behind William Wallace's revenge against the evil King of England, you won't find it here.  In fact, the main characters do not grow or change throughout the movie.  Second, the romance between Wallace and the Princess is not very believable.  It moves way too fast and doesn't work with the rest of the story.  Third, the acting is far from perfect.  Save Gibson's performance, no one else stood out as particularly memorable.  Finally, the movie is overlong.  However, these flaws do not detract from a generally, very well made movie.  It's a movie intended to inspire... and for many, it does its job.  One of the better pictures of 1995 (behind Usual Suspects, of course) and a solid 8 out of 10 in my books."
"robred69","Null","2","4","5 February 2001"," A good film if you know nothing about Scottish History
","When I first saw Braveheart , I was really impressed and the battle scenes were stunning and extremely graphic , which I thought was a refreshing change. Simply because the old medieval films Hollywood served were usually the arrow in the chest and sword thrust in the stomach variety.The scenes in the battles certainly put the evil in Medieval. Im not a historical purist (as other comments have shown) so I thought Id let the Battle of Stirling Bridge slide , the reason being obvious , as I didnt see a bridge in the films battle scenes. Anyway , Patrick McGoohan was absolutely brilliant as Edward (Hammer of the Scots)Longshanks. He captured Edward so well , that if any film is made now involving King Edward , any actor would have to follow McGoohans line. Make no mistake , Edward I was every bit as evil and psychopathic as the one in Braveheart. It was Edward I dying wish , that whenever there was a war between Scotland and England , his remains were to be taken to the field of conflict. Now the hero William Wallace , yes a great warrior and leader of resistance and again I'll let historical fact slide. William Wallace was over 6ft...a giant in that day and age ...did Mel really stand out among his men?..but hey. But I was forced to go in the puke bucket when Mel was hitting it off with the Princess of France. I mean , the real Princess  arrived in England 13 years after Wallace had been hung drawn and quartered. If Mel Gibson really wanted a love interest after his wife was murdered , he could 've gone for a 13 year old Glaswegian whore , and still keep the story based on fact...if Nigel Tranter the foremost authority on Scottish History is to be believed.But again dont let the facts get in the way of a good story , quite right...too a point though. Braveheart is a good film in many ways , but if there were Scottish historians and English viewers seeing the film , they would most probably have got the sick-bucket out"

","I gave Braveheart and earnest chance upon first viewing, but halfway through I jsut could NOT believe how terribly inaccurate this film was. I don't mind a little bit of poetic license to spice things up, but this film goes way too far.  To begin with, Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace as this lion-ish freedon fighter with a knack for Martin Luther King-style speeches is grossly exaggerated.  Wallace was actually a pretty crude, foul man by all historical accounts.  Not some romance-book cover icon dashing into battle with chest exposed.  Wallace wanted his own freedom...he wasn't some eloquent scholar or brilliant tactician.  He was an ordinary man who decided to lead this crusade for the logical purpose of tiring from English tyranny.  Last I checked, any evidence of the affair Wallace had with the English royalty is SKETCHY at best. Hardly even fact.  Making it such a heavy piece of the film was not exactly the most credible route to take.  The one-dimensional characters don't help much either.  Wallace is surrounded by what might as well be the supporting cast in the average modern-day action film.  We even get one-liners!!  Gee..that was creative.  However, what really made this film subpar for me was the ending.  In reality, Wallace died a simple death. Not some martyr-esque way where he shouted ""Freedom"" from the rooftops. In fact, some accounts claim he actually recounted his beliefs for leniency.  The story would have been far more gutsy had it been realistic and balanced, rather than some machine written action film set in medieval times.  Mel Gibson obviously has talent...his ego just seems to get in the way."

","Several films in recent years have followed a trend of knocking the English or British, notably the fantastic Last of the Mohicans. While this film is undoubtedly good it is fantasy parading as fact. Forever more those who do not take the time to study the history of the period will believe that Mel has been true to the period. This is unfortunate.<br/><br/>For example, why did he need the suggestion of the seduction of a French Princess, whom history suggests was in fact 6 years old at this point in time. Why did the Scottish warriors need to wear blue and white face paint - a practise which died out centuries prior to the period.<br/><br/>This film would be a top ten for me if not for these and many more glaring and easily altered inaccuracies. After all does anyone actually realise that the ruling Scots handed William Wallace over to the English for trial and execution?

As with Braveheart, I hadn't even heard about the movie as I walked into the theater to see it; and walked out some two and a half hours later with glazed eyes.<br/><br/>Talking to others that have viewed this movie, their main complaint seems to be that it is too violent.

I feel that it is more a mark upon the person that is complaining about the violence, than a mark on the movie.

There were two beautiful love interests but my favourites were Wallace's men who supplied the bulk of the action and humour, especially Stephen who had me laughing at the most serious of points. Both Robert the Bruce and Wallaces characters are seen to develope and change as the film goes on, out of necessity for the roles they must play in history.

","Anyone who thinks that England's history has entailed ""being civilized"" needs only watch ""Braveheart"" to learn the truth. It's the epic tail of my ancestor, Sir William Wallace (Mel Gibson), who was Scotland's greatest patriot. As the movie shows, he fought off the English invaders to death. I admit that the movie did get a few things wrong (namely that the Battle of Stirling was fought on a bridge, not in a field), but it definitely deserved Best Picture.<br/><br/>I should remind you that this is not the sort of movie that should be viewed by just anyone. The battle scenes are more violent than anyone could imagine. But this is one movie where violence is an integral part of the story. A masterpiece in the true sense of the word."

","Robert the Bruce is a Scottish hero and it was he, not Wallace, who really broke the shackles of English rule. I cannot see the film-makers logic in having him cowering in the shadows when anything happens. Artisitc licence is one thing but this is Hollywood, once again, trying to re-write history.<br/><br/>Patrick Mcgoohan's performance is one of the few saving graces. He is one of the best on screen villains I have seen, both for his own acting and through the dialogue of the character.<br/><br/>Peter Hanly is also excellent as Edward's cowardly son, Sophie Marceau smoulders in the background and David O'Hara almost steals the show as the hysterically funny, but once again historically inaccurate, King Stephen.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is extraordinarily annoying as Wallace. The accent is bad and has rarely been considered as much of an actor anyway. Another problem came from the lacklustre acting of the extras (all Scots) who somehow managed to look bored at a re-creation of some of the most famous battles in our history.<br/><br/>The backdrops and scenery are beautiful and the battle scenes are superbly directed but the rest of the film is a little flat. Gibson fails to occupy the centre of the screen and the extras do nothing to enhance the experience. The rest of the supporting cast do fine jobs, eclipsing the movie's lead actor. 'Braveheart' is fine for arousing the nationalism of drunk sports fans but leaves the serious film goer wanting more."

","I watched ""Braveheart"" on cable last night and I wondered why I bothered.<br/><br/>The movie was slow, plodding, and bloated. The pacing was such that one could stop watching for a few minutes while one went and made supper, return, and not really miss anything.<br/><br/>The only character who was the least bit interesting was Edward Longshanks, played by Patrick McGoohan. Then again, Mr. McGoohan has often played such people (e. g., Number 6 in his TV series ""The Prisoner""). I could well imagine Edward being tough, brooking no debate or challenge to his rule.<br/><br/>Everyone else was largely colourless and the portrayal of William Wallace didn't particularly convince me that he was the leader of a rebellion. The romantic angle between Wallace and Princess Isabelle was laughable at best. I mean, really--a royal consorting with a serf?<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out historical inaccuracies in the movie. That's nothing new--for example, take a look at Errol Flynn's portrayal of George Custer in ""They Died With Their Boots On"".<br/><br/>So why did this movie win the Best Picture Oscar and not ""Apollo 13""? I admit that I'm biased because not only am I a space buff but I was in high school when the events for which that mission is remembered occurred. The latter, however, had action and suspense and, on the whole, was tightly-paced. Even the historical inaccuracies are relatively minor. ""Braveheart"", on the other hand, was ponderously dull and, for me, a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Maybe there were political reasons for it. It certainly couldn't have been on the artistic merits of the movie.<br/><br/>It's the second time I saw the movie. The first time was nearly 20 years ago. I didn't like it then and I didn't like it now."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","3","8","15 December 2015"," An epic to some, boredom to me
","""Braveheart"" is a 3-hour movie from 20 years ago that won Mel Gibson Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. I will not deny that this film has some solid moments, but as a whole it was not even close to being enough for such a long film. Visually, it was fine for the most part, but this film is great evidence of how seeing something good is not equal to feeling something good. The story was not particularly interesting, but maybe the reason is also that this era in history was never among my favorite ones. It is as usual all about great writing and despite the Screenplay Oscar nomination, this film does not have it. You could certainly say that it is fairly difficult to make a script that keeps one interested into a film of almost 180 minutes, but they took the challenge and they came short.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, Mel Gibson proves in here once again that he is as good of an actor as he is a filmmaker. His performance was probably my favorite aspect of the very few good qualities in here. The Scottish sceneries were worth a watch too as were the costumes. However, this makes it pretty much style over substance. Not among Mel Gibson's best works overall and it's a bit ironic that this was the biggest success of his career. What maybe disappoints me the most is that I quite like Pat McGoohan and him playing the main evil guy is something that sounds awesome in theory. Still, I could not warm up to this one. Certainly a contender for my least favorite Best Picture Academy Award winner. Not recommended."

","""When the Legend becomes fact, print the Legend."" - from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.<br/><br/>War is Mel.<br/><br/>Reprising his MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME hairdo, donning a slimming skirt, pumping up the man-ceps and dropping an accent that is either Scottish or some form of Indonesian elvish, Mel Gibson brings the thunder as revolutionary Scotsman William Wallace, historical figure made mythical man-toy in BRAVEHEART.<br/><br/>Written by an actual descendant of the Scot warrior, Randall Wallace, and directed by Gibson's massive arms, BRAVEHEART takes us to 1300's Scotland, as Wallace, with his mullet on stun, leads Scots and Irish forces to free Scotland from the stranglehold of English King Edward Longshanks (Edward I, played by Patrick McGoohan with delicious contempt).<br/><br/>BRAVEHEART is one of the last great epic battle films, if not the last, to use actual people in crowded combat rather than computer blips - the battle scenes are some of the best you will ever see for choreography, editing, kineticism, brutality - yet the movie does not shirk on sterling characters, nuanced acting chops, moral ambiguity, political treachery, heart-aching romance, and a soundtrack by James Horner to match its majestic sweep. BRAVEHEART is truly Mel's masterwork, all legend, extra cheese, thundering hooves, swampy castles, weak-chested nobles and iron-thewed warriors covered in layers of kilt and poo. Mel is not so much worried about recreating history as recreating the way the light slopes off his muddied deltoids.<br/><br/>Returning to his village after being raised by his uncle (Brian Cox, looking like a rugged Billy Connolly), Wallace finds his beloved homeland cringing under the iron fist of English garrisons, who claim ""prima nocte,"" the ""first night"" with new brides married in their jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Longshanks considers it ""Scotland, my land."" McGoohan owns the trigger-tempered Longshanks, whose delivery is hilarious in its haughtiness. ""The trouble with Scotland,"" he tells his court, ""is that it's full of Scots."" (Thus, prima nocte would breed the Scots out.) Wallace avoids political squabbles, yet the antagonism of the resident English garrison forces his hand to war when they kill his secretly-married bride, Murron (Catherine McCormack).<br/><br/>In a berserker rage Wallace decimates the garrison almost singlehandedly in a hand-to-hand battle which presages the lethal beauty to come - ruthless, wide-eyed and vicious, his vengeance palpable, his kinsmen following his lead; impact weapons, mallets, maces, clawed spears, and Wallace kicking the garrison commander against a pole and slitting his throat as emotionlessly as the commander slit Murron's.<br/><br/>The English retaliate. It's on! Wallace, who just wanted to raise crops peacefully, finds himself leading Scotland in repelling England from Scottish shores, then taking the battle to English shores by invading York and beheading its prince, to quell Longshanks's ambitions at their source.<br/><br/>Wallace warns all the enemy soldiers he spares, ""Tell them that Scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more. Tell them Scotland is free."" The great Brendan Gleeson is Wallace's best friend, Hamish; rugged James Cosmo is Hamish's father and unstoppable battle hound, Campbell; Sean McGinley is Murron's glowering father; Angus Macfadyen is suitably regal and simultaneously limp-principled as nobleman Robert the Bruce, with a crazed recluse father who looks like Gerard Depardieu in leper makeup - Robert will be Wallace's Judas; an eccentric performance by David O'Hara as Stephen the Irish loon; Tommy Flanagan is the wronged husband of a prima nocte wife.<br/><br/>Stirling: a baptism by fire, as the amassed Scots want to turn tail, faced with English ""heavy cavalry, and armored horse that shake the very ground."" But Wallace shows that he was not just a master tactician, he was also a charismatic cheesemaker, as he throws down an iconic speech that is not lifted from the Inspirational Movie Speeches Handbook, but which has since been included as a modern classic: ""Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live, at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days, from this day to that, for one chance - just one chance - to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take - our FREEDOM!"" And all while painted blue.<br/><br/>We are there, as the English armored horse canter toward the kilted Scottish battle formations; we smell the wet grass underhoof, we sense the pounding thunder as they close in bent on massacre; as tree-spears lie at our feet - a surprise attack in full view - Wallace calls, ""Hold!... hold!... hold!..."" (""The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath / As we plunge on into certain death"" - The Trooper, Iron Maiden) And just before the equine tsunami breaks upon us in banshee ululation - we raise the tree-spears. Into horse flesh.<br/><br/>And all Mel breaks loose.<br/><br/>BRAVEHEART is not a historical document, and doing the research will only muddle the truth about William Wallace all the more. Rather, Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson have crafted a stylistic juggernaut tribute to a man who heavily affected Scotland's history. And if we are to believe this film, he also sowed his seed with princess Isabelle, so he affected England's history as well. And it's an incredibly brave performance by Mel, considering he can't do a Scottish accent.<br/><br/>Wallace is brought down by betrayal, and his execution cry is - ""FREEDOM!"" But the concept of personal freedom was alien to peoples who were inculcated to believe their royalty was emplaced by gods. He might as well have shouted ""DEMOCRACY!"" ‚Äì another concept as alien to the people of the times as democracy is to the American presidents who prop up dictators around the world and pretend like it's the oppressed country's fault that they don't have democracy.<br/><br/>As BRAVEHEART's opening narration tells us, ""History is written by those who have hanged heroes."" He doesn't mean US, does he?"

"JamesHitchcock","6","3","8","24 October 2010"," William Wallace and Gromit
","Even by Hollywood's sometimes cavalier standards, ""Braveheart"" is a film notorious for its historical inaccuracies. One critic said that it could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a Plasticine dog had been inserted in the film and the title changed to ""William Wallace and Gromit"".<br/><br/>The film gets the facts of William Wallace's life wrong from beginning to end. At the time of his birth in the 1270s Scotland was not under English rule but an independent kingdom under Alexander III. Wallace did not die on the same day as King Edward I as shown here; Edward outlived him by two years and died, not in his palace in London, but in Cumberland while leading an army northwards against the Scots. It misrepresents the characters of Edward I, Edward II and Robert Bruce. Edward I (like most mediaeval monarchs) was undoubtedly capable of ruthlessness, but was hardly the insane psychopath portrayed by Patrick McGoohan. Indeed, his English subjects regarded him as a wise legislator and reformer as well as a strong military leader. Edward II, although he was to prove an unsuccessful king, was not the effeminate weakling shown here; he was bisexual rather than exclusively homosexual and, like his father, was tall, strong and handsome. Bruce never betrayed Wallace and did not fight against him at the battle of Falkirk.<br/><br/>Wallace never fathered a child by Queen Isabella; indeed he never even met her, and at the date of his death in 1305 she was only ten years old and still living in France. (She came to England to marry Edward II in 1308, a year after his father's death). Edward I never introduced the so-called ""jus primae noctis"" to Scotland; this custom has never existed at any time in England or Scotland, and many historians doubt whether in reality it ever existed anywhere in mediaeval Europe. The film misrepresents Wallace's tactics during his victory at Stirling Bridge, where he ambushed the English army while they were crossing a narrow bridge; had he met the numerically superior English on an open plain, as he is shown doing here, he would doubtless have been defeated. The costumes are inaccurate for the period; Wallace, for example, would never have worn a kilt or painted his face with woad, something which had gone out of fashion in Scotland many centuries earlier. And why were the Scottish troops not wearing armour (as any mediaeval army would have done?) And yet this is not altogether a bad film. Certainly, it has its faults, quite apart from its liberties with historical truth. At around three hours it is too long by at least half an hour, and I can well understand why gay rights groups objected to the stereotyped characterisation of Edward II. At times the film's nationalistic politics seemed to be pandering to the Anglophobic bigotry which regrettably persists in Scotland. If, however, one sees ""Braveheart"" not as a historical account of the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 1290s but simply as a fictional story about a heroic warrior-patriot fighting to free his country from a tyrannical invader, it is in many ways a stirring epic.<br/><br/>The film was very much Mel Gibson's own project; he acted not only as its star but also as director and producer. As actor, he gives a powerful performance as Wallace, bringing out not only his courage and determination but also the charisma which inspired his countrymen to follow him. He even manages a decent Scottish accent. Other good performances come from McGoohan as the villainous Edward and the lovely Sophie Marceau as Isabella, who in this version of history becomes a heroine, a woman who is disgusted by both the weakness of her husband and the cruelty of her father-in-law and comes to sympathise with the Scottish cause. Peter Hanly, however, was dreadful as the hapless Prince Edward.<br/><br/>Gibson's direction in this film is not as successful as his acting. Yet if the film as a whole sometimes seems to be too slow-moving, some of the individual scenes are very good, especially the battle scenes and Wallace's final death scene, in which his bravery under torture has even the London mob, previously his implacable enemies, calling out for mercy. Some scenes, however, do not come off, especially the one when King Edward pitches his son's gay lover out of a window. (Gibson complained that audiences laughed at this scene, obviously failing to realise how inadvertently comic it was).<br/><br/>I think that this was a rather surprising choice to win Oscars for both ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director"", but Gibson had two factors working in his favour. The first factor was the growing revival of interest in the grand epic drama in the late eighties and nineties; several other films of this type won ""Best Picture"" around this period. (""The Last Emperor"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Titanic"", ""Gladiator""). The second was that there was no really great film in contention in 1995; my personal choice as ""Best Picture"" would have been Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"", but I would class that film as ""very good"" rather than truly ""great"". Had Gibson's epic been up against something like ""Unforgiven"", ""Schindler's List"" or ""American Beauty"" I doubt if it would have triumphed. Although ""Braveheart"" can be an enjoyable drama at times, it cannot really compare with the great ""Best Picture"" winners of the nineties. 6/10"

","This is one of my top five favorite films, so forgive me if I continue to ramble on about how incredible it is. This film has it all: romance, spirituality, action, amazing cinematography and background score, and second to few others. What I took was this film was the in-depth look at what makes men... well, men. To many characters in the film, there are different beliefs in what makes a man noble. I will not spoil the enjoyment for anybody, all I'm saying is GO SEE IT. If you have seen it, see it again. The film may be three hours, but when you watch it, that time will feel all too short. Every second is worth it, with emotions that are not overdone like in ""Titanic."" I know of the Mel Gibson controversy and people rip on him for his dumb beliefs, however, most will admit that he is a wonderful filmmaker and actor. I usually like movies, though this tops it all, even ""Lethal Weapon."" I even liked his ""Passion"" film (and I am NOT a religious guy), but that is nothing compared to this. Again, what really blew away about the film was the depth, the musical score, and the cinematography. The shots of Scotland were incredible as well as the beautiful battle scenes. The score made me smile for days on end, particularly when I left the theater. There is just something about it that holds you in its grasp until days after you watched it. This a must-see and the film is a lot deeper than some take it for."
"johnnyboyz","9","3","8","14 December 2008"," With a head and a heart in the right place, Braveheart comes off as a towering achievement of hope, love and tragedy.
","Braveheart is a stunning film, a film that takes you on a turning and unravelling journey of hope and tragedy but never veers off into a realm of out and out escapist fantasy. It's a film that remains grounded and compelling, even with a long runtime and not for a second if we're into the film at the level I was do we ever feel it's moving too slowly. Here is a film that follows the adventures of just an everyday boy made-man and put through the grinder. He interacts with the people in his surroundings and his surroundings in general; comes to love someone; comes to hate someone else; must rediscover himself following a tragedy and the underlying theme is resilience or battling for what you believe.<br/><br/>I think Braveheart works on its own level because of its grounded reality and it works better than later films that were perhaps inspired by it in the form of Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven. There is a constant, grounded sense of realism in Braveheart. At its core, you could read into it as a revenge story but the idea is ambiguous due to there being no distinct enemy as to whom garner vengeance from. Indeed, any retribution the protagonist gets from killing as a result of killing is done swiftly and, in his eyes, justly shortly after the initial death happened. In many-another film, the obligatory scene of the protagonist getting his revenge from the 'bad guy' that killed someone the protagonist loved would happen ten minutes, maybe more, from the end. In Braveheart it occurs after about half an hour thus rendering the rest of the film a different beast.<br/><br/>The film is unlike Gladiator in this respect, which was an out and out revenge film for the death of a family. It is unlike Kingdom of Heaven which was a really poorly done and ropey journey of self discovery with a dull lead and sprawling narrative complete with racist tone. Braveheart achieves in about forty-five minutes what most of these two films (try to) accomplish in their entire runtimes. What begins and then ends as a tale of anger and payback actually escalates into a full blown story about uprising and one's right to live without oppression.<br/><br/>The film centres on William Wallace, played very briefly at the start by James Robinson as a child but then by co-producer and overall director Mel Gibson. Gibson plays the character with a certain innocence early on as he engages in the oppressed world in which he lives. He tries to avoid the English and their grip on the nation, going so far as to defy them and their rules by marrying childhood sweetheart Murron MacClannough (McCormack) behind everyone's back but he does so in a cheeky manner in order to try and beat the system and avoid one of the English higher-ups being allowed to 'take' the newlywed for one night. What follows is a brief diversion into another arc mentioned before the main course of the uprising.<br/><br/>The film carries a distinct post-modern feel. Wallace uses odd tactics to 'woo' his bride to be; methods perhaps usually seen, invented even, in the modern age. Simple things such as throwing pebbles at a window in order to arouse attention from a loved one but these romantic elements to do with love are combined with older, more traditional beliefs or 'conventions' such as proceeding to be married first, in order to share an embrace. The film actually begins with Wallace's father dying and the young Wallace at the time being sent off for 'training'; training of the body but also of the mind ¬ñ to say we will get a glimpse of the results of this tantalising set up is an understatement.<br/><br/>Due to the film's nature of going one up on itself after it has dealt with the mini-narrative of revenge, we expect the film to get tuned up a level because of the uprising plot. Braveheart does this but it does so without resorting to mass battle scenes and cut-a-millisecond sequences that would distort the film, this could be seen as an action film but that doesn't mean we need action all the time. The film is a pot-boiler, a film that lends time to studies and other characters: the king of England nicknamed 'Longshanks' (McGoohan); a French princess named Isabelle (Marceau) and several allies within the Scottish camp. Wallace is constantly referred to as not a hero, purely because he doesn't 'look' like one with his short build and unattractive face but this is the film observing heroic clich√©s and going against them whilst pointing them out.<br/><br/>The film plays out like a game of chess, complete with battles; strategic moving around and ambushes of various different pieces armed with different weapons. Even the king himself is on the field at certain points making moves. Additionally, the parallels between young, upcoming heroes is made clear: Wallace and the future king of England are given sporadic case-studies in the sense they're both young but Wallace has nothing at his disposal and acts out of emotion chasing everything whereas the prince is young and has everything at his disposal complete with an assured future but shies away from it ¬ñ the point is how they go about their lives and how much certain things mean to them, although their overall fates might extinguish the theory. Regardless, Braveheart is a big; broad and cracking epic that everyone should see."

The ending was so sad that it had to make any man who watched the movie seriously cry. The ending with him being tortured when he said freedom mixed with the princess of England crying and the King dying was so powerful, including the very ending when Gibson narrates the very end about how they fought like scotsmen..and they won their freedom so so strong. This movie makes you feel like a different person after watching it and you sit their for a long time thinking abut the movie after<br/><br/>Great Movie 10/10"

","Dang, it looks like all of them starry-eyed folks from ""The Shawshank Redemption"" fan club got on their horses and rode over here to watch (and fulsomely praise) this film! <br/><br/>However, this slop of revisionist history made by the Holocaust/Christian revisionist is much worse than the ridiculously overrated ""Shawshank"". I mean, I've seen more incisive character depth and subtlety in ""Highlander: The Final Dimension"". If this won ""Best Picture"", couldn't Mario Van Peebles at least win ""Best Actor""? <br/><br/>I must admit - I didn't watch every scene. Instead, I fast-forwarded over the most obvious parts, and since the film was nothing but obvious, it made for a more coherent ride. Done in 1.5 hours, this film might have rated 4 stars (out of 10, mind you).<br/><br/>Instead, it is what it is, and it certainly is the worst film to win a Best Picture Oscar since that snorefest known as ""Out of Africa"". Every character is a bolt of evil or a bolt of good so that you can cheer or sneer without issue. Edward I Shawshanks (okay, Longshanks), played sneeringly by Patrick McGoohan, is really given the smear, and William Wallace, almost unanimously proclaimed by historians as a boor/rogue, is turned into legend by Obersturmbanfuhrer Gibson. His performance (in partnership with the wig) is laughably bad. His scenes with Marceau, who (G*d love her) tries her best, have that campy oil-and-water feel straight out of ""Moment By Moment"" or Streisand's ""A Star is Born"".<br/><br/>Let's get out, but I do have to say that the thing that I hated the most was the true WWF feel of the battle scenes and the camaraderie of Mel and his mates. I mean, I love The Undertaker and all, but do I need to see him in a Budweiser commercial masquerading as a historical film? <br/><br/>Me? I'm just waiting for a real good film about Edward II...now that guy was a piece of work! Meanwhile, I give this mess 2 out of 10."
"Eowyn1967","3","3","8","27 September 2007"," A very predictable film
","Apart from the many anachronisms and lack of historicity of Braveheart, I'm very disappointed by how predictable the whole film turned out to be. Those directors must really think their public are idiots as they keep rehashing the same stories over and over again. It looked more like a Scottish western than any accurate portrayal of mediaeval Britain. What is more, all the villains were far too wicked and one-dimensional to seem realistic. It left me completely untouched and uninterested apart from the romance at the beginning of the film. The claim that Wallace fathered the future English king, that's farcical at best, one does not even need to check historical dates to know how preposterous this must be. What's the point of making a film about a real historical character and then rewrite history completely? Gibson should stick to fiction. But historical faithfulness is the least of his worries, he had his characters speak Latin in The Passion of Christ though historically they spoke Greek, Aramean and Hebrew. I give it three stars for the beautiful Scottish landscapes."
"whpratt1","10","3","8","25 June 2007"," Gibson made a Masterpiece
","Greatly enjoyed this story and the great photography throughout Scotland and its beautiful landscape of green pastures as far as your eye can see. However, their was plenty of blood shed on the battlefields and a very realistic view of how battles where fought many years ago in England and Scotland. Mel Gibson portrayed a great William Wallace who was deeply in love with a woman he knew immediately was going to be his soul mate and the King of England had other plans for this relationship as England had complete control over Scotland and had the idea that every newly married Scotish bride was to be shared with an Englishman and integrated their blood relations in order to break down the struggle of Scotland wanting to be free from England. There film is full of wonderful surprises and their is a strong romantic theme running behind all the blood and gore."
"gregory-anderson-2","8","3","8","13 April 2006"," Greater than One Man - a Country
","An inspiring film, hot-hearted, patriotic and bloody. Can I say I am 1/4 Scottish? In the years after watching this film I believed I was Scottish! Because to be truly Scottish, after watching this film, is to believe in principles above all else. <br/><br/>That isn't to say Gibson presents the Scots as pious underdogs. Political infighting is shown as an insidious given for an annexed state. And at no point does William Wallace want to be heroic. He acknowledges before battle that his avatar of personality is greater than him as a man, <br/><br/>""If William Wallace was here, he'll consume the English with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of lightning from his arse!"" <br/><br/>He does not want to leave his home to fight, until events compel him to. A healthy alternative to the base barbarians of Schwarzenegger and Stallone.<br/><br/>The pacing of events is perfect. As Wallace grows in political influence he engages in greater fights for Scottish freedom. Smooth transitions are crafted, from tender love exchanges to brutal battle scenes - the mid-film clash of the hitherto undefeated English cavalry and the Scottish highlanders is a veritable film-punch to the stomach. And as the epic ending shows, what is necessary for those fighting for sovereignty can be found in no book. <br/><br/>To watch this film reflectively will lead you to ask, ""What does it mean to give yourself to your country?"" Before Australia's involvement in Gallipoli, a British minister declared that ""no country cannot call itself a country until it has given up its sons."" What do you feel when you hear that? I used to see it as an arrogance. Now, out of university and in the slog of society, I see that to give yourself for your country is the only the thing to do. Isn't it? <br/><br/>Freedom!"
"my_two_bits","10","3","8","15 December 2004"," Phenomenal--An Instant Classic Epic!
","Braveheart tells the story of a young Scotsman, William Wallace, looking to live in peace after seeing his brother and father die at the hands of the English. It's an uncompromising story of love and loss, of life and death, of war and peace, and of beauty and ugliness. <br/><br/>The first thing one initially realizes, from the first few seconds of this beautiful film, is the score. James Horner wonderfully captures the sentiment of medieval Scotland. The romantic, elevating, crisp freshness of the bagpipes feels like the cool mist of a Scottish morning. It captures the self sacrifice, the pain in the heart, the emotion of all the characters and just makes the film that much more rich and alive. <br/><br/>With regard to sets, the production is just amazing. The little villages, the rustic and primitive houses, the marketplace, the reconstruction of Edinburgh and York, and other cities in that time, is absolutely amazing, it looks like one would imagine it looked back then.<br/><br/>The editing is phenomenal. Braveheart has some of the most relentless and graphic battle scenes ever caught on film. Both the filmed battles, that of Stirling and Falkirk, are amazing, and viciously real. <br/><br/>The acting is superb. James Robinson, who plays the young William Wallace, is excellent. Particularly in the scene where he mourns his father and brother, and he weeps as the little girl, Murron (Mhairi Calvey) runs up and gives him a thistle. Patrick McGoohan is excellent as the villainous Edward I ""The Longshanks"". He has a great voice, so much character, he really commands the screen in all his scenes. Sophie Marceau is graceful and elegant as Princess Isabelle, but at the same time she shows strength, especially in scenes where she is juxtaposed to McGoohan. The lovely Catherine McCormack plays the adult Murron, and her beauty and natural presence just gives the film so much fuel. Although her role isn't very long, her presence resonates throughout the movie, and she returns in key moments to remind the viewer of this phenomenal, pure, loving bond she has with William. Even Mel says of McCormack, ""I fell in love a little"". And so does the audience. Stephen the Irishman is, next to Mel Gibson, the best acted character in the movie. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson is excellent as William Wallace, and as a director, is insightful, ambitious and visionary. The sheer size of this film, let alone the size of the character, and the way he took on both with such passion and ease--one cannot help but applaud his endurance, his talent, his portrayal behind the camera and in front of it. Randall Wallace writes a wonderful screenplay, and Mel Gibson brings it to life.<br/><br/>Having said all this, I have to share some of my favorite shots: 1) Little Murron, running up with the thistle to give it to William. It illustrates wanting to console in times of pain. Both the gesture and the plant itself has a beauty--a flower--but it also illustrates the pain--a thistle has thorns--that is the other side of the coin. 2) The virgin bride who stops the feuding between the Scots and the English, when the lord comes and claims the rights of prima noctes. She, of her own will, takes the hands of the English soldier off of her, and off of her husband, and willingly offers herself in sacrifice, so gracefully. The flowers in her hair are not unlike the way the ancients would put flowers on the head of animal sacrifices. 3) The scene of William and Murron after they have been married, and they are about to consummate their marriage. The shot is all dark, but you can see the mist of their breath. The breath shows emotion, it shows life, it shows freedom. It is perhaps one of the most meaningful shots in the film. <br/><br/>Finally, I have to share some of my favorite lines: 1)""I know you can fight, but it's our wits that make us men"". 2) ""The Almighty says this must be a fashionable fight, its drawn the finest people""! 3) ""If he were here he'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes, and bolts of lightning from his arse"". 4) ""And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all they days from this day to that for one chance--just one chance--to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom"". 5)""The Lord tells me he can get me out of this mess, but He's pretty sure, you're fucked""! 6) ""A lordship and titles, gold--that I should become Judas?"" 7) ""Every man dies, not every man really lives"".<br/><br/>Braveheart grabs the viewer from the first shot and does not let them go until the ending credits. It is easily one of the greatest films ever made. 10/10"

","This movie is great, but too long. And it was not actually the best made ever as i thought it will be. Battle-scenes and especially the love scenes were my favorite, Murron and William had been added to one of my favorite couples of television/movies. I cried when Murron died and when they buried her. It was very touching. I also liked the relationship between the princess(don't remember her name...) and William. They were always more than just friends because she wanted him since she heard about him, i saw it in her eyes.<br/><br/>And about the battle-scenes...hmm, they were good, but too much violence, do i need to say something about when they showed their ass and their dick? i think it was disgusting..my GOD!! Damnit that William Wallace was brave, i became scared when they was going to torture him, i closed my eyes. I heard he was being cutted to pieces, but glad they didn't showed. I thought they showed it the last time i saw it, but that was long time ago, maybe something is wrong with my memory."

","I've just seen Braveheart on TV, and it is simply a great movie. Mel Gibson gives a great performance. I usually measure the acting of a movie by how the actions of the characters and why they do certain things affect me, how they make me feel , and with this film, I can see through William, I can feel his pain, his bravery, you understand him, you understand why people follow him. And when he shouts ""Freedom!"", maybe I overreacted but I seriously got goose bumps So kudos for Gibson. Besides it has a great villain. Longshanks, yeah, I ended up hating that guy. Another good thing is the story, because it has little bit of all: romance, passion, violence, patriotism, it deserves its R rating, but its is justifiable, I think that the film would have been altered in a bad way without those scenes of graphic violence. The story is well-told, the first time I saw this movie was also in TV and I didn't want to get up, every minute is interesting Good cinematography, good costume. A really great movie.

If they wanted to make a historically accurate movie, they would have made a documentary. I feel sorry for anyone that actually believes the unbelievably overpowering fighting ability of the Spartans in 300 is just as true. It's just a movie people, made to entertain. I feel just as sorry if you watched Braveheart with expectations of the previously discussed accuracy. Since when has an action/adventure movie from Hollywood that covers a certain time period ever been somewhat, if not extremely, exaggerated?! With these comments aside, I have to say I thoroughly enjoy this movie. It is long and bloody and somewhat ridiculous to think basically one man could take down all of England, but... it's what I expect so I have to say I love it."

I am very annoyed because it makes us look like the bad guy, first of all William Wallace isn't this superman Scottish terminator that the film makes him out to be and at the end we are meant to feel sorry for him! When the British gave the Scots everything they needed and yet they still attack us I think the Scots should be thanking us for everything we have done for you.

As it has been pointed out it is historically inaccurate. It is also indifferently acted and directed, by Mel Gibson no less, without any distinction.  It is too long and kinda boring.

"tfrizzell","Null","3","9","25 June 2000"," An Amazing Accomplishment, Easily the Best of 1995
","I can remember when everyone was shocked when ""Braveheart"" won the Best Picture Oscar of 1995.  However, ""Braveheart"" was easily the best film in an above-average year for movies.  Mel Gibson's style of directing is the heart in ""Braveheart"".  It is a cinematic event.  In 2 hours and 59 minutes Gibson tells the story of William Wallace, a Scottish rebel in the late 13th Century, who led a rebellion against the English and freed a nation from an evil tyranny.  We get a glimpse of Wallace as a young boy to his awful death at the hands of the English.  The greatest argument about this film is whether this film is history or Hollywood.  Well it's more Hollywood than history, but that has nothing to do with the greatness of the film.  Gibson reminded us of all the great epics of the late-1950s and early-1960s with this masterpiece.  His ability as a director was solidified and ""Braveheart"" is a film that will likely never lose its glitter.  5 stars out of 5."
"felipedsrj","10","2","5","16 June 2019"," Braveheart
","Braveheart Review<br/><br/>We know Mel Gibson as one of the prestigious guys in Hollywood. As director, star and producer of ""Braveheart,"" he turns the unpromising story of a 13th century wonder into one of the most spectacular entertainments already presented. ""Braveheart"" tells the story of legendary patriot warrior, William Wallace, interpreted by Mel Gibson, in a mediaeval scenario at Scotland, who led the Scots in a struggle for freedom from England's brutal rule commanded by Edward I, called Longshanks, interpreted by actor Patrick McGoohan. ""Braveheart"" shows a tragic romance, unbounded heroism, gorgeous photography and a cast of thousands of people.
A positive point for this movie is that ""Braveheart"" is also an explosive action movie where mediaeval Scots use spears, swords, axes and giant rocks as a vengeance. A negative point is that the movie does not follow a real story and some scenes are obscured, changed or invented, like a romance between Wallace and Princess Isabelle, Longshanks' daughter-in-lawinterpreted by Sophie Marceau, who was sent by the English army as an emissary to the Scots to negotiate peace. There is a falsehood to their story: they meet, they're in love, she's pregnant, and she's gone. The affair was very criticized for many historians, because this novel didn't exist.<br/><br/>The genre of the movie ""Braveheart"" is drama, biography and war. The budget was US$ 65-70 Millions and it opened May 24 1995. ""Braveheart"" won many awards on Oscar 1996 as a best movie, best director, best sound editing, best photography and best makeup. Also won awards in other events like Golden Globe Awards, BAFTA and MTV Movie Awards, all in 1996.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" is a movie I will recommend to watch, because it tells about history, freedom, drama, courage and love. Also, it is a big production commented nowadays."

"4vonlea","10","2","5","21 April 2019"," Where has this been all my life?
","Well, alright then. This review is my first and I created this account for the sole purpose of writing one for this here beauty.
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder and when I finished this movie, beauty, my eyes beheld. When I reached the end, when it faded to black and the credits started rolling, this immense feeling of wrenching emotion, yet fulfilling satisfaction completely washed over me. Truly a feeling I hadn't felt in a very long time, if ever. This was definitely one of those films for me that is so good, that I end up finishing it and not even realize that it was a whole three hours long! I don't even know where to begin.
If I'm being entirely honest here, I didn't exactly go in to watching this movie with the highest of hopes. Somewhat low hopes actually, but wow, words could not even begin to describe how incredibly pleasantly surprised I was. I suppose I can begin by mentioning how breathtaking the visuals and shots of the highlands are. Prior to watching this film I never even realized what a beautiful country Scotland really is.
On another note, and I don't even exaggerate when I say that this film contained nearly every last element that I love and look for in a film
<ul><li>A wide array of extraordinary, complex characters played by astonishingly talented actors who know how to reel in an audience and play their roles perfectly.</li></ul>-Full of scenes that really keep you on the edge of your seat, whether they be the intense, action-packed clashing scenes or the heartbreaking scenes.
-A beautiful musical score that sets the mood of the film perfectly, making scenes all the more emotional.
-Expresses a thought-provoking and beautifully profound and wise message that the entire plot, story line and series of events is centered around.
A message that I just so happen to believe in wholeheartedly, with every fiber of my being. That there is no human possession more important and more dear than a person's freedom, and that every human is born with the right to possess it and the right to protect it. Love the line ""You're so concerned with squabbling for the scraps at Longshanks' table that you've missed your God-given right to something better!"" It's touching, admirable and motivational. His drive, what it is that fuels the bravery in William Wallace's heart is the unwavering notion that when someone forces themselves into your life, when someone tries to control your life and rob you of your freedom, that is not something you stand for, that is not something you allow, and you fight even if it may be a matter of life or death, because that's just how precious and sacred a person's freedom truly is. Like the scene towards the end, after his capture, during his torture, the Englishmen want Wallace to cry for mercy. Not only do they want to break his body but they also want to break his mind and soul as well, but all he cries out is the word 'freedom' in defiance, as if to say, 'I won't let you break us, I won't let you take what's rightfully ours and if you insist on stealing our freedom in life, we'll just have to take back our freedom in death, if we must.'
Simply the feel of the movie in and of itself was outstanding. All of these elements combined, and throughout the entire film, it gives off an epic and revolutionary atmosphere riddled with powerful and raw emotion and poetic vibes.
This film, based on a man who undergoes an arduous character development, a man who goes from an average, everyday, run-of-the-mill Scotsman to an insurrectionist freedom fighter who changes the tide regarding hierarchy, to a noble martyr who sacrifices himself for the sake of his country's future certainly lives up to it's hype.... and then some!! There's simply a note that anybody could take from this movie. 10/10 no doubt."

From his directing & flawless portrayal of William Wallace, there's very little one could find to criticize. Braveheart is obviously not entirely accurate historically, but honestly who cares? A lof of the stuff is exaggerated, and some of it simply didn't happen, but again, it's a movie. And in that it is as close to perfection as possible.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that I have only just watched this movie for the very first time ever!! It's crazy, I know, especially considering the fact that the movie came out one year after my birth. I've had plenty of time, but never got around to watching it until now.

The writing in this movie is great, and the speech that William Wallace gives while riding the horse out on the battlefield just gets me pumped every time. Second, the acting is led by Mel Gibson but there are several other actors that get the job done. Third, the cinematography won an Oscar so not much to say about that. Fourth, the action and battle scenes in the movie feel real and are done perfectly. Fifth, action isn't the only thing you get in this film but they also do a wonderful job implanting a love story into the movie that in my opinion is one of the best love stories ever. Sixth, Braveheart's music is phenomenal and puts you back into that time period. Lastly, one thing I thoroughly enjoyed was the unpredictability the movie has to offer.

","In 1280, King Edward ""Longshanks"" (Patrick McGoohan) invades and conquers Scotland following the death of Alexander III of Scotland, who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace (James Robinson) witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father (Sean Lawlor) and brother (Sandy Nelson), and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte (or droit du seigneur, the right of the lord to have sex with female subjects on their wedding nights). Meanwhile, a grown Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland and is reunited with his childhood friend, Hamish Campbell (Brendan Gleeson). Wallace falls in love with his other childhood friend, Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack); they marry in secret so she will not have to spend the night with the local English lord. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed by having her throat slit. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.<br/><br/>This enrages Longshanks, who orders his son, Prince Edward (Peter Hanly), to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace then leads his army to victory at Stirling and then sacks the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew (Richard Leaf) and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), the son of nobleman Robert the Elder (Ian Bannen) and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife, Isabella of France (Sophie Marceau), to try to negotiate with Wallace, hoping Wallace will kill her and thus draw the French king to declare war. Wallace refuses the bribe sent with Isabella by Longshanks, but after meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. Meanwhile, Longshanks prepares an army to invade Scotland."
"cammiefarella","10","2","5","21 June 2016"," Why its a good movie.
","Some movies one can see over and over, and they feel as if they're just as enticing as the first time you've watched it. Braveheart remains one of these movies. The movie directed by Mel Gibson, Braveheart (1995), depicts a humble clansman, William Wallace, determined to free Scotland from the English rule. William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, lost his father and wife, Murron MacClannough, as a result of the harsh English ruler, King Edward, and his inhumane laws. In addition, William Wallace's tragic loss of his ""hidden bride"" remains the result of him trying to protect her from the English Law, Prima Nocte, which allows a lord the right to have sex with the ""bride"" before her wedding night. As Wallace rebels against the English, he becomes a very well-known figure among others. As many people stand behind the remarkable William Wallace, he and his people truly express ""the heart of Scotland"" as they defy against all odds, but of course there remains enemies. Braveheart exemplifies an excellent film based on the following aspects: acting, cinematography, plot, soundtrack, setting, and theme. The well-known actor, Mel Gibson, appears in many films, but much of his success comes from his ability to perform a serious, strong-willed part exceptionally; moreover, in this film he does not come short of successfully playing the role of William Wallace. Mel Gibson plays the part of a Scottish knight whom becomes one of the most influential figures in the battles leading up to obtaining Scotland's independence from English rule, and he appears more than natural as he acts the part. In the scene where William tracks down the men who sabotaged him, he takes off the one man's gear prepared to kill whomever is underneath it; however, he discovers Robert the Bruce, the man who gave him his word to stand behind Scotland. As a result, William's facial expressions portray surprise and betrayal. Mel Gibson acts proficiently in this scene because his reactions depict natural behavior since this type of disloyalty demonstrated a look any individual would also obtain. Although Mel Gibson stars as the main character in the film, other actors such as Angus Macfadyen also exemplified exceptional acting. Reverting back to the previous scene, Angus plays the character Robert the Bruce, and after he realized William discovered he sabotaged him, his reactions demonstrated shame, remorse, and guilt realistically. In addition, Braveheart exemplified outstanding cinematography. Often times, action movies neglect to focus the camera in the appropriate angles, and this takes away from the audience's ability to understand what's going on and why it's going on. In the scene where William's wife, Murron, fought the English lords whom were attempting to rape her, the camera was focused in all the correct places, so the audience knew the whereabouts of both William and Murron; furthermore, if the audience had not been provided with William's information as well, we would dread on the fact he was unable to save her the entire movie. Moreover, a still, focused camera is essential in action movies because it remains too difficult to follow the action in a movie when one can hardly follow the camera. That being said, this action-packed film maintained a steady camera in every scene, even on the battlefield. In order for a movie to leave an impression, the plot must be organized and unique. Braveheart remains a particularly unique movie because it illustrates a true historical event. The historical event in which this film follows portrays the time period between the late-1200's to mid-1300's where a devoted Scottish man, William Wallace, persisted in gaining Scotland's independence, and breaking free from England and it's tyrannical ruler, King Edward. In order to capture the audience's attention, the movie adds a twist by providing incentive to William's actions. Braveheart correctly exemplifies a well-organized plot by following the events, such as battles, true to history, and through cause-effect then chronological order; for example, the death of William's wife caused his rebellion, and battle by battle Scotland got closer and closer to gaining their freedom. Often times, people neglect to recognize the power a movie's soundtrack withholds. In Braveheart, the music does a remarkable job in enhancing each scene. First of all, when Murron's burial takes place, bagpipes begin to play, and the well-known Scottish music for death remains the only thing the audience hears; moreover, this music effectively evokes the audience's emotions by representing grief, loss, and gloom. In addition, the music in this movie mimics Scottish culture which enhances the historical significance of the movie; thus, Scottish folk music and Scottish funeral music not only stand as an imperative tune for the events that take place, but they also solidify Scotland's significance and heart. The setting of Braveheart suitably matches the context in which the story's told. Scotland and Ireland remain the region where the filming for this movie took place; likewise, the movie's historical significance and plot reflect that of Scotland's and Ireland's province. In addition, the costuming of the actors and actresses imitate visually how the people of Scotland, lords of England, and military gear one would have worn in the late-1200's to mid-1300's. Additionally, Braveheart depicts a theme. Without a film conveying a purpose and underlying message, the film essentially has no meaning; nevertheless, throughout Braveheart we repeatedly see the same idea reappearing, freedom. The theme seems quite obvious considering how the ""heart of Scotland"" and bravery of William Wallace stems from one motivation, gaining Scotland's independence. However, it's not until the end of the film when William Wallace receives unbearable pain, yet still manages to scream ""FREEDOM. FREEDOM. FREEDOM"" while his organs are being torn from his body in a gruesome punishment ritual known as purification. The movie, Braveheart, demonstrates an excellent film regarding every aspect a superb film obtains. The acting, cinematography, plot, soundtrack, setting, and theme go beyond what most films encompass, making it one of those movies that never get old. Needless to say, Braveheart deserved the felicitations it received."

","Braveheart is truly the greatest movie of all-time. It is a three hour masterpiece that makes the perfect story of a fight for freedom. I saw this movie for the first time about three years ago. I loved it then, but I love it even more now. Obviously the excitement of not knowing what was going to happen was gone, but I have a great desire for real-life freedom now, so it made me really connect with William Wallace and his cause. <br/><br/>Wallace was just a normal guy who didn't have the motivation to defy tyranny. He knew his freedom was being limited by the government of England, but it wasn't until it happened to him personally that it empowered him to do something about it. The speech he makes on the battlefield before the first battle gave me the chills because Wallace says that freedom is more important than life itself. That is a huge statement to me. He would rather have his life taken before he ever lost his freedom. This movie is the epitome of how important freedom is and the passion Wallace had to give Scotland its freedom from England's overbearing government is realistic and exemplary for all of history. I thank Mel Gibson and everyone else who helped make this movie. It is the most inspirational, courageous, and powerful movie I have ever seen."
"SimonJack","10","2","5","8 April 2016"," Epic film of a Scottish legend
","The characters are real, with some name changes, and many of the battle events are accurate. But beyond that, this film is mostly fictitious. It may not be fair to judge it solely on its historical accuracy. That's because so little actual historical record exists from the 13th century about the hero, William Wallace. So, it's best to enjoy ""Braveheart"" as an epic film about a legendary and true hero in Scottish lore.<br/><br/>Doubtless, most people enjoy the film for the splendor of its production as well as the legend. The scenery of the Scottish Highlands (much of which was filmed in Ireland), the beauty of the country, the excellence of the costuming (some not very historical) and the staging of very real battle scenes ‚Äì all make this an epic film. It is not among the greatest of epics ‚Äì ""Gone with the Wind"" of 1939, ""The Ten Commandments"" of 1956, ""War and Peace"" of 1956, or ""Ben-Hur"" of 1959. But it clearly belongs with other superb epics such as ""Doctor Zhivago"" of 1965, ""Dances with Wolves"" of 1990 and ""The Gladiator"" of 2000.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is about Scotland's fight for independence from England. William Wallace was a leading patriot in that fight who inspired the Scots to revolt against the foreign rule and oppressive practices of English-backed Scottish nobility. The film is a grand portrayal of that fight. One can leave the historical details aside and enjoy the portrayal of the Scots' fight for freedom that they finally obtained in 1306 under the leadership of King Robert the Bruce. The Scots would survive two wars of independence (1296-1328 and 1332-1357), and remain a free country.<br/><br/>Some of the Scottish nobles traded sides and loyalties, as shown in this film. But, most were loyal and fought with the common man to wage the wars for freedom that gained Scotland its independence from England.<br/><br/>As the screenwriter, Randall Wallace, says in a 2000 documentary on the making of the film, much of the story they used comes from legend. A particular source was 15th century epic poem by a Scottish minstrel called ""Blind Harry."" The poem is entitled, ""The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Eidersile."" But, besides that, the producers made ""Hollywood"" decisions to give the film more glamor and appeal. Some would be drastic revisions of history.<br/><br/>Some glaring diversions from here included the queen, Isabella of France, who became the wife of Edward II. She was born in 1295, so was only two years old when Wallace began his fight for freedom. She and Wallace never met in real life. She was 13-years old when she married Edward in 1308 ‚Äì three years after Wallace's death. She was married to Edward 19 years, until his death in 1327, and she bore him five children, including his successor, Edward III.<br/><br/>Edward I, ""Longshanks,"" is reputed to have been one of the most ruthless rulers of England. He died two years after the death of Wallace. That was a year before his son married Isabella of France. So, all the parts of the film about her, Longshanks and Edward II are pure fiction. An Encyclopedia Britannica article reports that Edward II may have had relations with men as well as other women and his wife.<br/><br/>The Scots under Wallace did invade and conquer parts of northern England, but they did not get as far south as York as shown in the film. After the major defeat at Falkirk, which the movie shows, Wallace disappeared for four years on the continent. He returned to Scotland and resumed his fighting when he was captured.<br/><br/>Wallace's execution is one thing that the movie shows accurately ‚Äì but much less graphically than it actually was. We don't know what was said, of course, but the manner and method of his execution is accurate with recorded details. Perhaps we should have seen more of it to realize the gore and horror of English punishment in that time. After his trial on August 23, 1305, he was stripped naked and dragged through the city by a horse. He then was hung, then disemboweled, then beheaded, and finally drawn and quartered. His head was mounted on London Bridge for a time and his limbs were sent to the four corners of Britain for display and deterrence against revolt. Still, history records that the Scots has the last word with the ensuring victories that established their independence.<br/><br/>Of course, all this was more than seven centuries ago. And, in the time since, England has been blessed to have the Scots as part of the U.K. especially fighting on its side in the many wars that followed. By the 19th century, the sound of bagpipes accompanying the march of troops was a proud symbol for both Englishmen and Scotsmen."
"goreilly40","6","2","5","21 June 2015"," Historically inaccurate but its not a documentary
","As a history lover I found elements of the plot simply absurd. As said before it couldn't have been more inaccurate if Wallace had ordered in the heavy artillery or sent in the air strikes. Historically it was a nonsense and probably one of the most inaccurate movies I've ever seen. The story seems to be hand picked from various periods of history and mixed together to make what can only be described as a curious hybrid time piece. That said however this is a movie whose main aim was to entertain the viewing audience, not an educational documentary, and it succeeded in its aim. The acting was good, the battle scenes were brutal, memorable and exciting, the antagonist was conniving ruthless and cunning, all must have qualities for any villain, and the protagonist was brave, noble and charismatic, the plot itself wasn't overly complex and captivating enough to see the movie through to the end, it spawned a number of memorable quotes and the ending was very moving. So by all means watch this movie as it is entertaining, but don't take it as an accurate portrayal of the actual historical figures and events its based on."
"bestopretor","10","2","5","1 January 2015"," epic!
","e know Mel Gibson as one of the prettiest guys in Hollywood; who would have thought he was also one of the canniest? As director, star and producer of ""Braveheart,"" he turns the unpromising story of a 13th-century kilted wonder into one of the most spectacular entertainments in years. The story of William Wallace, who led the Scots in a struggle for freedom from England's brutal rule, ""Braveheart"" evokes old- fashioned movie epics. Gibson's stroke of brilliance is to revel in those epic qualities - tragic romance and unbounded heroism, gorgeous photography and a cast of thousands - and add a swift contemporary kick.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" is also an explosive action movie. The logical comparison is not with the pallid ""Rob Roy"" but with a ""Die Hard"" film. The medieval Scots use spears, swords, axes and giant rocks, and they use them with a vengeance.<br/><br/>They get quite bloody in the process, too. At the start of the film, the child William (sweetly played by James Robinson, who looks remarkably like Gibson) wanders into a hut where his clansmen have gone to make peace with the English. The boy sees their bodies hanging from the rafters, establishing right away that this movie is about a savage time.<br/><br/>Despite that, the early episodes are more lyrical than brutal. Wallace is sent abroad to be educated, returns as Mel Gibson and falls in love with a beautiful woman named Murron (Catherine McCormack).<br/><br/>Wallace and Murron are married in secret to elude an English law allowing a nobleman to rape a Scottish bride on her wedding night. The romantic marriage ceremony, at night in a clearing in the woods, is so evocative of ""Romeo and Juliet"" that there must be trouble ahead.<br/><br/>Just enough of the typical Gibson persona shows through to make Wallace accessible and likable in modern terms. The love affair with Murron plays off the actor's heartthrob image. And there are flashes of irreverent wit, including a weirdly zany rock-throwing contest between Wallace and his loyal friend Hamish (Brendan Gleeson).<br/><br/>Wallace is a warrior with wit and a romantic soul. But when someone he loves is murdered by the English, he is capable of slitting the murderer's throat in revenge. From then on, ""Braveheart"" becomes a film of sly political treachery and extravagant, unrelenting battles.<br/><br/>Wallace marshals the Scots to fight against King Edward I, called Longshanks, who is played with delicious, coldblooded villainy by Patrick McGoohan. There is no over-the-top acting here: Longshanks casually pushes his son's homosexual lover out a window, as if he were shooing a fly.<br/><br/>In vast, perfectly orchestrated scenes, the English send hundreds of arrows raining on the Scots. They in turn charge at the English carrying pointed wooden poles, the better to impale them. Heads are bashed in; swords are run through bodies. ""Where's Wallace?"" one Englishman asks. Thunk. A rock lands on the Englishman's metal helmet.<br/><br/>A few elaborate set pieces stand out. Wallace rides his horse into the small bedchamber of a sleeping enemy, swats the man on the head with a ball and chain and leaps out a high window, still on the horse. They fall into the water below and safely swim away.<br/><br/>And before the Battle of Stirling, Wallace rides before hundreds of Scots and rouses them to action. If they fail to go forward, he says, one day they will look back with regret and be willing to give everything to reclaim that chance to fight for freedom.<br/><br/>It's as if Mad Max had wandered onto the stage as Henry V and offered his own humble St. Crispin's Day speech. The language doesn't measure up, but Gibson (underrated as Hamlet in the Franco Zeffirelli film) pulls it off.<br/><br/>Surely it's no coincidence that the war paint on his face is the same cornflower blue as his eyes and the sky. The film is art- directed to the hilt, with a combination of mud and grime and movie- star glamor.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" is not served well by small-scale snippets on television commercials, in which his battle cry of ""Freedom!"" sounds a little silly, or by still photographs that draw attention to Wallace's fake flowing hair. This film relies on its epic size, visually on the big screen and emotionally in the cumulative sweep of its heroic story.<br/><br/>At 2 hours 59 minutes, ""Braveheart"" doesn't need to be any longer. Even so, it zooms by a romance between Wallace and Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau), Longshanks's daughter-in-law, sent as an emissary to the Scots. There is a wham-bam quality to their story: they meet, they're in love, she's pregnant, she's gone. The affair is so truncated it seems ludicrous.<br/><br/>The film goes over the edge at the end, when Wallace is captured by the English and comes to seem like a wild-eyed zealot. And some viewers will surely balk at the movie's graphic, bloody violence.<br/><br/>But ""Braveheart"" is a great, ambitious gamble that pays off. In his second film as director (the first was the small, deft, sometimes mawkish ""Man Without a Face"") Gibson has come through with an exhilarating new-fashioned epic."

We are made slaves and most are in fact leading a life of slavery under the veils of freedom.<br/><br/>A movie that is like a clich√©d warrior story if you have seen Benhur, Spartacus and one thats designed Barry Lyndon may not be a good watch but this rises with a Brave Heart, the script has got all in it to make it a perfect piece of cinema that compromises a little but nevertheless, breathes it's heart out. It's one heck of war and period film that I would rate as a must see for costume designers, for art directors and for cinematographers who aspire to make a period film. And for all others, its a story that is of inspiration that's made with a courage.<br/><br/>To attempt to see such a long film in itself these days is an act of bravery I must say, coz we are men who don't have patience and who want everything steadfast. But all accolades to Mel Gibson who in nearly 3 hours has shown his passion and exemplified by showing glory. <br/><br/>The Battle of Stirlington, or aWar of Filkark, those are war pieces that will stand the test of time in cinema history and may be regardes as a finest depiction of the gore the pain that war is. <br/><br/>Acted supremely well by all, this is easily one of the best textbooks of showing controlled emotion just with eyes at times. The music supplements the emotion and thanks to James Horner for the music that he gave. I have this movie in my OST collection too. <br/><br/>Few scenes like the affair between Wallace and Isabella or the king throwing off Phillip may have been cut and even the length may not make everyone its admirer so a tad short and this will be easily watchable by many more is what I believe. But still, a greatly made movie in all its near three hours running time. <br/><br/>My rating is 4/5. Blu ray just made this one so better to see. Thanks to the transformation too."
"thurb19","9","2","5","31 July 2014"," Braveheart is an action packed film on the life and trials of Willam Wallace and his quest for freedom and love
","Braveheart (1995) is an action film, with a theme focused on character, based upon the life of Scotsman William Wallace (Mel Gibson) and his heroic battle to free Scotland from King Edward I, Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan), King of England. When Wallace was a child, he witnessed the King of England hang and murder the Nobles of Scotland. Shortly after, his father and brother went to war; neither of them survived. Young Wallace was taken in by his uncle who educated him and taught him how to fight. Years later, Wallace returned to his village to take over his father's farm. Here he reunited with Murron (Catherine McCormack), a young lady who had captured his attention before he left. He courted Murron and the two fell in love. They were wed, although secretly, because Wallace did not want to share Murron with the English leaders of Scotland (which was acceptable custom at this time for the English Lords to take a bride to bed on the night of her wedding). Here we see Wallace's passion and wit as he charms Murron and proves himself to his friends upon his return. Wallace is man of integrity who is merely trying to farm his father's land and start a family. While walking in the village one day, one of the English soldiers attacked Murron and attempted to rape her. Wallace came to her defense and attacked the soldiers and the two attempted to escape. They were captured and the English sheriff tied Murron to a pole in town and he slit her throat to make an example of her. After seeing this, Wallace rode in to ""surrender"" and actually ended up attacking the soldiers and murdered the sheriff in the same manner in which he slaughtered Murron. After his attack, Wallace and his fellow Scots formed a militia and went on an attack of England. After sacking the English city of York, and murdering its Lord who was family of Longshanks, Longshanks sent Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) (because the King knows Prince Edward (Peter Hanley)is not strong or threatening enough for the task) to persuade Wallace to surrender. Wallace denies the bribe and Princess returns, but only after the two share a private moment of understanding. In the meantime, Wallace was attempting to enlist the help of the Scottish nobility. They deny his pleas and later, two of them set him up in one of the battles. Here he is nearly killed by one of the King's guards, which he discovers one of the Scottish nobility, Robert the Bruce (Angus Mcfadyen), who saves Wallace from being captured just in time. Wallace goes into hiding and kills the two who betrayed him. Robert the Bruce, feeling guilt for his part in the attack on Wallace, set up a meeting intending to join forces with Wallace but was sabotaged by his father, the Leper (Ian Bannen), who has Wallace beaten and arrested for treason. Throughout each battle, their losses and gains, Wallace remains true to his passion for the freedom of Scotland from the evil rule of Longshanks. Wallace is imprisoned and set to be tortured unless he submit to the King of England. Longshanks has become terminally ill. Princess Isabelle first goes to see Wallace and beg him to surrender to King Edward; when that was unsuccessful, she went to see the King to beg for the release of Wallace. When he will not free Wallace, she informs the dying King that she is carrying Wallace's baby. Wallace in the end is tortured and murdered, standing for the freedom of Scotland until his dying breath. Robert the Bruce is crowned King of Scotland (through arrangements of his father the Leper) and in the end charges the English army instead of submitting to them and winning the freedom for Scotland for which Wallace had fought so hard. Director, Mel Gibson, also makes good use of motifs throughout the film to drive home his point. We often see scenes of Wallace, face determined, sword drawn, ready to fight for freedom at all cost. Another area of emphasis in Braveheart, is the power of love and what it can lead a person to do. It is his love for Murron is what set Wallace's anger into motion. The love of his country and for his father and brother are other driving aspects in keeping his fight for freedom. The angle of filming also adds to focus on Wallace's character. The camera is focused on him whenever he is in the scene. Many shots of him are filmed slightly looking up at him to make him seem larger, stronger, and more formidable. Braveheart has a similar theme and focus on character as Gladiator (2000). In Gladiator, it is Maximus who attempted to be executed for his moral upstanding. After escaping execution, he finds that his family had been murdered instead. Through the film, Commodus in fits of jealousy, attempts to rid himself of Maximus. Even after attempting to cheat to do so, Maximus still manages to kill Commodus and return power to the people, undoing the work of Commodus' time in power. Maximus, like William Wallace, also had a passion to uphold good and give people their freedom, with love as a driving force."

I doubt the story is even close to 100% accurate, but all the big name characters in the movie were historical figures who lived during the same time period. For those wanting a piece by piece historical recollection of events, go read an encyclopedia. This movie takes many historical liberties, but also manages to piece together a pretty decent plot: Scottish man suffers loss at the hands of the English and leads a rebellion against them. This movie really boils down to one important thing: To persuade ""The Bruce,"" to take the throne and lead Scotland to independence, which happens at the very end following Wallace's death.

If you want to watch a 100% historically valid movie about William Wallace, feel free to watch the History Channel. Even then, not much is ACTUALLY known about Wallace so good luck with that.

The action is blood splattering joy. The scale of the battles are actually quite impressive with real people. It's the kind of sword swinging that every boy dreams of playing.

A testament to the power of the film, the spirit of William Wallace and the effort of all involved, particularly Mel Gibson. Incredible film. Another perfect score by James Horner."
"basilisksamuk","8","2","5","3 March 2013"," Works because it is done with conviction
","Mel Gibson plays William Wallace and the story basically tells how he is politicised, raises an army and begins to win against the English, even pushing back their forces as far as York. But in the end he is unable to get the support he needs from the Scottish nobility and his revolt falls apart. Wallace is hung drawn and quartered after his capture but, of course, the idea of freedom lives on.<br/><br/>Gibson is very good in the part and plays with utter conviction. My only reservation here was that he leaves his highland village aged about ten and returns aged forty although you would expect him to be in his twenties. He remains looking forty for the remaining years of his life too. But it is difficult to get around the fact that in showing someone's life you have to use different actors √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú if you have too many it gets confusing. I'm no expert but his accent sounds pretty good to me too.<br/><br/>The casting is convincing throughout especially with the grizzled and weathered warriors who always mange to look as they really know how to handle themselves. Special mention must go to Patrick McGoohan who is perfect as Edward Longshanks. The cold and calculating way in which he manipulates everyone around him is played to the maximum and you believe that this man could really dominate his family and his court through sheer force of will.<br/><br/>Gibson also directs and it is difficult to find fault in this. The battle scenes are some of the best ever seen on screen though I do not know how much of this is down to the second unit direction rather than Gibson. Whatever, it is impressive.<br/><br/>As a viewing experience I do feel the third act is a little disappointing as the rebel camp falls apart and Wallace is betrayed and captured and this section could have been trimmed down a little. But that's just a minor point. Some people have noticed historical inaccuracies and moaned about them. For instance Prince Edward's French wife was apparently only about six years old at the time she is portrayed as an adult having it off with Mel in the film. Well, it's a good sub-plot in the film so it doesn't trouble me at all.<br/><br/>The other glaring inaccuracy is the fact that Wallace's warriors wear woad into battle although this practice died out long before. To this charge I'd like to say I just don't care. When you see the warriors woaded up you just know that this is right. Even if woad was not used at the time it should have been! Painting your face to make yourself look fierce in battle has always been practiced and always will. Whether it is woad or mud or red paint that is used it is psychologically right. The woad is one of the masterstrokes of the film for me"

","If you consider this a war movie or an action movie your missing the point. This movie is about the human spirit. If I did have to classify it as a war or action movie it would certainly be #1 in either genre. Mel Gibson's acting is superb and is unbelievably outshone by his direction. The war scenes are epic and this film should be seen by everyone. I swear the scene where he rally's the troops to war made me want to wield a mace so bad I couldn't believe it. All in all if you don't like this film there is something wrong with you. This is Mel Gibson on the top of his game, the way his career and life have fallen off the cliff at least movie fans have this gift to see how amazing a movie maker he once was."

","Braveheart is one of the the most influential films ever made and a film that changed much about films.<br/><br/>The movie 'Braveheart' tells the story of a Scottish man named William Wallace, who, after the loss of all his loved one, goes on a quest to pretty much wipe out the evil that has invaded Scotland and give its people their rightful freedom and peace.<br/><br/>The movie premise is very basic. Its not the story itself that is so compelling in the film. Its mainly the direction and acting of Mel Gibson, who absolutely masters both aspects to one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>The film itself is beautiful in every single aspect. All the supporting cast did a fantastic job and each made their character be as real as possible. The guy playing King Edward Longshanks does such a great job making sure you totally despise the character in every way. Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace is one of the finest and most professional acting I've seen.<br/><br/>The musical score to the film is very beautiful, further adding to the incredible brilliance of the film. The cinematography shots around Scotland were breathtaking. In fact, it is Braveheart's brilliance of cinematography that ensured masterpieces such as Lord of the Rings would follow the same trail.<br/><br/>The moment the film really started, I absolutely loved two things about it. The musical score and the breathtaking cinematography! The start of the film where we see swooping shots through mountains is so breathtaking that from here on in, I loved the whole film.<br/><br/>Though a few of the fight scenes now may look a little aged, and a little disappointing, which is my ONLY minor concern, they are certainly watchable and I enjoyed MOST of them. The action in Braveheart is what brings us the action in Gladiator, Lord of the Rings, Troy, 300 and so on.<br/><br/>Braveheart in short, is nothing less than a masterpiece. It exceeds every aspect that a film should by including brilliant performances to relate to characters, breathtaking music, great direction and superb cinematography."
"ryansouza","10","2","5","8 November 2012"," Braveheart: One of Mel Gibson's Best Movies
","Braveheart, directed by and starring Mel Gibson is an exhilarating and fast paced movie about the honored warrior William Wallace, who united the 13th century Scots in their battle against the English rule. This film is an excellent piece of work, as it accurately depicts important battles in history. Furthermore, this is also an outstanding movie to add to the many blockbuster hits that Mr. Gibson already has under his name.<br/><br/>In addition, personally, this is one of Mel Gibson's best movies overall; only tied be his role in The Patriot and the Mad Max movies. He has had multiple blockbusters because of the fact that he almost becomes the person he is acting as. Mr. Gibson goes the whole 100 yards and even then some no matter what role Mel is playing. Whether it be an American soldier or a 13th century Scottish warrior, he puts all that he has into the part, for the good of the film.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this movie is also historically accurate, which in turn makes it all that better. The people who made the movie actually put the time into finding weapons accurate to the correct time period. One of the most important parts to making this fantastic movie was the scenery. When you watch the movie, you will actually feel as if you were right there watching the battle. The film directors did not cut any corners whatsoever in the making of this outstanding film.<br/><br/>However, if you are the kind of person who is only willing to spend 90 minutes on a film, this is not the movie for you. This film takes time to watch(approximately 177 minutes), which on the average day is very time consuming to most people. But if you are looking to spend 3 hours watching a movie, Braveheart is an excellent choice.<br/><br/>Moreover, this is one of those movies that will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. This film has those wonderful blood filled battles with gore in it whichever way the viewer turns, which is quite appealing to some viewers. However, it also has those inspiring and touching moments, for example, whenever William gave his inspiring speeches before a battle, that certainly got me riled up. <br/><br/>Lastly, Braveheart starring Mel Gibson is an outstanding film that will have the viewer in awe after watching. This movie will most likely make all other movies seem half as awesome as this one. All in all, film is an excellent one to watch, especially if the viewer is aiming to wait out a few hours."

","I loved this movie,it had every thing that a movie should have and more. From love found to love lost,William had to fight for everything in his life from the time he was a boy till manhood .His life long dream for freedom was bloody.brutal and full of hate,lust and thirst for life. That was my mom's take on one of the best epics of its time. For me it was that, I admired his passion he never gave up fighting for his cause till the very end! And that his dream was not fought in vain . Because it lived on in the hearts of his men. With the same conviction and passion he had , that is why I love this movie! There lies the heart of a true classic! And what made it this incredible, was the actors especially Mel's portrayal of the infamous William Wallace. It was one of his best performances ever! And for that we give it an A+++!"

","Braveheart is definitely one of the best films that's come out in the past twenty years. The acting is fantastic and so is the story. Mel Gibson does his best acting in this movie, playing William Wallace, who leads the Scots against the British. Mel Gibson isn't the only person who gives off a fantastic acting job. Sophie Marceau plays Princess Isabella,the poor girl stuck in a loveless marriage and dreaming of Wallace, the man she's always wanted. Throughout the entire movie I was cheering for her, hoping she would somehow get a happy ending. Another fantastic acting job was Patrick McGoohan, who plays King Edward of England. He's ruthless, heartless, and power hungry. In my opinion, Mr. McGoohan should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his part. However, as much as I loved all their performances, my favorite performance was done by David O'Hara, who plays one of my favorite characters, Stephen, the Irishman. Yet, as much as I loved this movie, it was not my favorite. It was rather long and seemed to drag out just a tad bit. Some parts could have been cut a little shorter. Yet, overall it was a very well done film."

","Braveheart, which tells us about the true story of Scottish rebel William Wallace, is a stunning and impacting historical film. From the moment it hit the theaters, everyone knew that this would go down as one of the classics. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson shows a great talent (it his only his second film as a director). The battle scenes are wonderfully filmed, and the characters seem very real. The film also makes us believe the plot, not only thanks to the great storytelling, but also thanks to the realistic (and sometimes graphic) depiction of those times. Added to all that, the acting is perfect, even from newcomers such as Brendan Gleeson or Angus McFayden. All these qualities make it one of my favorite films ever."

","O.K., we need to separate Mel Gibson, the actor and director from the raving racist lunatic we have been subjected to in the news. In front of or behind a camera the man is a genius. <br/><br/>Now to Braveheart; without question, the artist Gibson has created a great historically based biography of William Wallace, who in the 13th century led an army against the British against great odds and triumphed on several occasions. Wallace's bravery in battle is legendary and Gibson is perfect in the role. His rise and fall after many brutal and violent encounters, is breathtaking. Braveheart is a true epic in the best sense of the word. The three hours move very quickly and the ending is not easy to watch but the life of William Wallace was certainly worthwhile."

"smithm19","10","2","5","10 December 2011"," Film Review - Braveheart
","The movie Braveheart (1995) tells the story of medieval Scottish patriot William Wallace and Robert the Bruce's fight to unify his nation against English oppression. It is the story of how one man, Wallace, (Mel Gibson) unites his countrymen to take up arms against the English for the cause of freedom and to crown Robert the Bruce King of Scotland and ultimately securing their independence. The film begins with a young William Wallace who has lost his father and brother fighting the English. After William's father's funeral he is taken by his educated and cultured Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox) who teaches William that he must learn to use his brain and wit, before he can learn to use a sword (Braveheart, 1995). Wallace returns to his home twenty years later and is reunited with his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack). The two fall in love and secretly marry to avoid the English right of prima Noctae, allowing an English soldier to sleep with the bride on the first night of marriage. Soon after, Murran is assaulted by an English soldier and in an attempt to escape, is captured, and killed. Wallace responds to her death with anger and to avenge her death, kills the entire platoon of foot soldiers. The other villagers join William in his fight against the English and eventually, the revolt becomes a full-fledge war. The film continues to show how Wallace leads his fellow Scotsmen against the English in a series of bloody battles and proving the Scots are a real threat to the English (Braveheart, 1995).<br/><br/>Although the film has been criticized for not being historically accurate, it is still a story filled with passion and courage, illustrating the influence one man had on his countrymen to rally and fight for their freedom (Ferguson). It is the life of William Wallace and his passion and drive to inspire his countrymen resulting in eventual freedom that is the underlying theme of Braveheart. Braveheart is an action, romance, and drama movie that created a sense of pride and nationalism throughout modern Scotland upon its release in 1995. Wallace is considered a national hero in Scotland, with numerous poems and stories written about his life (Scotsmart, 2011).<br/><br/>The films cinematography (John Toll, Cinematographer) captures the beauty and ruggedness of the landscape of Scotland and Ireland where the film was shot. The colors of the landscape were vibrant and clear, whereas the colors of the actors tended to be muted creating a more historic and realistic picture of the people of the time. Director Mel Gibson's epic battle scenes realistically showed the brutality and violent hand-to-hand warfare used during the 13th century. Gibson hired members of the F.C.A., the Irish Territorial Army to act as extras for the battle scenes to create a more authentic looking army. The battle of Stirling took six weeks to film and over 90 hours were shot for the sequence (IMDb, 2011). <br/><br/>Braveheart is a convincing tale of Scotland's fight for freedom, and although it lacks in historical accuracy, it is a powerful movie that is realistic and inspiring."
"MovieBiscuits","5","2","5","3 March 2011"," Fatal flaw
","Braveheart begins with the young William Wallace losing his father and leaving his small Scottish village. I have to admit, the first 15 or so minutes of the film were less than exciting. I can deal with slow scenes if I feel that they have purpose and set up the film, but I felt myself having a difficult time connecting with William as a boy, perhaps because there was not enough development with him and his father. Thankfully, I managed to make it through this introduction because the film picked up quickly. Since I watched this movie for the first time a week ago, my opinion of Mel Gibson is not favorable, and so I thought this would be distracting. However, I immediately became entranced in the love story with Wallace's childhood friend. Her unjust death pulled me in the film even further. I found myself emotionally bound to the revenge that I hoped Wallace would find. The battle scenes were realistic and the visuals were captivating. Mel Gibson's portrayal of a grieving, revolutionary hero was exceptional.<br/><br/>Despite these praises, I strongly believe this film failed. The critical flaw was the romance between Wallace and the French princess. While I understand the theme of freedom was crucial to the film, the primary motivation for Wallace was love and revenge, symbolized by the swatch of fabric from his dead wife's clothes. Each time that Wallace looked at the cloth, there was a renewal of understanding as to Wallace's purpose in fighting the English. Rather than keep this powerful symbol, the film threw away all of the purpose and power that the movie possessed by Wallace sleeping with the princess. Initially, I enjoyed the princess' character. She helped Wallace and it seemed that her moral compass pointed her towards helping the Scottish. But as she indirectly admits later, the reason why she was helping Wallace was because she loved his face/him. This temporary moment of lust destroyed what could have been an exceptional film of freedom, revenge and love."
"Dandy_Desmond","5","2","5","2 March 2010"," Majestic & Entertaining and a bit annoying
","I consider myself a big film fan. When a friend recently pointed out that it was a crime that i had not seen this movie, despite it being 15 years old, I bought it cheap and decided it was time to see what i had missed out on. <br/><br/>First of all this movie has all the elements of an epic. Grand scenery, the great hero, a doomed romance, evil bad guys, a wonderful score and it was about as entertaining as it gets. So why isn't it a 10? Well first of all at times it is a little one dimensional the Scottish are brave heroes and the English are evil spineless bimbos to the last man, the inclusion of the homosexual prince for no reason other than for Mel to have his little fantasy and to shag the princess! What went through the writers mind to put that in? He would have stunk. <br/><br/>At that point I felt it bordered on plain stupid. I'm no historian but even I know that was a load of b0llocks. So yes it was entertaining but re writing history to such a degree left me annoyed enough to mark it down."
"Gunn","10","2","5","7 September 2009"," Emotional, Stunning, Brilliant Masterpiece!
","I can't believe I haven't reviewed this, my co-favorite (with Dances with Wolves), No. 1 film that I've ever seen. I just couldn't pick between the two. Both films move me emotionally in similar ways. Mel Gibson's masterpiece actually affected/inspired the vote for Scotland's devolution. It gave the Scottish people a strong sense of pride in their heritage, something they seemed to lack when it came to voting for independence. Anyone who knows a bit of Scottish history knows that the film contains many inaccuracies, but this story is based on a poem by Blind Harry and little is known of William Wallace outside of that. The basic story plot is true. The murder of his wife definitely drove him to act against the English tyranny of Edward the 1st (Longshanks). Certain details are off, as the Battle of Stirling was fought on a bridge over marshlands, the romance between Wallace and the princess never happened as she was a mere child when Wallace died. Kilts are also questionable as they were not worn commonly at that time. Yet the story of William Wallace is legend. He beat the English against incredible odds, as he had much fewer men. He united a divided Scotland to fight for Freedom. He inspired Robert the Bruce to act for Scotland and not the throne. Gibson tells the story brilliantly with the help of cinematographer John Toll, who brilliantly captures Scotland's rugged, rustic beauty, and a fine cast of actors led by himself, Angus Macfadyen, Patrick McGoohan, Brendan Gleeson, James Cosmo, Brian Cox, Ian Bannen, Tommy Flannagan and the gorgeous ladies, Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau. His use of symbolism is excellent. I especially liked his use of the thistle, which is the Flower of Scotland, its main symbol along with the Saltire or St. Andrew's Cross which is on Scotland's flag. In the film, Wallace has saved the thistle Murron gave him as a child and he gives it to her as a gift of love. She in turn embroiders a thistle on a cloth which she gives to him at their wedding and this gift becomes even more of a symbol. Also, the blue warpaint that early Celtic warriors used was symbolic. James Horner's music score is magnificent and moving, Randall Wallace's script is exceptional and stirring in spite of its inaccuracies. The Sons of Scotland speech always moves me to tears as it reminds me of the sadness of Scotland's history. God, I love this movie!<br/><br/>Post Script: To fully enjoy this film I highly recommend the blu-ray DVD which has crystal sharp clarity in picture and sound, new Extra Features which explain the history and also inaccuracies, plus new interviews with the cast and crew."
"g-white723","9","2","5","21 August 2009"," The Bloody History of Scotland
","One thing which defines Scotland's history is that much blood was spilt in battles with the English over territory and power. Scotland's history seems to be a series of tragic mishaps and defeats in battle, and I think this film describes an important moment in Scotland's story when the country united against (what they saw was) a common enemy.<br/><br/>Braveheart is quite a long film but although I've seen it many times I never tire of watching the whole lot again and again. The film starts with Wallace as a youth and then moves to when he becomes a young adult and then onto a seasoned warrior. Mel Gibson does this whilst looking middle-aged throughout the whole film, however I have to say that Gibson, who won many Oscars for this film, certainly deserved more plaudits for his performance in this film as he is runs up and down mountains and then kills a few English in battle, invades England, and damn well unites a country (all in one fine performance). It must have been a gift of a role to play. Unfortunately much of the legend of William Wallace is actually legend, and not based on factual history. Another notable performance was that of Robert the Bruce. Torn between his family and his countrymen, the bloke who played 'The Bruce' turned in a moving performance. In fact the acting throughout the film was first rate.<br/><br/>The historical inaccuracy is a hot topic about this film, but I think the critics are exaggerating the flaws of the film. One real error is the relationship that Wallace has with the Princess of England. Even someone with no historical background can see that was a total fabrication of the truth.<br/><br/>The film really describes Scottish History in a 3 hour film. Some of the detail may be incorrect, but the battle of Bannockburn, where the Scots beat a much stronger English army is a major historical event in Scotland's history. I think that was the first time heavy horse cavalry was defeated by foot soldiers. This battle seems to have been moved in time so that Wallace could lead the battle. In fact Wallace was dead and gone by then, but it was his inspiration that led to that battle."

Although, it might sicken you to see the way people sometimes treat other people. While seeing this movie, I got angry with England for what they did to Scotland.

Shakespeare was said to be the first noted writer where the majority of his characters had severe psychological undertones identifiable by the reader who could understand them and relate to them.<br/><br/>Braveheart does this as well with an perfectly cast film with dozens of stellar Shakespearian- type performances that the viewer can identify with: The political clans head where everything is a payoff, the ruthless king who maintains his kingdom through fear, the inept son of the king who is there by birth-right, the pure village maiden misplaced in a ruthless time, a queen forced into a loveless relationship, Robert the Bruce who is struggling with establishing his own character, the reluctant hero leader, the lover's vengeance, the son who his avenging his father's murder, and the singular heart who pure focus is achieving his goal of freedom.<br/><br/>The battle scene are very gory, but necessary to tell of the struggle and raise the stakes in the movie. Since this movie, I have seen other movies influenced and whom have borrowed from this movie's battlefield trickery, angles of fighting, and eye-level impact clashes.<br/><br/>A sweeping epic that is one of the most inspiring movies of its time. It is the 1990's version of a Man for All Seasons. In a Hollywood industry that highlights and makes films of the underworld seediness, Mel Gibson brought forth a story of conviction and character and inspiration, and in hindsight laid the foundation in this film that would be the foreshadowing of his work in the Passion of the Christ.<br/><br/>One of the Best Movies Ever Made, as FIVE Oscars recognized!"

","Had this film been set in a mythical land with fictional characters it wouldn't be too bad a film. But it has ideas, well above its station, about being a historical film, about being a film with a message. This turns an average good vs evil yarn into a bit of a joke. The trouble with real life is that it doesn't fit the Hollywood mould. So it gets bent out of shape. No film is completely historically accurate but Braveheart has a mass of cringingly bad mistakes. It gets his name right and puts some battles in and has him killed. The rest is fiction, almost nothing it right - from the blue paint that is supposed to be woad through to the romance with the English Queen and the siege of York, all wrong. It's a film that will annoy those who value history and still cling to the idea that modern films are capable of showing it. All this aside, it's not a bad film, just don't take it on the level it wants to be taken on and you'll be okay.

","This movie is by far one of the best movies ever made.  The story is awe inspiring, as is the writing.  If anyone tells you it's too long, or the monologues get boring, IGNORE THEM! The monologues add to the greatness of this epic tale of the Scottish Revolution from (again) the British.  Mel Gibson (William Wallace) does an incredible job portraying the epic hero of Scotland, and his directing complements the acting. The speeches give the movie a certain greatness that can only be described in the inspiring (and beautiful) score and theme (what a great song!).  Not many movies are this great, and not watching it would be like missing out on the automobile.  MUST SEE!<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10"
"Bravheart","Null","2","5","16 February 2001"," Best Movie of All Time!
","This is the best movie of all time. It shows the courage of William Wallace as he fights to free Scotland from the clutches of the ruthless King Edward the Longshanks. He fights overwhelming odds, and every time, save a few, he comes out on top. His intelligence is that off greatness compared to others of the time, and uses it in battle, as showed in makind spears to take out English calvalry(and the first time in recorded history that infantry took out cavalry without a heavy one of their own.) This movie shows a great portrayal of this mans heroic feats, and includes romance and humor. Most of the movie is also historically acurate, due to the fact that Mel Gibson consulted with the head of the actual Wallace clan in Scotland on everything, though he added a few of the movie essentials to keep it moving. Overall this is my favorite movie of all time, and William Wallace has proved to be my hero, due to his courage and intelligence, and has opened my eyes to everything, and the thing which most of us take for granted; our freedom."

Then they got Peewee Hermann, Coco The Clown, Lassie, and Bill Clinton's Speech-writer to re-hash it. They then managed to con Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles into producing and directing it.<br/><br/>THEN they had the Spice Girls do post-production, just to polish it up.<br/><br/>Well, it certainly SEEMS that way.<br/><br/>If anyone can come up with a better version of how/why this movie was released, I'd be MORE than happy to hear it.<br/><br/>
Overall, it was about as exciting as watching my hair turn grey, and about as mentally-stimulating as 3 dozen Valium.<br/><br/>How sad that one of Scotland's greatest sons was turned into Mad Max while his story was turned into THIS cinematographic torture-chamber.<br/><br/>Oh yeah .... one final thought.<br/><br/>The guy who wrote this movie was on TV recently saying that he firmly believes himself a  descendant of William Wallace (a man who supposedly died childless!!) and because nobody can prove otherwise, that's his story and he's sticking to it.<br/><br/>Pretty much like David Koresh saying that he is Jesus because nobody can prove otherwise!!<br/><br/>Says it all really, huh?"

But the gaffing, sound mixing, editing, and most of all the interaction of the strengths of the performances were strictly amateurish. Nowhere was restraint exercised.

","I hadn't seen this movie when it came out and, considering the hype it was bathed in back then, I may have liked it at the time. As it is, I watched it on DVD and HATED it for the following reasons:<br/><br/><ul><li>Mel Gibson's tic-drenched acting. He acts with his face, not with his heart. He is especially annoying at the beginning when he is supposedly a younger man. His eyes-wide smiles and grins come off as ridiculous leering.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gibson/Wallace and the women in his life. Gibson obviously likes to set himself up as hunk-du-jour. The most ridiculous line in any movie comes when Sophie Marceau berates him for beguiling her, saying something like, ""you just have to look at me and i go weak in the knees."" Give me a break. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gibson's fright wig. Scarier than Tina Turner in Tommy. His hair made me feel like I had lice. Ew. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tedious plotting. Homely family scene followed by rousing battle followed by incomprehensible noble plotting followed by homely village life followed by rousing battle followed by incomprehensible noble plotting, etc. Yawn. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cringe-worthy dialogue. I wasn't taking notes at the time, but even my 13yr old kid, with whom I was watching the film, couldn't stop groaning. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gibson's messianic complex. Probably not noted at the time of the film's release, but it is impossible to watch Braveheart today without seeing Mel-the-Messiah. Martyr like poses and positions abound, arms outstretched, beatific expressions, etc. Hard to watch. </li></ul><br/><br/>-Overly violent battle scenes. I guess these things are the norm now, but I am getting less and less tolerant of listening to the FX-designed sounds of the battlefield, let alone close-up shots of swords and brainmatter.<br/><br/>All in all, Braveheart is a film by a man in love with the image of himself as heroic Christ-like martyr. I think that will be the LAST film with or by Mel Gibson I will ever see."
"thinker1691","9","3","10","20 March 2011"," "" From the point of view of a true Scotsman, this is his epic and only defeated Englishmen can dispute it ""
","In the late 13th Century, a modern descendant of Sir William Wallace, one Randall Wallace, set to pen this long forgotten epic. The story as told by modern writers, began when Wallace takes up the challenge of the English invaders on their own terms. This fine film called ""Brave heart "" is an excellent rendition of the basic facts of the legacy. Although there are many disputed events, the final outcome was nothing short of complete freedom from English tyranny. Mel Gibson plays the Scottish hero William Wallace and does a commanding effort and furthermore he directs the dramatic epic as well. In his superb cast are Hollywood veterans like Brian Cox, Patrick McGoohan, Angus Macfadyen as Robert the Bruce and Alun Armstrong. The lasting impression one gets from this movie are the vicious, slaughter-house re-enactments of the most brutal battle scenes in Scottish history. Although it's the cast and crew which combine to bring History to life, it is the poignant interwoven romantic inter-story which adds a novel flavor to it. All in all this is one exciting movie which has set in motion the wheels which will eventually turn it into a Historic Classic. ****"

","Braveheart was simply astonishing. Mel Gibson crafted an absolute masterpiece and was awarded for it. The first time I watched this film was in 2009 at my trailer. I bought it at wal-mart that day because everyone that I know said it was amazing and also I am a big fan of Mel Gibson's movies. So I bought it went back to my trailer put it in and after it was done I needed to sit on the couch for a couple minutes to take it all in. I had just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece! <br/><br/>This film is my favourite movie and I could watch it over and over again. Well let me just tell you what the film is about. This film is about 13th century Scot William Wallace, who leads a Scottish rebellion against the British during the Scottish Independence wars.

"ncruz-77996","4","2","6","28 June 2019"," A Little Overrated
","Intro:
Now, Braveheart's fine. I don't hate it. The acting is great, the sets are amazing, the writing is fine. So, why don't I love it? Well, there's one reason. It's down right disrespect for history, as Braveheart follows it so rarely. To the point that it's almost fiction. And I think it's hypocritical when people give this film a pass fir being inaccurate, but when others are just as fictional, it's not very well loved.<br/><br/>My Problems:
This film ""adapts"" the story of William Wallace, and the Scottish rebellion against the British. Now, even though I consider myself a bit of a history buff, I am not really familiar with this part of history. But I can still tell you that this film doesn't well adapt this story.<br/><br/>From the romance that Wallace has with the princess, which never happened, and never could've happened. It wasn't possible. Because when Wallace was running around in the 13th Century fighting for freedom, the princess wasn't even 10 years old. And so many other pointless and inaccuracies plague this film.<br/><br/>Another problem is the fact that Scots wore kilts. Which something that wasn't created for another few years. And I'm not the only one who knows this, many people have pointed them out, yet, they still love the film.<br/><br/>How come it's okay when this film takes so many ""creative liberties"", but it's not okay when other films do it. Here's a good example, Pocahontas is often hated by many and called one of the weakest in the Disney lineup. For it's numerous historical inaccuracies. And if you took away all the names from history, you wouldn't be able to tell the similarities it has to the actual story.<br/><br/>And people also don't like some of Mel Gibson's other films, such as, Apocalypto and The Patriot. Apocalypto makes so many mistakes and makes some choices that don't make sense. Let me explain. This film's even worse. The film claims to be a chronicling of the end of the Mayan Classical Era, but it doesn't even stick to that. As the Mayans are depicted doing things other tribes did, such as sacrificing people, which was something the Aztec's did. And the ending to that film, is one of the dumbest endings. Which shows the Spanish arriving over the 100 years before they actually came to the Mayans. And similar problems go for The Patriot.<br/><br/>Now that got a little off track there. But do you get my point? The shear hypocrisy that surrounds this film really annoys me.<br/><br/>What I Like:
Though I had a lot of criticism, I still don't hate the movie. Why? Well, let me answer. I kind of get it, the film looks great, and mostly recreates the time period. If this story was fictional, I would probably like this film more. But, I think they should've just told the story as it was. To my knowledge, there was more than enough information on the rebellion and William Wallace, to make the epic Mel Gibson imagined. I just think he should've called this an original story, loosely based on the story of William Wallace, or just adapted William Wallace correctly. But, I'm not gonna change a lot of people's opinions on the film.<br/><br/>Conclusion:
History will see it as one of the greatest films of all time. If the astonishing 8.4 rating (higher than Citizen Kane), isn't evident enough, I don't know what is. I know that many people do love this film, and I still respect their opinions. And I ask you to respect mine."

It should be archived and cared for. This Gibson's masterpiece and gift for the audience. It is a film everyone will love, adore for generations and it will strike you emotionally.

The script is one of the best ever, all in all it is just the best film ever made, anyone that disagrees will probably think its the godfather or shawshank redemption, both brilliant but cant compare to this masterclass.

If nobody has watched this i would recommend it to everyone, although the film does have violence in it, it is for a purpose, but what story about freedom and revenge doesn't.

The acting is just superb by not only Mel Gibson, but also by his Scottish wife (Murron) who was murdered, LongShanks the pagan, the beautiful French queen (Isabelle), as well as William's sidekicks (Irish, Hamish)) throughout the movie. Not only do we get a feel for life under British colonial rule we see the relationships developed through this fight for freedom and equality.

","Great movie. Anyone to rank this less than an 8 must be English. Those who criticize the movie for its historical inaccuracies have some good and accurate points. However, the time period depicted in this movie has very little in way of pure historical facts, just what the victors wrote after battle. Therefore, it is tough to judge any historical fact at this time (with a truly deciding what is correct)...especially when they were the enemies of the English. As the movie's opening lines say, ""I shall tell you, of William Wallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes."" Enough said, if you want to have a discussion about this film let me know."
"Mario64","8","2","6","1 August 2010"," A good battle epic.
","Braveheart is the story of William Wallace and his vengeance of a love one, uniting of the Scots against the English in the fight for vengeance and freedom. The acting is good all around, but the antagonists of the film are played too much as evil English stereotypes. The heroes, Wallace and his band of Scottish warriors, you cheer for, in spite of the brutality, but I can't help feel at least a bit of manipulation that pulls me in that direction.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is the battles. They are brutal, graphic, and believable. Braveheart isn't something you'll want to get a history lesson from though. It sells the story well enough, but after researching on the internet the history is apparently quite bad even by Hollywood standards. Still the bad history does nothing to diminish the effect of the amazing battle scenes that hold up superbly 15 years later.<br/><br/>Braveheart can't be mentioned in the same breath as Lawrence of Arabia, Ben Hur, or Gone With the Wind, as masterpieces of epic storytelling. What it is is a bloody, rousing, entertaining, exciting, and romantically delightful film. Nothing more and nothing less. No it did not deserve to win Best Picture, but hey it's 3 Hours that are never dull, and that are sometimes rather impressive."
"TheUnknown837-1","9","2","6","6 August 2009"," a near-perfect contemporary epic with riveting action scenes, a superb soundtrack, competent acting, and high-velocity pacing
","The greatest pleasure that I myself derived from Mel Gibson's Academy Award-winner ""Braveheart"" was not that it was a superb, gripping modern-day epic but that it was a superb, gripping modern-day epic that wisely reused a lot of the traits that made its truly wonderful ancestors like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956), Stanley Kubrick's own medieval epic ""Spartacus"" (1960) and ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939). ""Braveheart"" is a very simplistic epic and highly inaccurate historically and it's not on par with some of its influences, but I will say this: it is a truly exciting and delightful film and I was not bored with a single moment of it. And again, I saw that same spirit that made classics like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and I have some hope that maybe Hollywood will revert back to the characteristics of its Golden Age.<br/><br/>Earlier I mentioned the film was historically inaccurate and it is. It's based on real events and real people from the 13th century. Mel Gibson not only directs the picture but stars as William Wallace, a Scottish warrior who rebelled as the tyrannical king Edward ""Longshanks"" (Patrick McGoohan). In this film version, Wallace responds aggressively when the king's soldiers assault and murder his wife (Catherine McCormack) and inspires other Scotsmen to fight with him. And what follows are some of the bloodiest and riveting battle sequences I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in ""Braveheart"" are the best thing in the picture. The well-depicted Battle of Stirling sequence reportedly took six weeks to film and over a million feet of film was shot and this is believable when one examines the high tenseness, the close quarters of the camera, the amount of explicit gore and violence, and the ferocity that is displayed by the actors and extras. Now as for the human stories in the film, that's where the simplistic nature comes in. The human drama areas in regards to Wallace and his wife, his romance with the princess of England (Sophie Marceau), the king's disappointment in the abilities of his son, are very unsophisticated, but they don't have to be. At nearly three hours in length, ""Braveheart"" still manages to push itself along rather speedily and the somewhat underdeveloped background stories neither get in the way nor slow things down. Of course, the strongest compliments go out to Mel Gibson, who put a lot of responsibility on himself. Gibson is a great actor and he's an even better director. He's great both in front and behind the camera. And the fact that he can juggle both so magnificently makes him one hundred percent worthy of the Best Director Oscar that he won. My compliments also go out to the late Patrick McGoohan, who is quite sinister and devilish as the pagan king who not only wants to destroy the rebellion he's triggered, but to destroy the name of those who built up the courage to face him.<br/><br/>Another thing I'd liked to return to is the hints of a return to Hollywood's Golden Age, when it had the nerve to make movies like this once upon a time. Take note how in the film, like Kubrick's ""Spartacus"", the important roles are not played by handsome, lean young actors. Rather, they are taken by performers well into the middle sections of their lives. This is a very daring and brave thing to do in Hollywood these days, since it almost seems routine to cast somebody who serves more as eye candy for the audience to play a hero.<br/><br/>In short, ""Braveheart"" is a fast-moving, highly powerful, somewhat simplistic, but overall delightful modern-day medieval epic. Sporting a great cast, a wonderful music score by James Horner, gorgeous cinematography, and of course, the hair-raising, jaw-dropping battle scenes, it is one of the more enjoyable films I've seen in recent times."

William Wallace represents a hero one could believe in and bleed for in and out of battlefield. It's the heroic character of William Wallace that captures the audience's imagination and takes one to the whirlwind tour of the display of the sublimity of human spirit.<br/><br/>Never once making Wallace a super hero, the film portrays a human, a commoner one can easily believe in and elevates the love, war, peace, kingdom, friendship, betrayal to their quintessential purities and in a touching way.<br/><br/>Apart from the emotional part of it, the film throws up a few surprises too to a good measure like the war scene in which William cries, ""Hold, hold"" only to reveal the plot in the last minute to thwart the approaching cavalry.

It is deserving of each of the 5 Oscar's it won though I believe Mel Gibson should have won for best actor as well, especially since there was no other performance of that year that came even close to his, yet strangely he wasn't even nominated. Of notable mention is the lighthearted yet dedicated performance given by David O'Hara as ""Stephen, the Irish fighter"". His performance added just the right touch of levity without detracting from the storyline or ambiance. Brendan Gleeson's performance was perfect as well, in fact each role was filled to perfection. Although this film clocks in at nearly three hours, at its finale you find yourself wanting even more, much the same as elicited by such other great films as, ""The Hustler"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""The Great Escape"" and so forth. Another way to sum it up would be to coin the old adage: ""time flies when you're having fun"". Simply Excellent!"

","This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw it at the theater when it was released and have seen it many times since but it still hasn't lost its charm. Great story, great acting, great directing, great, great, great. It doesn't even matter that it isn't historically accurate (which usually really bugs me with movies), everything else is perfect about it. It deserved every Oscar it won and more. I can't believe the academy would award a movie like Titanic more and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Braveheart is what an epic movie should be, never boring and always entertaining (unlike Titanic). Everyone involved in the movie should receive our thanks."

","Yesterday I watched Braveheart, for like the 4th time. And almost throughout the whole movie my eyes were wet and in the end I broke out crying. I know this sounds weird cuz I am a guy, but I have never been so overwhelmed by emotions before. Well, it was saddest in the beginning and in the end. One more thing which makes the film even more fantastic is the gore.. You really see how men got their arms and heads cut off and their skulls crushed by the barbarian brutality, but that just makes it more intense and closer to reality. I wonder if anyone else has tried this ""thing"" before? And by the way, this movie is so beautiful and almost perfect. Without any doubt the best piece of movie art ever made."

","Would the film have lost any profits had it included some Gaelic dialog for the sake of accuracy and reality? There might have been couple of mumbled words in Gaelic at some point, but they were easily overlooked.<br/><br/>The fact that the majority of Scots involved in this history would have been Gaelic speakers is strangely absent from the film. Even the writers of the Indiana Jones fictional stories made sure that realistic dialog with subtitles peppered the script to give an air of realism.<br/><br/>This story is one of freedom from oppression. The people's right to use their own language was one the things that was eventually taken from them. It might have been important therefore to show the audience that they actually had their own language."

","Wallace is an American hero, with a very American ideology and way of doing things. Historically, he was, I believe, hardly a British rebel on a cultural level -- Robin Hood was.
The background of the story is nothing more than a stage for the director to express his inner stage. We love this movie because we love the pure heroes: the forthright, the brave, the quick-witted, the righteous, the daring to hate and love. Throughout the film, at least the treatment at the end of the film is in line with Wallace's character. ""If you fight for freedom, you are a free man,"" is one of the grandest phrases in the movie, and most of the time it's more inspirational than melodramatic.
This is the pinnacle of a hollywood-style hero film that includes almost all the elements of the genre: war, heroism, love, betrayal, hehe. What is valuable is that the film is full of emotion from the beginning to the end.
We can applaud our favorite hero without demanding which country he is more like."

","RELEASED IN 1995 and directed by Mel Gibson, ""Braveheart"" chronicles the life of Scotsman William Wallace (Mel Gibson) from his youth in 1280 to his execution in 1305 and events shortly thereafter. Parts of the First War of Scottish Independence are depicted, like the Battle of Stirling Bridge, the Battle of Falkirk, as well as Wallace's betrayal, capture and execution.<br/><br/>The film is notorious for its inaccuracies. For instance: (1.) kilts did not become a popular form of men's wear in Scotland until almost 400 years later. (2.) The first night or Primae Noctis wherein English nobles had the privilege of sleeping with Sottish brides is considered a historical urban myth by most historians. While there are plenty of writings that allude to it, there's very little legitimate evidence that it was ever actually used by any nobles anywhere. (3.) Scots at the time of Wallace didn't paint their faces for battle, although the Picts did wear blue face paint to scare off the Romans centuries earlier. (4.) We see no bridge at the Battle of Sterling Bridge in the movie. In the real battle the English had to cross a small bridge to attack the Scottish, but the bridge only allowed for three cavalrymen to cross at a time, which Wallace's men took advantage of, immediately killing the English once they made it to the other side.<br/><br/>(5.) Princess Isabelle of France (Sophie Marceau) was actually only 3-4 years old during Wallace's military campaigns and, in fact, never met Wallace. (6.) Although it's one of the best scenes in the movie, Phillip was never defenestrated (thrown out a high window), but lived long after Longshanks' death. However, it is likely true that wimpy Prince Edward II had homosexual affairs, although he fathered as many as five children. (7.) While Longshanks was present at the Battle of Falkirk and was known for using Irish & Welsh conscripts, at no point did the Scots and Irish stop in the middle of battle to shake hands. Also Edward I (aka Longshanks) never told his archers to fire blindly into the m√™l√©e of English and Scots. (8.) Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen) never betrayed Wallace, although he initially disowned him publicly, he secretly supported his war effort and openly admitted it later.<br/><br/>Despite these inaccuracies, the gist of the tale is true: William Wallace existed. He fought a battle with the English at Stirling and won. He fought another battle with the English at Falkirk, but was betrayed and lost. He was deceived and captured by the English, taken to London and excruciatingly executed (although it was even worse in real life than in the film). Wallace's rebellion set Scotland on the road to freedom.<br/><br/>About half the movie makes it worth seeing: It starts weak for the first 25 minutes or so, gets good for the next hour and a half and then inexplicably loses its mojo in the last hour. The problems in the last hour include: the story losing its drive, the eye-rolling betrayal scene; the equally eye-rolling episode where Wallace rides into a noble's bed chamber on a freakin' horse and easily escapes (Why Sure!); and, lastly, the overlong and dull execution sequence wherein the Christ symbolism is laid on too thick.<br/><br/>Highlights, beyond those already noted, include Gibson in the title role (speaking as someone who's not even a fan), the magnificent locations, Wallace's initial rebellion, Patrick McGoohan's delightfully diabolic portrayal of the pompous Longshanks, the brutal fight sequences and the moving score by James Horner.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE RUNS 2 minutes shy of 3 hours and was shot in Scotland & Ireland with the impaling of the horses sequences shot in Arizona.

","Hi! I have seen Braveheart five days ago; At beginning, i was not very motivated; not at all! Three hours of film, just in one time! It was very difficult to find motivation... After all, it was great! I appreciate this movie a lot in spite of a few drawbacks. I adore the medieval style with castles, knights, etc... so i very appreciate this movie for that, but i think that, the battles between SCots and English were too gory with too many details and too much blood and violence, but it's very realistic, so it's a good point! I have also appreciated the little scenes of fair between villagers when Wallace goes back in his old village. I have adored the enthusiasm and the motivation that Wallace gives to his soldiers when they have to fight against the English who are too many for them, and they want to go back home for staying alive. At this moment, Wallace shows his bravery and courage and says to them to fight in the name of liberty! Finally, i can say that i very appreciate this movie, in spite of it too long length!!"
"margaux-feral","7","1","2","3 March 2017"," don't believe all the details !
","Braveheart is actually not a historical movie, just an adventure/action movie. But I thought it was not a bad film either. I think the movie was well-made, it was pleasant to watch but in my opinion, Mel Gibson over-played his part so it wastes the character of Wallace. And as I said it isn't a historical movie when you know all the mistakes like: the Scottish didn't wear kilts at this time, some fights in the film are invented, they went too far on a point: the Prima Noctis; Lords didn't really used it), and many others. So if you wanted to know about the history of Scotland, you shouldn't watch this movie, if you want to know the basis maybe but be careful. The love story between the princess of England and Wallace is really really too much and another big mistake in a historical way. Some people say it was annoying as a movie but I didn't think it was as annoying as they think, some scenes are interesting. And I thought the King of England and Robert the Bruce are two great characters, these two actors make a good job ! To resume, it wasn't a bad movie but it can easily be much better, it is not historical, don't trust what you see immediately. But some great actors play in, so it is a good point."

"CinematicInceptions","7","1","2","9 May 2015"," Not a must-see, but certainly an impressive cinematic work.
","I am not denying the quality of this film when I say that it is a slightly overrated movie. I know that since I viewed it during it's twentieth anniversary year, I probably don't fully appreciate it. It's still a good movie two decades later, but I just think that calling it the seventieth best movie ever is a bit of a stretch. It perfectly fits the epic genre, but has a very Prince of Thieves feel to it.<br/><br/>The story is both character and plot driven. The characters that advance the story the most are Longshanks, Robert the Bruce, and of course William Wallace. Though his character is less prominent, Longshanks provides most of the plot twists in his attempts to stop Wallace. Most of the storyline consists of moving from one battle to another with some form of complication regarding the nobles or Longshanks arising between skirmishes. It can get a little complicated, but you can follow the plot without having to concentrate too much since there aren't too many characters to keep track of. There is a minor internal line with Wallace avenging his dead wife, but it doesn't have any real progression, though it is addressed a number of times. <br/><br/>I didn't feel like the characters were written with anything award winning, but I'd say they're all above average. Wallace fits the Scottish bill of being very strong-willed, but with an emotional side. He has a few inspiring speeches and lines, which is part of what makes this movie as renowned as it is. That said, his character isn't the deepest protagonist that we can all really relate to, though we can certainly sympathize with his various plights. Murron is well developed considering her limited screen time. Longshanks is a pretty good villain with a prototypical tyrant personality and arc since he has a downfall of sorts. Robert the Bruce has a pretty good arc in turning away from the wishes of his father to follow Wallace's guidance and his own conscience. He has a very evident and strong progression in rejecting the standard that his fellow nobles have set for him. I wasn't thrilled with the incorporation of Princess Isabella, especially since she historically never met Wallace according to the FAQ page. I think she could have been left out and let Wallace mourn over Murron's death like in Bourne Supremacy, which I guess he does a little. The other minor characters like Edward Longshanks II, the Irish guy Stephen, Hamish, Prince Edward, Robert's father, and the nobles are written with fair proficiency, but I've certainly seen better.<br/><br/>The action sequences come mostly in large scale battles. The sequences aren't too long, but there is a lot packed into them. There is a pretty good amount of blood, but it's not presented in too graphic a fashion. Apart from the big battles, there are a couple of smaller skirmishes in military outposts and villages, but no duels or other high-octane confrontations.<br/><br/>The technical execution seems pretty good for the time, but I know I can't really gage that properly twenty years out of context. The sound mixing and editing was satisfactory for the most part, and exceptional in a couple of places. The high-pitched Scottish bagpipes didn't make for James Horner's most impressive score, but it wasn't bad all in all. There were a couple of sequences that could have been shortened, like the one where Wallace re- enters his village to avenge Murron. I understand that it was a very pivotal moment, but there still could have been a good twenty seconds of slow-mo shaved off.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who likes action but doesn't mind a good story to go with it, and anyone who likes a good story but doesn't mind some blood and battles on the side. The elephant in the room is that the film is almost three hours long, so just be conscious of that when you decide when you want your rental period to start. I haven't seen enough Mel Gibson movies to know whether this Gibson fans will enjoy Braveheart, but since it's regarded as his crowning achievement it's probably a safe pick for all Gibson fans. So set aside a school break or long weekend to watch it through if you're okay with the genre and subject matter. I sometimes recommend a twenty to thirty minute trial period, but this is more of an all or nothing kind of movie. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."
"NickMullins","9","1","2","6 November 2013"," Brilliant, emotional, thrilling masterpiece by Mel Gibson.
","A lot of people have been bashing this movie for its historical in inaccuracies. I am a big history buff, and the first time I watched this, the complete shoving off of several major historical facts bothered me a good deal. However, after about the first hour I realized that the point of the movie was not to show exact historical facts as they happened, but to show a beautiful, touching story of a man who lost everything, (his father, his brother, his wife) to an oppressive king, and decided to do something about it. He stood by his principles and morals to the point even of death at a young age in a horrible way, from the man who in the end took literally everything, accept one thing. William Wallace's freedom.<br/><br/>The movie is a must see , but be warned, there is violence, language, sexual content and adult themes. I would not suggest it to anyone younger than 15, as it can be a bit intense at times. Other than a bit of a slow start, this movie is close to perfect, as long as you can look past this films factual issues and see it for what it is."

","Mel fights for the right to wear a skirt without being killed by some intolerant Englishman. He's also fighting for the freedom to free-ball under said skirt. Mel plays William Wallace, a warrior who leads a whole army of free-ballers in this beautiful and bloody historical epic. <br/><br/>Wallace's ambition would be all well and good were it not for the fact that all is not well in the state of England. King Edward is a trifle bitter when he realizes that his prince son has a longshank for another dude. This throws a phallic wrench into any plans King Ed may have had for an heir. Things really start to go south for northerner Wallace when King Ed shows that he's not so much the king of England as he is the king of douchebaggery when he decides he's going to teach Latin and invoke the law of prima nochte whereupon an English lord can rape any newly married Scottish woman. But King Shank doesn't foresee the consequences of sexually abusing the women of thousands of angry Scots and when Will's wife is tragically executed for going against policy, he is a highlander who will not take the high road. <br/><br/>At the battle of Stringaling, the plaid patriot's army is hopelessly outnumbered and what's worse is the English military machine has horsepower! But when the battle commences, it's the Scots who gain the advantage as they show the charging cavs who's really got the long shanks when they pull out their woods and shank 'em off their steeds. The battle proves a vicious victory for the Scots. But unfortunately, it's not all downhill for the highlanders after that. They will have to defend their title as heavyweight champions at the Battle of Falkor if they want to make history. <br/><br/>Not only is Braveheart possibly the last historical epic not to rely on CGI, but it set a precedent for manly screaming in film. Do you really think we would have had a movie like 300 were it not for the emotive whaling in this thrilling opus? Braveheart is also significant for being the first film to display director Mel's healthy obsession with gory executions."
"aalghanmi","10","1","2","29 August 2013"," Marvelous
","Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" is a full-throated, red-blooded battle epic about William Wallace, the legendary Scots warrior who led his nation into battle against the English in the years around 1300. It's an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery, and avoids the travelogue style of so many historical swashbucklers: Its locations look green, wet, vast, muddy and rugged.<br/><br/>Not much is known about Wallace, known as Braveheart, except that according to an old epic poem, he unified the clans of Scotland and won famous battles against the English before being captured, tortured and executed as a traitor.<br/><br/>Wallace's dying cry, as his body was stretched on the rack, was ""freedom!"" That isn't exactly based on fact (the concept of personal freedom was a concept not much celebrated in 1300), but it doesn't stop Gibson from making it his dying cry. It fits in with the whole glorious sweep of ""Braveheart,"" which is an action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of ""The Road Warrior."" What people are going to remember from the film are the battle scenes, which are frequent, bloody and violent. Just from a technical point of view, ""Braveheart"" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. Gibson deploys what look like thousands of men on horseback, as well as foot soldiers, archers and dirty tricks specialists, and yet his battle sequences don't turn into confusing crowd scenes: We understand the strategy, and we enjoy the tactics even while we're doubting some of them (did 14th century Scots really set battlefields aflame?).<br/><br/>Gibson is not filming history here, but myth. William Wallace may have been a real person, but ""Braveheart"" owes more to Prince Valiant, Rob Roy and Mad Max. Once we understand that this is not a solemn historical reconstruction (and that happens pretty fast), we accept dialogue that might otherwise have an uncannily modern tone, as when Braveheart issues his victory ultimatum to the English: ""Scotland's terms are that your commander present himself in front of our army, put his head between his legs and kiss his - - -."" Uh, huh.<br/><br/>In the film, Wallace's chief antagonist is King Edward I (""Longshanks""), played by Patrick McGoohan with sly cunning; he is constantly giving his realpolitik interpretation of events, and that's all the more amusing since he's usually guessing wrong.<br/><br/>Edward's son, the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), is an effete fop who marries a French woman only for political reasons. ""I may have to conceive the child myself!"" Longshanks says, and indeed, under the medieval concept of prima nocte, or ""first night,"" nobles were allowed a first chance to sleep with the wives of their lessers.<br/><br/>The Princess, played by the French actress Sophie Marceau, does not much admire her husband, who spends most of his time hanging about moon-eyed with his best friend (until the king, in a fit of impatience, hurls the friend out the castle window).<br/><br/>Edward, smarting from defeats, dispatches the Princess to offer his terms to Braveheart, but soon she's spilling all the state secrets, ""because of the way you look at me."" The Princess is the second love in Wallace's life; the first, his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack), marries him in secret (so the local English lord won't claim his rights). The two spend their wedding night outdoors, and the backlit shot as they embrace gains something, I think, from the frost on their breaths.<br/><br/>These characters come from hardened stock. (When Wallace has a reunion with his childhood pal Hamish, they hurl rocks at each other for entertainment; later, when a Scotsman has his wound cauterized, all he says is, ""That'll wake you up in the morning, boy!"") It is sometimes seen as an egotistical gesture when actors direct themselves, especially in heroic epics costing (so they say) $53 million. The truth is, given this material, I do not know that anyone could have directed it better. Gibson marshals his armies of extras, his stunt men and his special effects, and creates a fictional world that is entertaining, and thrilling.<br/><br/>And as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can."

","I have to admit that I don't know much about William Wallace the Scottish hero that fought against England's ruling in his country back in the 13th century.

The script is well done and sustains interest all along the extended duration of the film. The action sequences and massive battles are perfectly achieved too. The musical score fits accordingly.<br/><br/>If not perfect technically speaking Gibson's performance as Wallace is strong and convincing.

This film managed to propel Sir William Wallace, the infamous 13th-century Scottish hero through nearly seven centuries via the magic of a Hollywood script that took great liberties with historical fact.<br/><br/>While many praised this movie's epic film making accomplishment, just as many historians decried it's lack of historical accuracy. The film's script, by American screenwriter Randall Wallace (no relation), of William's life, love, and death owes much to Blind Harry, a 15th century minstrel who put his rhymes into writing *150* years after Wallace's execution. Wallace historians and biographers continually dispute part or all of Blind Harry's narrative, but his account of the patriot's life DOES provide the most entertaining version of the tale.<br/><br/>Blind Harry also used a heavy hand when sprinkling his tale with bitter sweet passion. His mention of a young maiden named Marion Braidfute of Lamington, who Wallace allegedly courted and wed, provided the inspiration for Murron (Catherine McCormack), Wallace's secret wife in this movie. However, no factual evidence of the marriage survives to corroborate Blind Harry's, and now Hollywood's, tale. On the other hand, Wallace DID murder Sir William Heselrig, English sheriff of Lanmark. Wallace put him to the sword and cut him into pieces in May 1297.<br/><br/>One of the film's most intriguing twists is pure Hollywood invention. A calendar puts the LIE to the tale of Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella (Sophie Marceau), wife of Prince Edward II, and the fathering of her child. Isabella and Edward II married in 1307, two years AFTER Wallace's execution. Her son Edward III, was born in the years that followed. Incidentally,Wallace was executed by hanging, drawing and quartering, not by being disemboweled at the gallows as the film suggests. The script was also very unkind to Edward I (Patrick McGoohan) specifically, and to the Normans in general, who no historian will dispute, regardless of tactics, unified a then very culturally diverse England and molded it into the great nation it still is to this day.<br/><br/>MANY other inaccuracies appear in this film as well, too many to name here, the most glaring of which had Wallace attired in the more familiar Highlander costumes when he was, in fact, a Lowlander. So what we have here is a film that is almost as much a fantasy as it is an epic. But admittedly, it is the good-guy, bad-guy scenario that is the proved Hollywood formula for success.<br/><br/>The true power of this medium is that it has the ability to EDUCATE as well as to entertain, and it's truly shameful that so many viewers think this movie is an accurate representation of historical fact. It is NOT! See it for the character portrayals, costumes and well orchestrated battle scenes. But remember, the story itself is as much a self-serving, Hollywood-formula fantasy, as it is somehow well done."

","After watching this film for the millionth time about 10 minutes ago I have to say this is easily one of the best films I've seen. We can go on all day about the best films ever made, but it's rare to find a film like Braveheart today.<br/><br/>This film is not the most factual piece in existence, I would consider it fiction based on fact. William Wallace existed as did Longshanks, and England did invade Scotland, however some characters are obviously fiction, a lot of what happens is fiction and I would like to think of it as fiction for film. Being honest this film was made primarily for film-making and money, not historical accuracy, and there is nothing wrong with that due to the film being excellent in my own opinion. The battle scenes are well done with little flaws (continuity errors happen in every film, not just braveheart), it's stuck to the ""rules"" of film making for the most part and the camera work and angles come across sometimes as stunning, along with the scenery, great acting, scripting, and emotion put into the music and story itself it's a recipe for a great film.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend seeing this film to anyone that hasn't, if you haven't, why not? This is easily one of the best war/sword films that has been made and is definitely work a watch, however it is quite long, and at some parts slow. It personally took me a few watches to realise how Wallace thinks, and how he has known certain information he shouldn't know, but I won't spoil it for you and urge you to watch the film to understand.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","i am English and i have pride in being English. i have read many reviews of 'Braveheart' in my country that have criticised this film for all sorts of crazy reasons and i know it all really comes down to these people taking offence from the film and the slaughtering of the English in it. i love my country as much as the next Englishman but i feel that the content of the film and the side that American Mel Gibson has chosen are both taken far too personally by English reviewers and they should admit that this really is one of the greatest films ever, even though they may not like the fact that their country has been beaten...LONG LIVE THE SCOTS!"
"wilfy914","10","1","2","25 February 2006"," God gave birth to this movie
","This outstanding piece of work from Mel Gibson makes it the best epic film ever. Stands next to ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Gladiator"". Braveheart is truly an epic masterpiece, the storyline, the acting, the directing is superb.<br/><br/>William Wallis is a Scottish rebel who plans to take over England. After the death of his father who was trying to bring freedom to the Scots. Wallis takes on the cruel greedy tyrant English King Edward the Long shank played by Patrick Mcgoohan. Filled with bloody battle scenes, one of the best is the first major battle when the Scots takes on the invaders.<br/><br/>Braveheart gives one of the best one-liner ever, towards the end when Wallis is about to be executed, Wallis screams out ""Freedom!!!!"" this gave me goose bumps all down my arm.<br/><br/>For Gibson's directorial debut, he wins six academy awards including Best Picture and Best Director, in which Gibson deserves for this epic masterpiece."
"cytomegalovirus","8","1","2","10 December 2005"," Best Picture, indeed - but...
","Braveheart, one of the most influential movies of the 90s has certainly deserved its Best Picture Oscar: an amazing travel through Scotland. This travel certainly gives a valid reason for Braveheart to be in the IMDb top 250. For non-native English people, be sure to watch the movie in its original version, the accents are worth. The soundtrack is certainly deserved its nomination to the Oscars: the bagpipes are in harmony with the Scottish background. Costumes were finely chosen: from the Scottish aristocracy, to the court of England passing by the Scottish populate. A long movie where the director takes its audience attracted - forgetting the length.<br/><br/>Why not voting for a 10 then? Several reasons. First, I didn't believe Mel Gibson as a leader. His smile is too naive and his play sometimes too comic. Nothing to say about the acting of others, they made a great job. Second point, I think violence is certainly part of the movie but I am not sure it should be reflected like that. I am personally internally hurt by seeing the combat field at the end with all corpses lying on the ground but I am shocked by seeing someone cutting the throat in front of the camera. I am not sure the purpose of the movie is to shock. The purpose is to hurt people so that they are concerned with the atrocities Scottish people were living at that time. A bath of blood is not necessary. Showing enough so that your mind can imagine it is more subtle. I am also wondering if it is normal that the weather is so nice in Scottland: too little rain at my taste.<br/><br/>The previous paragraph is probably severe for the movie and remember the first paragraph if you are planning to see that movie: you won't be disappointed."
"dryan3","10","1","2","20 June 2005"," A great story
","This is one of my personal favorites, if not my very favorite. Even though it's very long, I was captivated throughout the entire film. The plot drags you in, the fight scenes are great, and the acting is as good as you'll find. The movie evokes your passion and grabs your emotions.<br/><br/>That being said, I feel sorry for all the ""history buffs"" who are appalled at this movie and cannot appreciate it for what it is. It's just a story. But instead they rail on it for historical Inaccuracies and label Mel Gibson as a racist. I'm not sure if that means that all war films are meant to be racist or something along those lines, but not all historical movies are meant to be history channel specials. A movie is made for entertainment, and it shouldn't be a huge deal if history is tweaked a tad. If the movie really grabs someone and makes then want to know more about the story, that's the history channel's cue.<br/><br/>So give this film a chance to entertain you and appreciate the story for what it is: a story. Enjoy."
"benwest464","9","1","2","9 June 2005"," Certainly worthy of its Oscar
","Two things stand out for me in this film. Firstly, the battle scenes. They are beautiful- well, as beautiful as a medieval era, gore filled epic can possibly be. What seems particularly realistic is the scene where the English Heavy Cavalry charge into the Scottish phalanx. The paradox to this are the moments when the film has been speeded-up in post production- the sight of the kilted Scots charging at speeds beyond human capabilities is one of the daftest moments of the film. Secondly, English King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan) is correctly depicted as utterly ruthless, and McGoohan is perfect for the role. Despite the fact the monarch is the films villain- who allowed local Lords to become bedfellows of newlywed women apparently- I cannot help but admire King Edward. His pre-Falkirk line saying ""Not the archers...arrows cost money. Use up the Irish: the dead cost nothing"" sums up this brilliant character perfectly. Hats off to the writers for that one. Overall, despite the bagpipe centred score, this is a film worthy of its Oscar."

"fritzygirl83","10","1","2","23 February 2005"," Mel Gibson the actor/director
","Mel Gibson thought of everything in this movie. The acting, the location, the plot, the music, everything meshes so perfectly. Although it's extremely long, and unforgivingly gory, Braveheart is definitely one of masterpieces of the last twenty years. It proved that there was more to Gibson than a stellar actor. The little known actors in supporting roles were all superb and intense in what could have easily become a bore of a movie. What makes this film so great is it's attention to detail, and to the many facets of William Wallace. Instead of meerly being a battle movie it was a love story as well, which sustained throughout the entire film. Thank you Mel!"
"jjo999","9","1","2","10 February 2005"," Oustanding acting and
","This is a wonderful movie to watch again and again. It has a plot that is interesting to follow, and the action is intense and believable. Mel Gibson displays his romantic and heroic side in a way that really touches me. He is truly talented and is very remarkable in this film. The entire supporting cast really brings a lot of belief into the movie as well. One aspect of the movie that held my interest is how we are able to see William's character as an innocent child and as a grown man whose fate becomes that of a hero. This is a widely viewed movie, but if you haven't seen it yet, I encourage you to check it out and see if it appeals to your taste. It's serious, emotional, and powerful!"

"Preston8907","10","1","2","26 October 2004"," Wow, This movie rules
","The first time I saw this movie, i was about 7 or 8 when my parents bought it on video. I watched it, and didn't really understand any of it, because I was too young. I've seen the movie about 30 times in the past 2 years, and I see something different every time I watch it. It might be something in the scenery, or I might just not remember. It is amazing. I wish more movies like this would be produced. The battle scenes were exciting, the storyline was fantastic, and throughout this three hour movie, there was never a point of which I was bored. The only thing that I can say that is negative about this movie is that it could've been made into a 2, 2 1/2 hour movie. Mel Gibson stretches scenes out that don't need to be stretched out, and there is always a long pause between people talking, but I guess he just wanted to movie to look more majestic, or something. But, it is still an AWESOME movie!"
"Macadamian-Nut","9","1","2","18 October 2004"," A fantastic movie for anyone who doesn't mind violence (Possible Spoilers)
","This movie is spectacular and leaves the viewer a lot to think about. There is no specific good guy or bad guy in this story. Each character is well-developed and always has something good about them. Just as they have some problems, as well. <br/><br/>The story is about William Wallace, a man who had a rough childhood, and has come back to his village in Scotland to make a farm. He doesn't want anything to do with the war that the king of England does. When he returns, he falls in love with a woman, and they get married, hoping to settle down together. But after a tragedy, William goes mad and creates one of the biggest revolutions Scotland has ever seen. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson both directed and starred in this movie, and he proves that he is good both on and off-screen. The character of William Wallace is so dimensional, and is not as easy to like as characters in other films. He does some very unmoral things throughout the film, such as sleeping with another woman even though he claims to be in love with his late wife.<br/><br/>A lot of people complain about the fact that the movie doesn't follow the true story. I can't say anything about that, as I don't know the true history. All I know is that this movie is done extremely well, and is very enjoyable.<br/><br/>In all, I recommend this movie to anyone who won't compare this to the real story, and who doesn't mind violence, because there's a lot of it.<br/><br/>Braveheart, Directed by Mel Gibson 9/10"
"mOVIemAN56","10","1","2","3 October 2004"," Inaccurate but Excellent
","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>Braveheart. An outstanding film. This movie is based on actual events that occurred during the 12 and 13 hundreds. The main character is William Wallace, a man raised by his preacher uncle, and played by Mel Gibson. Wallace when we see him as a soldier is inspiring to the Scottish rebels at Sterling and at York and he was. Mel Gibson gave an outstanding performance as Wallace and a great performance by Patrick McGoohan as King Edward I.<br/><br/>Now the downsides to me. William Wallace, though a protector of Scotland became ruthless after his invasion of England. It was said by a soldier that he spared man nor woman; monk nor nun. Also Longshanks (King Edward I) is made out to be a terrible king who murders at his own will, when in fact he cared lovingly for his people and his soldiers. And in fact at Falkirk as many as ten thousand Scots were killed before hand to hand combat began.<br/><br/>Still the movie was amazing. An amazing score, directing (done by Gibson), and acting. There are more fine acting jobs in it than I have ever seen. It in fact deserved its Oscars. It was fine movie all around.<br/><br/>Braveheart. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, Angus Macfayden and Breendan Gleeson. 4 1/2 out of 5 Stars."
"jock_ryan2000","9","1","2","3 August 2004"," With out a doubt a amazing film, even if it's not accurate
","Braveheart was released in 1995 and won Best Picture. It is the story of William Wallace and his battle for the freedom of Scotland. The story is brilliantly told and has some magnificent battle scenes.The feeling you get when Wallace gets revenge on the person who took the life of someone dear to him, is phenomenal and there are moments like these all throughout the film. The scenery is absolutely brilliant and there is a decent enough score to go along with it. The movie is not entirely accurate however and leaves some important details out though it does not take away from the enjoyment of the film, unless of course accuracy in movies really matters to you. So overall it is a very decent film worthy of its title of Best Picture and a very good movie from Mel Gibson who also directed the recent ""The Passion of the Christ"". A must see."
"stickysweet07","9","1","2","25 July 2004"," One of the best!
","This movie is actually one of my top five favorite's because it makes me so happy and sad as well. It's just one of those films that you end up putting in your collection and watching over and over again. Not only did this movie give Mel Gibson a real spotlight but the movie itself is still in a spotlight. It still continues to be many viewer's favorites and I am personally one of them. Humor, sadness, anger, and sometimes even twists are just parts of this movie that you will love. This is also partly true because William Wallace really was a real leader. This movie shows him in a beautiful story that brings a family together. On top of everything that this movie is, it has a tremendous love story to keep you dreaming about. None-the-less, this film is one of my most recommended movies ever!"
"WonderBro","10","1","2","31 May 2004"," commenting on Leondr's post
","I don't think it is a good idea to compare ""Braveheart"" with ""Return of the king"". These movies are way too different. If we speak about the battle scenes in ""BH"" the battle scenes were filmed with actual actors, while in ""LOTR ROTK"" they were extremely well modelled. And for me it is a huge difference. The same thing is with recent ""Troy"" movie - yes, the battle scenes look good, but you cannot feel them. When you watch ""LOTR"" or ""Troy"" you are more likely to say ""Wow!"" than ""Oh my God!"". And I think there is nothing fascinating about the battle scenes. People die there. In BH you have a very strong feeling of being in the middle of the real battle and not inside of the PC game."
"CitizenCaine","9","1","2","21 April 2004"," Gibson's Braveheart: A Valiant Film
","Mel Gibson's second directorial effort is a very good one, but stops just short of greatness. It's the story of William Wallace, a Scottish hero, who fought for Scotland's freedom from England's rule early in the 14th century. The film reveals Wallace as a simple man turned romantic/idealist in a time when there were too few of them to count. Some have taken issue with the story of William Wallace according to Mel Gibson. However, it's clear, and the film makes this known, that we really know very little about the real William Wallace. Therefore, the film is a fictionalization of his life. The film takes a while to build from Wallace's days as a child until the adult (Gibson). There's one real touching scene with Wallace being consoled as a child. When Gibson appears on the scene, the film really picks up. He plays Wallace as an intelligent, intense man, who becomes a leader of men by necessity in order to fight for his country's freedom. There's action in the form of bloody, brutal battle scenes. We see a variety of weaponry from the era, some may not be. Several of the close-ups we see in battle seem designed to shock us rather than to propel the story or illustrate character, with the exception of those clips we see of Gibson hacking away.<br/><br/>Indeed, heads, hands, legs, and disembowelments pervade the screen. We get the message that fighting in those days must have been gruesome. The lovely Catherine McCormack is Gibson's childhood love interest, who inspires strength in Gibson throughout his life. Brendan Gleeson, James Cosmo, and David O'Hara play Gibson's cohorts in fighting for freedom. Their performances are all rather good, and they're well drawn characters. Angus McFadyen aptly portrays the troubled Scottish noble, Robert the Bruce, as a man faced with competing loyalties to his father, the other nobles, and Wallace. His conflicting thoughts demonstrate just how hard it is for any political figurehead to please everyone. Patrick McGoohan is evil incarnate as Edward I, the English King. Sophie Marceau is very good as the princess with divided loyalties as well. Peter Henly is the foppish unmanly son of Edward I, who is unable to meet his royal responsibilities in more ways than one. The film has a few lulls in it, and after a while, it seems like there's a huge battle scene every fifteen minutes. McGoohan, as the English King, is entirely believable and fantastic, and he is one of the main reasons the film is so compelling. It always helps when both hero and villain are equally well cast, have great dialog, and demand attention for every scene they are in. Randall Wallace gets credit for the great screenplay. The cinematography won an Oscar for John Toll, who also won for Legends Of The Fall the year before. James Horner's sweeping, majestic, musical score is simply sublime. Gibson won Oscars for best direction and best picture. ***1/2 of 4 stars."

"utherson","10","1","2","6 April 2004"," in this viewers eyes, the greatest film ever done.....
","I won't try to build up hype on this film, or embellish anything, but in this viewers eyes, this film is without a doubt, the best picture I have ever seen. Seems like a strong statement, and for a person who has never seen the film there must be some skepticism, but here's how I back up my statement: the main point that stuck out to me was the dialogue. This is a three hour epic, that had a lot of poignant, and pivotal moments in it, but you are left with these wonderful, and heart felt phrases that will echo in your mind forever.......I won't spit out every notable phrase, but they are so powerful and moving, that it's hard not to feel compelled for William Wallace, among others.<br/><br/>The second reason, are the costumes used, as well as the sets. Everything looked so authentic and realistic, that the viewer was given a sense of looking into the middle ages through a television screen. Even though during the time Kilts weren't worn by the Scottes, the uniforms were striking, almost gritty, or dirty. Other films of this genre try and push the realm of what's real, with flash and moxy. Simplicity was the look for ""Braveheart,"" and it never got boring.<br/><br/>I mentioned early that this film was three hours, but felt much shorter, this was because there was not a wasted moment in the film. Whether it be to introduce a character, set up a character, or show a flashback, the viewer is in awe the entire time.<br/><br/>If the story, dialogue, and costumes aren't enough to draw you in, the battles will. Every guy wants blood, gore, and a full out maiming and ravaging scene in a film. This film offers plenty of battles with the use of gore that before it's time, were rarely seen in a mainstream film. This picture is gritty, and real to it's core. The battles will draw you in, they'll make you check your body parts to make sure they're still intact. Not only do you squirm during the graphic scenes, but you feel yourself wanting more.<br/><br/>Not only is the whole picture captivating, but the final act, the trial/imprisonment/and execution will get a rise out of even the most lifeless of viewer.<br/><br/>I really dislike writing reviews, especially for films I feel so passionate about because I doubt I do them the justice they deserve, but from one movie lover to the next, ""Braveheart"" is the ultimate picture, nothing more needs to be said."
"springspringsparrow-1","10","1","2","13 March 2004"," Great
","If you look past the blood and gore, there is a great movie underneath (although, for some, the blood and gore is everything) it.  The true meaning of ""Braveheart"" is freedom-- and freedom is a true necessity for life. Mel Gibson does a wonderful job portraying mid-evil war, punishment, and passion.  The movie has a great number of fairly-famous people throughout the entire 3 hours.  Arygle, played by Brian Cox, has been made famous for this movie.  And many other people, some turning out to be no-names and others becoming famous from this movie.  Moreover, this movie has great cast, storyline and setting.  It will go down as the ""Godfather"" of the 1990s.  This is a must see for any historical-fiction buffs."

The story of William Wallace and how his legacy rallied the Scots to fight for and earn their freedom is very gripping.  While the movie is about 3 hours long (and I had the luxury of a pause button), this is one of those movies where you don't want to get out of your seat until it's over (Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King is another).  I would definitely recommend this movie and I would also recommend looking for more about William Wallace."

The battle scenes are intense, the comic relief is actually very funny, the characters are sharply drawn, and it packs an emotional wallop that few films can equal. This is the kind of movie that makes you remember why you go to the movies.<br/><br/>From the opening shot through the mountains of Scotland, to the tear-jerking shot of Wallace's sword flying through the air, the movie is a triumph from beginning to end. If you haven't seen this film, you are doing yourself a disservice. Go out and rent it, turn the lights off, and enjoy Mel Gibson's masterpiece.<br/><br/> 10 out of 10"
"Machival","10","1","2","22 November 2003"," One of my all time favorites
","There are some movies that stand the test of time and can be truly considered ""all time greats"". I believe Braveheart is one such movie. I've watched it numerous time and it never fails to captivate me. The beautiful landscapes, breathtaking cinematography, well choreographed battle sequences, and inspiring dialogue all combine for maximum dramatic impact. These are the things that keep me coming back to Braveheart.<br/><br/>Braveheart is, above all else, a movie about the human spirit. It's about a commoner named William Wallace, who's father and brother are killed in an attempt to stop English oppression. He is then raised by his uncle, who is a great warrior, and learns how to use the sword. After many years have passed, he returns to his boyhood village to raise a family and live a peaceful life as a farmer. But he soon finds that without freedom, no such dream of peace will ever be. Tragedy ensues and the epic struggle is set into motion.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is superbly done. Mel Gibson (who is probably more well known for his high-adrenaline action films such as the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon series), is good in the role of William Wallace. He shows a range of emotion and especially nails the more light-hearted comedic expressions. He is also a heart-stealing romancer, an aggressive and somewhat barbaric warrior, and a clever and compassionate leader. Patrick McGoohan plays a deliciously sinister King Edward Longshanks. His is probably the most captivating performance in this whole film, for there's something about the way he speaks that makes you unwillingly lean back in fear. Angus MacFadyen plays a torn and easily persuaded Robert the Bruce. His performance is nothing short of incredible, especially the scenes between him and his father. The dynamic between Robert and William is one of the characterization high-points of the film.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are excellent, and definitely one of the high points of the film. The battles are extremely large scale affairs with hundreds of extras clashing with each other on large fields. The editing and sound work so well in these sequences, they make the battles a complete experience that looks and sounds quite realistic. One of the best parts is the build up to the actual battle, the music (drums) and shots used for the charging armies before they clash always have me on the edge of my seat. I believe these are what makes Braveheart a complete and exciting experience.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a mainstay in epic war movies. I honestly believe it's a mainstay in modern cinema altogether. There's something about it that holds me spellbound every single time I watch it. Maybe it's the beautiful scenery, the beautiful score, the amazing cinematography, the superb acting, the riveting action, or all of these combined. All I know is that Braveheart has so much to offer it's hard to be disappointed."

","Sure there are alot of good ones out there. But i could hop on The Godfather bad wagon or develope a taste that means something. Look at the acting of Mel Gibson in Braveheart it clearly takes alot more acting skill to pull off what he did. I've watched this movie time and time again and it still. Pulls my heart every which way when i watch it. The ups and downs in this film clearly make it one of the best. It's hard to claim a #1 favorite but i may as well take Braveheart. Sure if i could have 10 #1's i would becasue if we all thought about it. We have a handful or 2 of ligit favorites."
"Ricardo_Aparicio","Null","1","2","2 August 2003"," Why is this movie so revered?
","Although this is an enjoyable movie, I have to take issue with everyone who feels that this is one of the short list, all time greats. This movie forces the viewer to root for the Scots. There is no reason for a decent person to take any other side. To me, a great film presents an accurate account (or, as accurate as possible account) of both sides motivations in a conflict. I suppose ONLY the British soldiers committed atrocities. I suppose ONLY the British soldiers had no descent, civil, sympathetic human beings in their ranks. I suppose, by watching this movie, that the British are a bunch of evil, ruthless b*****ds and that the Scots are 100% good and right. Like I said, a decent, enjoyable movie. Not a great one."
"Isolation","Null","1","2","23 May 2003"," A good movie, but very fictional.
","Braveheart was one of the better films of the year it was released, mostly due to its well thought out story, the good character portrayals, and its rather graphic and stunning action sequences.  However, while this movie was a very well told story, it is a story none the less. To consider this a true story would be a mistake, as it is rather historically flawed in its portrayal of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce.  Historically, Robert the Bruce led the Scottish armies of independence from nearly the beginning, while Wallace was more of a romantic figure, that never really led any major battles. But much like other historical dramas (Gladiator springs to mind) some willing suspension of disbelief is always a pre-requisite to actually enjoying the film.  If you're a major history buff and just can't get over the historical inaccuracies, then this isn't the film for you.  For the rest of you though, I recommend this movie thoroughly."
"stevetseitz","10","1","2","1 February 2003"," A truly Magnificent and Epic motion picture
","Top notch in all categories, Braveheart is a level above most films. Themes of love, death, freedom, regret, self-sacrifice and manhood are addressed in this masterwork. I was so surprised (and thankful)that the Academy recognized this movie with it's highest award that at the time, I nearly fell off my seat! The cinematography by John Toll, the music by James Horner and the direction and acting by Mel Gibson couldn't be any better. Beyond being a great ""movie"", the true story of William Wallace upon which the film is based is also incredibly moving. It's possible to see our distant relatives fighting in this cause or similar ones."
"rtcpenguin","10","1","2","12 December 2002"," A Glorious Epic Unsurpassed By Any Other Film
","First off, let's get one thing straight. Braveheart is based purely on legend and folklore. Historical documents were rarely kept during the lifespan of William Wallace and few (if any) survive to this day. Many critics have bashed `Braveheart' for its inaccuracies, but nowhere in the film does it claim to be a documentary. `Braveheart' is simply a marvelous movie. From its sweeping battle scenes to its romantic, intertwining love scenes, everything is perfect. The acting throughout is superb, and the action sequences stunning. Randal Wallace's script is matched only by so-called movie classics such as `Citizen Kane' and `The Godfather'. There is no better a speech in any movie than Wallace's own `I Am William Wallace' speech, and no more poignant a movie moment than during Wallace's disemboweling (with the visions of his wife). Leonard Maltin said it best with `a passionate film about a passionate man'. `Braveheart' may not be the `best' movie of all time, but it is certainly is my, and many other's, favorite.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

Braveheart is timeless in it's message: courage and sacrifice are the ingredients of true freedom.  The message and drama of this movie grab you from the start and don't let you go.  3 hours long and not one wasted minute.  Truly inspirational.  Best of all, I'm told most of it is based on the true life story of William Wallace.  The stuff of this movie is what makes America great: faith, courage, and the willingness to fight for what's right and for freedom.  A welcome reminder for us, especially in this day and age.

Braveheart has some powerful scenes and acting to offer with an action packed script.<br/><br/>So, why did I try to dislike it.  Yup, you guessed it - historically inaccurate, if fact so far from the truth only the names of the main characters appear to be correct.  Are modern movie-goers incapable of digesting historically accurate films.  Apparently so if U-571 and Pearl Harbour are anything to go by.  Perhaps a British film should be made set during the American War Of Independence where the British win, then when the complaints role in claim it's only a film, what are u getting worked up about?<br/><br/>Second beef is good ol Mel shouting 'freedom' at every opportunity, the execution scene is completely ruined by a well sliced and diced William Wallace screaming freedom at the top of his voice.<br/><br/>To sum up, rollicking good action, shame about the typically Hollywood take on historical events.

The war scenes are amazing. Not for the squeamish. There is a lot of blood and gore and you do see a lot of people being stabbed and killed all over the place. But this movie is all about war so that's what you've got to expect. This won best picture in 1995 and I can see why.

"koenrogge","9","1","2","18 June 2002"," Magnificent epos
","I've seen Rob Roy a couple of days ago.  With a thrill of expectation I made myself comfortable in front of my tv, expecting the same experience that Braveheart delivered me.  What a letdown it was,though, what a sheer waste of time. This made me wonder again what exactly it is that makes Braveheart such an astonishing masterpiece (instead of Rob Roy's mediocre and Hollywoodized crap).  I mean, both movies deal with strong-headed lead characters,Scottish Men with capital M that live their live by their honour and their pursuit of freedom, right?<br/><br/>That is the only parallel that can be drawn between the two movies, however. In its passion, in its greatness, in its music score, in its cinematography, in just about √©verything, it stands lightyears above Rob Roy.  One single look between Mel Gibson and Catherine McCormack contains more electricity then all the scenes of Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange together.  One moment of silence between Braveheart and the Bruce says more then fourty dialogues between MCunningham and McGregor dragging on and on and on.<br/><br/>It's of course the combination that makes Braveheart such a powerful movie, the combination of elements that are piece by piece masterful:  the thrilling screenplay, the breathtaking images and the unsurpassed emotions. Braveheart has this raw honesty over it which Rob Roy is desperately striving for, but never even close to.  For example the action scenes:  in Braveheart the spectator is in the very midst of the fights, understanding how a r√©al battle looked like: arms being chopped off, swords driven through bodies and blood flying around.  In Rob roy, the fights seem to come straight out of a fencing school.  So clean and correct brrr.<br/><br/>I can only say this now:  long live Braveheart!"
"alba-5","10","1","2","20 July 1999"," simply the best
","I am bewildered. It's been quite a while now that I've seen Braveheart, I'm not quite sure how long....maybe 6 months. Tonight I was all alone at home and I suddenly had the urge to see this awe-inspiring work of art again. I got all set for the film, put in the tape, got a beer, pizza was nice and hot, then I pressed ""play"" on my vcr......it's hard to explain this feeling that came over me......""I shall tell you of William Wallace..."", but all you Wallace/Braveheart fans know what I'm talking about...I was like mesmerized throughout the entire film, although I knew nearly every line, each frame, I've heard Horner's soundtrack countless times ever since the Summer of '95......there's some kind of undefinable magic in this film (I wish I could use another word than just ""film"" or ""movie"", I find these terms not appropriate). Of course, needless to say, no other picture ever moved me to such an extent as Braveheart did and still does......and it doesn't seem to let go......before Braveheart I had various so called favorite movies, like star wars, ET, Raider of the lost arc....they were all indeed very nice, very entertaining, humorous, and warm movies, but in no way can they live up to Braveheart, 177minutes of love, hate, passion, anguish, despair, humor, hope, pride........you name it. Maybe this is the secret magic of Braveheart: it grips you by the heart, doesn't let go, takes you on a 3hour emotional rollercoaster ride, never giving you a break, taking you to extreme highs and in the next minute you simply feel you're going to die of sorrow. Of all the times I've seen Braveheart, tonight, I think was the first time I saw it in complete privacy, the phone didn't even ring! It's amazing, I'm a 32 year old guy, not the macho type, but it does take quite a bit for me to cry...but in specific scenes tears did escape my eyes: Hamish's dad passing away........the part where the princess tries to persuay William to beg for mercy..........the realization that strikes William like a hammer when he sees robert the bruce when he tears of his helmet after the falkirk battle............when the bruce feels like pure s**t (forgive me) wandering along the corpses at the blood-soaked Falkirk field, realizing what he had just done...........and , of course, William's FREEEEEEDOM.......what more can I say, I'm happy I could share my thoughts with you and I feel when so many different people react to a film in a such similar way, well, it makes me feel good, I mean, it's just a good thing to know that people react so positively, it's kind of a binding experience in a cyber sort of way:-) right, thanks for reading my personal notes."
"Kajisan","9","1","2","14 July 1999"," It's good
","Well, here's one heck of a movie that Mr. Gibson's given to us all.  It should especially appeal to anyone in a lousy job who dreams of revolting against daily oppression.  You'll probably leave the theatre thinking your life will never be the same... but let's face it, it's only a movie and you'll be back to playing ""Metal Gear Solid"" in a day and thinking maybe someday you'll get to that script you've always wanted to write.<br/><br/>Still, it's a damn good movie.

This movie definitely deserved the Oscars it won. Unlike some other movies that are three hours long, this one keeps your attention all the way through."
"Coxer99","9","1","2","1 June 1999"," Braveheart
","Engaging motion picture with Gibson brilliantly portraying William Wallace, a man simply in search of freedom; for himself and for Scotland. The film is his moving story, a battle for that freedom. It won Oscars for Cinematography, Director Gibson and Picture. Aside from Gibson, the film also features wonderful support from Marceau, Mc Goohan and McFayden, excellent as Robert the Bruce. James Horner provided a lively musical score. The battle scenes in the film are in the class of Spartacus, Barry Lyndon, Glory... One of the finest!"
"cutter-12","8","1","2","24 May 1999"," The end justifies the means
","Spartacus probably will for all time be the definitive epic film about Martyrdom and the fight for freedom against oppression.  It manages to succeed better than Braveheart because it depicted a hero on which less than a page of recorded history is known.  Therefore the story doesn't leave itself open for historical inaccuracies and, with traditional hollywood elements, weaves together a tale of a man fighting against all odds for the two things that should matter most -- love and freedom.  It also explores fascinating subplots to do with the corruption of power, the politics of ancient Rome and the meaning of loyalty which elevates the picture far higher than just an old Gladiator movie.<br/><br/>Braveheart, by aspiring to tell the story of a legendary martyr and hero, falls into the Hollywood trap of how much is fact and how much is fiction.  The film is visually authentic but enough is known about Wallace to expose the several liberties the screenwriter and producers took with history.  Some can be excused of course because of time constraints but others cannot be quite so forgiven.  The omission of Stirling bridge is a strange decision but it is the contrived devices of pitting Wallace against the Queen romantically (and having her whisper to Long Shanks on his death bed she conceived Wallace's child) and the depiction of Robert the Bruce as an indecisive young nobleman getting counsel from his leper father (one almost expects the old man to say ""the Dark side of the Force has many advantages my son."") and selling out Wallace on the battlefield only to see the light and take up wallace's struggle in the end, that are undeniably contrived and foolish.  Other things such as the obligatory inclusion of an Irishman in Wallace's band to give the film contemporary pertinence and the scene where Wallace goes on a Rambo revenge quest against the Scottish lords who betrayed him in battle further discredit the film as an accurate document. The scene where he bursts into that bedchamber at night on horseback and escapes through the window was old fashioned Hollywood daring do better left to Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power.  In this film it is just unbelievable.<br/><br/>As a history lesson Braveheart falls woefully short, and so too as an examination of Wallace himself and his politics.  But does this mean the film is ineffective and bad?  Absolutely not.<br/><br/>Braveheart packs an extraordinary amount of emotion into the story and succeeds in getting it's ultimate message across without question.  Although a romanticised account it nevertheless has moments of sheer power.  I dare anyone to deny they remained unmoved when wallace is drawn and quartered at the end and sees the vision of his dead wife walking amongst the crowd of onlookers before he carries out his final cry of freedom.  Manipulative?  Of course.  And needed to bring the story full circle.<br/><br/>Technically, Mel went a little overboard with the slow motion sequences, which seem to add about ten minutes to the overall running time, and the film on a whole could have been cut by at least a half hour.  The Battle scenes are incredible and the best ever shot as far as realism.  Mel's performance, incidental as was John Wayne's when he was directing The Alamo, is quite good, though possibly a little too gentlemanly and clean cut at times for such a savage warrior.<br/><br/>Braveheart is not a great film, but it is recommended as a stirring cinematic experience.  The fact that it rewrites history is not as important as it's final outcome.  How ever Wallace got to his final torture and execution, he got there because he fought for the freedom of Scotland."
"Brownie-2","Null","1","2","7 May 1999"," A true epic.
","One of my favorite movies of all time. It's amazing how Mel Gibson has been able to grab a virtually unknown Legend and bring it to the silver screen with sparkling intensity and passion,and not like a snooze-o-rama history lesson.<br/><br/>A great story with fantastic acting and the most realistic battle scenes I have ever seen,(you almost feel a sword swing over your head and chopping a guy to bits behind you.)<br/><br/>A must see for anyone that loves great stories of human triumph."
"Mr. Epic","Null","1","2","16 April 1999"," A film that will inspire for generations to come!
","I was totally oblivious to what this movie was about because it came out at a time in my life where I did not see many films.  When I rented it from my neighborhood video store I had no idea what to expect other than the fact that it was a multiple Oscar winner (which doesn't mean a thing sometimes) and I was completely ignorant about the history behind the Scottish legend. After the opening 10 minutes which includes the young William Wallace stumbling upon a collection of innocent men, women, and children hanging by their necks and losing his father in a valiant fight against the oppressors, I felt emotions that I hadn't felt in years after watching a motion picture, but I did not feel manipulated or insulted in the process.<br/><br/>I was simply dazzled for almost three hours as I viewed the beautiful cinematography, the brutal battle scenes, the tragic scenes of oppression bestowed upon the Scottish people, the amazing chemistry of the cast, and the interwoven love story between Wallace and Murron.  The score was as appropriate and compelling as any that I've ever heard (I still hear both the triumphant and sad/soul-stirring music in my head at times). The performances by each actor/actress are all outstanding especially Angus McFayden who played Robert the Bruce, Patrick McGoohan as (the purely evil) King Edward I, and David O'Hara as Stephen.<br/><br/>Braveheart is an authentic film that captures the spirit of a man that fought to free his people from oppression.  Mel Gibson provides wit, courage, audacity, and a slight taste for revenge as William Wallace and does a fantastic job behind the camera too.  Braveheart has the power to inspire the least of us to fight for what we believe is right and demonstrates the power one person's zeal can have on those around them. It is a tale that should be told for many generations to come and I am sure that there will be more versions of William Wallace's life depicted on screen as the years progress.<br/><br/>The only scene which I did not like and thought was too '90's was the scene where the Scottish army led by Wallace mocked the English army by lifting up their kilts and mooning them.  Other than this, Braveheart is perfect.  If you only saw it on television when it aired on NBC then do yourself a favor a get a copy of a more complete version on VHS or DVD.  You'll be glad you did!"
"Haplo-4","8","1","2","6 April 1999"," Extremely well done.
","This is one of the best films I have ever seen - and that is a lot of movies. Even if the script doesn't follow the actual story it is very well done and it has no logical flaws - by the way, I read that the clan Wallace in Scotland also approved of this movie saying that this is the best you can get on such a limited time.<br/><br/>Further more the music written by James Horner - one of the top movie composers - is so perfect that you can almost feel the ""highland spirit"" flowing towards you, especially in the first seen with the camera going over the Scottish-highland and the music makes it all very vivid.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses are all so good that they all deserved an Oscar - but that would bee impossible. Mel Gibson is perfect as William Wallace - even if he in fact isn't as tall as the character he is playing was and his accent isn't perfect - but he acts with all of his body and really puts his heart and soul into the caracter. Patric McGoohan acts with such brutality that one can understand why his character got the nick-name ""hammer of the Scots"" and Sophia Marceau shows her acting qualities.<br/><br/>But even if I think that this is the best movie ever it has some downfalls:<br/><br/>1) I don't approve with the sub-plot about his love affair with Murron and the princess - they are so different to the rest of the movie and therefore they doesn't fit in the movie; they tend to feel a bit greasy and lecturing.<br/><br/>2) I think that some of the historical flaws should have been made in the way they really happened - like the battle at Stirling bridge that actually occurred on a bridge and not on a field as it's done in the movie.<br/><br/>I just have to mention one more actor and that is Brendan Gleeson who makes a humoristic and splendid performance as Hamish - and even if he never did exist the movie wouldn't have been the same without this character."

","This movie encompasses how we all feel when things in our lives do not go right and we want to avenge them. In the hearts of us all is a true spirit of wanting to gain Freedom from any sort of tyranny. William Wallace's life warranted that he become that person to lead the revolt against the evil in history through his wisdom gained from his<br/><br/>Uncle Argyle, the devastation of losing his father at an early age, finding his own true love, and from losing her as well. It made him fight and that is what they all wanted. War is never pretty. But it is necessary to gain victory and the rights of others to be Free. In watching this love story, and fighting for justice, honor and freedom for the Scots to wear their tartans and to overcome the injustices forced on them by this unfair government, one realizes how powerful men with rave hearts can be when they go to raise a standard up against the army of decaying monarchs. I was riveted to my seat. I loved the part where he and his true love became one, I cried with tears of how beautiful it was, so romantic. I cried as I saw her taken from her in a most unfair and cruel way. And I rallied with him as he defeated them in battles and took restitution for the evil deeds they did to the Scots. I was appalled to see how even their own noblemen turned towards the enemy at the beginning of the fights. I saw the real men fight and win against what looked like unbeatable odds. Braveheart is an epic movie with a message. Beware the men that fight for truth, righteousness and freedom, for in them lies the true Brave Hearts. Highly recommended for the whole family."

Where was the bridge at the battle of Stirling bridge?  The british army were cut off when only part of their army had crosed the bridge before the scots slaughtered them.

I REALLY liked the two female roles. I thought Catherine McCormack as Murron was ideal.  She had a very Celtic feel about her, and she is VERY good looking too.  I also liked Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabella.  Sophie is GORGEOUS.  My favorite male actors (besides Mel) HAD to be David O'Hara as Stephen and Brendan Gleeson as Hamish.

"grahamsj3","Null","1","2","19 February 2001"," An epic film
","I have heard some complain about how bloody this film is. Well, folks, this is a war movie, plain and simple and war is bloody. The Gulf War was bloody....you just didn't see it. This film is very real as it depicts how horrible war is. William Wallace was a warrior and warriors make people bleed. Enough about that. The film is magnificent. The facts are somewhat stretched and some artistic license is taken, but the film is a more or less accurate description of life in Scotland at that time. Wallace is the national hero of Scotland to this day and his fight to free the Scots from the English yoke is the stuff of legend. This film attempts to capture the essence of that legend. Never mind that there are some inaccuracies...the film is a work of art. Mel Gibson as Wallace (and director) really shines in this work. Wallace is shown to be a man, one who tried to live quietly and peacefully. However, it was not to be and he and his men ended up fighting the entire English army (and the Scottish Nobles). The battle scenes are indeed bloody (if perhaps a bit too long) and realistic. The story also revolves around the ascention of Robert the Bruce, who eventually became King of Scotland. This is a long and ambitious work and Gibson the actor and director made it work beautifully. The cinematography is truly great, the scenery magnificent and the story undeniably a classic. If you don't own this film, buy it now!"

"jiangliqings","10","1","2","12 January 2001"," One of the best films ever made.
","**** out of ****<br/><br/>Braveheart is a magnificent historical epic, easily the best film of its kind, one that features bloody and brutal battle sequences, but also adds an immense amount of depth, passion, and human interest into the wonderful story.<br/><br/>Taking place in Scotland in the 1300's, Braveheart is the story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a Scotsman who wishes only for peace after the deaths of his father and brother in a rebellion when he was only a boy.  His Uncle Argyle becomes his caretaker, as well as his teacher and mentor.<br/><br/>Wallace eventually returns home to the love of his life, Murron (Catherine McCormack), and marries her in secret, due to the new British law that all newlywed women must be bedded with an English lord. But tragedy ensues, when Murron is killed for assaulting a British officer trying to rape her.<br/><br/>With vengeance and passion for freedom from tyranny in his heart, Wallace stages a rebellion against Edward the Longshanks, the King of England.  He's aided by the help of old friends, countless villagers and highlanders, and the Princess of France, Isabelle (Sophie Marceau), and romance and strong feelings begin to develop between she and Wallace, who continues to fight for Scotland's freedom.<br/><br/>In only his sophomore effort as director, Mel Gibson weaves together a fantastic film, one that is complete in every and works on every level.  The movie is most famous for its bloody battle sequences, which are indeed brutal and perhaps the best of its kind ever filmed.  Despite the brutality, the violence is never glorified in any manner.  War is truly ugly, and bloodshed is always a result.<br/><br/>Braveheart features a stunning cast, mostly of actors whom are unknown, but are very memorable in their roles.  Of course, top acting honors must go to Mel Gibson, whose portrayal of William Wallace is powerful and brilliant (plus, the accent sounds genuine) and the fact that he did not even receive a nomination for his performance goes only further to prove how unfair the Academy can be.  Patrick Mcgoohan is appropriately cold and callous as the King of England, a character whom we truly grow to fear and despise.  Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack, two supremely beautiful and talented actresses, are great in their roles as the women in Wallace's life.  Though McCormack has only a half-hour or so of screen time, her character remains long within you.<br/><br/>On the technical side, everything is marvelously executed.  The cinematography is lush and beautiful, the sets are very convincing, and the musical score from James Horner is perhaps his best ever, a real compliment, considering the fact he also scored Titanic and Glory.<br/><br/>At 177 minutes, Braveheart's pace never lags for one moment, as it always mesmerizes and compels you.  Credit this to the work of so many people (most particularly Gibson), who have put together a cinematic masterpiece.  This is one motion picture experience that is a must for any moviegoer."

It is suddenly thrust upon his self as the love of his life is openly murdered. It just starts from there & in the end, it's his death that really gives the jump start that the Scots need.

"carlgt1","8","1","2","5 November 2000"," A good movie, I think it's overrated.
","Braveheart is a very good movie but I don't think it deserves to be in the ""top 100.""  Historically it's terrible, something Mel continued in ""The Patriot.""  It makes for OK entertainment but anybody getting nationalistic inspiration from this movie should get their head examined.  The English kings are portrayed too ridiculously one-dimensional (total evil) and I'm sure things were a lot more complicated; and the love story/affair is just too absurd.  This is probably the most inaccurate story of Britain since William Shakespeare penned ""Richard III.""  But of course this film is far from being anything the Bard would have done."

","This movie is by far one of my all time favorite movies. Not only does it feature one of the worlds greatest actors, Mel Gibson. But, it sees him directing this epic about William Wallace. And, he won an oscar for it. And, after I bought the DVD version of the film, I was really impressed. Paramount did a good job of putting together the special features on the DVD, including a documentary on the making of the film. I also have to give credit to Randall Wallace, who wrote the script. After discussing the film in film class I realized how complex the script was, just something else to enjoy when watching the movie."

"pitfall_5000","10","1","2","2 September 2000"," Wow
","****Spoliers ahead****<br/><br/>This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.  Sure, some facts are changed for the purpose of the film and maybe it is a bit inaccurate at times, but people, come on.  Look at all the good things that stack up to the bad things.  Mel Gibson is fantastic as William Wallace, and all the acting is great. The characters are colorful and captivating, especially the loony Irish guy. The scenery is breathtaking and the scenes are well shot, every one of them.  And the music......incredible.  Perfect at capturing the mood as well as the audience.  Also, this film brought such emotion to the screen, like never before.  When Wallace is about to be beheaded and cries out ""Freedom!"" .....I get chills every time I see it.  I am not one to cry at movies, but I got teary-eyed then. <br/><br/>   Maybe it is because I am almost 100% Scottish.  Maybe that is why this movie is so touching to me.  I embrace my ancestry with such enthusiasm.....this movie made me even more proud to be Scottish, really. Maybe Britain got the short end of the stick here because they are portrayed as ruthless and, well, the bad guys.  But I sure things like that happened, on both sides here.  So don't pretend to be innocent victims, Brits.<br/><br/>    This deserved every award it got, and some it didn't win.  Don't try to tell me otherwise, because I'll lash out in protest.  I praise this movie with utmost enthusiasm.  I also praise Mel for making it.  Thank you. <br/><br/>    Long live Scotland.<br/><br/>Final Thought:  20 out of 10, the best movie ever."
"stamper","9","1","2","13 August 2000"," Well really someone with a Brave heart
","This film is about a man, William Wallace (whom if you take the time and look for it, can find in an encyclopaedia, although nothing much there is mentioned). He is a man, from Scotland who would have loved to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children, but sees his dream killed of by a brutal Englishman. He then becomes enraged and focuses on bringing freedom to his country by beating the bush ¬ñ robbers, who call themselves English on the head and so chasing them out of his country.<br/><br/>
In this film Wallace though has not got many friends, although he is worshipped and respected by the people, the Scottish nobles are not on his side. They rather got more scraps of land from the Englishmen and see their own folk slaughtered than help. So he is betrayed by his own, called ¬ënobles' and it was then much like it is now. The rich sacrifice the poor, there is fuss amongst men who are supposed to back each other up.<br/><br/>
Now on to the film. This is a truly worthy film of a best director and best film Oscar, cause apart from Se7en and Murder in the First this is the best film of 1995 worthy of an Oscar (not counting action vehicles and sci-fi here, cause they are not going to get an Oscar for best film). The actors are all great, up front of course is Mel Gibson himself as William Wallace but there are other great actors in here. For instance (I believe it was) Tommy Flanagan as the crazy Irishman, Angus MacFayden as Robert the Bruce and of course Sophie Marceau as princess Isabelle. Here I really must compliment the casting director or whoever it was who picked these people. The best thing though about the characters is yet, that you feel for them and with them, especially Mel Gibson of course. This film, it's direction and it's music a few times really brought tears into my eyes and I'm not ashamed to say, that in the end I cried (not what you'd call crying, with sniffing and stuff, but yes, tears rolled and my nose became all runny.<br/><br/>What makes this film such a treat for young and old, is that it contains everything that makes a film worth looking at it for three hours. It contains comedy, romance, revenge, brutal war scenes (which is the only thing you may dislike here), betrayal and a good and basically true story about a freedom fighter in  time in which his homeland was brutally ruled by the British. Ok I know most of the surrounding plot is probably made up, but that's what is so great, uniting a true story with fiction and there is nobody around today, who can tell you how it really was, so let your imagination rule and be not too rational.<br/><br/>What I also liked is that in this film you get the sphere of being in middle age. There are for instance saga's told about Wallace that make him 7 feet tall and say that he slaughters men by the hundred's. Also this film has a great moral it tells us that freedom is one of the most important things in life and that it is not treasured enough by those who have it and don't know what it is like living without it. Also there is something that can be applied to this time also, and that is that everyone dies, but not everybody really lives. These two things ought to be bared in mind by many people on this earth.<br/><br/>
A great feature of Gibson's directing career, although it is only his second and a masterpiece that follows well in the footsteps of the good and underrated The Man without a face. I urge Mel Gibson, to again direct a film and make it at least as good as the past two. I know he will, cause he takes his time on choosing his director projects as you could see, cause Fahrenheit 451 still has not been made until today and is now I presume officially cancelled although it had been planned for about 2 or three years.<br/><br/>

","A very entertaining, well made action film but history is out the door form the beginning: ""They're saying good-bye their own way, playing forbidden music on forbidden instruments"" to the end: The princess telling her dying father-in-law, the king, that she is pregnant with Wallace's child. Actually bagpipes were unknown to the Scots before their introduction by the English and were still unknown to the Highlanders in Wallace's time. King Edward died several years after Wallace and for that matter neither did the princess give birth. There are many other such fallacies throughout.  The great victory of the Scots over the invading English was not in ""open"" battle; the Scottish archers mowed the English troops down as they attempted to cross a narrow river ford on the way to Stirling castle. The Scots never wore blue face paint. That was a practice of the pre-Gaelic Picts who were recorded by the Romans as doing that. Wallace's army never conquered York. The largest English city they took was Carlisle, just 30 miles south of the border."

The point is; ""Who cares""?  I loved this film for its sweeping scenery, its epic battle scenes, and its underlying message of hope and the triumph of the spirit that it represented.  Most treatments of ""larger than life"" figures (Joan of Arc, Field Marshal Montgomery, George Washington, etc.) concentrate on those aspects that make them memorable, often leaving out anything that would lessen their stature.  Think of this as a fiction movie, if it makes you feel better, and just enjoy it for the masterpiece of film making that it is.  ""Braveheart"" was well deserving of the best picture award, along with ""Contact"" it is one of the best films of the decade. I give it five stars, and would highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys epic adventure."

"pieschel","9","1","2","12 July 2000"," Mel Gibson is definitely one of people's favorites!
","Braveheart is probably one of the best war movies to hit the big screen. With winning five academy awards (but it deserved more), its hard not to like. With an excellent performance from Mel Gibson and a unforgettable story, Braveheart is a movie that will not lose its popularity over the years like some other war movie trash like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Thin Red Line"". Although the war scenes don't really show what war was like (instead, they focus on the gore of war), the story line and romances are enough to satisfy most people. Most people will agree that the constant gore was unnecessary but you don't notice this until a few hours after you watch it. But be warned: Mel Gibson saved this movie immensely by directing and starring in it. If he hadn't played William Wallace, the acting would not have gotten good reviews from the media as Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack failed to please. Oh well, at least they didn't appear a lot. So, if you're a fan of war movies and want to be pleased after many nights of grief from other movies of the genre, Braveheart is a movie you will surely want to add to the family collection!"

Based on the struggle that Scotland endured to gain its independence from England in the 1200's, the film focuses on Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace, the leader of those fighting for the right to be free.  As one watches the film, a sense of real appreciation for that which he has was gained without the Scottish struggle.  This is a definite must-see."

The supporting cast is absolutely delightful, from Wallace's lady loves and best friends to the hateful King of England.  The roles are all acted to perfection, making you genuinely care about the characters.<br/><br/>My only real gripe is that the enemy (in this case the english) are not really portrayed as people.

"spinin","9","1","2","8 December 1999"," Oscar worthy, but not the greatest!
","""Braveheart"" is a very impressive war epic, especially since it was directed by Mel Gibson. Before the movie won any oscars, I had no idea that Gibson was capable of such filmmaking. Here, he effectively recreates a legendary story of Scotland's battle for freedom from England.<br/><br/>This three hour picture focuses on the life of William Wallace (Mel Gibson) and his courageous attempts to lead Scotland to victory in the 13th century. A peaceful man by nature, Wallace is driven toward violence after his beloved wife is executed by English soldiers. Having lost his father earlier to the English as well, he is no longer capable of standing aside and allowing the enemy to rule his life. As he coldly and vengefully kills the men responsible for his wife's death, he begins a revolution. Brave men are quick to help him in this battle and desire more. Wallace, unsure of his goals, is eventually persuaded by his men to continue even further. He accepts the role of leader as a classic quest for freedom unfolds.<br/><br/>The cinematography in ""Braveheart"" is excellent, especially during the battle scenes. Some of the most energetic and quite graphic sequences occur during the fighting. Gibson plays Wallace very well. The hero vows never to give up, and often when it appears that all odds are against him, he still manages to overcome them in some way. Cold and determined, Wallace still remains a good person. He will not accept defeat nor will he accept compromise. Along the way he meets the unhappy wife of King Edward's son. Princess Isabelle is played by Sophie Marceau, who I really like and respect now after also seeing her terrific performance in ""The World is Not Enough."" They find beauty in each other and Isabelle is inclined to aid Wallace in his battle.<br/><br/>The acting is superb and the film is very well made. Wallace's heroic will and his endless efforts are evident in Gibson's performance. The story is smart and well written, and the entire outcome is not too obvious. The film could have been even better if a couple of scenes were omitted. For example, during battle, the Scottish raise their kilts one time too many in order to flash the English army. An unnecessary shot of one Scot getting his rear hit with an arrow follows. Also, this film is yet another war epic in a long list fine war movies. It seems that those types of films are too safe and too easy to make. No one will ever hate them. While ""Braveheart"" is probably not better than ""Platoon"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" it is right up there with them. Aside from a couple of sequences I would have liked to see edited out, this movie is terrific. The cinematography creates a story world where there is very little not to like. This movie deserved the oscar it received. Overall a 9 out of 10."

"hollis56","7","1","2","12 September 1999"," An excellent movie, but a bit of a fairy tale
","I truly enjoyed this movie, from the direction and realism of the medieval battle scenes, to the cinematography and score. However, for the sake of equal time, please note the following information.<br/><br/>""Edward I might be taken as a pattern of the medieval king. He is remembered on the whole for his achievements rather than by his personality. Tall, strong and handsome in figure, he was magnificently royal in presence, clear and emphatic in speech, forceful and enterprising in action. He was uncertain in temper, but reasonable in council. Above all, he attempted to live by the ideal of Christian knighthood -- devoutly gallant and heroically chivalrous.""<br/><br/>I'm not saying the book I culled this information from is any more accurate -- we are talking about events that took place 700 years ago. But don't take this movie to heart as the whole truth. Examples of history vs. Hollywood:<br/><br/>William Wallace was 19 when his father was killed. He had killed English soldiers before his father's death. The French princess first arrived in England years after Wallace died. Edward I lived years after Wallace's death.<br/><br/>My favorite error/omission was that in the movie the Battle of Stirling Bridge was in an open field without a bridge in sight. The bridge was the key element to Wallace's victory."
"Kensai","9","1","2","28 August 1999"," Amazing!
","Amazing... What else can I say about BRAVEHEART? I lack the words. BRAVEHEART is a fantastic story, with romance, dramatic times, epic and harsh battles.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't strictly follow history, but else BRAVEHEART wouldn't have been what it is...<br/><br/>In my opinion, it's no wonder why it has gained so much awards!"
"Danimal-7","9","1","2","23 August 1999"," Awe-inspiring and uplifting film
","It was a favorite dictum of the late science fiction writer Robert Heinlein that a free man can be killed but never conquered.  This is the guiding idea behind BRAVEHEART, and makes the movie a much truer rendition of Heinlein's thought than either of the two movies putatively based on his works (THE PUPPET MASTERS and STARSHIP TROOPERS).<br/><br/>The story, very loosely based on historical fact, follows the 13th-century figure of William Wallace, native to a Scotland living under English domination.  Wallace tries to ignore the brutality and oppression of the English lords, and is repaid by the loss of his wife, who is murdered for the sole purpose of luring Wallace into English hands.  Concluding that he and his countrymen can only live in peace if they are free of English domination, Wallace leads a revolt against the English king, Edward I ""Longshanks.""  An ensemble of Scottish lords, including the leading candidate for the Scottish throne, make common cause with Wallace, but their loyalty is sometimes questionable.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson gives a robust and sincere performance as Wallace, but it is his direction that truly shines.  His battle scenes are powerful and brutal, pulling no punches, showing the Scots' fight for freedom as a grim and agonizing experience.  The warriors are glorified, but not the war.  But Gibson does not skimp on screen time for the supporting characters, who are rich and varied.  Angus MacFadyen, as would-be king of Scotland Robert the Bruce, paints a fascinating portrait of a tortured man whose conscience weans him away from the cynical political maneuvers his father is teaching him.  Parallel to him is Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabella of France, King Edward's daughter-in-law, who finds Wallace more admirable and appealing than her own family.  Brendan Gleeson portrays Wallace's friend Hamish, an ox of a man with few brains but plenty of guts.  David O'Hara steals every scene he's in with his hilarious, lunatic turn as Wallace's ally Stephen.<br/><br/>BRAVEHEART raises some interesting questions.  How much humiliation and oppression can be tolerated before it becomes worth fighting against?  Is the Scots' struggle for freedom worth the blood and pain that it costs them? How much of what is precious to you can you give up to save your life, before that life ceases to be worth living, or saving?<br/><br/>This movie has been rightly criticized for its lack of historical accuracy. ""Prima nottae"" (actually called ""jus primae noctis"") was never instituted in 13th-century Scotland; the battle of Stirling was fought at a bridge crossing, not an open field; the Scots didn't ""charge the field"" at Bannockburn but stayed wisely on the defensive, etc.  However, the details are not as far off as some would have you believe. King Edward is rightly shown as distracted with his wars with Philip IV in France; his son is correctly portrayed undermining his own leadership by giving cushy jobs to his lovers; the Scottish nobles' subservience to the English throne is realistic; the Scottish reliance on spears against the English cavalry is accurate.  BRAVEHEART is a poor history lesson, but it is no worse than average for Hollywood.<br/><br/>Randall Wallace's script, aside from its historical faults, is tender, warmly humorous, and touching.  John Toll, whose cinematography was nearly the only redeeming feature of THE THIN RED LINE, brings the medieval Scottish landscape magnificently to life.  James Horner provides a beautifully melodious score.<br/><br/>There are few films that generate such respect and admiration for their characters.  Wounded, bleeding, losing their loved ones, and often losing their battles, the Scots symbolized by Wallace refuse to stop laughing, loving, or fighting.  Their story, embroidered with historical falsehoods though it is, is irresistibly compelling.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of ****."

","As a Scot, I could only dread what a diminutive, Australian, action movie star would do to a story about arguably the greatest Scotsman who ever lived.  Fortunately, Mr Gibson showed me a thing or two about film-making and in the process made one of the finest movies I've ever seen. People can argue about the facts of the story and the parts played by the names in the history of Scotland.  What cannot be argued is that Mel Gibson turned in an heroic performance as William Wallace, and his direction helped tell the story with equal parts heart and guts. I have never been more proud to be Scottish than when I left the cinema on the night I saw Braveheart.  That is the highest praise I can give Mel Gibson."

"wutzthedeal","9","2","7","10 December 2012"," Best movie ever made
","My all-time favorite movie; would have given it a 10 if they had shown the Battle of Sterling as it actually happened, which was the English coming across a bridge that was too narrow for them to quickly move an army across and regroup (the Scots jumped on that mistake, charging down the hillside and annihilating that organizational mess).<br/><br/>To truly understand what the meaning of this movie is, you have to look at what it stands for and against. At this period in history, the English were treating the Scots as less-than-human. The Scottish men existed to serve the English cause, the women to comfort them (i.e. slavery and rape were the order of the day). There's no reason to hate England for what was happening--this has happened throughout multiple cultures in the world across the entire time-line, right up to the present. It's about a man, with spirit, appealing to people who believed that humans should be free of forced rule and abuse, and it really is that simple; everything else is a subcategory of that."
"sanreb187","10","2","7","15 May 2011"," A masterpiece among the movies of Mel Gibson
","A Superb Movie... saw it when i was 12 Years old and was blown out by the class of the movie. Wallace is portrayed as a beacon of strength and power, not to mention a much honoured leader.. Mel Gibson is great in the movie.. The scenes in which william wallace's wife is killed and william wallace executed are heart touching. <br/><br/>The War scene are dynamic.. The battle scenes are ground breaking and upfront, the senses of comradeship, love, patriotism and courage all take a stand throughout the film. The music adds further to the epic, be it sad and haunting tunes or strong and stirring bagpiper anthems.Beautiful background music of Bagpiper is pleasant to hear...<br/><br/>Mhairi calvey who play young murron is cute. Sophie marceau is good looking in the movie but not much to do in this flick. Mel is a great director.. a good story teller.. Catherine McCormack is gorgeous.... she is more beautiful in this movie than any other movies she has been in. movie is perfect entertainer.. One of my Favourite movies.<br/><br/>Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who played Lonshanks, should have been nominated for Oscars due to his powerful rendering of evil. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson deserved all the credit he received and more. His portrayal of William Wallace, one of Scotlands most mightiest warriors, was spot on. Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational, hat off to Mel Gibson. I hope he makes a few more movies like this one."
"rkepelwitz","8","2","7","7 December 2010"," Something To Think About
","I've watched this film likely over one hundred times. It would not be an exaggeration to state this. In summation, I would have to say that this is Gibson's best work. The Passion Of The Christ is what he is most well known for but his direction of Braveheart, coupled with his acting brought cinematic history to the forefront of our minds.<br/><br/>I can't help but point out the similarities between WIlliam Wallace and the depiction of Christ. They were both men who died for what they believed in and never broke in the face of persecution. They fought for justice. May we draw the same conclusions about Mel Gibson as a man? Is art imitating life?"
"nicholls_les","9","2","7","9 March 2009"," Wonderful Film
","One of the best films ever made. I know it may not be 100% accurate and I know that what was meant to be Scotland was actually filmed in Ireland but it still has everything a good film should have. All the actors were magnificent even those who did not have big parts. There is Action, Comedy, Romance, Pathos, Beauty, Violence and more. This film leaves you with a distaste for what the English did to the Scots, but also a feel good feeling when the Scots win a battle. When Wallace realises he is betrayed by Robert the Bruce the emotion Mel Gibson portrays really hits home. The ending also was really well done and again hits home. Highly recommended!"
"treadwaywrites","8","2","7","18 January 2009"," Cast Seems Like Thousands
","Braveheart is a film that can be called, in our modern way of story telling on screen, an epic. There are sweeping vistas, castles, teams of horses and loads of people all fighting at the same time. Yep, cool. Mel Gibson doesn't make any long lasting impression as Sir William Wallace, Scottish national hero in his country's fight for independence from English rule in the thirteenth century. But he is still Mel Gibson and this allows him to take a non-fiction based movie and beat the sense out of it when it comes to facts. I have to give Gibson some credit since it was his passion for the role that brought the movie into the sight of Hollywood and it gave Mel the chance to pull off the triple play - act, direct, produce. The film denied Mel is acting award on Oscar night, but the film did win five Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Cinematography, Makeup, and Sound Effects Editing.<br/><br/>If you're a medieval fan, there is a sure bet you'll love this film. From castles and swords to kings and princesses, the film delivers a bit on all levels. Playing Wallace's nemesis in the movie by was of England's King Edward I, known as Longshanks is scene-stealing Patrick McGoohan (""Secret Agent,"" ""The Prisoner""). McGoohan makes Edward the perfect villain, a butcher willing to sacrifice any number of his own men to maintain his power. McGoohan's performance also contributed to making Gibson a villain in the eyes of much of the British movie going public, who felt that along with Gibson's ""The Patriot"" that he must be holding a grudge against them, unfairly giving a bad name to the country and its past. McGoohan's performance is excellent and while arguably award worthy, probably not egging the English on against Gibson all these centuries later.<br/><br/>Braveheart does some twisting and turning and even throws the Princess (Sophie Marceau) into Wallace's arms for sex factor. But in the end we know where this film is headed. Gibson handles his 3 jobs well and in Braveheart turned out a film close enough to fact to look enough like fiction to make a really good film. ***/****.<br/><br/>The posters are fairly the same as the posters of The Patriot in that it seems to just be Gibson with flashes of the background behind him. I'll be glad when the days of the headshot posters are behind us."

This timeless film is a movie about human nature, both good and evil. Braveheart is a story about what a true man can be. It will take you through every emotion that we experience in our lives. It is a story about what's right and wrong, and love. Our words could never express the power of this movie. Mel Gibson, no matter what people have made you think about him, does an astounding performance in the portrayal of a peaceful man who is pushed to his limit by oppression and injustice by a downright nasty government and it's evil cohorts. If you believe in freedom for ALL people, I insist that this is the one movie you should choose to see at least once in your life. I'm sure that this film is banned in countries like Iran, China, and other oppressive countries where tyranny still exists. I'm sure that this film is beyond the comprehension of the masses that continue to live under the heavy hand of tyrants all over the world today.

But the freaking lines across the board suck (actor's spoken lines.) If you're into slash, dash, slash some more dash even more, that really does not 'evolve' in any way, then see it. The photography is beautiful, but is photography enough to justify spending nearly 3 hours on this thing? Whether William Wallace was a great person / warrior you're left to infer that he 'should have been' but that is not on the screen though intended as outcome of the flick - yuck.

","Mel Gibson, who also directs, plays the hero William Wallace, a Scottish patriot who brings a fighting passion into the common man against the tyranny of the English and the bigotry of the Scottish nobleman.<br/><br/>As it turns out, he becomes a brilliant tactician. He designs a new weapon to counter English armored cavalry. He outwits the English by having his army fight in unorthodox pattern, the Scots now are smarter and they fight better with more passion now with Wallace leading. All of this for not in the end because Wallace fails to see betrayal within the eyes of the Scottish noblemen who want nothing more than money and land in exchange for their peace. Seems all too predictable but it sets up half an hour of what the bad side of William Wallace really is if you get on it.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are the best choreographed I have ever seen at the cinema. Watching the fights on the big screen makes so much of a difference. It is stunning, I will tell you that. The story is compelling, for the most part, and it leads you along smoothly which I like. I found the intimacy between Wallace and Isabelle odd and out of place however. Much of what drives Wallace, besides freedom from the English, was anguish from his slain wife. He dreams about her, has visions of her after her death. Why cheat his dreams on another woman? Did he finally give in to the fact he's lost her? If so, that entire piece of Wallace was cut off from the film. Or, maybe they gave in to their feelings to each other. Again, if so, that entire piece was cut off as well. It was too sudden, too quick.<br/><br/>
Nevertheless, Braveheart is an impressive film and easily will rank as one of the greatest stories ever told on film. Beautiful  sets, and well directed. If not for some of the tacky scenes like that romance, it would have been flawless and as close as perfection of a movie as you can get."

","I have read a lot of flak about this movie and how it is historically inaccurate. Like that really matters in Hollywood! In fact, many many parts of this movie accurately portray the stories, myths, legends and historic truth around the true life hero, William Wallace.<br/><br/>Sure we can argue over a good single malt all night over whether the ancient kilt was being worn yet in Scotland in the 13th century when William Wallace returned to Scotland from France in a bid to unite the clans and achieve independence. It really doesn't matter. It's a movie about Scotland, and the ladies demand we wear kilts, it's only fitting.<br/><br/>I accept the director's conflicted portrayal of Robert the Bruce, torn between loyalty to his diseased evil father and the dream of an independent Scotland, and I forgive him his introduction of the French Princess as a love interest, we have to give the lassies something to watch after all.<br/><br/>Most amusing is his use of the diminuative Mel Gibson to play a man who was apparently tall for his generation. William Wallace may well have grown an inch each time his story was re-told, and started out a short man as well. Mel did his best on the accent, and I found it pleasing to the ear, Scottish with a bit'o Aussie, what's the harm?<br/><br/>Did you know some believe Braveheart (William Wallace) may have been the inspiration for Robin Hood? Wallace was skilled in archery as were his men, they wore green camouflage, hid in the woods, and hit the English in commando style raids. Much of their spoils would have been passed on to the dirt-poor Scottish around them.<br/><br/>Those rich Scots, who took English bribes in return for loyalty to the English crown, are the ones who got to write history, and of course they despise the commoner Wallace for his attempt to upset their applecart. They brand him to this day a villain.<br/><br/>But to this commoner Scot, Mel portrayed my mythological hero accurately and true to heart.<br/><br/>May Scotland be one day free of English dominance and re-assert it's true culture!"

","I do not usually enjoy historically accurate period piece movies, but this one really worked for me. Probably had something to do with the fact it was rather violent and had good action scenes. Still, I even liked the parts of the movie that had little action as the ending to this one was rather emotionally powerful. How Mel Gibson did not win an academy award for acting is beyond me as he did just as good a job or even better (in fact I say better) than Russell Crowe would do in the movie ""Gladiator"". Still, he got best director and best picture during the days when he was not crazy (or the days when he hid it better). This film tells the tale of Wallace a man who tried to break Scotland free of English rule back in the days. Why did he begin this crusade, well this is established in a early scene where Wallace's new wife is killed by the British guy in charge of the area. Well William Wallace quickly gets his revenge and soon begins his quest of trying to liberate Scotland from the Brits. You have a couple of rather good action scenes that involve the standard arrow attacks and the charge of two factions. Very well done and there is a bit of humor to this one as well. The movie though is not all action as we get to learn of things about the king who rules England and his son who is married to a very beautiful lady, but for some reason he does not seem to care for her much 'wink'. The final scenes of William Wallace are very emotionally charged and powerful and despite a somewhat sad fate for the main character, the film ends with one final charge. In the end a grand movie that I am always surprised did not make more money than it did as it did not even break the 100 million dollar barrier despite being a very good film."

He puts everything at his disposal into this role and gives perhaps the best performance of his career.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are very realistic. The way Wallace lifts the moral of his countrymen before the Battle of Stirling is truly inspirational.

The scene where Wallace is just about to be executed and he sees his wife's soul is very-very creative and touching and it really makes you cry.<br/><br/>Then in Bannockburn, Robert the Bruce decides to fight rather than accept the endorsement of his crown.

","Say what you will about Mel Gibson as a person, but when it comes to telling a story or acting, he is quite brilliant and immensely talented. Mad Mel has never been better than he was here, both in front and behind the camera. Braveheart is the story of William Wallace, a legendary historical figure for Scotland. The film is not completely historically accurate, but its a film and a great one at that. Braveheart was absolutely deserving of the critical and commercial success it has received. Mel Gibson is on top of his game here in this bloody, brawling epic with excellent storytelling and acting and incredible and very brutal battle scenes that of the likes prior to this have never been captured in this manner on celluloid. For its time, there was nothing else quite like it opening the doors for movies like Gladiator and such. To be movie literate, Braveheart is essential and it holds up really well all these years later."

","Braveheart is a classic film that should be on everyone's ""Must Watch Before I Die"" list. This movie is based on the true story of Sir William Wallace, a Scot who lived in the 13th century and was known to his countrymen as a national hero. Wallace's legacy lives on to this day for leading a successful rebellion that freed Scotland from England's tyrannical hold.<br/><br/>At its core, Braveheart is a commentary on the ideal leader. Among other rulers such as King Longshanks, the prince, and Robert the Bruce, Wallace stands out as the type of leader most anyone would want. While he exemplifies admirable qualities such as strength, courage, and intelligence, what makes him so compelling of a leader is his unequivocal righteousness. He considers freedom to be of the utmost importance and fights to restore the power of the people, even at the cost of his own life.<br/><br/>William Wallace displays this virtue best during a particular battle scene where he comes to the aid of other villagers trying to batter down an English city. Wallace and the rest of the army surround the site as several men crash a battering ram into main entrance of one of England's greatest strongholds. Despite their strength and determination, soldiers defending the base try to stamp out the threat by raining arrows upon the men, every so often piercing a man and ultimately weakening the whole group. While it seems that perhaps the villagers might be able to prevail, the soldiers then pour out a vat of boiling tar onto the men down below and take out nearly half of them. In that moment, William realizes the dire fate of his attack plan with so many men having been lost and decides that he himself should join in on the action. He shouts a resilient ""come on!"" to the men beside him and runs straight into the chaos with no hesitation whatsoever. He then takes a position right at the front of the ram, all the while crying out encouragements to his men. Not only does he come to his men's aid, but he also lifts their spirits during that crucial time and gets them reinvigorated to complete the invasion. Wallace's decision to enter the fray reveals how truly devoted he is to the cause of freeing his people and also shows how he does not prioritize his life above those of the other citizens due to his status as a revered leader. Mel Gibson, the man who plays Wallace and who also happens to be the director of the movie, really fits the image of the original Scottish hero; he has a bit of a rough face with clear blues eyes and a wild head of hair on top. His weathered appearance allows him to blend in with the rest of the villagers, but his blue eyes mark his as someone who sees good and truth.<br/><br/>In contrast to Wallace's heroic actions, King Longshanks holds no appeal as a leader. The King is a rotten, selfish man who considers his wants and needs above everyone else's. He believes that people are expendable and that no one should stand between him and power. One instance in which King Longshanks demonstrates his utter self-centeredness happens when the English and the villagers face off in battle. William Wallace stands at the forefront of his men, whereas the King commands his troops from the back of the army. The King orders his foot soldiers to proceed forward to meet the villagers halfway, where the fight begins. Once the men have engaged in battle for a period of time, the King notices that his men are starting to weaken, and a sense of defeat creep up amongst him and his personal advisors. Fearful that the villagers will win, he orders for his archers to shoot arrows into the skirmish at the risk of hitting his own men. His endless pursuit of self-preservation blinds him from realizing the inhumanity that has taken over his heart. The King shows no care of that whatsoever, wearing a perpetually stony expression that underscores his brutal apathy. Actor Patrick McGoohan does a fantastic job of maintaining this cool aloofness to inspire within the audience a desire for the Wallace to prevail just for the sake of seeing that mask fall.<br/><br/>Though I would give caution to anyone with a distaste for gore, I recommend this movie to all history buffs, action enthusiasts, and people who just love a good underdog story. Though the historical aspects of the movie are an integral part to the film, the story itself is a timeless tale of an everyday hero that anyone can get behind. My dad has always claimed that this movie is his all-time favorite, and now I've seen why: Braveheart tells the tale of the epitome of a righteous character that resonates with the leader in us all, encouraging us to stand up for what we believe in in spite of what others may say."

Mel Gibson has crafted an incredible film full of moving images and fervor based on revenge. Of course, most of the film is very loosely based on actual events and some are downright made-up but that does not deter from the film at hand. The acting is top-notch and led from the front by Gibson himself. Cinematography is lush with the Irish and Scottish landscapes photographed in stunning glory and the battle scenes are raw and unflinching which add a certain realism to the proceedings. When the film was released it created a sensation in 1995, winning multiple academy awards and even being accused of Anglophobia by the media.

","I have to admit it, Braveheart is an excellent film. It's a great historical film but it's historically inaccurate¬†! What a shame for a film that tells us a real story. Braveheart is also a bit difficult to understand when you know nothing about Wallace's story and Scotland. I've watched it 3 times and there are still some scenes that I don't understand. Anyway, the actors, for example, are really competent, it seems that it really happened this way, that we are at Wallace's time and we see him live. By the way, Robert the Bruce is very touching, Argail (William's godfather) is bad *ss as f*ck¬Ö But the only character I've disliked was Isabelle of France. Every time we see her, she's in tears¬†! I's tiring. That's for the characters. About the shots and the film direction, everything was well filmed. The best moments of the film are, personally, the landscapes shots¬†: they're so poetic and relaxing (thanks to the music too). It makes a contrast with the gory battles scenes, which are truly amazing. We can notice that there is another poetic scene, for example, the wedding of Murron and William¬†: deep in the wood and during the night, very simple¬Ö So beautiful. As a conclusion, I can tell that Braveheart is a film I recommended (if you like historical films, because 3 hours about something you don't like, is Hell), it really makes me think of the movie Alexander by the way¬†: some scenes are almost the same. Despite all the inaccuracies (which are a bit disturbing when you know about them), I only can encourage you to watch it."

","I'm not fan of historic movies, even if Braveheart doesn't respect the real story. It's easy to see that the film is old, and I think that the landscapes are not very incredible. Moreover, this film is sad. I don't like the atmosphere. But the actors are very amazing ! They play their part very well and there is a real effort for the costumes. The fights don't surprises me : it's cool, but not impressive. The best for me is the camera : between zoom, traveling and the rest, I think the cameraman did a great work ! Without forgetting scriptwriter, who has my respect : to change several things to have the story that he wants, I think it's a great idea ! I want to do the same thing (maybe with Jeanne d'Arc) ! I think I will forget the story and characters, because this movie doesn't touch me. But there are a lot of good ideas which can be used for, maybe, a re-adaptation. With today's technology, a better movie can be produced. And maybe a new scriptwriter will still change the script. Who knows ? As a conclusion, I think I will Watch ""Sing"" (yes, I like animation movies. It's my favorite kind of movie. Maybe that's why I don't really like ""Braveheart"" : because it's not an animated film)"
"rodriguezhanna","5","1","3","2 March 2017"," William Wallace and the war
","At the beginning of the film, we can hear the narrator's voice. This, we put directly in the context of the film. In fact, the narrator explains to how the story began and he shows the characters. In my opinion, I think it a good idea to do this description because we can already understand the goal of the story. Then, we can see the main character who is William Wallace when he was a child, ans a few minutes later, we see William Wallace but when he is an adult. I think it is too a good think because the narrator concentrates on the action in the film ans this allows us to see the evolution of the principal character. The beginning of the film Braveheart, is interesting until here. Also, the colors are dark and cold. But after, there is an image when we can see many of character hanged. This image shocked me. And then, we can see Wallace and his army ready to the war. From then, the film becomes violent ans for me it is a negative point. This may be negative in particular for the children who watch the film. To conclude, for me, I don't like the theme of the film and actor's role aren't highlighted. This film is moving ans touching because of the death of William's wife but a little boring owing to the war that is present all along the film."

","Synopsis: Spoilers alert for all those who may want to see the movie.Mel Gibson portrays the role of medieval Scottish patriot William Wallace who struggles to unify his nation against English.The story begins with young Wallace, whose father and brother have been killed fighting the English, being taken into the custody of his uncle.He returns twenty years later and finds his childhood crush Murron, and the two quickly fall in love.However, when his love is killed by English soldiers the day after their secret marriage (held secretly so as to prevent the local English lord from exercising the repulsive right of prima noctae, the privilege of sleeping<br/><br/>with the bride on the first night of the marriage), he springs into action and begins a revolt against the English. TO know if our hero was able to avenge his love watch this movie.<br/><br/>Review: Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" is a full-throated, red-blooded battle epic.It's an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery.What people are going to remember from the film are the battle scenes, which are frequent, bloody and violent. Just from a technical point of view, ""Braveheart"" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. I want to praise Mel Gibson for the work he put into making this movie. His vision as director was first-class and gave the movie a ÔøΩgrandness' that it deserved. It is also a great achievement for Gibson to star in the movie, playing the integral character of Wallace, a difficult role. For his direction of Braveheart, Mel won the 1995 academy award for best director. I love all the battle scenes in ÔøΩBraveheart', as they are filmed in a big and bold way by Gibson. Death of Braveheart's wife adds emotional touch to the film. Overall the film contains romance,action,drama, adventure and deserves 5 star rating."
"Fenrir_Sleeps","7","1","3","25 December 2014"," Plot shrinks before the greatness of open sets
","'Braveheart' was prepared to be one of the greatest epic movie experiences of all time, if it wasn't built around it's poor, formulaic core: Randall Wallace's script.<br/><br/>The movie opens with some astonishing, aerial views of the Highlands, setting immediately the movie color scheme: brown and green. During the three hours of 'Braveheart', our eyes and hearts will be invaded with these two colors, that come from the mountains down to the very pieces of clothe that the characters wear. The bond between Scotland and Nature is assured then!<br/><br/>Although 'Braveheart' is regarded as one of the most historically inaccurate movies ever, an unsuspicious watcher (like me) won't spot that difference while watching the film. 'Braveheart' succeeds on involving us in its story, resorting to little details like the use of Gaelic-Scottish accent to help. E.g., the artificial look of the sets and the American English accent of the characters in 'Gladiator' made me take much longer to feel wrapped in the film. 'Braveheart' never intended to be historically accurate. It wants to create a whole new myth, and succeeds on doing that realistically.<br/><br/>The real backdrop of 'Braveheart' is its argument, which is as typical as a Hollywood epic drama movie can get. Taking little risks when writing the plot cuts on the thrills of the film, as much of the story becomes predictable. Here, 'Braveheart' loses to 'Gladiator', as I felt the last one took the liberty of being tragically dense, which resulted on me being completely hooked on its climatic finale.<br/><br/>Although no actor is really outstanding, all the actors are competent playing the characters they're given. The story's texture comes mainly from the feeling of the existence of the director's trademark, the sense that a human is behind the camera. Maybe it was an unpredicted consequence from the cuts Mel Gibson applied to the film to avoid the NC-17 rating, but there's undoubtedly something unique in the quick way the story unfolds."
"benedikt-entner","6","1","3","3 December 2014"," Americans love their ""freedom""
","The story deals with the Scottish historical figure William Wallace, and is spiced up with medieval ""heroism"". Selfless fighting for freedom against the evil English oppressor. In addition to that we get two shallow romantic side plots. Wallace is an admired war hero and also he is a womanizer. Yikes. At one part he is having a cheesy romantic affair with no other than the french princess. Wait, what? Not only completely irrelevant for the story, William Wallace is supposed to be seeking vengeance for his murdered wife. He loved her so much that he picked up the fight against the English army in the first place. So it is his main motivation throughout the film and now he is banging the french chick? <br/><br/>And I don't have a problem with graphic violence, but Braveheart has some moments of unreflected gruesomeness here and there. He burns down a shack with soldiers trapped inside, he smashes a guys face laying in his bed, while is screaming and begging for mercy. ""BADOOCH"". Spike mace right in his face. <br/><br/>Afterwards he jumps out of the castle window into a giant lake with his horse. Good chances to get crushed, dumbass. Still can not believe it won 5 Academy Awards.<br/><br/>The movie is well executed but with these unnecessary ""soap opera"" elements in it and the five Academy Awards including Best Picture I come to the conclusion the film is overrated. One of the best movies ever made? Not really. I would give ""Braveheart"" a 7 out of 10, if it wasn't for the historical inaccuracy, that goes on in that film. Someone who has basic knowledge of medieval history can be offended. I don't expect it to be historical correct, if the plot holds up for it, which is not the case for me, so it ends up on a 6"

","i do not know much about William Wallace or that English-Scottish war that movie depicts, but, by all accounts, neither do Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace. if there is so little history in this flick, then it is to be considered as a romanced hero tale. as such it is grotesque. 'the hero' does such acts of sickening violence that it feels like exaggeration of sort, kitsch, camp, but the rest of the movie is straightforward so it is not. i believe that this was one of the most violent films ever made, at the time when it came out. there were very graphic films and before this one, but those were mostly exploitation b movies. this one brought gruesomeness of movie killings into the mainstream. unfortunately, it was very well received. audiences loved it. so it opened the doors for many others to come. and two more from mr. Gibson. so sadistically violent, that it is impossible for me to see them any other way, except some sexual fantasies. and to make things even more disturbing they all have some Christian overtones. 'the hero' here dies a martyr death. same with 'apocalypto' where the brownskins are punished by 'crossbearers' for being savages. all in all, the message of the movie is deeply twisted and evil one, in the way that it smuggles the act of killing, as something sacred, a holy right of every man. too late to whine now, when all is done, the film discussed is a cult classic.."

The story is so well told and so engrossing it pulls the viewer into the movie.<br/><br/>This film will make you feel the anger and betrayal the characters feel in a way that very few films are capable of(the way you felt in Saving Private Ryan when Mellish had a bayonet SLOWLY shoved into his heart while Upham hid in fear) over and over.

The beautiful Sophie Marceau made her Hollywood debut in this film.<br/><br/>Something few people mention is that this is the first film in which the violence was actually realistic although the background fighters were less than convincing at times.<br/><br/>If you are a TRUE fan of cinema, this is a must watch. A real classic unlike other so-called-amazing films such as Citizen Kane.

","Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995 Braveheart is an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especially Mad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, Orson Welles's Chimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh's Henry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it."

"pernickety-hall8","8","1","3","31 May 2005"," Historical Truths
","Frist of all, let me be clear about the fact that l did enjoy Braveheart a lot, And l would have to put it in as one of my all time favourites. However it does not mean that l ignore the historical inaccuracies of the film. And reading many of the reviews on this site, it is clear that many people seem to gain their grasp of history from films and television and not from the facts as we know them. So l will try to help a few of you out there. This is what l had manged to find out about William Wallace after being inspired by the film. Both my parents are Scot's and often spoke to me about Wallace long before any film. It appears to many Scot's (like my parents) that Wallace continues to be an inspiration for an independent 'Scotland' and his struggle (like all for Freedom) captures the hearts of many. But most Scot's that l know, my parents included, have no real desire to be independent of England, in fact the UK has always been stronger united than separate. Wallace's inspirational achievements may well be greater than his actual achievements and this could be his greatest legacy. So some facts. 1. Wallace was born into what was believed to be a minor 'noble' family - a sort of 'county gentleman' not a Lord. However recent evidence suggests he was a game keeper or professional tracker or hunter - but certainly of lower class then previously believed. He was a lowlander! 2.Scotland and England at been at peace for over 100 years until the death of the Scotish King, Edward the 1st of England then tried to put a 'puppet' king on the throne of Scotland. Scotland said no and England invaded - Edward removed the puppet King and claimed the throne of Scotland for himself. 3. There is little known about Wallace's life before this time, but what evidence we have suggest's he was already an 'outlaw'; but seems that he did try and fight the English when ever he could after Edward took the throne of Scotland. 4. Wallace's actions seemed to be a rallying cry for many Scot's and his numbers grew - encouraged by the the Church he openly targeted English forces and administration centres. 5. At the Same time a Scotish Knight called Andrew Mornay began actions in the north of Scotland ( forces you see in the film that come down to join Wallace at the Battle of Stirling) 6. Wallace did have a wife or lover killed by the English and he did Kill the English Commander of Lanark in response ( We know this because at his trail it was one of the only recorded actions of Wallace's that was mentioned and we have documents about) 7. The Battle of Stirling was fought over a Bridge, not on an open field. 8.Wallace did invade England but not as far as York (as shownin the film) 9. He never had a relationship with the Princess of Wales as she would have only been about 4 years old at the time. 10. Wallace lost the battle of Falkirk due to the power of the English longbow and his own cavalry fleeing. (shown in the film) - however Falkirk was the first time during the middle ages that heavy cavalry had been stopped by foot soldiers. 11. Wallce went to France for several years - returned and after a few small actions was captured and killed as shown in the film; but did not shout FREEDOM at his death - sorry to say. 12. Robert the Bruce was never at Falkirk - he was 50 miles away. 13. Edward the 1st died a number of years later after Wallace, not at the same time. 14. Wallace has believed to be about 6'7"" tall and could have been as young as 20 to 24 at the Battle of Stirling.<br/><br/>Wallce is a true hero of Scotland and his 'stepping' on to the pages of history was short but dramatic - he did inspire the nobles to fight for Scotlands freedom."

Equally how can a three hour film take you back in time and hope to scratch the surface of the moral values and education levels of the day?<br/><br/>We really know next to nothing about Wallace (the key source for this script is a poem!), but we know very little about Shakespeare either and he was a public figure living in the world's largest city. What chance has history got with a lowland (highland for cinematography reasons here) Scot?<br/><br/>Certainly Wallace existed and certainly many of the battles presented here are real, but it plays Hollywood games with many of the key facts and at least one key romance is provably false. Thankfully it does portray the hard life of hard people with a certain amount of accuracy. <br/><br/>(The IMDb Trivia and Goofs sections for this movie is an absolute must for understanding this film.)<br/><br/>This is a big budget Hollywood film and having put up the money they have the right to call the tune. This includes scenes as ridiculous as riding in to a castle on horseback (how is this possible with drawbridges, etc.?) and having the said animal open the door with its front hooves! In the words of the joke, from then on the scene gets a bit silly. <br/><br/>For the needs of America the film takes a twin-track approach to motivation: Wallace has reason to want personal revenge (I won't spoil it) as well as revenge for his countrymen for all the English have done to them. He is charged to the brim with outrage, although this point in history was actually a quiet period for English/Scottish hatred and maybe that is why so much fell on deaf ears.<br/><br/>To make Wallace look better and more important, other key Scottish historical figures - such as Robert the Bruce - are shown to be weak if not outright weasels. An angle that seems to fly over the heads of Scottish Nationalists who champion the film.<br/><br/>The medieval battle scenes are very frightening. Probably as accurate as anything that has been put down on film without making it a literal - rather than metaphorical - blood bath. <br/><br/>The ""sixty pounds a day"" Irish army (or reservists) going at it hammer and tong with only one or two looking like they are not very serious about it. The scenes with a fake horse and the incoming arrows is especially memorable. <br/><br/>People say we (the English) are the bad guys here, but I cannot be really bothered. This is so far back in time it might as well be another planet. Rape, plunder and rough justice were probably viewed in a very different light by both sides in this argument.<br/><br/>Gibson is really too old (and too short) for the lead role and as a result other roles have to be over-aged cast as well, including his wife Murron (Catherine McCormack) - who would probably be seen as middle-aged judged by the life expectancy of the day!<br/><br/>However he directs well and keeps a balance between telling a story and simply entertaining the masses, winning the Best Picture Oscar with only his second effort behind the lens. His first film - The Man Without A Face - was as dreadful as this is good."

","WOW! Braveheart is by far the greatest movie of all time, Mel Gibson diversifies himself with ease. Starring, as well as, directing this incredibly well-researched film had to have been an extremely tedious task, but Mel far surpassed the expectations of others and therefore earned my vote of a ""10."" Outstanding dialogue: Mel managed to find the perfect choice of words to convey the strong situations that existed during the events portrayed in Braveheart. Amazing battles: the battles were fought out with true passion - they were ""not"" choreographed be any means."
"spunkydunky_84","10","1","3","29 February 2004"," A true masterpiece of cinema and storytelling.
","I consider myself a movie buff.   And as such I have always been reluctant to choose a 'favourite' movie.  But this film... moves me like no other movie can.  My feeble comments can't possibly convey the beauty and raw emotion of this incredible film.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, this is a film about the heart.  The themes in this movie, from love, honour and freedom, to betrayal, hate and death, evoke such emotion while watching it, that it truly draws you in, to a brilliant tale, with brilliant characters, in a brilliantly beautiful setting.<br/><br/>James Horner's haunting score is possibly one of the greatest movie themes of all time, and it's certainly the most powerful and memorable I've ever heard.  I don't care what the competition was, but it should have won the Oscar, without question.  This beautiful piece deserves the recognition for what it is, because it is as essential as the plot, characters, and (awesome) cinematography to making this movie what it is.  Braveheart wouldn't be Braveheart without this gut-wrenchingly passionate music.<br/><br/>I am aware of the historical inaccuracies in this movie, but as a proud Scot, I must say - is that really the point?  Watch this film as the great story that it is.<br/><br/>Let it it move and inspire you.  Allow yourself to feel the pain and the joy of this... experience, because this film touches on every emotion in the spectrum.<br/><br/>Braveheart deserves to be no.1 in my opinion.  Because, unlike The Godfather, and most of the other so-called 'great' films, this film leaves you with hope, and passion, and courage.<br/><br/>I know others disagree about the true greatness of this film, but read some of the other posts; see it for yourself, and if you've already seen it, watch it again.  Only this time watch it as your own story, and see if it can't speak straight to your heart.<br/><br/>So I'll finish by saying that this is indeed my favourite movie, and no matter how many times I see it, it still takes my heart on an emotional, and breath-taking journey.<br/><br/>***** (Absolutely oustanding)"

","I'm not saying that Gladiator was a bad movie, but this is everything that Gladiator was plus a lot of things it wanted to be and wasn't.<br/><br/>One of the main differences is the connection between the characters and the audience.  Whether it's the hero's mates or his enemies, they are all across with the viewer to a much greater degree.  If you've watched both I'm sure there are other characters and events that are similar but more powerful.<br/><br/>I guess the difference is exemplified by saying if you watch this movie and feel nothing throughout you are truly made of stone.  It takes you on a roller coaster ride of charged emotions, without the tackiness or corniness that are usually included with high action and high budget modern films.<br/><br/>The acting is led by Patrick McGoohan in my opinion, his performance as the uncompromising King Longshanks is outstanding.  But nobody lets the team down, and almost every performance is delivered superbly.<br/><br/>There are good, little comedic moments as well that help the flow of the movie, and are another factor that gives this movie a connection with the audience that Gladiator missed: human touches.<br/><br/>Overall, a movie that you are guaranteed to enjoy, no matter the demographic - something that is truly rare, and the ability to give that genuine wide spread appeal combined with the class of the movie itself, makes this one of the great movies of all time."

","Braveheart remains one of my all-time favorites, and as a Scotophile I'll be forever thankful for its role in awakening the patriotic spirit in the people of Scotland.  Few movies can make a case for helping to change the history of a nation (it played a significant role in arousing the patriotic zeal of the people of Scotland who soon voted for a separate Parliament from that of the UK after hundreds of years of minority participation in that larger Parliament).  Having already read some books and stories about William Wallace, I was thrilled when I learned that there was going to be a film about him.  I became even happier when I found out it would be an epic movie, as I'm a major fan of the sweeping epics!  I was somewhat skeptical about Mel Gibson as Wallace, but once the movie came out his performance dispelled my concerns, and I was pleased that he was cast for the role.  I loved the color, the pageantry, the awesome scale, and the pulse-quickening action (big guys whacking at each other with swords and axes WAS bloody, so the level of violence was appropriate!) of Braveheart.  So, they went a little overboard with the romanticism and villainy, but in my mind that only cost them one rating point out of ten.  A spectacular movie that I'm sure to watch many, many times in the future!"

You'd think after a while the affect would where off, but some of those pesky films still manage to turn on the water works.<br/><br/>Behold the glory that is Braveheart.<br/><br/>I watch, I cry.  And I'm not ashamed to cry.  It's what we girls do.  My friend told me when she first saw this movie, she cried so hard she fell off the couch.<br/><br/>And despite the fact that this has often been hailed the 'ultimate guy movie' (seriously... I have yet to meet a guy who doesn't think this movie is wonderful), it has an appeal that can draw anyone and everyone.<br/><br/>And I'm not just talking about Sophie Marceau. ;)<br/><br/>I'm talking about movie-making at it's finest.  Cinematography at it's finest.  Acting at it's finest.  Which, in the end, makes this one of the finest films ever made.  Mel Gibson is definately one of my favorite actors, but his turn as a director is even better. He pulls off what could possibly be his best role ever (just for wearing the kilts, alone... hee hee) and can I say enough about Mme. Marceau? Most people don't even  know that she did this entire movie phonetically (at the time still a relatively unknown French actress.)  Mel get's my personal thanks for the casting call.<br/><br/>And though it isn't perfect, this is truly one of the best movies out there. It inspires you, humors you, touches you and sticks with you long after the credits have stopped rolling.  Few movies can do this these days, so take it while you can... because there's a million 'American Pie' movies for every 'Braveheart'.<br/><br/>A definate 10 out of 10."

The real Princess Isabelle was too young for Mel at the time of the story.  Kilts weren't worn by Scotsmen at the time.  Blue face paint was not used. The movie is shot through with this type of Hollywood embellishment.  However, If you can push history aside for a couple of hours, you will enjoy this ultimate action flic.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the previous comment: ""The Patriot"" where he there is fighting in the Civil War . . .""  is a bit off key also.

","Mel Gibson in his critically acclaimed movie Braveheart, is one of the most spectacular films of all time. Mel Gibson is one of the most talented actors that ever lived and this movie actually proves it. I thought this is one of my favorite movies. I thought Mel Gibson had a great Scottish accent. That shows how much time and effort he put into this movie. As a director, he was quite good at it because all the effort he put in to this movie, was finally awarded and the Academy Awards. He probably learned a lot from a Man Without A Face because that was his directoral Debut. Finally he was awarded for Best Director and Best Picture of the year in 1995. Randall Wallace was also a genius in this movie. He was the writer of the movie and moved on later on with Mel Gibson in We Were Soldiers and he directed that movie. He was probably an inspiration of Mel because they were together with two great movies. The movie was great and I recommend this movie to all viewers who like Mel Gibson and like brutal war, this is the movie for you."

Of all the action/adventure movies there ever was, this one is the best.<br/><br/>James Horner's score is brilliant.  It truly makes you cry.  Especially the scene I mentioned earlier.  The music there is just pitch perfect.  Like John Williams score for Jaws, the best music is the simplest.  Also did you notice how the best original score award at the academy awards was always given to the music that made you cry.

","Braveheart is one of those films that comes along once in a while - you never get tired of watching it because each time you do, you discover something new that you never noticed before.  This has to be one of Mel Gibson's greatest achievements to date, making his directorial debut in what has become a classic even though it is just eight years old! No one else could be quite as convincing in the role of William Wallace.  This film has something for everyone - bloody battle scenes, love interests, humour, tragedy, believable characters, an amazing soundtrack and a script which couldn't fail to inspire!  Of course it has had its critics as well who hit out at the 'historical inaccuracy' of the film - but who cares?  It's a great movie and one which will stay in your movie collection for many years to come. Highly recommended!"

The battle scenes are VERY well done, the acting is great, the supporting cast is excelent, and the story is very engaging.  <br/><br/>So what if the history is wrong, I really don't care.  I am a history major in college (I have a BA in history).  I have learned NOT to take most ""historical"" movies seriously.  And Braveheart is no different.

","While there are a lot of sweeping epics that have and always will stand the test of time (Spartacus, Gone With The Wind, Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, etc.) few will hold that 100% entertainment value along with the intellect that can satisfy the most cynical of cynics like ""Braveheart"". <br/><br/>  This film is perhaps the best ""Movie"" that Hollywood has done since it's golden age.  Not a shock, considering it's director and star (Mel Gibson) is the most non-Hollywood celebrity in Hollywood.  He has spent most of his career as a soft spoken gentlemen, and when he has taken the opportunity to speak out Hollywood shuns his opinions.  (Yeah!  goes to show how well Hollywood loves the 1st amendment, ""Only when it applies to the corporate Hollywood masses."") ""Braveheart"" is a beautiful and brilliant portrait and story.  While many argue on how true the film stays to the ""real""  William Wallace, I say whether this film is biographic or a fictional work, it dazzles with brilliance.  It deserved so much more than it won at the Academy Awards. Then again, however I think the Academy was bitter because Gibson wasn't wearing his red ribbon.  <br/><br/>BRAVEHEART:   10 of 10 dead!  It's that simple."
"WriterDave","10","1","3","4 March 2003"," One of the Best
","There's just something about this quasi-historical big sweeping epic that gets me every time. The schmaltz and romance works, perhaps because it is wonderfully balanced by gorgeous Scottish vistas and some of the grittiest and most gut churning battle scenes ever put on the big screen. This is the movie that every battle scene in every movie since has tried to top in terms of amazing choreographed carnage. Mel Gisbon makes William Wallace out to be a mythic sized hero and freedom fighter whose most heartfelt desire was to be left alone to raise a family on his own terms and by the sweat of his own brow. Powerful stuff beautifully shot, appropriately scored, reverently acted, and ultimately unforgettable. The revenge plot is a familiar and archetypal story that is often told, but not often told this well (much like ""Gladiator"" in that respect). This is grand epic film making at its most heartfelt best and sincere."
"gyvo","Null","1","3","31 January 2003"," Average film, great comments
","It's all very well saying that a movie is not a history lesson in order to explain away it's inaccuracies - but sadly these days too many people blindly believe what movies tell them.<br/><br/>The film itself I consider nothing more than average, but the comments on here are highly entertaining. Particularly ones like that of ""fmr007"". He/she needs to learn that:-<br/><br/>1. The ""auld alliance"" between France and Scotland was made specifically to give Scotland the chance to take territory from England while the English were busy fighting the French - eg in the case of the Battle of Neville's Cross.<br/><br/>2. Saying that the English were ""cowards"" for using longbows from a distance is a nonsense. The longbow was a valid weapon that won England many victories - it took a lifetime to train to use it, if other countries didn't see it's value and failed to put the effort in to training longbowmen, that's their lookout. Probably the most effective weapon until the invention of the machine gun.<br/><br/>3. Charles II was, of course, a Scottish king, and king of both Scotland and England. I'm not sure why ""fmr007"" thinks that he wanted the Scots to fight against Oliver Cromwell in 1650, Cromwell having died a year earlier.<br/><br/>4. The Jacobite rebellion had no validity. James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 due to his unconstitutional pro-Catholic leanings and replaced with his daughter. The Stuart line continued until 1714 when Anne died childless and was replaced with George I. However some (not all) Scots felt the need to invade England 30 years later to try and put the pretender on the throne. After having marched south as far as Derby they can only blame themselves that the English wanted payback after beating them.<br/><br/>5. The Scots desperately needed the Act of Union in 1707. They had tried to control ALL world trade without doing their homework and had effectively bankrupted themselves. Check out Simon Schama's excellent ""History of Britain"" to learn some basic history.<br/><br/>As I said at the start, the film's very ordinary, Mel should stick to non-thinking roles."

","Now that Mel Gibson has finally finished what I like to call his ""unsuccessfully going out of character"" trilogy (""Forever Young"", ""The Man Without A Face"", ""Maverick""), I can finally go back to seeing him as the action man that I know him best for. The time, setting and overall plot are considerably different here but the result is a film that stands out as one of Gibson's finest hours (or three hours in the case of its running time). He portrays William Wallace, a brave and determined Scotsman who leads a rather small but equally determined Scottish troop in a revolt against the English oppressors. Very bloody and brutal at times but if one can stay strong and patient through it all, it's well worth it. Gibson also seved as this film's director and producer (a Paramount film released through Gibson's Icon production company) and does well on all counts. The first of Gibson's ultra violent and lengthy war epics trilogy (followed by ""The Patriot"" and ""We Were Soldiers"")."

I suggest you read up on history, the english in the 1100s were nothing more than an occupying force. The islands of Great Britain and Ireland were historically the homeland of the two celtic nations, the Britons and the Irish. The english came out of the invading Normans and the Angles, Saxons and Jutes. What you are saying equals to a North American claiming that 'the injuns attacked us first'. If you can find cause for pride in your people's bloody history (starving 2 million Irish, conquering Wales, repeated attacks against the Scots, the extinction of Cornish and Manx, still occupying Northern Ireland, fighting against the American colonies, India, etc etc.), then there is something seriously wrong with you.

Keep in mind that the most accurate documents available are those written by the English, not the Scots, thereby presenting half of the view on the conflict.<br/><br/>
To many of you it may be annoying and insulting that the movie doesn't get more historical than it does. Think of it this way- at least it'll inspire people to go and read up on the real story. Like me.<br/><br/>Sure, it's not historically accurate, but it's a movie, a film, a feature presentation for film-going audiences, NOT a History Channel documentary. Check your heads and make sure they're on right- dismissing the movie completely based on the fact that it's not the TRUE story is ridiculous.<br/><br/>
The acting in this movie is superb, the score is phenomenal, and THE SCENERY IS GORGEOUS!!! The sweeping landscapes are breathtaking in ways that other movies like Lord of the Rings have tried to achieve and come up short. I have not been blown away by the imagery in any other movie quite like I was by Braveheart's landscapes. The battles are brutal, as they should be, and every violent scene makes you contemplate what would drive YOU to risk it all for your freedom.

After the movie, I snuck out while the credits were still rolling so no one would see my tears.  When I went into the ladies room there were five other women in there, also in tears.  We just looked at each other sheepishly and smiled.)<br/><br/>My husband and I saw the film for the first time in 1995.  In 1997 we went to Scotland, primarily because Braveheart had ignited our interest in Scottish history.  Unlike films that do not accurately portray reality, Scotland is as beautiful as the film depicts, perhaps even more so.<br/><br/>Braveheart has everything I look for in a movie: action, adventure, romance, comedy,drama, beautiful scenery, beautiful music,perfect cinematography,artful editing,skillful directing, great acting, a great plot, and a handsome lead. Others must agree with my assessment, because many nuances have been stolen from Braveheart to enhance movies that came after.<br/><br/>The most incredible miracle of this film, however, is that it has staying power.  It is now 2002, and I still think about the movie and Scotland.  I never miss a chance to see it."
"yam","Null","1","3","11 January 1999"," A stunning visual kaleidoscope of Celticism
","I was skeptical about this film at first. Quite a lot of me is Celtic ""under my kilt"", so to speak, and I have long looked forward to a narrative which demonstrates the yoke that our people have long had to suffer under the thumb of the watchful eye of the English jackboot. However, previous valiant efforts by the likes of Billy Connolly have always ended up selling out to the English Paymasters. This film is different. From the first stirring sounds of the Celtic pipes being fingered nimbly by their dextrous pipemen, I felt my heart leap some distance up my rib-cage. Although I am hardly an athlete (I watch a lot of videos), I almost felt at one with Mel Gibson as he triumphed over the effeminate nastiness of the English Lie with his big, vicious sword. Curse you, damnable hypocrites! UP THE SCOT!!! That's what this film makes you feel - pure, unadulterated admiration for the Aussie/Scot Wallace and his humane and fair description of the marauding English robber barons. Since seeing this film I've felt a lot better about my Scot past, even though I'm only going on a vague intuition that I actually am descended from Celts, having no actual documentary proof - but the point is, it's given me self-esteem, it's changed my world and it's helped curb those violent urges I used to have to bite on a sponge in order to suppress. This film truly speaks to the disciple of truth within all of us, the disciple that is actually one person, one huge vibrant being whose centre is You and Me existing for the moment. Truly these primitive peoples lived more intensely than in our modern-day world of couch potatodom. The use of colour in this film and the rapid editing made me feel more alive than the last time I ran a 100 metre sprint. Fantasmagoric. Truly."

","This late 90's version of the Scottish rebellion against the cruel English ruler Edward the Longshanks, tells as much about us as it does Scottish history.  But who can complain about a chance to see Mel Gibsons gams??? This film should have enough action and violence to keep the men in your group happy.  Based on the historic figures William Wallace and Robert the Bruce this is still a thrilling romp through history.  The final scenes a reminder there were no lethal injections for the condeemed in the 13th century. Mel stays ruggedly handsome to the end."

","I remember seeing a bit of the film on HBO and chunks of it on USA and now, when i finally saw the whole thing a few hours ago, i was captivated by the theme as well as the impact of the movie. It took a lot of guts for Mel Gibson to star in the film as well as star in it and he deserved that Best Director Oscar. Rarely, have we seen actors who have direct themselves into a good performance. i believe that i saw it in Mel Gibson. this may be one of the best war movies that i have ever seen. all of the cast members were wonderful, especially Mel Gibson. The battle scenes may be a little bit stomach-turning and brutal but, as the viewer, it is important to show the violence of what happened between the Scottish and the British back at those times and it is brilliant film making and the best fight scenes ever captured on film. this is a film about the fight for freedom and the courage to free your heart and follow your dreams and to achieve it at a high peak. I also thought that the music was wonderful too as well as the cinematography which was beautifully filmed. The music, by James Horner, gives a deft subtleness of the movie and creates the tone. I recommend this film to everyone because this film is like a sonnet as well as a history lesson. it is a incredible movie and a film that will live on forever."
"jimbobinblue","10","1","3","11 October 2001"," ""Breathtaking""

This movie has more heart than any others I have seen, inc. the Great Escape, What a wonderful life and Romeo and Juliet. This film is pure inspiration. It's almost impossible for a Scotsman to watch this film and not think about overthrowing the English, who we are still ruled by no matter how ""independant"" we are."
"seancolins","10","1","3","5 August 2001"," One of times greatest and glorious masterpieces
","**SPOILERS** I have seen this, I believe, nine times.  I saw it for the first timelast summer on my big-screen and it wouldn't be prudent to watch much on a small or normal TV screen.  It was fabulous!  When it came out on DVD I of course got it and I started to love it even more.<br/><br/>
As the Paramount and Lightstorm emblums come on, James Horners gripping score starts and through the cloudy fod on the dark screen BRAVEHEART in powerful title come towards us.  Then the great hills of Scotland ar shown as though you were in the Onimax Theatre.  The bagpipe music owns you as you soar through the lands.<br/><br/>
Robert the Bruce's great voiceover words ""I shall tell you of William Wallace"" take you.  Then there are the other following qoutes of compelling grip.  ""It's our witts that make us men""  Have the courage to follow it,"" ""Then I'll teach you to use this,"" it's greatly done.  William was a child when his father and brother were killed, fighting the English after a tragic ""Nagotiating meeting"" which was a hanging massacre.  William is adopted by his uncle and before he leaves with him he shares a passion with a little girls, Morron.<br/><br/>
In England, The daughter of the King of France has his daughter marry the son of King Edward I the Longshankse, a ruthless ruler.  Edwards son is not respponsible and is weak.  Longshanse is also not thrilled that he is actually homosexul and is in love with a local man.  Longshankse tries to controll Scotland.  He comes up with the old custom Premodocte'.  English nobles can have sexual rights to Scotish brides on the first night of her union.<br/><br/>
When William returns to Scotland as a man, he finds Moron and secretly marries her.  After there wedding, tradgedy strikes when an English commander attempts to rape her.  William saves her, but when they seperate for a rendevous, she is caught by English and her throat is slit.  ""An attack on the king's soldiers is an attack on the king himself,"" the magistrate says.  William fights off the British with other Scots.  When he finally get to the magistrate, there is a long moment betwee them untill he finally puts him to Morons execution poll and slits his throat.<br/><br/>
After this they join with other clangs to battle the British.  They go to a head quarters and take them captive.  ""Go back to England and tell them that Scotlands son and daughters are yours no more!  Tell them Scotland is free!"" Finally, the Northern army is sent to fight them at Stirling.  The Scotish nobles have brought their army.  The battle looks like David vs. Galyeth. Many Scots want to flee.  Then William gives them the great powerful speech. ""Aye, fight and you may die.  Run, and you'll live.  At least for awhile, and dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that to come back here and tell our enemies, that they may take our live, but they'll never take our freedom?!  The battle is a great success.  There's that great seen when he holds his sword and yells and they yell his name as he pusses his sword into the ground.<br/><br/>
Mel Gibson's directing is fabulous!  As is his performance.  There is critisism of accuracy problems.  Why wouldn't a lot of this had happened?<br/><br/>
Wallace then invades York in England.  To settle a deal, Longshankse send the French princess.  Passion is between them and she decides to take his side.  She worns him of a battle schemed at Falkirk.  There, he is betrayed by his noble alleis Locklan, and Moneigh.  He was also given unition by Robert the Bruce, but his father convinced him otherwise.  Wallace is defeated and his men take heavy casulaties.  The Bruce is outraged at what has happened.<br/><br/>
Eventually, Wallace is again warned of danger by the princess.  They meet and passion takes act.<br/><br/>
SPOILER SECTION BEGINNING-(If you haven't seen the film and don't want to know spoilers, don't read this part, but go on down to after ""SPO ILER SECTION END"" and read on)-The nobles come to Wallace and offer him a metting for legiance.  When he goes, he is taken prisoner by the British. This was set up by Robert's father the VVVII Bruce.  Robert again is outraged and is opposed to his father.  Now, I have read reviews saying The Bruce wasn't a traitor and that this film is disrespectful towards him. The VVVII Bruce did arrange Wallac's capture.  I've seen history things. Wallace is of high treason of the king.  He is sentenced to a purifying death with extreme pain because he wouldn't confess treason to what they called ""his"" king.  He is tortured, untill he is finally disembowled infront of a crowd.  The executioner repeatedly tries to get him to pleed.  Finally he says ""The prisoner wishes to say a word.""  This to several people yelling for Wallace to say mercy.  Finally Wallace yells ""FREEEEEEEEEEE-DOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" One of the absolute most powerful moments in film.  He is then, finally, beheaded.  The final seen in Banockburn is also one of the absolute most powerful seens in film.  As Robert and his associate head towards the BNritish to pay holmage for the crown, Robert haults.  We watch in pure lock.  ""You have bleed with Wallace!  Now bleed with me!""  As Hemish throws Wallace's sword, our insides our froze.  As the charge towards the British in battle mode with Wallac's narration voiceover, it is like one of the things more deeply powerful then ever.  ""They fought like warrior poets. They fought like Scotsman, and won their freedom.""  This as we view Wallace's sword in the earth.  Incredible.-SPOILER SECTION END<br/><br/>
Now, I've read reviews, and these reviews I speek of are from the IMDb, that are even disrespectful.  Wallace was an incredible hero.  Now, I don't even think I have Scotish in me.  It's been written that Wallace was as bad as the British.  Horrible bull.  When you are a war leader you take jurraastic steps like sending body parts as messages.  It can work also.  How about we look at for example General George S. Patton.  At this point, I don't particularly like the rather broing film, but it tells a lot.  ""Go down and get yourselves killed so I can get ahead of  Monty and look good in the papers.""<br/><br/>
Well, geese!  The British couldn't have been evil like that!  It's history. During the time period there were several times when the British were an evil empire.  It's pretty arragant that modern Brits might get upset with films like this.  Your among the people who did the raping, stealing, murdering, etc.  Am I gonna go on and say we were so great to the Indians or African Americans?  No.  It's history.  It should be eccepted.<br/><br/>
John Toll is a master!  This was his second oscar in row after ""Legends of the Fall.""  This is a man who know how to use a camera.  He also mastered with ""The Thin Red Line.""  Epic cinamatography.  James Horner's score, superb.  Fantastic editing.  Powerful script, Randall WALLACE.  Good production design.  Costume design.  Make-up which got the oscar.  Of course, acting and directing.<br/><br/>
This is a very emotional, touching, gripping, powerful, uplifting, masterpiece.  It should hold that reputation forever."

","Since the first time I've seen this movie in 1996 and I consider it one of the best movies although the copy that I watched was a VHS censored copy. The first time I watched the full copy was when I bought the DVD special edition of it last year.<br/><br/>The story is so powerful and although it was a typical story about the battle between good and evil but the fighting scenes were the biggest of that time and they were simply amazing. Of course if you try to watch this movie after watching a movie like Matrix. well, you will feel that Braveheart is a kid movie and the tricks in the fighting scenes are so obvious and done poorly. My advice to anyone watching this movie is to enjoy the story line instead of concentrating on the special effects.<br/><br/>Another important point about the movie is that it can't reflect an accurate or even near view of what actually happened to Wallace. Reading a little in history or watching some of the programs about this man's life will make you ask the question 'was this man a hero after all?'. Anyway, the history is as good and as bad as who writes it want it to be. so enjoy the movie and just don't take its events as historical facts."

All characters in the movie can be classified into two categories: good people and bad people (perhaps except only one, unfortunately that man is not Wallace).

I had great hopes for the movie because it won so many Oscars and I love great epic films.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that the fight sequences are spectacular and the opening sequence of a William as a young boy were quite moving. I did like the Noble character who struggled with whether to help the William or to be true to his noble heritage.<br/><br/>As the movie wore on I tired of the battle sequences and started not to care whether the ""good guys"" were going to win or not. The level of gore may have been authentic to the torture methods of the day, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.<br/><br/>It wasn't a terrible movie, but it didn't meet my expectations of a movie that won multiple oscars."

"Caledonia Twin #1","10","1","3","29 January 2001"," The Best Film ever Made
","I think I was about four years old the first time I climbed the tediously tiring thousand steps to the top of Wallace's monument outside Stirling, 7 miles from my Papa's house in Dunipace, Stirlingshire.  So of course, I have always heard the stories of William Wallace, heroic patriot of Scotland, but never before had Wallace's story seemed so real, so tragic, so compelling and noble, as the first time I saw it realized in glorious color as it was in Braveheart.  Though since I first saw the film in May 1995, I have heard some people criticize the historical inaccuracies of Braveheart, I can say for my part that this film brings to life the essence of Scottish spirit and Scottish pride as many Scots understand it, and that is ever so much more important than the force of any nit-picking negative criticism launched towards Braveheart.  The power of what Braveheart conveys on an emotional level is reason enough for all Scots to value the film, but it also appeals to what is universal in all people and what all of us value, yearn for, and fight for: Braveheart appeals to our sense of justice and forces us to ask ourselves the question, ""What price is any one man--am I--willing to pay for freedom?""  It shows us the unconquerable spirit of one man and one nation, and kindles in us all a new sense of our own fortitude, strength, and valour.  I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed by this film, in my opinion, perhaps the best, or at least the most enjoyable, film ever made."

","Braveheart is the ultimate movie, in that it has something for everybody. It has action, intrigue, and romance. The gripping and sometimes disturbing battle scenes are offset by the tranquil and moving scenes of emotion throughout the movie. The themes of father and son perpetuate throughout, guaranteeing a continuity that transcends the gore. Offset with a warming humor, the violence and the romance are finely balanced, and have rarely been duplicated, except in rare cases such as ""The Last of The Mohicans."" This is number 3 on my all time top fifty, and stands out clearly as the highpoint of Mel Gibson's career thus far.

There is however a few things that they changed for the movie because it might have been too gruesome how it really happened or something like that. I just got the DVD of this movie with the directors commentary on it and Mel Gibson explained that the real William Wallace was not shot in the shoulder with an arrow,(as he was in the movie) but actually in the neck! But he did survive through it. He then went on to be captured by King longshanks and beheaded after being tortured way more than was shown in the movie. But then his people did go on to win their freedom.

"The_Movie_Cat","6","1","3","20 July 2000"," ""Certain Events Portrayed Have Been Dramatised""
","That says it all in a way. Maybe if I had watched Braveheart alone I would have liked it a whole lot less. Yet I took this one out on video after seeing ""The Patriot"", my curiosity piqued to see if this was as fundamentally bad.<br/><br/>It isn't, of course, and watching in conjunction with that film made me appreciate this one a whole lot more. The Patriot is melodramatic, trite, sentimental and showily directed. Braveheart may have its dream sequences, stereotypical bagpipes and the odd duff line, but generally it's pretty good for Hollywoodised history. I don't even mind the fact that history has been severely distorted, either. After all, this is a film, and every film needs its heroes and villains. The picture may be entirely one-sided in it's portrayal of the Scot/English divide, but at least the ""enemy"" in this one get more than the boo-hiss one-dimensionality of ""The Patriot"".<br/><br/>However, while this isn't high-minded enough to be a great historical epic and isn't totally worthy of the five Oscars it received (and, while nominated for more, they were all technical, none for acting) it is sturdy, average entertainment. In fact, what makes it of note, and justifies its watchability are really just two things:<br/><br/>1. Patrick McGoohan, No.6 himself, having a thoroughly good time as the outrageously mad King;<br/><br/>2. The Scottish accents. Maybe the American audience that thought they were getting an honest historical was convinced by the laughably fake ""accents"". Gibson was far from the worst, incidentally. But even so, anyone who lives in the whole of the British Isles would be unlikely to sit through this film without crying tears of laughter as this Australian, would-be US actor tells us what it's like to be a Scotsman. <br/><br/>For those two factors alone, Braveheart is priceless."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","3","9 July 2000"," Mel Gison has gone (at least temporarily) from relatively forgettable action comedies like the Lethal Weapon series to an incredibly intense and historically accurate epic film with Braveheart.
","What you have in Braveheart is a spectacular portrayal of the struggle of the Scots against English rule in the 13th century. Mel Gibson's directing in awesome, and the film does an excellent job of illustrating the suffering and brutality that the Scots went through at the hands of the English.<br/><br/>
Gibson portrays William Wallace, a Scot who lost his wife to the English in a horribly violent display of cruelty on the part of the English. It is that event that inspires him to fight for the freedom of the Scots from the English, and he becomes the leader of the Scots' tremendous revolt. The battle scenes between the two sides are both tremendously large and breathtakingly real. Some people will say that this film is too violent, and yes, it is incredibly violent. But the thing that makes it okay is the fact that it's all REAL. None of the brutality on the battle fields was thrown in to appeal to Males Age 18-24. These were all occurrences which were taken out of history books, this is what the Scots sacrificed for their freedom, and Braveheart provides an intense learning experience about that. The violence is acceptable in Braveheart for the same reason the the violence in Saving Private Ryan was acceptable; it really happened.<br/><br/>
Braveheart tells a greatly important story, and it tells that story very well. The directing, the acting, the script, the cinematography, music, everything was put together with painstaking attention to historical accuracy and thoroughness, and the result is an intense and spectacular movie event that is destined to become a classic."

This is a cinematic experience -- a true composition of sight, sound and excitement.  Oddly, I've never known an action movie that could move men, in particular, to tears so effectively.<br/><br/>Be warned: Braveheart contains a lot of bloody medieval hand-to-hand combat.

I've never been oppressed or been forced to fight for my freedom, but I do have to struggle to remember the many people who died so I wouldn't have to.  This film helps me remember.  The story moved me, even if Mel Gibson ""sold out"" (after you make a film like this, you can never sell out!), whatever that means.  Gibson did a fine job as Wallace, I could cheer for him, I could feel what he felt, same with all the characters, which says a lot about Gibson's directing abilities.

"Captain Ed","8","1","3","8 June 2000"," Good, not great, flawed by inaccuracies
","I enjoyed Braveheart and would recommend the movie as epic entertainment more than historical insight.  The fighting scenes were terrifically staged and the film captures the theme of Scottish nationalism.  (Contrary to an earlier opinion, war paint was in fact used by Celts in battle and was not added for melodramatic effect; you could argue that it was melodramatic but it was not in error.)<br/><br/>In fact, the historical Wallace not only embodied nationalism but in large part created it, at least a century before Joan of Arc, who usually gets the credit.  Mel Gibson was good, not great, as Hollywood's Wallace, and the supporting cast is outstanding.<br/><br/>That being said, a lot of historical facts need to be sorted out if you want to know the REAL story of William Wallace.<br/><br/>1. Wallace was no reluctant warrior; before his girlfriend (not wife) was murdered, he had already built a fearful reputation for killing Englishmen in Scotland.  The historical record shows that Wallace loved his work and had always been very good at it.  His girlfriend's murder occurs late in his career.<br/><br/>2. William Wallace actually co-ruled an independent Scotland for a few months (there are treaties signed by Wallace) between the battles of Stirling Bridge and Falkirk.<br/><br/>3. Robert the Bruce was not about to be named a puppet King of Scotland on the fields of Bannockburn, as shown in the final scenes of the movie.  He had already declared himself an independent king and Edward II's army was there to engage and destroy him.  Outnumbered 2-1, Robert destroyed the English army at Bannockburn in 1314, creating a de facto independent Scotland that was confirmed by treaty in 1328.<br/><br/>4. Edward II did not marry until after Wallace was dead, so the whole ridiculous subplot with Sophie Marceau could not possibly have been true. It doesn't even pass the laugh test.  However, apparently Edward II was a terrible king; Churchill himself refers to him as ""a perverted weakling"" and ""an unworthy successor to Edward I"".  So the notion in an earlier post that this is an American propaganda slant is not true.<br/><br/>These are not minor points and the movie is flawed by its misrepresentations.  It is still enjoyable and probably captures the essence of the cause that Wallace fought and died for.  <br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"saraarts","7","1","3","6 April 2000"," Made huge mistake; must warn others!
","First of all, I have to say that the first time I saw Braveheart, I loved it, unequivocally.  Too old to remember what I once knew of Scottish history, and therefore entirely unaware of any historical inaccuracies which I've since heard others put forth, I saw only a long, lush, romantic, dramatic, cinematic war poem, the sort of thing that would have become required reading in English literature courses had it been created by a troubador a few centuries earlier.  It didn't even bother me that Mel Gibson, despite his usual exceptionally strong acting, was far too old for the hero's role.  I was enchanted and deeply moved.<br/><br/>Let me also state my opinion that, no matter what, Braveheart is still a really good movie.  The sheer choreography of the battle scenes is superb and not to be missed.  Patrick McGoohan's performance is the best I've seen him do yet.  Most of the little glimpses we get of Sophie Marceau are lovely and memorable.  The only real criticisms I can make of this film rest on the length and on certain cliches which could have been avoided; there were a number of scenes that could have been trimmed to strengthen Braveheart's impact immensely, and the script was not always as strong as the point.  But these are small criticisms.  Watching Braveheart is like immersing yourself greedily in a thick historical novel.<br/><br/>However, when I first saw Braveheart, I had never seen anything like it on film.  So over the course of the next few years, hungry for more rich widescreen epics spread over two cassettes, I watched and rewatched a lot of other films, as much David Lean and Akira Kurosawa as I could find.  The first movie I saw after Braveheart was Lawrence of Arabia, which I'd seen and loved before; then, at my boyfriend's instigation, I moved into Kurosawa with a vengeance, starting with Ran.  If my goal had been to keep loving Braveheart, this was probably my first mistake.<br/><br/>Then my boyfriend, at my urging, bought the video of Braveheart, letterboxed and everything as all originally widescreen films should be.  A big Kurosawa fan, and someone who cannot seem to get enough of beautifully presented violent tragedy, I assumed my boyfriend would love Braveheart as much as I had.  This was my second mistake.  For had he not purchased this videotape, my third and most critical error of judgment would never have occurred.<br/><br/>My third mistake took place a couple of weeks ago.  We held a little film party at our house, ostensibly to watch Monty Python movies with a bunch of our friends, ages ranging from early 20s to late 30s.  We first watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a brilliant and hilarious movie we all love dearly.  Then the people who don't like violent tragedies, even when beautifully presented, had to go home.  So the question arose, what should we watch next?<br/><br/>For some reason, neither Monty Python's The Meaning of Life nor Life of Bryan, which we had rented just for the occasion, appealed to the remaining guests.  For some perverse reason which I can only attribute to too many margaritas, we all agreed to watch Braveheart.<br/><br/>Like The Holy Grail, Braveheart attempts to portray life in medieval Britain as it might really have been, filth and all.  So the first time we snickered when we saw a dirty face, we suspected we were in trouble.  As soon as the first English soldier in a bullet-shaped helmet appeared to receive a thorough taunting, those of use who had seen Braveheart before knew at once that our love affair with the film was over.  It didn't take long for our small audience to begin screaming things at the screen such as, ""Come back and fight, you coward!"" or ""Not dead; in fact, I'm feeling a little better,"" or ""You don't frighten us, English pig dogs!"" or, worst of all, ""Naughty, naughty Zoot!""<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil Braveheart for others.  The purpose of this review is simply to put forth a warning.  And so I will not walk you through all the parallels we encountered, much to the detriment of Braveheart, from costume to character to event.  It would be unkind.  Nor will I go into a detailed analysis of the flaws of Braveheart versus the virtues of, say, Kagemusha.<br/><br/>I would offer two warnings, though.  The first warning is that, if you love Braveheart and have not watched a lot of Kurosawa, go carefully into that rich domain.  Know that once you have seen Ran, with all its beautifully composed scenes, unique and perfect music, and careful, truly poetic editing, never again will you be able to look at Braveheart with the same respect. <br/><br/>The second warning is much more obscure, probably a mistake others are not likely to make, but still...  If you love Braveheart, or if you want to love Braveheart, never ever screen it directly after screening Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Oh, sure; should you disregard this warning, you will certainly have fun.  Rolling around on the floor and laughing until you hurt is generally enjoyable.  However, you will never again be able to view Braveheart with any type of dignity."
"SSand","10","1","3","22 December 1999"," Greatest film EVER...on all accounts!!!
","Braveheart is a film that has everything.  From romance to action, to adventure to purely amazing drama, it has it all.  This 3-hour-epic is brilliantly acted and directed by Mel Gibson.  It is based on the actual events of how Scotland overcame English rule to achieve it's own independence with the strong leadership of William Wallace (played by Mel Gibson).  It is also a great `David vs. Goliath' story that really happened! <br/><br/>Also helping achieve #1 status in my book, is the great score composed by James Horner.  He gives the film a great feel in every moment and it really adds to this picture.  <br/><br/>Braveheart also contains what is in my opinion the greatest film segment in movie history.  The segment, which takes place almost at the very end of the film, is about 3 and a half minutes long and is marvelously done by Mel Gibson.  The cut-aways that Gibson uses during this segment, combined with his great acting, and arguably the best score ever composed by James Horner, really makes this an incredible 210 seconds.  Mel Gibson continually amazed me with his direction and brilliant acting throughout the movie (especially the well constructed battle scenes).  <br/><br/>I look forward to seeing more films that are directed by him in the future, and HIGHLY recommend that anyone who hasn't seen this film to do so.  Some have complained at the speed which Braveheart starts, and I fully understand this minor complaint, but I feel the first 20-25 minutes that people normally complain about is vital to setting up William Wallace's character, as well as the entire film.  The fact that Mel Gibson (who won best director and Braveheart did win best picture) was overlooked for an Oscar nomination is beyond me."

","In 1995, Mel Gibson starred and directed Braveheart, a cinematic re- telling of the story of William Wallace, a Scottish legend who is purported to have secured Scottish freedom from the English crown.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films of all time. Mel Gibbson has done quite well in his role. Many people have pointed out that Mr Gibson have taken more than a few liberties with the historical accuracy of this movie. But regardless, it's a very fine piece of cinema making. The action scenes are superb and the acting down to smallest bit part is convincing. Some might question if it deserved the Oscar or not, but in my humble opinion, it was more than well deserved. The battle scenes are ground breaking. <br/><br/>Ten out ten."
"T.C.-4","9","1","3","23 September 1999"," One of the most politically important films of all-time
","In criticizing BRAVEHEART, it is easy to jump on such perceived failings as excessive violence or homophobia or historical inaccuracy. What is easy to miss in assessing the movie, however, is its astonishing political resonance. It is difficult to think of a single movie which catalyzed a political process - in this case, Scotland's current move for independence - to the degree that this one has. No matter how manipulative the film may be, it demonstrated to the world an undeniable truth: That Scotland is not ""English"", that it has a national character and a history all its own, along with a deep resentment of the way it has been subsumed into ""Great Britain"".<br/><br/>On a technical level, BRAVEHEART is a wonder. While acknowledging the importance of second unit director Mic Rodgers, it is difficult to think of a second outing by a director that is as ambitious and, ultimately, successful as this. I would argue that John Toll's cinematography and James Horner's score are the pinnacles of their respective crafts in the '90s.<br/><br/>But it is on the emotional side (Duly supported by consummate craftsmanship) that BRAVEHEART triumphs. No matter how many times I view the film, I am thoroughly engaged in the heartbreak of young William's loss of his father and brother and the supreme sacrifice Wallace makes for nothing more than love of honor and freedom."

"jacobhunt6","8","1","4","30 April 2019"," I have certain feelings towards Mel Gibson, but all credit to him
","Braveheart is a work of passion and an inspiring historical picture that encapsulates the spirit of the legend of William Wallace, if not quite as much the accurate legend itself. This is Mel Gibson's finest work and his dedication and love of the project shine through in his raw and emotional directing style and leading performance.
There are times that Braveheart feels a little bit self-indulgent from Gibson's perspective. The film gives birth to rousing monologues and inspirational battle sequences that revolve entirely around Gibson's impassioned performance as Wallace, and while it is undeniably a masterpiece of a film, there is certainly a reflection of the Australian's high opinion of himself in this project.
Nonetheless, his performance certainly does make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck, and the gritty, bloody style of this film makes it a historical epic worth watching. It is confronting, heart-breaking, heart-warming and uplifting in many ways throughout its three-hour runtime.
The score by James Horner is superb, and Gibson's use of the orchestral soundtrack to further amplify the emotional impact of this story is legendary. The addition of bagpipes to the typical action-adventure score is a neat touch that is as effective as it is symbolic.
But as many times as I watch this film and love it to bits, I cannot help but feel that the combination of certain historical inaccuracies and Gibson's hogging of the spotlight slightly undermine the authenticity and genuineness of the film. This is only a tiny seed of doubt that is quenched by my love of the dialogue, action sequences and music, but it is there, and I do wish that another performance had risen to the fore to make it feel slightly less self-promoting.
However, a self-promotion or not, it is a wonderful film, and we can only give credit to Gibson for one of the greatest performances and one of the greatest historical films of the 20th century."

","Braveheart, the 1995 production of Randall Wallece's scriptwriting, the director's chair, and Mel Gibson's lead; he successfully reflected on the epic story of William Wallace, who did not loyal to King I. Edward, stand on the front line of the Scottish freedom struggle, and he won five Oscars that year, including Best Picture. The film, which included a lot of fiction, even though it came from a historical reality, made us feel the last of the scottish people and the wisdom of William Wallace's wrath, hopes and freedom in our pursuit of freedom and invited us to their world and dragged us along with them to search for freedom
It is a film that even preserves its influence in 1995. Mel Gibson is a great example of masterpieces in his companionship. Mel Gibson, who plays both acting and directing roles, has managed to get out of the job very well. Braveheart has been watched for many years in our country with great interest, and has become a focus for the filmmakers. We can call a historical event, a successful expression of your personality, a fuller scenario, a successful production and a master player, as the reason why Braveheart is seen so much around the world.<br/><br/>The film is based on the Scottish people's struggle for independence. Mel Gibson has brought William Wallace to character and this character has become a very popular character all over the world. In fact, the life of the film has increased further. Catherine McCurmock in the role of Murron, though rarely seen in the film, has actually been featured in the spectator with pure and clean beauty. This 177-minute film, with the director's editing, has a feature that does not squeeze the viewer at a distance, compared to many other films. I can say Filmin has a lot of improvements.
Filmin Cinematographer John Toll, James Horner, who we know from Tinanic in music, Art Directors were carefully selected and did a great job. It is a wonderfully satisfying artwork, both in terms of visuals and music. The film also features Oscars. She has also won prizes in the Bafta, Golden Globes and other award ceremonies.<br/><br/>The winning Oscars are:<br/><br/>So Good Director (68th Academy Awards 1996)

You can take the boy, but we will never be free.
Everyone dies, but not every person really lives.Braveheat (Braveheart) has become a film of freedom and hope. Do not be late anymore if you've been watching this film that's been defying years."

"TheNabOwnzz","9","1","4","30 April 2018"," Powerful, emotional, epic, sensational story about what it means to be free
","An incredible motion picture, Braveheart is a sensational masterpiece and one of the greatest movies ever put to screen. It is a feast of color, motion, sound and emotion which delivers one of the greatest cinematic experiences one could ever hope to get.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is pretty much the ultimate cinematic experience. We witness brutality, tragedy, love, redemption, revenge and much more in the course over just the first hour. The rest of the movie is equally great, but i would pick the first hour as the ultimate cinematic experience. The small romantic part of the story between Wallace and his secret bride is quite short yet so convincing due to James Horner's incredible emotionally rich musical score or the little things such as him returning the flower she gave him as a child or the genuine and natural looks they give eachother without speaking that it makes it all the more emotional and powerful when his wife does eventually meet a terrible fate.<br/><br/>The acting is of top notch quality. Particularly Patrick McGoohan is extremely convincing as the ruthless King Edward Longshanks and Angus Macfadyen as Robert the Bruce caught between his own conscience while trying to pick the right side and make the right decisions. Gibson, Gleeson & O'Hara are also extremely convincing as the three leading men of the scottish army.<br/><br/>Yet what really makes Braveheart the movie into what it is is Gibson's character Wallace and his ideology for a free Scotland and his incapability of stopping until it is achieved. This is combined with excellent dialogue such as the speech before the battle of Stirling which makes his character the ultimate well developed idealist instead of a generic hero type. It is a powerful statement about freedom and what we are prepared to do in order to achieve it. <br/><br/>Some critics critize the lack of historical accuracy in Braveheart, which is mostly correct. However, these critics do not realize that film is a cinematic experience, and should not be judged by factors that have little to do with the actual cinematic experience. What Mel Gibson created here is an epic emotional journey that lives and breathes due to romanticizing history into fiction which only strengthened the movie itself. <br/><br/>Battle sequences are incredibly filmed. The cinematography is already great in Braveheart with many extraordinary sweeping landscape shots of the green planes of Scotland but in the battle of Stirling this reaches its quality climax. The widescreen shots of the entire English army with the trees in the background are just breath taking visual beauty that is a delight to the eyes. You can tell Gibson took inspiration from Akira Kurosawa's style ( creating epic widescreen shots with constant movement ) and in this particular scene especially Ran (1985) seems to have been a major influence. The battle sequences are always shot in a way that you can understand what is going on and how the battle is playing out, and the violence is realistic and brutal, as is the movie. Also admirable is Gibson's incredible use of slow motion or long drawn out rides of horses or men to build up tension to a point where we are sitting on the edge of our seat. It is a movie full of extremely well build tension, which is lacking in most films today.<br/><br/>With great dialogue, acting, cinematography, incredible music, tension, emotional value & many beautiful shots what Mel Gibson has achieved here is an absolute masterpiece of the historical epic genre."

","Braveheart is a film that potentially characterizes the war between two conflicting countries, it shows that the characters in the film are courageous people in the mind and the physical. One can notice that during the scene William Wallace the main character who invokes the other knights not to let go, that they must fight for their country. This scene is a highlight in the film because it represents ""humanitarian brave"", ""the independence of a country"". The decorations are magnificent are bright colors that represents nature in itself and the Scottish colors. The fighting games are very interesting sometimes a bit violent but that remains a humble fight. The characters are sometimes dressed not very presentable which shows the lack of hygiene in the film at the same time we are in a century where hygiene is not at the rendezvous. The scene of death of William Wallace is a scene that particularly affects the public because it is both emotional but rather violent."

","William Wallace was as a Scottish knight who became one of the main leaders during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th Century. Braveheart directed and starring Mel Gibson is a fictional telling of the Wallace story.<br/><br/>Gibson has produced a rip roaring adventure with bloody battles and visceral violence. He certainly has brought his experience of action from the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon films.<br/><br/>Patrick McGoohan is the hissable villain as King Edward 1 also known as Edward Longshanks. He is ruthless and cunning. Just see the way he disposes of his son's newly appointed war counsellor. Yet he will also bribe Scots noblemen with land in order for them to switch sides.<br/><br/>The film opens with Wallace as a child, his father killed in an unknown battle. The grown up Wallace just wants a peaceful existence as a farmer with the love of his life. All this is shattered with the despicable English, raping and pillaging like they were Vikings.<br/><br/>Gibson with writer Randall Wallace show a sure footing in the the story set up and the early battle scenes in the beautiful settings of Scotland and Ireland.<br/><br/>It is the latter part of the film that causes problems with pacing that makes the film overlong and the rather shady depiction of Robert the Bruce who is the better known Scots hero. Wallace who has been betrayed by some noblemen takes revenge against them like he was Zorro, he also has a fictional affair with Princess Isabelle which is almost laughable. The final scenes of torture where he is put on a cross makes it look like that he already was planning The Passion of the Christ."

","I really enjoyed this movie. I couldn't imagine someone giving this movie a poor rating because of some minor defects it may have. It might have some cinematographic errors, but that's not the point. The point is to express history as a watchable, visual experience. I'm sure Mel Gibson felt proud to play William Wallace, for in his mind he's recreating history. Though, for that reason, I give this movie an 8 instead of a 10 star rating. More of the actual history could've been included. One major flaw in the storyline of the movie (which had a window of 3 whole hours), is that it did not show the preparation Wallace's army had to go through to be able to fight the English. They went from pitchforks to axes to swords in no time at all in the movie version, but in the real-life historical version, it took some planning. Wallace was seen as a hero, but his victories came at more than a price than what was shown. I wished there was more rape, murder, and adultery in there to show just how cruel the English were. Anyways, that's my review."
"chucknorrisrules","7","1","4","8 August 2012"," Double-edged sword
","Braveheart is a film that I've found it hard to make up my mind about. I loved it when I first saw it, then I hated it when it started to fuel Anglophobia in Scotland, often with horrible consequences - for instance, a girl half-blinded in Aberdeen for being English.<br/><br/>The story is roughly based on the life of William Wallace, a minor knight who led a rebellion in medieval Scotland against English forces invading under the command of King Edward I. Wallace is successful, until his own countrymen betray him to military defeat, and betrayal to English forces, where he is executed.<br/><br/>What's good about this film? The characters are very likable, you really care about Wallace and his comrades and feel for what he is going through. The English get irredeemable characterisation - being the foes of the piece, but interestingly so do some of the Scottish nobles who are responsible for Wallace's downfall. The soundtrack, battles, and settings are top notch as well.<br/><br/>What's bad about this film? It forgets that it's not a history lesson and purports some of its mistakes as fact. And these aren't minor errors, but glaring ones that are so huge they are laughable - e.g. the french princess falling pregnant by Wallace. The Scottish response to this film is disturbing. English people living in Scotland has suffered horribly, despite this being a film based on out-of-date politics. Wallace is portrayed as a peasant farmer as are his comrades, again false. He and his men would've looked similar to the English soldiers as they appear in the film. Also, having the English with no redeemable qualities makes for poor characterisation, and inevitably weakens the film. Also the inaccuracies are a shame, because the story of Wallace is a really great story! A lot of these details are snubbed and forgotten, which is a real pity.<br/><br/>As a film, it is not to be taken seriously whatsoever. As a fictional account and entertainment, it's great.<br/><br/>Just don't go around attacking English people after seeing it, because that is unacceptable."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","4","28 May 2012"," Glorious epic and guts-directing at its best ...
","Cinematically speaking, Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" is a triumphal homage to a kind of old-school entertainment that deserted the big screens during the cynical 90's. And I believe that the controversy surrounding its Best Picture win has more to do with the degradation of Gibson's public image, than the content of his film which is no better, no worse than some antagonist's portrayal found in Spielberg's movie..<br/><br/>Now, to ""Braveheart': with this catchy title, Mel Gibson delivers a flamboyant epic that pays homage to one of the greatest Scottish heroes, William Wallace. Therefore, he finds the perfect tone required for such portrayals: it's grandiose without being over-the-top, it builds a legend but not a myth. Gibson, with a remarkable craftsmanship, draws the perfect line between historical accuracy and legend and the way ""Braveheart"" oscillates between these two aspects is the true measure of the film's greatness both in the form and in the content.<br/><br/>Indeed, when historical accuracy can be questioned, the film is immediately redeemed by some of the bloodiest and most realistic battle scenes ever filmed, and when the myth is too big to be believable, the story is elevated to a sort of abstract and hypnotic beauty, conveying the feeling of a myth that historians couldn't properly reach. ""Braveheart"" is like a ""Gladiator"" with a ferocious and passionate heart pumping and driving its dynamics, with a thrilling thirst of fights and battle, and what makes it superior than ""Gladiator"" rely on a famous quote from this film : 'Are you not entertained?"" <br/><br/>Mel Gibson won two Oscars on that 1996, for Best Director and Best Picture. Both satisfy me, but the directing one, even more. Gibson's talent behind the camera literally implodes on our faces and is as much a revelation, as the existence of this William Wallace figure, now, a cinematic legend. Gibson is so talented that he doesn't even take for granted his story's material, after all, with a handsome hero who leads a revolt against an invader, you can't fail, just copy some respected epics, such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"", add some complexity on the character, make his handsome, and brave with a wound in his heart, and use the biggest part of the budget on the battles. Really? <br/><br/>If the recipe was so sure, there wouldn't be so many epics that sunk into oblivion, think of all the post-""Braveheart"" films, the ""Troy"", ""Alexander"", not to mention the infamous ""Vercing√©torix', all these movies were probably less controversial than ""Braveheart' but less memorable as well. Gibson doesn't do an epic for the sake of it, and it shows, he wants also to tell us a story and to make it believable. His battles are more than two crowds of soldier colliding for a bloody mess, there is military strategy in ""Braveheart"", warfare. If you pay attention, you may quickly realize that beyond the historical setting, ""Braveheart"" is also one of the greatest and most convincing war films.<br/><br/>And the storytelling extends the limits of the war. Wallace is not just a leader painting his face in white and blue, he's the exaltation of the romantic figure in such a modern way it can feel anachronic. He's the quintessential hero, charismatic as hell, handsome, sweet and gentle or ferocious and impetuous when duty calls but also vulnerable and overly idealistic. Mel Gibson signs an extraordinary performance on an Oscar worthy level. So when the film opens with these lines ""You may call me a liar, but history is written by those who hang heroes"", which is a subtle way to leave the benefit of doubt to the story. At the end, we're intelligent enough to make the difference and Gibson trusts this very intelligence.<br/><br/>Maybe Wallace was not that 'perfect', maybe Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) was not such a ruthless and evil man and his son an effeminate weakling, but these considerations hardly matter in a spectacular film like ""Braveheart'. Yes, it's Manichean, yes it emphasizes the hero's value and demonise the villains but would have the film worked better on the field of political correctness.. By the way, to those who criticized the one-dimensional portrayal of British, I thought that the portrayal of the Scottish nobles as morally corrupted men was harsher than the British, who were only defending their interests.<br/><br/>Again, I suspect these critics are influenced by the many controversies that affected Mel Gibson's career recently. People are now so eager to prove that he's a racist bigot, that ""Braveheart"" is used as the most blatant alibi. What I see in ""Braveheart"" is not a racist film but the birth of a cinematic talent, free-spirited, independent and bold in its depiction of violence, in ""Braveheart"", the violence displayed in ""Apocalypto"" and ""The Passion of Christ"" are hinted. In an era where many acclaimed directors lose their touch like Scorsese and Tarantino, Gibson knows how to associate guts. Everything is efficient on every cinematic level, the cinematography, the editing, the beautiful music from James Horner and maybe more than that, the acting.<br/><br/>Every actor shines within the limits of his role and manages to transcend the conventions applying to their characters, McGoohan is magnificently evil as the demoniac King and while we're shocked by some of his lines and actions, we can't help but respect the Machicavellian genius, Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCornick are equally good in the two female characters who'll conquer Wallace's heart, while Brendan Gleeson is the perfect gentle brute sidekick. And Angus McFayden deserves a worthy mention as Robert the Bruce, the tortured man torn between his admiration toward Wallace and his ambition to get on the throne.<br/><br/>""Braveheart"" is also an insightful journey into warfare, politics and Machiavellism, but more than that, transcended, by Mel Gibson's mind-blowing talent in both acting and directing, it's also pure entertaining and one hell of a film."
"sddavis63","6","1","4","6 April 2012"," A Good Tribute To William Wallace - But What's With Isabella?
","As a tribute to William Wallace - one of Scotland's great national heroes in its ancient (and in some ways still ongoing) battle for freedom from England - this movie works very well. Wallace (portrayed by Mel Gibson) is a heroic figure in this. As a viewer you have no choice but to admire him for his courage and his fierce devotion to Scotland, and for his ability to rally the Scots around him. He certainly comes across as more consistently devoted to Scotland's freedom than, for example, Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFadyen) - which, in truth, he was. The title misleads, however. ""Braveheart"" was the name applied to Robert and not to William, and Robert, generally speaking, has received far greater acclaim in Scottish history.<br/><br/>There's a lot to like about this movie. The sets and costumes are wonderful, and there are some spectacular shots of beautiful Scottish scenery throughout. The battle scenes between the Scots and the English are marvellously choreographed, and Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is compelling. The last half hour or so, which revolves around Wallace's capture, torture and finally his execution at the hands of the English is fascinating for its look at some of the torture techniques of the day, and for the same reason, it's disturbing. One gains a sense of the conundrum faced by the Scots, with divided loyalties and shifting alliances among themselves.<br/><br/>There are also some things not to like in this, however. One could go on in great detail about the historical inaccuracies - and many have done just that. I have no desire to rehash them - but I will mention the one that really stood out for me: the depiction of the relationship between Wallace and Isabella. Let's first point out that Isabella was about 10 years old when Wallace was executed - making their relationship as depicted here quite unlikely, made moreso by the fact that the two never met, and that Edward I would have been unlikely to have entrusted a diplomatic mission (which is where the two are depicted as meeting for the first time) into the hands of a young female child. There's also the fact that Isabella didn't marry Edward II until 3 years after Wallace's death. For all those reasons, it was ridiculous to suggest near the end that Isabella implied to Edward I on his deathbed that she was carrying a child who was actually the son of Wallace. That portrayal mystified me and bothered me, and really detracts from the overall credibility of the story. It's dealing with a Scottish hero, so one expects dramatic licence and a bit of playing loose with history - but why this, which is so bizarre and so inaccurate? All it does is give a soap-ish feel to the story, while it adds nothing of any real significance.<br/><br/>That's my main criticism of this movie - and for me at least, it's a big criticism. It detracts a lot because of its extreme inaccuracy, and because of the amount of unnecessary time the faked relationship takes up in the film. And it adds exactly nothing to the story. So this is a good tribute to William Wallace, definitely portraying him in deservedly heroic terms, but that detour into mere fable is a huge problem. (6/10)"

","""Braveheart"" is just awe-inspiring and spectacular and leaves the viewer with a lot to think about. There is no specific good guy or bad guy in this story. Each character is well-developed and always has something good about them. Just as they have some problems, as well.<br/><br/>The story is about William Wallace, a man who had a rough childhood, and has come back to his village in Scotland to make a farm. He doesn't want anything to do with the war that the king of England does. When he returns, he falls in love with a woman, and they get married, hoping to settle down together. But after a tragedy, William goes mad and creates one of the biggest revolutions Scotland has ever seen.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson both directed and starred in this movie, and he proves that he is good both on and off-screen. The character of William Wallace is so dimensional, and is not as easy to like as characters in other films. He does some very unmoral things throughout the film, such as sleeping with another woman even though he claims to be in love with his late wife.<br/><br/>A lot of people complain about the fact that the movie doesn't follow the true story. I can't say anything about that, as I don't know the true history. All I know is that this movie is done extremely well, and is very enjoyable.<br/><br/>In all, I recommend this movie to anyone who won't compare this to the real story, and who doesn't mind violence, because there's a lot of it.<br/><br/>Braveheart, Directed by Mel Gibson 9/10"
"Desertman84","10","1","4","7 March 2012"," A Spectacular Entertainment
","Braveheart is a historical drama film directed by and starring Mel Gibson. The film was written for the screen and then novelized by Randall Wallace. Gibson portrays William Wallace, a 13th century Scottish warrior who gained recognition when he came to the forefront of the First War of Scottish Independence by opposing King Edward I of England,portrayed by Patrick McGoohan,is also known by the nickname ""Longshanks"".<br/><br/>The story begins with young Wallace, whose father and brother have been killed fighting the English, being taken into the custody of his uncle, a nationalist and pre-Renaissance renaissance man. He returns twenty years later, a man educated both in the classics and in the art of war. There he finds his childhood sweetheart Murron, and the two quickly fall in love. There are murmurs of revolt against the English throughout the village, but Wallace remains aloof, wishing simply to tend to his crops and live in peace. However, when his love is killed by English soldiers the day after their secret marriage (held secretly so as to prevent the local English lord from exercising the repulsive right of prima noctae, the privilege of sleeping with the bride on the first night of the marriage), he springs into action and single-handedly slays an entire platoon of foot soldiers. The other villagers join him in destroying the English garrison, and thus begins the revolt against the English in what will eventually become full-fledged war. Wallace eventually leads his fellow Scots in a series of bloody battles that prove a serious threat to English domination and, along the way, has a hushed affair with the Princess of Wales before his imminent demise.<br/><br/>Braveheart looks like a true epic -- even if it is both bloody and bloody long.A huge, bloody and sprawling epic,it is the sort of massive vanity piece that would be easy to disparage if it didn't essentially deliver.Mel Gibson, long-time heartthrob of the silver screen, came into his own as a director.As a filmmaker, he lacks the epic gift, but the movie works on a fairly basic level as a hiss-the-English medieval Western.Distractingly violent and historically dodgy, Gibson's directorial work justifies its epic length by delivering enough sweeping action, drama, and romance to match its ambition.One of the most spectacular entertainments in years."
"Maniac-9","10","1","4","23 February 2012"," One of the best epic movies of all time
","Braveheart is one of the best epic war movies ever put on film. The battle scenes in this movie are truly well made from a choreography and cinematography perspective.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson who not only is the main star of the movie but also runs the whole show with being the director and one of the producers. William Wallace is probably the best role of his career. I like him in the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon movies also but this is where he truly shines as an actor.<br/><br/>The movie also has a great supporting cast with Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, Catherine McCormack, Brendan Gleeson, Angus Macfadyen and Brian Cox."
"The-Sarkologist","6","1","4","28 October 2011"," Nothing really all that special
","After seeing Chasing Amy and A Bullet in the Head, Braveheart just did not seem to match up. I remember the first time I saw this movie: actually half this movie, was at a friends house where everybody had crowded into the small loungeroom, most uncomfortable. The image that remained was when they were eviscerating Mel Gibson. It was only implied, but that must hurt when done in real life. It also shows how barbaric the English at that time really were.<br/><br/>Braveheart is about William Wallace, a scot in the 12th century whose wife was killed by the English after he save her from being raped by some soldiers. This started a huge war between the Scots and the English. The English had subdued the Scots for a while, but at this time Scotland was still independent with its own king. In fact Scotland was allied with France because the Scots hated the English and the French hated the English. It was that Scotland was easier to subdue that France. Scotland only became a part of Great Britain in the 16th century (I think - can't recall off hand). The movie is about one man's fight for freedom and how he is able to bring the people along with him. It is about how people will overcome the most amazing odds and win simply for freedom. They believed that they could never defeat the English but this was proved wrong on the battle field when the English were slaughtered.<br/><br/>The movie also highlights the idea a barbarity and how it is a purely subjective idea. The English claimed that the Scots were barbaric, and Wallace even agreed that he was, only to prove the Princess of Wales wrong when he spoke to her in fluent French. He appeared to be a barbarian, but was in fact a civilised man. The English, who saw themselves at the epitome of civilisation, in reality were barbaric in the way they did everything.<br/><br/>The one thing I like about the movie is Edward Longshanks. He is very much the ruthless king. He looks the part and he plays the role with absolute savagery. Yet though he is powerful in life, his death is not able to change his weak willed son, and cannot stop his bastard grandson inheriting the throne. This grandson becomes Edward III, one of my favourite kings in the way that he seized the throne back from his usurping regent and then went to war on the French in 1327 and caused the irreparable damage."
"davidfyfe99","7","1","4","7 May 2010"," The Academy got it wrong but.....
","I have tried to sit through this film on many occasions and haven't managed for several reasons, the primary one being that the Academy thought Gibson was a better director than Michael Mann and Ron Howard ( I don't recall if Mann was nominated, he certainly should have been), another being that I just can't stand the sight of Mel Gibson, another being that the Scottish accents are absolutely DREADFUL. I have, however, set myself a goal to see every Best Picture winner in reverse chronological order (yes I am an anorak) and Braveheart happens to be the first I haven't seen. So I finally managed to get through it and my conclusions are as follows:<br/><br/><ul><li>It's really quite a well made film, actually most of Gibsons directing efforts are good films production wise - I guess it wouldn't have had such commercial appeal if he used Scottish actors and no-one understood what the hell they were saying -the Academy showered it with awards because it has all the ingredients of what they normally give all the big awards to ie, an inspirational true story (although Gibson was quite creative with historical events), a great soundtrack, a tragic tear-jerking ending....</li></ul><br/><br/>So yes, the Academy got it wrong, but it's not the first or last time, the biggest injustice ever is that Slumdog Millionaire was showered with so many awards, it was a good, entertaining film, but that's it, no way it deserved the awards it got. Oh, and considering the other nominees for '95, I think probably Sense and Sensibility and Apollo 13 were better films than Braveheart, but 'Heat' was the best big studio film of the year and it wasn't nominated, and Michael Mann was the best director."

"andrew7","9","1","4","15 February 2002"," Great, but over-rated
","This is not, repeat not, the greatest film of all time.  I'm sorry, it just isn't.  My advice, to everyone who maintains that it is, is to immediately go out and see ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Spartacus"", two other historical war epics which each have far more depth than ""Braveheart"".  If you still say ""Braveheart"" is better, then we can disagree amicably, but I can't take seriously anyone who trumpets ""Braveheart"" without having seen its ancestors.  <br/><br/>What bothers me about this film is its simplicity.  But I mentioned in another comment that simplicity and power go hand in hand, and this is definitely a powerful movie.  But for me, its that same simplicity that prevents ""Braveheart"" from being elevated to the level of a true cinematic classic.  <br/><br/>The villain in ""Braveheart"", Edward the Longshanks, is a one-note villain. He is an interesting character (villains usually are), but he is simply evil.  There are no shades of grey there.  Compare to the villain of ""Spartacus"", Crassus, portrayed by Laurence Olivier.  Here is an infinitely more complex character.  Crassus is a character for whom the audience can feel a degree of sympathy, even when siding against him.  It's impossible to feel sympathy for Longshanks.  The man is not human.<br/><br/>But then again, it's the simplicity that makes the film powerful.  The audience feels a deep and stomach-churning hatred for Longshanks, which is important.  That hatred is an important motivating factor. <br/><br/>
Now look at the hero.  William Wallace is uncompromisingly good.  No matter how vicious he is in battle, how brutal in war, we know that his motivations are utterly noble.  There is a level of historical inaccuracy here, I'm sure.  His principle that the nobles exist to provide the people with freedom is, I think, a highly anachronistic political principle.  But nevermind.  I hate people who quibble about historical accuracy in films. It's a movie, not a history lesson.  <br/><br/>Anyway, compare to the hero in ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  He is in a similar position, and has similar goals.  But that turns a very critical eye toward all the violence involved in achieving freedom, and a very critical eye toward Lawrence himself.  Again, ""Braveheart"" lacks this depth. <br/><br/>
Lack of depth is not such a terrible criticism of a film, not when the story, shallow as it may be, is so strong.  And not when the performances are so strong, and the direction is so strong.  But when people are talking about the greatest film of the 20th century, as many people here are claiming this to be, I think there needs to be a higher standard at work than that.  The bottom line is that ""Braveheart"" is an excellent and highly entertaining film.  Despite its length, it is riveting from beginning to end (except that denouement, which is a little drawn out there at the end).  It is an emotional monster, getting right into your guts and kicking the wind out of you again and again.  The supporting cast is wonderfully.  The political intrigue going on is fascinating.  But, this is not the best ever. For me, it would probably fall somewhere in the lower half of my personal top 100 list, if I ever bothered to compile one.  I give it 7.5/10."

","I think this was one of the first films I remember seeing that was directed by the star, and it is a fantastic one, from Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated director Mel Gibson. Set in 14th Century Scotland, William Wallace (Gibson) was living a peaceful life with new wife Murron (Catherine McCormack), until she is killed by the soldiers, so he leads a rebel army to fight for the freedom of his country. They may be slightly outnumbered against the armies of the sneering King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan), but they manage to win the battles they encounter. Wallace becomes a name to be reckoned with, and he also forms a bond with Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau). But Wallace is captured when he is betrayed by Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), and he faces a slow and painful death when he refuses to beg for mercy, and before beheaded, his last noble word is ""Freedom!"" The army of Scotland, and Ireland, continue the fight in his honour, and they won their freedom. Also starring Brendan Gleeson as Hamish, James Cosmo as Campbell, David O'Hara as Stephen, Ian Bannen as Leper, Peter Hanly as Prince Edward, Sean Lawlor as Malcom Wallace, Brian Cox as Argyle Wallace and Alun Armstrong as Mornay. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Makeup and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for James Horner, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Sound, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay.

","Mel Gibson is an absolute madman, and this movie is an absolute masterpiece. A nearly perfect film. The script may not be historically accurate, but the medieval atmosphere is flawless, the acting is superb, and the score complements and sharpens the passion of the struggle portrayed. 
 The story revolves around three men that exemplify Hollywood archetypes William Wallace- an man of uncompromising principle, personally devastated and wholly devoted to his cause. 
 King Edward I- A pure villain in the context of this film, the whites of his eyes glow with evil. McGoohan is tasked with difficult soliloquy which he delivers without contrivance. 
 It is Robert the Bruce, however, that is the film's most compelling character. Whereas Wallace and Longshanks are one dimensional- their actions are guided by the rails of their existence, The Bruce grapples internally with acceptance of the seemingly inevitable- defying his father who attempts to steer him down the path of the cynic. 
 While Wallace is supported by his loyal friends, and Longshanks will is unchallenged by his constituents, The Bruce must find the strength to forego the safe path chosen by his nobles and family.
 At no point during any of the film's epic battles does the suspension of disbelief wane, and the emotional crescendo would make any man proud to be Scottish, even if only to remember moments later that they are not, in fact, Scottish."

"film-critic","9","1","5","21 February 2008"," Would you trade your land for freedom?
","Gibson, to create ""Braveheart"", pulled from every epic imaginable. His use of battle sequences, heroics, and individuality ring eerily close to that of ""Spartacus"", ""Gladiator"", and ""Ben-Hur"", yet even with these clich√©s riding well within the film, Gibson creates his own style and voice. Watching this epic, one must take it in four different slices to fully appreciate the work, and while they all may pair differently apart, it is what they do together that creates the magic. To begin, the direction is nearly flawless. A scene that stands out is when one of the nobles is dreaming of an attacking Wallace, only to wake and witness Wallace barge in through the door in a beautiful black stallion. It, like many other scenes, was breathtaking and flawless. Gibson has an eye for shots that are considered ""beautifully gruesome"", meaning that colors, placement, and camera angle are visionary, while the action on screen may make your stomach a bit squeamish. His direction showed a realistic view of the battle and filth surrounding Scotland during this dark time, and it is his work behind the camera that continues to make this film rank amongst the greatest ever.<br/><br/>The next element that one must slice into is the story, which in my eyes, is the weakest element to this film. While it is emotional to watch the love story unfold, the eye-candy battle sequences, and the picture-esquire view of Scotland, there seemed to be a lacking ""meat"" to this story. Wallace was angered by what happened to his one true love, but we never get the chance to see his years of living with Uncle Argyle come into fruition. He spouts Latin and French randomly, he uses original battle tactics, and there is talk of Rome at one point, but I wouldn't have found it difficult at all to see a young William Wallace take shape under Argyle. It would have been impressive to see this hero's roots, to take his passion from more than just his father's death into a whole new realm. Throughout this film, watching it in 2008, there wasn't much substance to Wallace. He fought with pride, patriotism, and with his heart, but we never were able to define him as a character. We knew he could fight ¬ñ but how? We knew he loved this girl from the village ¬ñ but we needed a deeper back story! The fight scenes were brilliant, but they did not help me see the true William Wallace. We charged through the film making it from points A to B to C, but never gave us the appetizers in between. More critical today of films than I was in 1995, perhaps a viewpoint from the English side would have strengthened the background. I don't believe all English were this harsh, where were the other elements that may have helped Wallace's crusade? These are just missing pieces that would have strengthened ""Braveheart"" and pushed it to a new level.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the next slice is sound. The power of the battlefield, the yell of Wallace's ""FREEDOM"" and the bagpipes echoing through James Horner's score engulfs the power of the film. It is the sound that makes ""Braveheart"" the epic that it is. Without the sounds of battle, without the sounds of the majestic mountains, without the sound of love ¬ñ this could not have won the awards it did. As a viewer, it is the most exciting part of this film and the flawless. While one can argue there are directorial decisions that Gibson could have done better, stronger acting choices, and a more structured story ¬ñ it is the sound that goes without question. It is perfection. Horner's work is mesmerizing and fantastic. He should have won an Oscar for his sole work on this picture.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the acting of ""Braveheart"". Gibson wasn't nominated for an Oscar, which doesn't surprise me watching it now in 2008. Gibson, prior to this film, was thought of as the pretty boy/bad boy persona. Seeing it in the theaters women were swooning over the scantily clad Gibson and that in itself proves that he didn't shake the predetermined image. There were scenes in which Gibson was smiling, or that his eyes seemed to be bluer than the sky, or that blood seemed to be splattered to an exact location on his body ¬ñ he seemed to have trouble shaking the beauty of Gibson ¬ñ and I fault him for that. The others in the film were decent, but nobody stood out as exemplary. Coupled with the less meaty story, the characters seemed clich√© ridden. There was the ""best-friend"", the ""love-interest"", the bad King, and the loyal psychopath ¬ñ all of which can be seen in any other period piece film. I don't believe the acting was up to par with the rest of the film, and the Academy noticed. <br/><br/>Overall, despite my best efforts to find major flaws with this film, it is still an amazing piece of cinema to watch. ""Braveheart"" deserves every award that it has won and others should credit it as the launching pad that finally gave us ""Last Temptation of Christ"" and ""Apocalypto"". Gibson has taken his fame from this film, changed the glamour of it all, and handed us some gritty portraits of the past. I wish he could have done the same here, but I don't think 1995 was ready for it. Gibson pushed the envelope with gore and carnage, and it continues to steal your breath away ¬ñ yet ""Braveheart"" needed to be more than just that. He couples it with amazing sound, but troubles it with a struggling story and weak characters. Watch it ¬ñ over and over. It may be a long film, but it is worth every minute.<br/><br/>Grade: **** out of *****"
"dbn3","5","1","5","14 November 2003"," In Serious Need of a Good Editor (5/10)
","[I saw this on DVD, YMMV]<br/><br/>Weighing in at over three hours this movie is way too long and in need of some serious trimming.  I suspect this was a Mel Gibson pet project and no one would stand up to him and tell him to leave large parts on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The plot is morally and ethically pure.  Wallace is the Good Guy who plays the part of Christ (and just in case you miss the symbolism, Wallace is stretched onto a cross or in a cross-like shape no fewer than three times as he is tortured to death).  King Longshanks is the Bad Guy who will stop at nothing to kill and torture all the poor Scots he can get his hands one. Conveniently Wallace has all his family killed so he has no attachments and can spend the rest of this movie trying to defeat the Bad Guy.  The love story and betrayal themes are of the depth and complexity of the one in, say, Titanic.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were just campy.  Every time one took place with the ""ooofs"" and ""aaarghs"" it sounded like fighting in Monty Python's Holy Grail.

","I finally got around to seeing Braveheart more than two years after it came out. Sure, I read the great reviews, saw it get all those academy awards. I believed the hype, and so I made the huge mistake of watching this movie, which I must say is absolutely ridiculous start to finish, in my opinion. This refers to plot, dialog, acting and everything in between. I don't care if it's based on a true story - it felt fake. After I realized that I would not enjoy it on an artistic level, I started noticing its more amusing aspects, so it wasn't a complete waste of time, which is why I did not rate it a 1.<br/><br/>I have now seen many, many Mel Gibson films, and have reached the sad conclusion that he's not much of an actor (or a director, but never mind that). Now, this saddens me, because there is a vast quantity of Mel movies that one can (unfortunately) be exposed to, few of them any good - and strangely enough, the LW series is one such exception. Perhaps he should have brought Danny Glover along for this one as well?<br/><br/>I console myself with the thought that members of the academy must have forgotten to watch the many, many movies that came out and were better than this one.

","Mel Gibson again plays the berserker movie fans love so much.  While Braveheart may be entertaining to watch, it is a favorite formula repeated. My major discomfort with the movie comes right at the end when old Mel screams ""freedom"".  Contemporary viewers hear and know exactly what he means, but...people of the British Isles did not know ""freedom"" nor believe in it as we do today.  Individual freedom did not exist in Europe. Freedom for Wallace would be his ability to choose his own master from the aristocracy and not the freedom to be a king, as we would like to think we have the freedom to be today.  Individuals in the tribes of the British Isles were raised to be what their father's were.  They could be nothing else.  Peasants never became kings, and never believed they could.  The belief in freedom to be whatever we choose, or have the skills to become, came from the original people of America, the First Americans.  Too bad they receive no credit."

","This is the best work Gibson ever created. I'm certain some would argue for The Passion Of The Christ and to them I would say that it's not a fair comparison. Gibson was at the helm on Passion but he played multiple roles both behind and in front of the camera on Braveheart. <br/><br/>I would also like to point out how Gibson's faith has played a major role in the pictures he's made. Both William Wallace and the depiction of the crucification of Christ are based on similar characters I think. I also believe that Gibson himself must feel that he is somehow linked to the journey of both character's. Having is life under a microscope and being judged for his actions, especially if you take into consideration the public scrutiny he received for anti-semitic comments surely speak to this point. He must feel as though the is his cross to bear. Regardless, he has created some magnificent work along the way."

","Rarely do I find a film this long that can hold my attention the entire way through. ""Braveheart"" is composed of one brilliant scene after another, all due to Mel Gibson's excellent directing, as well as his superb acting. From an early scene in which the little girl hands young William Wallace a flower at the grave site to Wallace pleading to the enemy to apologize to Scotland's people in an almost unreal way, great care and direction was clearly given to every scene in this film. The battle scenes do not drag on too long as in films such as ""Lord of the Rings"" but instead are just long enough to keep us engaged. The battle scenes are masterfully balanced with scenes of dialogue and character development, which is important because it helps cause us to care about the characters. The film is brutal and violent by nature, so most likely it is not for everyone. Nevertheless, it's nearly perfect for me. Gibson draws the detail out just long enough to tell his whole story and still keep us engaged long enough to watch it all. A great, brilliant film, worthy of many of the Oscars it received. I can honestly call this one of the best films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

"artistsnwriters","10","1","8","16 March 2011"," Braveheart Delivers Like Campbell's Soup for the Soul
","After nearly fifteen, long years, I finally went out and bought this one just to see it again at my pleasure (after having seen it some five times before anyway), and in the forlorn hope that maybe Hollywood's artistic license might have finally given way to some measure of historical accuracy. William Wallace has always been one of my heroes‚Äîsort of a tortuous cross between Ethan Allen, George Rogers Clark, ""Mad"" Anthony Wayne, Stephen Decatur, and James Fenimore Cooper's fictitious Hawkeye. It was the film depiction of his nation's true-to-life brawl against the forces of English King Edward I Plantagenet Longshanks of this period (Edward, incidentally, was known as ""Longshanks"" owing to his ""great"" height at 6'2"", towering over his subjects who averaged, at the time, at about 5'6""‚Äî tops).<br/><br/>The film Braveheart itself, however, depicts the adult-life struggle of Wallace (Mel Gibson) to unify and galvanize his troops, and wrest his own Scots people free of the English Crown interloper, Edward I (Patrick McGoohan), who had set his eyes on Scotland ever since his ascendancy to the throne upon the death of his father, Henry III Plantagenet, in AD 1272. In addition, it took Edward nearly thirty-three years to nearly accomplish the objective never actually fully granted to him by force of arms. In the interim, Wallace is treated to everything from the horrid sight of hanged children, sexual purveyance (primoris nocti-actually, jus primae noctis) and the sanctioned murder of his own wife (Catherine McCormack) by a commandant of English regulars, battle sequences at Cambuskenneth Bridge, Stirling and Falkirk that you can ""feel"", and betrayal by one of his own confidants‚Äîboth on the field‚Äîand the one off‚Äîthat sealed his ultimate fate, resulting in his ""traitor's"" death at Smithfield, London on 24 August 1305. Gibson as (also) director was entirely charitable in visually sparing us most of the gratuitously gory details of this ghastly method of judicial execution.<br/><br/>As depicted in the film, Wallace was betrayed and captured in Scotland and sent south in AD 1305. There, in the Great Hall of Westminster, he was charged with and convicted of the five crimes of treason, sacrilege, robbery, murder, and arson‚Äîand with the attendant penalties for each. He was branded and hanged until unconscious (and not racked as shown); then revived, castrated, drawn and judicially eviscerated with his living entrails burned before his very eyes, beheaded (mercifully), and finally quartered. <br/><br/>His head was placed on a pike on then-London Bridge for all to see, and with the rest of his dismembered remains sent north for everyone else to see: his right arm to Newcastle, his left arm to Berwick, his right leg and torso to Perth, and his left leg and quarter to Aberdeen. Of course, this legal atrocity detonated in England's face some nine years later when King Robert I, 17th Earl of Bruce in Scotland thoroughly routed Longshanks' son's (Edward II's) troops at Bannockburn in AD 1314. It was ""payback"" time for the kangaroo-court murder of Wallace and Bannockburn was the deliverance; they being the promise and the proof, respectively.<br/><br/>His poignant end came, supine on the scaffold, seeing everyone from his slain wife come back to life, his friend who had betrayed him, and thoughts of Isabella, Princess of Wales (Sophie Marceau). Momentously, all the children who were compelled to watch this grisly, fourteenth-century killing brings to Braveheart a certain welcome pathos with the execution‚Äîa pity that subliminally encourages us to believe that the sacrifice was indeed ""worth it"".<br/><br/>Moreover, it is a reminder to all of us that freedom does indeed not only come with an expensive price tag, but with the continued price to pay that comes with any revolving line of credit connecting individual life and liberty.<br/><br/>However, now, some five inconsistencies need to be addressed here: <br/><br/>First, Wallace was not a peasant. He was raised and formally educated in the French Court and was a direct descendant of the Welsh Walays who had been earlier granted lands in Ayrshire, Scotland in AD 1110.<br/><br/>Second, there is no record whatsoever of the practice of primoris nocti, or the ""first night"". There was, however, the rule of ""jus primae noctis"", the law of the first night, which hovered for centuries over the villeins of Europe, and upheld by both the church and secular sybaritic jurisprudence.<br/><br/>Third, Edward Longshanks did not murder Edward, Prince of Wales' male lover, Peter de (Piers) Gaveston. He was murdered in AD 1312, some five years after Longshanks' death in July 1307.<br/><br/>Fourth, William ""Braveheart"" Wallace was not captured, as depicted, by foolishly walking straight into a British military outpost. Instead, he was deliberately betrayed by one of his closest friends who invited him for a drink at an inn in a little Scottish village called Robroyston.<br/><br/>Lastly, the film also indirectly referred to Isabella's ""pregnancy"" by Wallace. There is no record of Isabella having her first issue until AD 1312, the birth year of Edward III.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave Braveheart a five-star rating for not only its art direction and acting, but also, in a larger sense, for bringing to bear and to underscore the plight of the Scottish nation in those dark days. As an interesting aside, and for a number of years before Braveheart's release, the local Scots government in Edinburgh had been attempting to wrest more and more home rule from Whitehall, however, with little public support. <br/><br/>After the release of this movie, though, the community became fired up and electrified as Wallace's military troops were 700 years before, and home rule was eventually granted with England kowtowing to Scots' public pressure. The Scottish people thanked Mel Gibson profusely and he is now the unofficial, local national hero there, and no respectable household in the West Highlands' wee glens is devoid of a copy of this motion picture."

","The last time I checked, Scotland was still ruled by London, and is still the domain of the 'British' (actually German) royal family.<br/><br/>Braveheart was a huge deal when it first came out. I never really watched the film properly until recently. As a frequent cinema-goer since my youth I was not a part of the mid-nineties cultural phenomenon that was Braveheart's release in Scotland. I did turn up at the the cinema, the old Odeon in Edinburgh, but the queue went round the block (the literal term for a blockbuster) and there was no way in hell I was prepared to wait for three hours on a gray September afternoon (a choice I came to regret). Every subsequent attempt since then was blocked. I never rented the video as I didn't want to watch in pan-and-scan. The fact that every single living Scottish person had seen it apart from myself really got on my nerves, and I was quite bitter about it. And then, as the fever died down, I just kind of forgot about it and moved on.<br/><br/>Watching it fully as an adult I think I probably enjoy it more now that I would have done as a teenager. It's certainly a huge epic right up there with the best of them. Mel Gibson captures the pretty side of Scotland wonderfully with his scope photography accompanied by James Horner's bittersweet score. The film never really feels three hours long, the time just disappears.<br/><br/>Nearly every notable Scottish actor (apart from Connery and Connelly) appears at some point. From the brilliant (Brian Cox) to the dreary and pretentious (Peter Mullan). Keep a lookout for Tommy Flanagan too, in one of his earlier roles.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are impressive, but I wish there were more gory. Gibson's first cut of the film was apparently bloodier, I wish it had remained intact. But despite the grim satisfaction of seeing the English aggressors getting splattered the fact that Scotland IS still ruled by England kind renders Wallace's bravery irrelevant. It may have been 700 years ago, but I hate the fact that he ultimately died for nothing. We DON'T have a country of our own, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Maybe one day...in my lifetime."

I must agree that John Toll wields his camera with devastating effect, capturing some majestic Scottish countryside and breathing life (and much death) into some spectacularly choreographed battle scenes. However the other two awards I really find myself questioning.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong here, ""Braveheart"" is a worthy piece of entertainment of epic proportions, but proportions aren't everything. Technically the film is near flawless, with Toll's superb camera work backed up by artistic and very realistic makeup, fantastic sound and sound effects (makeup and sound effects won Oscars), top notch editing, striking costumes, convincing art and another strong, inspiring score form military soundtrack master James Horner (""Aliens"", ""Glory"" and ""Apollo 13"").<br/><br/>Gibson does direct with a purpose, setting out to make an epic, he gets almost everything right. Randall Wallace (any relation to the great William?) provides a sound screenplay, which seems to be quite historically accurate, even if it may take creative licence in the more private affairs of the mighty William Wallace. What screenwriter Randall does not do is allow us to really get into the head of the fearsome Scot, leaving us with only suggestions as to what motivated him. Lack of character depth, and therefore appreciation, can probably also be attributed to the absence of outstanding acting, which is the real reason ""Braveheart"" falls short of its enormous potential. A couple of knockout performances would have made this film an indelible memory, but alas none of the strong support cast (including Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack, Brenda Gleeson, Angus McFadyen, James Cosmo, David O'Hara, Peter Henly, James Robinson, Alun Armstrong and Ian Bannen) were able to turn in anything more than a 'thoroughly enjoyable'. And honestly, though we all love Mel with a passion, he's no' William Wallace, now is he? Gibson is always a pleasure on screen, and he does a good job with the accent, but I for one was never really convinced that this was the man who freed Scotland form the tyranny of English rule.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I would not hesitate to recommend ""Braveheart"" to all audiences who crave a blood stirring, passionate film, especially those who, like myself, have Scottish heritage. Do try and catch this at a repertory theatre. Not for the squeamish!<br/><br/>Monday, July 15, 1996 - Video"

Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally,the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war."

"tdrish","7","0","2","24 March 2020"," Solid film
","Braveheart was a solid film. It focuses in on one man who revolts a war against the king of Scotland for two reasons. One, is for revenge of a wrongdoing done to his family. Two, is for freedom from the royal crown. Everyone is afraid, and lacking a hero. Feast your eyes on Braveheart! If you can hear him galloping on his horse, its already too late....he's taking you and your friends out one by one, ending the lives in extreme brutality of everyone who betrayed him, and giving the country the freedom they long deserved. Unquestionably, this was Gibson at his very best, he roared with stylish action, however, my complaints on the film are numerous. I felt the film was over extended way beyond its running time. While the acting was astonishingly great, it felt there was either something missing, or too much of a good thing here, but either way, the film is far from perfect, and the cracks show from my perspective. This was one I could only watch one time, as the brutal and violent nature of the movie kept me from watching it again. The film has high tension and high levels of energy, could very well be the most energetic film from the mid 90's as we know it. Historically, I found it incorrect, but I think as long as you go into this and enjoy the film for what it is and don't nitpick and try to correct its mistakes, it should be a wonderfully engrossing film for your late evening viewing. I give Braveheart 7.5 out of 10 stars."

","Mel Gibson's Braveheart is a great movie, brimming with passion and energy. Loosely based on the Scottish folk hero William Wallace the film takes some liberty with the source but not so much that the history books change meaning. The film is exceptionally shot and photographed, well-acted (although perhaps a tad bit melodramatic) and features a great score which should rile the audience up. Mel Gibson is a talented artist and anyone saying ""Oh, he's a pretty boy"" should watch Braveheart to get an idea. Braveheart was responsible for an increase in tourism to Scotland as well as a new interest in the country's history. All reasons point towards a very well thought out and executed production. A must watch for history buffs, fans of film making and anyone with a passing interest in history."

"CubsandCulture","8","0","2","6 February 2019"," It is far better if you think of it as high fantasy epic
","This film is aggressively ahistorical. Some choices examples: serfs don't know what freedom is, there should be a bridge at Sterling, Isabelle was under 10 when Wallace got executed, prima nocta was not a thing. Basically, the film gets most of the names right. It also tends to get locations and broad outcomes of battles right. But that is it. If you think too much about this stuff the film becomes a farce. However, on my last viewing I decided to think of it as a LOTR sequel and lo I was swept up in it like I hadn't been before.<br/><br/>A lot of the strength of the film is thanks to Gibson's direction (and psychological leakage). The film's violence is brutal and gory. The vistas are utterly gorgeous but the characters are all dirty. The framing, composition is all bold and mathematical. The film has a very masculine energy that is very compelling. The script might be ahistorical nonsense but it has a blunt sense of just desserts. I.e. Prima Nocta and Isabelle's secret.<br/><br/>This is a great film to watch with just the music."

"suicidea","7","0","7","24 October 2018"," The poster boy for ""movies that haven't aged well""
","I was in my early 20's when I had the chance to see Mel Gibson's Braveheart on the big screen, sadly along with a classroom of young giggling girls behind my seat. I still remember what a huge experience it was on first viewing, full of excitement, great scenery, incomparable battle scenes, and wonderful dialogue with a very memorable scene after scene every minute. The story of a commoner who rebelled against a huge kingdom when his secret bride is murdered was, in one word, majestic.<br/><br/>Years later, however, most of these views changed. First, the Internet came into our homes, and as I did a bit of reading about history, I began to realize the mind-numbing historical inaccuracies that Braveheart has. Now I don't mind altering history a bit in movies for the sake of entertainment, but certainly not to this extent. Braveheart, in fact, is not an historic film at all: It uses names, characters and events from history, but rearranges them to fit its story. In fact, it's not too different from Tarantino's excellent Inglorious Basterds in that aspect.<br/><br/>Second, DVDs came into our homes, and upon a couple of repeated viewings, those ""incomparable"" battle scenes turned out to be somewhat ordinary, then bad, then straight up laughable. Full of unforgivable editing mistakes, continuity mistakes, background actors playing sword among themselves like children... I'm not talking about ordinary movie goofs that you can find even in Kubrick's films if you try hard, I'm talking about mistakes that could be avoided if you simply took a bit of care.<br/><br/>I still gave it a solid 7 stars, though. Because despite all its flaws, Braveheart is still a damn entertaining movie. While making every possible mistake a first-time director could make, Gibson also managed to pull off something very difficult: make a thoroughly engaging, entertaining film. It's fun, it has a once-in-a-lifetime score, and despite its appalling flaws, it's still an unforgettable movie.<br/><br/>Final word: Although Gibson directed, produced and starred in this, making it ""his baby"" so to speak, for me it will always be Patrick McGoohan's movie. He's more of a king than some actual kings. A very fine actor giving a chilling performance, stealing every scene."

","Well almost; the story which has no basis in reality, armies winning battles when hopelessly outnumbered, terrible terrible accents that are barely from the same planet let along the right region - this film is clearly one of the inspirations for '300'.<br/><br/>This is my first viewing of the film, 23 years after its release. I'm pleased to say that I hadn't missed much.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the cinematography and soundtrack were both beautiful.<br/><br/>The rest was average at best. Presumably when Mel cast himself in the lead as a heroic, principled, freedom fighter he thought that only he would have the prowess and credibility to pull it off. Clearly Mel's ego is as vast as some of the panoramic shots in the film.<br/><br/>The characters were all old school, the wicked king with his weak and childish son. The freedom fighter hero, who is inspired to fight by his beautiful dead wife, murdered by one of the men employed by the wicked king. The traitor who ultimately repents and finds redemption, and various other cliches live within this film. To be fair, these character types are classic for a reason.<br/><br/>Despite my cynicism, I did generally enjoy the film, although now I've seen it I doubt i'll be rushing back for a second viewing.<br/><br/>If you like the idea of Mel being the consummate hero freedom fighter then give it a whirl, if you find that tiresome then there are thousands of better films out there..."

","From its soulful score by James Horner, brilliant editing in the battle sequences, brisk pacing, and dazzling cinematography by John Toll, Braveheart is an epic in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>The acting, the surprisingly brutal battle scenes, the speeches and monologues, etc, feels fresh and new to the genre even if they actually aren't. That's in large part due to Mel Gibson's remarkable and risk-taking direction, and the masterful editing.<br/><br/>Long shots, wide camera angles, and quick cuts in the dialogue scenes as well as the battle sequences gave this movie a lively atmosphere, and therefore made it a unique experience that helped it to stand out from the other historical epic movies.<br/><br/>That being said, I found the tonal shifts completely outputting. The movie kept moving from a somber to a lighter tone throughout its runtime to match the current situations and events. That made some important moments have less impact on me, such as; some dramatic moments didn't work as mush as it should, the climax of the plot felt sudden and not well prepared for it, etc. While it didn't take me a long time to adapt to the new tone, the episodic nature of the movie is quite annoying and distracting.<br/><br/>The romantic relationship between Wallace and his wife was pretty fine and acceptable at first, but then it overstayed its welcome a little bit. Whilst the reason for that is quite understandable, I couldn't help but cringe for a while.<br/><br/>The villain is very menacing and almost everything about him is great, except that he provided us with an exposition of his plans many times. But, fortunately, likewise some cheesy lines, these scenes were justified by Gibson's excellent direction that gave them an epic sense, and therefore made them more passable.<br/><br/>Randall Wallace's screenplay is more than enough to make the movie match its ambition. From the way we witness our protagonist from his childhood to become the hero he is, to the miraculous narrative control on the abundance of side characters and their sub-plots. All that made Braveheart a larger-than-life historical tale, and I don't care about how historically accurate it is because it's a great movie!<br/><br/>(8/10)"

","Braveheart it is a good movie. This acting is superb and it is very well directed there are a lot of actions of people fighting. We have the impression to take part in the movie. This history where the English people want to conquer Scotland is very well reconstituted. William Wallace wants to save his clan. We feel sad when William wants his revenge after the wild murder of Murron. This moment for me is the best, the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies. This movie deserves this place because it has a lot of negative points. However the film is too long (three hours). This film is too violent. People cut each others throat. However there are not that many movies that have beautiful suits, which look exactly like those the Scottish clothes at this time. We can also appreciate great cinematography. Braveheart is glorious, even if this movie is extremely violent it is a great film and includes very good actors and this movie has a very good scenario screenplay you can watch this film! enjoy it!!"
"liliemjg","7","0","2","2 March 2017"," Good movie, but disturbing mistakes
","Braveheart is a movie that I like, but I can understand different points of view. <br/><br/>First, it is a type of movie which can't, of course, be enjoyed by everybody. Personally, I like this kind of story with knights, battles and all this medieval world. But everybody doesn't like that, it depends of each. This movie, like a lot of that kind is interesting, there is action and the plot in not boring at all. But it is true that they made a lot of important historical inaccuracies. I can understand that they made them to make the plot more interesting, or to help people understanding easily, for example the Scotts are wearing the kilt even if they didn't, in reality, at that time. But make William Wallace falling in love with a lady who was, in reality, only four years old, is, I think, a very important mistake that they shouldn't do and that makes this movie less good than it could be. The battle scenes are really good and amazing, that makes up a little bite for those mistakes. The actor play is well done, and the speeches are spectacular.<br/><br/>To put it in a nutshell, I think that Braveheart has good and bad sides, more good sides in my opinion, but it is answerable to the taste of each."
"patrick-chaplain123","7","0","5","15 February 2016"," Overlong and overrated
","Solid flick but nowhere near as good as epics such as Gladiator or 300. Mel Gibson is simply irritating as William Wallace and, although the battle sequences are undeniably awesome, the majority of the film is far too drawn out and the ridiculous run time makes it difficult to maintain concentration throughout. I did enjoy the film immensely but I have given it such a low rating due to its wasted potential to be like some of my favourite films of all time, and despite only being from 1995 it already feels incredibly dated like a film from the eighties or even seventies may. Enjoyable performances from Sons of Anarchy's Tommy Flanagan and James Cosmo, as well as a personal favourite Brendan Gleeson."
"brianberta","4","0","1","21 August 2015"," An entertaining war film but it could have been better
","Even though this movie is not perfect, it's still a pretty entertaining war thriller which keeps the viewer interested despite the fact that it's almost 3 hours long.<br/><br/>After William Wallace's lover is killed, he decides to start an uprising against the cruel English ruler Edward the Longshanks in hopes of inheriting the crown of Scotland for himself.<br/><br/>This movie does have many memorable scenes. The 2 battle sequences in the movie are memorable and the ending is also very memorable. This move is very quotable also. It clearly has a few iconic quotes. Examples of the iconic quotes are ""They may take away our land, but they'll never take away out freedom!"" and when Mel Gibson yells ""Freedom!"" The acting is okay. It isn't the best performance by Mel Gibson but it's also not bad. There are a few cringeworthy moments but not too many. All of the other supporting actors just gave decent performances. They weren't bad but they also weren't very impressive.<br/><br/>This movie is clearly violent but sometimes its violence can be distracting because the movie gets a little carried away with its style. Some scenes include a man getting thrown off a platform and getting impaled on a wooden pike and a man getting shot by an arrow in his butt. Those scenes are several others can take the viewer out of certain battle sequences because they are kind of ridiculous.<br/><br/>Also, the movie does have its historical inaccuracies. The inaccuracies mainly revolve around the princess of Wales. Granted, the movie would be a little more boring if it didn't include these inaccuracies but the movie still should've tried to find a way around them. I'm sure that it could've been done.<br/><br/>But despite what I said, I do feel that this is a pretty entertaining war film. However, I don't think that this is one of the best war films out there and I feel that there are much better ones. I also think that Mel Gibson has made better movies."
"anthonymichaelbangert","7","0","2","31 January 2015"," Inaccuracy Throughout
","This horribly inaccurate historical epic tells the story of William Wallace. As a young boy his father led a failing rebellion against the British rule in Scotland. Years later William Wallace decides to lead his own Scottish rebellion, after his wife is raped by British soldiers. He unites the people of Scotland and uses smart military tactics to bring down the strongest military force of the time. Bloody, gruesome battle scenes are shown throughout this movie, to depict the true horrors of the fights for freedom. William Wallace was a real man, but most of the rest of this film (about 90%) was fictionalized for dramatic emphasis. This did not result in a bad film, but just an inaccurate one.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: 10- Using bagpipes for a good portion of the movie's soundtrack gave a dramatic and well put together atmosphere for the movie. An excellent job.<br/><br/>Script: 5- Due to horrible inaccuracies and sometimes strange speeches, the movie suffered. This comes down to a writer who didn't seem to care, and a director who cared even less.<br/><br/>Originality: 8- The story of William Wallace had not been done on such a scale before, but the rebellion story has been done many times. Had this been an accurate depiction, the score could have been slightly better.<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10- The director may not have cared about the story, but boy did he have an eye for detail. The camera-work was amazing, and gave the feeling of being a part of the events most of the time.<br/><br/>Casting: 7- Mel Gibson is a great actor, but he himself knew that he was way too old for the part. Most of the other actors fit their roles well, although there were a few questionable choices.<br/><br/>Acting: 7- Mel Gibson is a very convincing man in at the main role. However, some of the supporting actors took me out of the movie at times. I felt in those moments that I was watching a movie, and I never want to remember that when I watch. I want to be so immersed that I forget that I am watching a movie.<br/><br/>Overall: 7.8 <br/><br/>Personal Rating: 7- I did not hate this film, but there was so much that could have been done better."

"Andyssoohigh","10","0","3","14 May 2013"," Epic and a Classic film
","Okay, so here goes my first review. And, for the first, I had to choose my favourite film of all time, Braveheart. Firstly, I must start by saying that this will probably be a very biased review. By no means do I think this is the best film of all time. For me, that would be the Godfather (all parts ‚Äì It's one big ass film, not to be judged in parts) but the reason for Braveheart being my favourite film of all time, is purely due to the fact that it is the film I have watched the most during my life probably around 50+ times.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film received 1995 Best Picture and many other awards and nominations. At that time (1995) I was only 5 years old¬Ö Now I don't think I saw this film first when I was five. But I am pretty sure I watched it while I was in primary school, aged around 7 or 8. It was my Dad's way of teaching me history, his way of bonding. He was born in Scotland and I was born in England; therefore, he felt a need to educate me that the English are pigs. It was a bad history lesson though, as the film does not pay particular interest to being historically accurate, other than stating that Scotland and England had a bit of a bloody history together.<br/><br/>Thirdly, at that young age of being easily impressed and all things coming new to me, this film blew me away. It had me interested from the beginning, it had me gripped on the plot line, it had me believing in the characters, it had me screaming inside for freedom and justice and it had me in tears at the end. Now I'll be honest, I didn't cry the first time. I was a young boy and loved the real grit and rawness of the violence and battle scenes. The violence and the battle scenes were sprung from the pain and anguish of young lovers having their right to love stripped away with a clean cut of the knife. But this is predominantly a man's film, filled with blood, violence and hairy men. The love scenes between Wallace and the Princess are clearly just an extra bit of intrigue and probably placed there to keep the partners of the men at least thinking it's all about love. In truth, though, this film is all about violence, standing up for what you believe in and fighting for your right to live. If this film had been all action and not split up with love scenes would it have been any worse? I think not. It is, in reality, almost one long film of battles. But the side plot of secret lovers and other plots (fathers and their sons) do help to give the viewer some time to catch a breath before the next beautiful battle. And that is truly what this film is. A bunch of beautiful battle scenes. <br/><br/>So let's begin. . . Braveheart, for its time, seemed to come out of nowhere, with visually stunning and very, very, very real looking battle scenes. From the horses being impaled, to the legs being lopped off and even that sharpened wooden stake being stuck up some poor English pig's throat¬Ö The soundtrack throughout keeps your heart beating and the sound effects of the groans and thuds and clangs and twangs of swords keeps the hairs rising and the blood curdling. From beginning to end you are at the edge of your seat, gripping to hold on and rooting for William Wallace and Scotland to be victorious. Alongside Mel Gibson (William Wallace) you have Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks) who displays a truly powerful performance as the tyrant, King Edward I. You believe in him from the beginning and want to stab him in the back as soon as you realise what kind of man he is. Then there is Sophie Marceau (Princess Isabelle) not just a pretty face but with the acting ability to complement. Is she more beautiful than Catherine McCormack (Murron)? I think not. They are both beauties and they both have a power over Wallace and the audience alike with their phenomenal performances. There are also many other great actors/actresses to be seen in this film ‚Äì Brendan Gleeson, Tommy Flanagan, though I shan't comment on them all for fear of the word count and blabbing too much! This leaves me really with only one thing left to express an opinion on. And this is probably where I come out of the closet. HA, I joke. But, seriously: Mel Gibson in this film, even with a wee bit of a dodgy Scottish accent, simply blows you away with his performance. As he is the main character as well as the director it is clear he truly had a real passion for the making of this film and that is shown throughout in his superb acting. He does everything he needed to do to have you believing in him and (as I got a bit older¬Ö and clearly more sensitive¬Ö) even crying at the end. When he looks out about the crowd who are watching his execution and somewhat smiles as the axe comes down, the handkerchief falls out of his hand as he holds the gaze of his 'original' lover's eyes (Murron)... It may be true to say I pretty much idolised Mel Gibson after this film. I wanted to be (as a young boy with not much to do with my days) William Wallace, fighting for what I believed to be right, fighting the English. And I did spend a fair few days in the garden attacking weeds and trees with wooden sticks¬Ö The powerful performance of Braveheart is relived inside you. That's it. It's simply one of those films that, no matter what happens, you will always take with you. It is a timeless classic and a truly great piece of cinematography"
"lee-dugan","Null","0","3","14 February 2012"," Braveheart for all!
","On my list of the greatest movies of all time, BraveHeart ranks as number 3. It is by far one of the most epic stories ever told. Mel Gibson deserved all the credit he received and more. His portrayal of William Wallace, one of Scotlands most mightiest warriors, was spot on. The only part that lacked was the romantic affair of Princess Isabella and Wallace. It historically never happened. This movie also has other historical errors but WHO CARES! The Battle of Stirling has to be the second most graphic piece of footage ever shot next to Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. I love the part where the English Commander gives the order to charge and Wallace sees this and raises his broadsword into the air and starts yelling. He charges the field with the Scots and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens next.<br/><br/>Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational and I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel Gibson portrayed him.<br/><br/>My hat goes off to Mel Gibson. I hope he makes a few more movies like this one.<br/><br/>Out of ten............10/10!"

","With a dynamic performance from Mel Gibson along with his unexpected, though brilliant directing, Braveheart has become one of the finest films ever made, if not one of the most famous epics ever produced. Loosely based on the real life of William Wallace, the man who united the clans of Scotland in order to obtain their independence from the tyranny of Britain, Braveheart, underneath its historical aspect, also beautifully told the story of William's love for his wife that charged his campaign till the very end. With a stunning cast and remarkable dialogue, Braveheart exemplified the potential for such films, creating a storyline that was as enriching as well as captivating with some of the most violent and visually intense battle sequences ever captured, it formed a new impression of the epic genre; one beloved by both men and women. Though dramatic and tragic, Braveheart became a symbol of a nation's pride, one man's strength and people's hope; a testament to their ""Freedom."""

","I loved this movie when I first saw it, but there was always something off. A friend who works as a script supervisor mentioned that it is used in many film classes as an example of bad continuity. The scene where Sophie Marceau's character is representing the king is highly flawed. Each time the camera cuts back to her the awkward headgear is arranged and dressed differently. In some shots it is an entirely different headpiece entirely.<br/><br/>Once you get started you'll start to notice that there are many other scenes with equally distracting inconsistencies.<br/><br/>Is this just bad editorial decisions or a total disregard for the audience?

"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","3","14 September 2010"," Not all it's cracked up to be, but still a beautifully photographed and memorable epic drama
","This 1995 epic, directed by and starring Mel Gibson was a huge hit and was nominated for ten Oscars, five of which it won, but I was too young to watch R-rated movies back when it was released. The first time I watched ""Braveheart"" was in 2006, when it came on TV one time that year, though I had known of the film's existence for years by then. With that first viewing, it was a 10/10 for me, but that all changed when I watched the film again a little over a year later. It dropped all the way down to a 5 with my second viewing! Three years later, I've finally watched it a third time. I knew I wouldn't be giving it a 10/10 this time, either, but I think I put more effort into seeing the positive aspects during my latest viewing, and I guess it worked.<br/><br/>The story begins with William Wallace as a child in Scotland in the year 1280 A.D. William's father and brother, Malcolm and John, leave to take part in a battle to liberate Scotland from the oppressive Edward I (a.k.a. ""Longshanks"") of England, and sadly, neither comes back alive. William is then taken out of his village by his uncle Argyle and raised by him, as the country continues to live in oppression. After growing up, he returns to his old village, where he falls in love with Murron, a girl (now a woman) he knew before he went to live with his uncle. The two get married, but trouble comes when a group of English soldiers come along and one of them tries to rape Murron! Wallace successfully fights off these soldiers, but his wife is then killed by the village Sheriff! After this tragedy, William Wallace leads an army into battle, determined to bring freedom to his country once and for all! <br/><br/>One of the things this film is widely praised for is the cinematography, which I can't complain about. It's all very well photographed here, and cinematographer John Toll deserved his Academy Award for his work on this blockbuster. The beautiful filming locations in Scotland and Ireland definitely help with the visuals. However, not everything about ""Braveheart"" is good. Many have criticized it for numerous historical inaccuracies, but I don't expect too many films based on true stories to be very accurate. Still, I didn't care much for the opening narration, and other problems with the film include script flaws, including some poor dialogue in the romantic scenes with William and Murron, and some parts can be a little tedious. Fortunately, there is more than just the cinematography and scenery to carry the film. Mel Gibson did a great job directing it, and his acting performance is impressive, even though it's slightly flawed. I didn't usually find anything wrong with his Scottish accent, but I'm not Scottish, and some say Gibson's attempt at the accent was very bad. The cast performances in this epic are good in general, and it's also a mostly intriguing story with a lot to keep one watching. Other things that help are some intense battle sequences (though these are too gory for some viewers), touching moments, and a fitting musical score.<br/><br/>This is one of those films which are generally thought of as masterpieces, but I certainly don't completely agree with the reputation of this one. I think it's a good movie, and some things about it are amazing, such as the visuals, but I certainly don't think it's a masterpiece in every way. For that reason, I can't say I agree with those who might say this is one of the best movies/best movie of all time, but can't join the haters, either, even if many of them do have good reasons for their criticisms. It's been about two years since I saw ""The Patriot"", another film starring Mel Gibson (he didn't direct that one), which is a lot like ""Braveheart"" but set during the American Revolution. I was not impressed with that 2000 release, directed by Roland Emmerich, but this 1995 film featuring the same actor in the lead role is far more popular than that one, which is understandable, even if it is more popular than it deserves to be. This is a long, dark film, and not one I would want to watch over and over again, but it still has a lot to make it stand out."

","Although movie making is not a one man job but people tend to praise only person for the success of a master piece. Mel Gibson deserves all the accolades. He is the 'Heart and soul' of the entire movie. Few of you may know that he almost turned down the role of ""William Wallace"" in this movie because he thought he was too old for the role. He asked the producers if he could direct it instead. A compromise was made, he could direct the movie if he agreed to portray Wallace. Had it not been for the producers i believe we would've missed one of best performance by him.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is that of war against England by the Scots who want to attain freedom but they do not realize what to do and how to do until William Wallace steps in. His initial motive is to avenge the death of his wife Murron by a Noble. But then this retaliation gains full-fledged momentum into a war for freedom. Brilliant flow of the story.<br/><br/>""The courage to face fear"" is the tagline and is what a braveheart needs to posses and exactly that is shown in the movie about Wallace. Even going through the extremely painful torcher and execution, instead of begging mercy he cries out ""FREEDOM"". True courage.<br/><br/>Going into the details of the movie making- full marks to the entire crew. The cinematography needs a special mention. All the scenes are so well shot that after the movie ends you can't help but reminisce the scenic beauty captured in such a fantastic way. <br/><br/>Sound editing and the music are also worth praising with the sound of war constructed superbly. All the fights,roars,sword clashing, hoo-hoo of the soldiers and every detail brought to life in the best possible manner.<br/><br/>The movie has received 5 Oscars including BEST film, Director, Sound,make-up and cinematography.

"Ziya90","10","0","5","7 January 2010"," Forget about the chaos of the haters for a minute, this is a great epic!
","Braveheart is a great battle epic, but if you one of those people who are almost obsessed with historical inaccuracies in movies, then probably you are not impressed, positively affected and entertained by this movie like us. As for Mel Gibson, it is known that there are a lot of enemies of him, there are a lot of people who hate him. Why? It is because he is a deep catholic and you are not? It is because he did a speech about Jewish people, when he was drunk? or it is because you think that the movie is one sided, it shows some English people as evil? or it is because you are a nerd who doesn't forgive any movie, if it has historical inaccuracies? As for being one sided or racist, should we toss movies out, if they are one sided, even if those movies are cinematically and artistically great? This is the key question. If so, for example Saving Private Ryan is an awful movie either, right? By the way since I am not English, I can't know what you feel, so about this point, English people might be right. If I had been English, may be I would have hated the movie too, but in these circumstances, as an historical epic, as a war movie for me, it is one of greatest movies of all time and the best historical action ever! You may dislike this movie, I can understand that, but trolling is not my cup of tea and I find it unfair, so what really disturbs me is those kind of ugly and nasty stuff, written by people. I mean that some say that acting was awful, direction was awful etc. I like Mel Gibson, he is one of my favorite actors / directors. I believe that in this movie, he gave one of his best performances, may be the best. William Wallace. With his long hairs, blue eyes, with his mimics, stares, hard looks... His face while looking at the man in their first insurgency, his face while looking at the blonde child. These are great moments in the history of cinema. The final was one of the most 'heavy' and heartbreaking finals ever made (of course not for the people who hate him) I know that the haters watch that with pleasure. Direction, Mel Gibson, Mel Gibson's interesting William Wallace interpretation, cinematography, its dramatic impact and because of the battle scenes, I love Braveheart. Some people claim that Gibson imitated Kurosawa's Ran, sorry but does Ran has even a real battle sequence? And I know that it will be very assertive, but in terms of direction, mise-en-scene in battle scenes, Gibson is much better than even the master Kurosawa. If we don't count The Lord of the Rings, you cannot find better battle scenes in the history of cinema! The most well planned, the most detailed and the most epic battle scenes are here. To me, Saving Private Ryan is the greatest of the all war movies and Braveheart is the greatest one of the all battle epics."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","0","3","14 October 2009"," The birth of nationalism in Scotland
","William Wallace, a commoner, is a legend, a myth, a hero for sure in Scotland. In his thirteen century he opposed the rule of the king of England over Scotland and the ruthless colonial attitude of that king and his soldiers. Why a commoner and not a noble? Because the nobles accepted to be paid prisoners, salaried slaves of the king of England. As a commoner he only suffered the ruthless violence from these soldiers and the indifference of these nobles. He started a rebellion against the English and that rebellion actually swept the whole Scotland and climaxed in the battle of Stirling. He had managed to bring the nobles behind the commoners and he got a full victory. He was knighted at once but did not change his logic. So in order to force the king of England to grant Scotland full independence he crossed the border and attacked the English at home. He took and ransacked the city of York, and killed the duke of York, the very nephew of the king of England. But in the next confrontation the nobles betray him and he is defeated after the nobles leave the battlefield. The Bruce gets him off that battlefield in due time. But later on the nobles again will betray him again, attract him in a trap and deliver him to the king of England. He will be duly executed as a traitor. The film evokes that treatment though it remains rather far from the real stuff and the fact that he was executed on the day before the Bartholomew Fair on the Fair ground itself as a festive entertainment added to all the others by the king himself. The point is historical and the film is valuable because of that historical dimension. A commoner could easily bring commoners together and make them fight for their freedom, even their national freedom. That is the birth of popular nationalism, of nationalism as such, the only nationalism that represents some historical progress, that of the people, of simple people. That nationalism is going to develop in Europe over the coming centuries, but we can witness its birth in Scotland here. At the same time the film shows very well that nationalism is in absolute contradiction with feudalism. That nationalism is based on self-pride and individual freedom, and the protection and guarantee of that individual freedom. The right of the first night (the local esquire or noble has the right to make love to the newly wed woman, before her newly wed husband on the evening of their marriage) is one of these unbearable privileges of the nobles. Furthermore, the nobles satisfy themselves very well with the financial dependence on the king of England, as long as it does not question their local dominance in Scotland over the local Scots. They have no real national spirit, and the freedom of the people is not their problem. They have sworn allegiance to the King of England and that guarantees their privileged position and they are quite satiated with that. At the same time we must understand a different approach of feudalism that is no longer very active in our minds. The king was the very secular representative of God due to his appointment by God himself, under the only authority of the Pope who is the direct spiritual representative of God on earth. If such is the reality of feudalism, then no one can question the decisions and acts of the king, certainly not the nobles who are under allegiance towards that king. A duke can fight against a count or another duke, because they are of the level but they cannot fight against the king who is over them. But the surprising element is that the battle of Stirling took place on September 11, 1297 some 80 years after the first signing of the Magna Carta and 30 years after the final acceptance of this Magna Carta that shows how the English nobles and the English Church actually joined against the king to impose onto him some freedoms that were unheard of before. I tend to believe William Wallace was the development of this Magna Carta and that it brought the third social element into the picture, the third estate, the commoners. The defeat is all the more significant, and the execution is also all the more significant. It was more a martyrdom than anything else. We know that a poet, Blind Harry, will turn the oral legend into a myth with his epic poem written at the end of the fifteen century. This film is just the adaptation of this myth.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Vincennes Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Val de Marne Creteil, CEGID Boulogne Billancourt"

","A magnificent movie. Mel Gibson sure deserves some credit. He directed and acted as the main character. He created a magnificent movie. It starts out in Scotland, with Edward the Longshanks ruling over it, a cruel pagan leader as the Scots say. Finally the Scots rebel, led by Wallace, his rebellion triggered by the death of someone close to him. His close confidantes are hilarious. The Irish man, his old best friend Hamish and his fiery father, are the best supporting characters I've seen in a long time. Funny and loyal. The performances of Edward Longshanks and Robert the Bruce are great, as with the Princess of Wales. Their awe/love/hate of Wallace all leads to a climatic ending, that inspires a raw spirit within you to rise up. Its powerful and chock full of emotion. The brawling part comes from the explicit violence. But in truth, that was how I would've imagined a movie like this being. Its skimps on nothing, throughout everything else it shows Scotland how it really was. Why should it skimp on the brutalities of war? Beheadings, slitting of throats, impaling, the list never ends.

It's story and acting are not bad for a major American film, and the action is amazing. But historical accuracy..... Mel Gibson creates a likable character, and throughout the film, even as somebody raised in England I found myself routing for Wallace to win in all situations.

","I had problems at first watching this movie because a major enemy of mine, a girl I had dated in high school and her vengeful family were of Scottish descent. But I put my hate for the Scottish aside and actually found this movie to be enjoyable and quite moving in parts. The Scottish girl and her family are why I also have an ax to grind with Washington DC. They broke up my seven year marriage to my former wife, destroyed my personal life and even caused me a nervous breakdown. I had said in 1986, if someone were to actually start a legitimate insurrection in America for a cause that I believed in, I would also bear arms against our government. When you take everything away from a man that he has and he has nothing to lose, he can become quite brave as well. I waited for the revolution that never came. I even felt emboldened by stores of the Judges (warrior prophet liberators of ancient Israel) as well as the life and death struggle between soon-to-be king David and his paranoid schizophrenic enemy King Saul who was trying to literally kill him! Yes, Virginia, there is ""a time to kill"" in the Bible book of Ecclesiastes. Most of the twenty years of hate that I have endured from my two brothers and the government revolved around the issues of my refusal to finish my PhD and my refusal to become gay for the government! I will say this much, as Braveheart had seen his wife's ghost looking lovingly at him before his lost his head, I remember lying on my bed and feeling the strange sensation of an affectionate large dog kissing my feet and I wondered if that was Jesus Christ himself or his angel? The government had tried to drive me insane with their threats.Teasing by sexed up women in church had also twice driven me to the brink of suicide! Yet, I am still alive! I couldn't imagine that God would amke me to become like Bravehart or Samson or David or Gideon from the Bible; but the hate that I endured for my principles and my integrity was severe.

However, I am very disappointed that so many historical factual errors have been made. Of course, you cannot get it all right - and some things have to be adjusted to please audiences and keep a red thread and in order to make a great film. BUT: There are several things that could have been done historically correct. For instance, the Battle of Stirling. Why not include the bridge as it was essential to the outcome of the battle? What's the point of the intimate relationship between the future Princess of Wales and Wallace? Seeing as she was just a little girl at the time it doesn't make much sense to invent this relationship. And the sacking of York - what's the purpose of inventing this? Not being in control of Scotland would be serious enough for Edward to send the army north. Besides, a rebel army such as this would not be able to lay siege to a walled town like York at this time.<br/><br/>My main point is: If film makers think that the story or themes are most important then they should leave historical figures alone and invent their own. Of course, they may include historic events and persons, but they should not form the core of a fictional venture."

Well, it is kinda grandiloquent (those images filmed from 2 or 3 helicopters of Wallace on the top of a mountain!!

","William Wallace was a hero, whose story lapsed into obscurity for the more famous Robert the Bruce (who liberated Scotland from the English). Because of the lack of historical detail this story is obviously going to a fabrication. A broad, romanticized story of an individual leading many to fight for freedom.<br/><br/>Well directed by Mel Gibson, with perhaps too much time spent on the battle scenes (which were not very accurate and never really explained the truth about how the Scottish beat the English....basically it was about using methods from Roman times that were effective but had fallen into disuse in an era when war was about making sure only the peasants died and the Noble's wore so much armour they couldn't fight properly, but they wouldn't get hurt either).<br/><br/>Instead of worrying about facts, Wallace becomes the idea of freedom and this what makes the movie brilliant. Along with the drama, romance, humour, fun fight scenes and dark violence the movie is above average.<br/><br/>However it stumbles in a number of places, making it less than perfect, but not so that it matters unless you want to watch it often."

The acting is great and the battle scenes are magnificent. I can't say I liked the scene when Wallace discovered Robert Bruce was the traitor, but it was so real I could do nothing but stare at the screen in utter disbelief. It's one of the scenes that almost make you believe it is really happening right now. The battle scenes were also great; looked realistic but not too gross.

","It is good to see materials that enhance your culture and knowledge of history, and this is the case with this film about William Wallace, a Scotish patriot of the 13th Century who was able to unite most of his people in the fight for the independence of Scotland. The film directed and starred by Mel Gibson has too many violent scenes, one may say that this is the mode of Gibson, but historically the film goes well. It is seen when William's father is killed and also his young wife by the English soldiers, the fights uniting Scots, some of them wealthy and susceptible to betray. The battle of Falkirk is an example of betrayal by those Scots looking for their personal profits and less interested in the sovereignty of their country. This battle was practically the end of Wallace. Although he hid himself for a while he was captured, brought to London, where he was tried, convicted and executed (the history said that this happened in 1305). One of the things I am not sure is that the son of princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) was really a product of her relations with Wallace. In any case, the film is interesting and exciting from the beginning till its end."

","Highly regarded as one of the best films of all time. This epic story starred in, directed by, and produced by Mel Gibson follows the true story of William Wallace and his crusade to liberate Scotland from English control. To put it plainly... this movie works on so many levels. I cannot think of another movie that uses its actors, sounds, music, and setting better than his movie. (well, maybe Lord of the Rings) but this was made in 1995:) It's epic war scenes set the standard of what war scenes should encompass. This movie was known for its bloody, graphic fight scenes. But it's story is one that is truly unbelievable. It won many Oscars including Best Picture in 1995, and if their was an all-time Oscar awards... this movie would definitely be among the nominees for Best Picture of All Time."

","This is my personal favorite film ever, and for very good reason. From the acting to the heart wrenchingly powerful drama to the brutal battles to the cinematography to the score to the direction, every single aspect of the film is absolute brilliance, greatness, superb, perfect, there aren't enough good adjectives to describe it. Anyone who doesn't like this film immensely doesn't deserve to live. This is the best movie ever made, and I don't care what anyone else thinks, it just is. Few films have ever even come remotely close, only The Lord of the Rings, Saving Private Ryan, and Gladiator can be compared. I can't believe Mel didn't win the Oscar, nobody as ever deserved it as much as he did for this, at least he got the director one which I couldn't agree with more, this movie deserved all 18 Oscars. I recommend the previous films I stated and Alexander, Troy, King Arthur, and Kingdom of Heaven coming out next year if you are a fan of this, which you unquestionably should be, Rob Roy is just sad and if you think that is anywhere near as good as this then start praying because you are in desperate need of help. I give this movie a 10000000000000000000000 out of a 10 because it truly is that magnificent, this is THE MASTERPIECE, not just a masterpiece, THE MASTERPIECE, this word says it all ""FREEDOM""."

I have to say that I don't care about such things at all when seeing this movie. <br/><br/>You never get the feeling that Mel Gibson was trying to give you the one and only true story about William Wallace. Please don't forget that he based his movie on the novel written by Randall Wallace and not on all kind of history books. So why say that this movie is bad because he didn't respect history at all? By the way, who of us knows all what happened than? At the time we weren't there either, were we? And why comparing this movie to Spartacus or other movies? Just because both movies have a battle scene? Many movies have that kind of scenes, but that is still no reason to compare them.<br/><br/>I respect everybody's opinion, but personally I really enjoyed watching this movie.

But this film did do one of the things it should have done, make me want to look deeper into this story, and regardless of its mistakes with history it was a brilliantly made movie.<br/><br/>It is a storyt in the eyes of the writer and director, but it is still up to the individual to research themselves, No matter how good I thought Michael Moore did with Farenhiet 911 without looking deeper into the issue it is just one mans opinion and their needs to be responsibility of the viewer but all in all a very enjoyable movie."

","Blasphemy! I think the previous poster is sadly mistaken. And the 8.3 rating average should attest to its potential staying power. Critics are so wonderful, they cannot do, so they complain. Braveheart when released did not fare well at the box office and was considered somewhat of a disappointment. But many of the best movies have had this fate. It is only when its picked up by the masses, and spread by word of mouth that it consumes like wildfire! I will not pick apart a movie over every detail, it seems a bit overboard for the medium. I simply watch it as a whole and see if it works. Sometimes, many times, you cannot even explain why it does, it just does. Some movies awaken something primal, something good. That is what Braveheart does, and I am sure it is the main reason why it is still one of the most sought after movies of that year. I do think it deserved the award, it cut across all races, all ages, and even the sexes. Because deep down everyone of us, loves a hero.

","Braveheart is a Mel Gibson's epic film, which tells a romantic version of the Scottish legend William Wallace and his people fighting for territorial freedom. Braveheart is legend, myth, love and fight. Despite its graphic violence, disturbing methods of killing, and themes of romance lost, the film's quirky sense of humor float the legacy with a maddening stream of interest.<br/><br/>My feelings were strong when I watched this film for the first time. I admire those people who fight for freedom without worrying about dying, as we can see in this film. But I want to remark two important things.<br/><br/>Firstly, the music, which has high importance and makes you feel the film as if you were into it. I say that it has importance because it is CELTIC MUSIC, and this kind of music represents not only Scotland, but also other parts of the world, as Ireland, Wales or Galicia(Spain). James Horner shows one more time that he is one of the most prolific and admired composers of Hollywood. Secondly, the other thing I want to remark is the 'ius primae noctis', a right disappeared but not less important, because this right made people get married in secrecy, and this lead Wallace to make a war against England.<br/><br/>To conclude, I think that Braveheart is a film that teaches you about history, love, fight and, above all, about the worths of life and freedom. The more I see it, the more I love it."

It takes us through the various stages of the Wallace uprising, which cumulate in the magnificent battles at Stirling and Falkirk.<br/><br/>The brilliant soundtrack provided by James Horner adds to the experience of this movie and enhances the impact of many of the scenes.<br/><br/>Many people look at Braveheart and point out the historical inaccuracies.<br/><br/>
Yes, they exist but if it wasn't for Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson turning his book into a movie a lot of people would never have known of William Wallace. The movie captured my imagination and made me want to find about William Wallace, find out what he actually did. If it wasn't for Braveheart, I may never have heard of William Wallace and the desperate battle he fought in order to secure freedom for Scotland.<br/><br/>As this is a movie, Braveheart does its job as it brings to life the legacy of Wallace; finding out the rest is up to us."
"Old Joe","Null","0","2","29 April 2004"," His passion captivated a woman. His courage inspired a country. His heart defied a king. This is Mel Gibson's brilliant epic movie.
","Mel Gibson's ¬ëBraveheart', is a movie that I feel inspired by every time I watch it. William Wallace certainly was a man that was driven by all sorts of emotions, a man who loved the women in his life, was forced in the end to fight for country, but did it in a grand style and was never intimidated by his enemy, that being the English, his only goal, for Scottish ¬ëFREEDOM!' Braveheart is a rich, emotionally charged historical epic filled with passion, betrayal and courage, one that is too savour.<br/><br/>Braveheart is the sweeping saga about Scotland's brutal battle for impendence in the 13th century. When William Wallace's wife is ravaged and murdered by English troops, his quest for revenge quickly turns into an impassioned fight for his country. Tales of Wallace's bravery inspire every commoner to take arms against the English and escalate their crusade into a full scale war. <br/><br/>Firstly I want to praise Mel Gibson for the work he put into making this movie. His vision as director was first-class and gave the movie a ¬ëgrandness' that it deserved. It is also a great achievement for Gibson to star in the movie, playing the integral character of Wallace, a difficult role. For his direction of Braveheart, Mel won the 1995 academy award for best director. <br/><br/>Under Gibson was Academy Award winning cinematographer John Toll, who certainly gave ¬ëBraveheart' the right look onscreen. The camera shots of the open plans, were just fantastic, and made the Scottish land look green, lush and rugged. The one that one that sticks in my mind the most, has to be the moment in the film which shows William Wallace climbing to the top of a mountain, what we see as this unfolds, really did stun me, but in a good way. <br/><br/>The story contains characters that I am unsure are fact or fiction. But whatever they are, were very convincing onscreen. William Wallace, aka ¬ëBraveheart' (Gibson) is a man that is shook up as a child by the disturbing visions he sees happens to his people, especially his father Malcolm Wallace (Sean Lawlor). We see quite quickly that Wallace as a man, was born to fight, with a ¬ëdead eye' when it comes to throwing with any sort of stone. Gibson is terrific in his role here, playing it with grandeur, flamboyance, style and slight humour that suits the film. ¬ëBraveheart' also looks intense, with the blue paint draped across his face. <br/><br/>Yet Wallace did not want to fight. He marries his childhood love, the beautiful Murron (Catherine McCormack) that he weds in secret. However there life together would be cut short by the warriors of the king of England, who capture, violate and kill Murron for not submitting to their desires. This death was hard for me to watch, but without it, we would not have the rest of the film. The small role that McCormack plays in the film is vital, as she softens the brutalness of war onscreen.     <br/><br/>After this event, Wallace is filled with raged and turns on all the English troops. Helping Wallace was his friend Hamish (Brendan Gleeson), a brute of a guy that is the size of two warriors, who never at any stage, takes a backward steps in the war. While Robert the Bruce (Angus McFadyen) is a very interesting character, a guy who you think you know, but then surprises you.<br/><br/>
On the English side, the enemy that Wallace wants to defeat, is King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan), or ¬ëlongshanks' as he is referred to. He is a very aggressive type of king, when in a fit of rage throws a friend of the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), out a high rise window, as he has no time to listen to this inferior sort of person. McGoohan is a nasty king and does not like what Wallace is achieving by the war. His son is a weakling, so afraid of what he is seeing take place. <br/><br/>The Prince was arranged in marriage to a French woman, for political reasons. Her name is Princess Isabella (Sophie Marceau) a beautiful woman, who is used to try and bribe Wallace to stop the war. He immediately picks up that she is attracted to him. The Princess hates her husband, but is truly in love with Wallace. When Wallace is close to death, the Princess tries to help him handle the ordeal. Marceau is great in this role as she is nice to look at and convincing in her role. <br/><br/>I love all the battle scenes in ¬ëBraveheart', as they are filmed in a big and bold way by Gibson. That is not to say they are easy to watch. The first battle at death of Braveheart's wife is tough to watch. Yet there were times I was laughing (unintentionally) as the English were frightened for their lives at the sight of ¬ëBraveheart' and his men. The major war scenes are great, but also leave nothing to the imagination, as we see arrows, swords and axes wounding and killing many men on both sides. <br/><br/>
The music to Braveheart was another important element, as it gave the correct Scottish feel to the film. The composer on Braveheart was James Horner, whose music gives the film true emotion when it needs it. The bagpipes are used in a very effective way here especially.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is currently in the spotlight with his movie ¬ëThe Passion of The Christ'. I felt I would prepare myself for that movie by going back and watching this film and I am glad that I did. The resemblance that this film has with the story of Jesus is amazing. ¬ëBraveheart' is the ultimate Hollywood movie experience, a most powerful film, made by a man with a passion, about a man with an intense passion, who was willing enough to sacrifice himself in order that his country could have freedom. What a sacrifice it was too! <br/><br/>CMRS gives ¬ëBraveheart': 5 (Brilliant Film)"

","Those are the words that I said to my mom after I finished watching the first half of Braveheart.  In Braveheart Mel Gibson portrays William Wallace the great Scottish lad (man) who brought peace and freedom to Scotland. Having a great deal of Scottish background in me, I thought watching a movie about someone who was very important at the time might be a good idea to watch.  I have to tell you I absolutely love the movie.  Mel Gibson, wow, I loved him when I first saw him in Gallipoli, many years ago, and I think he still does a fantastic job today, I beleive over 20 years later.  There hasn't been a movie with Mel that I haven't liked, and I have to say that even though he's done over 50 movies, Braveheart is my ultimate favourite Mel Gibson movie.  Mel portrays an excellent William Wallace, a man who is more than a name to the great country of Scotland.  The movie was very real like, and you could actually see what he was really like.  In the movie Mel sports dreadlocks and he wears a kilt, complete with a Scottish scarf, which is made from Wallace plaid.  Mel also does a great Scottish accent, where most actors besides ones that have a British accent cannot do one, the only other actor that comes close is Mike Myers. The costars were good, however they don't compete with Mel's Oscar-winning performance.  The story was well written, and it has a few emotional parts, my favourite part in the movie, is when they portray a young William Wallace with the little girl and the Scottish thistle.  That was sooo cute.  So, to sum it up, Mel Gibson did look sooo sexy in his kilt, and the movie was breathtaking."

","I rented this over the weekend and had always wanted to see it. I'm a big history buff, so I wanted a little culture. The scenery is awesome and so was the acting. It was the basic good vs. evil, but one step further. I find movies like this about freedom for some people who went around and took it away from others to be a bit ironic. Part of my ancestry is Scottish and they were the slaveholding kind. Hollywood loves to make movies that glorify people (namely themselves) and then ignore the other part of their history. It was still a good film, but it makes you think about history."

An epic story.  Incredible actors. Gorgeous Actresses.  The painfully beautiful Irish countryside captured by the best cinematographer in the business.  An amazing score by the gifted James Horner that evokes every emotion in the spectrum and haunts you long after you leave the theater.  Brutally realistic swordfights on a grand scale.  Love.  Honor.  Friendship.  Loyalty.  Bravery.  Betrayal. Sacrifice.  Redemption.<br/><br/>It was a revelation when I saw it in the theater.  I was so absorbed by the film and moved by the story that as soon as the credits finished rolling I went and bought a ticket to the next showing.  I never noticed the length of the film (still don't...in fact I wish it was longer).  Just like how David Gray brought be back to music and made me rediscover my love for it and the joy I derive from it....Braveheart did the same for me and movies, and I am grateful."
"perfectbond","8","0","2","27 January 2004"," Slightly overrated but...
","The reason I am not in as much awe as others of this movie is that I saw The Patriot (also starring Mel Gibson) and The Last Samurai before I saw Braveheart. The battle scenes in those two later films are clearly influenced by Braveheart so it deserves credit for that. With Gibson making the soon to be released The Passion (which, having conservative Christian sympathies, I am really looking forward to) it is interesting that he cast himself as a Christ like figure. I'm sure most people know this but what is presented here is not entirely factual history but an interpretation of a myth. Nevertheless the movie is well acted, skillfully choreographed, lavishly produced, quite moving, and a nice window into English history of that period. Highly recommended, 8/10."

I am entranced every time I see this movie into thinking the Mel Gibson is indeed William Wallace and is fighting for the freedom of his Scottish Countrymen. The ending is by far the best I have ever seen in a movie of this genre. The climax delivers a combination of unriveled sadness, hope, and how far one man is willing to go for something which he so strongly believes in. I have wrote reviews for the such other movies as the Lion King, and Caddyshack which are the best of their categories.  I beg you to give this movie a chance.

","Mel Gibson's accent slips from time to time, but he is still good as William Wallace and he's just down right sexy.  The film strays close to cheesiness when Wallace makes his pre-battle pep talks but thankfully, the score is awesome, so the screen doesn't get lacquered in strings and cheddar, and you almost don't notice how bad the writing is(for the speeches).<br/><br/>The writing, overall, isn't too bad (though not that accurate, historically), and there are some really well-written scenes; such as the ""wits of men.""<br/><br/>The romance between William and his wife feels quite rushed, but it's not that much of an issue, since the Braveheart aficionados only like it for the gory battle-scenes (in general, faw!).<br/><br/>There are flaws, yes, but Braveheart is still a mind-blowing movie of epic proportions.  The cinematography (though I'm not quite an expert) is phantasmagorical, and there are several Bee-eautiful scenes; such as the scene with the deer, the love scene by the waterfall, the scene where William takes off Robert's helmet, the scene where Robert walks among the dead bodies, the torture scene (Gibson seems to have a fondness for S & M), and the final scene with the flying sword, although the writing there is excruciatingly bad:  ""They fought like warrior-poets--they fought like Scotsmen.""

","""I want to tell you of William Wallace.  Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes...""<br/><br/>And so, with a beginning that is eerily reminiscent of The Sound of Music, Mel Gibson's medieval epic unfolds...slowly.  We must watch it for at least forty or so minutes before the first major ""battle scene"" but as we are soon to discover, the wait is well-worth it...and gory as well.  Braveheart is a gargantuan film that tries to be an epic...and barely succeeds.  At times, the film becomes unwieldly, simply lumbering along awaiting the next ""battle sequence"" (there are four in all).  The performances are mostly top-notch, especially Patrick McGoohan's portrayal of Longshanks, the evil English king who is so desperate to destroy William Wallace and everything that he stands for.  Braveheart has something for both sexes, but it would be the men who would leave the theater well sated.  There is more blood in this film than in the first three seasons of ER alone!  <br/><br/>Braveheart swept the 1995 Academy Awards winning 5 trophies, including the coveted Best Picture Award.  It also won for Best Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Make Up and Best Sound Effects Editing.  It was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Dramatic Score.  It is interesting to note that this was the film that started the mid-90's trend of Academy Awards going to ""epic-like"" films, as the next two films that would be honoreed as Best Picture would be The English Patient and Titanic, respectively.<br/><br/>If anything, you come away from this film feeling revitalized.  For it was William Wallace himself, a real man, who inspired thousands of his countrymen to fight for their own freedom.  And that one message is powerful enough in itself.<br/><br/>My rating: 3 stars"

","Braveheart was a great movie. It showed many aspects of a good movie. It wonderfully showed how the battles were held. It showed how they dressed, lived, and even talked. The reproductions of clothes and buildings are amazing. The director even throws in a love story to make it interesting for the female viewers. Even though Braveheart is a little less than three hours, it goes by fast. The movie is about William Wallace (Mel Gibson). It goes all the way from his childhood to his inspiration as a leader, even to his gruesome death. Sweeping, stirring, and moving, this epic is right up there with Ben Hur and other classic epic of movie history. The battles are amazing. They succeeded in showing how massed battles in the middle ages were conducted. They were frightening and fast. They were very bloody and they were very emotional. The battles in Braveheart are very suspenseful, and keep you on the edge of your seat. The film also works as a love story. The love story is excellently done, and moving. The scenes between Wallace and Myron are tender and gentle. It gives Wallace a reason to rebel without looking like a bloody warrior. Even though Wallace never really sacked York, but merely died in York, the movie continues. It seems to make it more interesting. All performances in Braveheart are great. Gibson himself- coping with the Scottish accent- turn in as a stunning performance. His expression of disbelief and dejection when he learns of Bruce's deception is magnificent. The fact that Mel directed the movie and performed in the movie is magnificent. The supporting cast is impressive. Patrick McGoohan's ruthless Edward Longshanks is very sinister. Sophie Marceau's French princess is compassionate and tender. Wallace's men are great for familiar faces in battle, and also help the plot be comical as well as light relief. This film will make you want to cry and love. It really pulls you in with the love story, the rebellions, and the wars. It is a classic that defiantly will be in your home video collection."

It does not happen here (perhaps because that is not how history records it).<br/><br/>I see on this website, the odd reference to Spartacus and I would too draw the same comparison because of the similarity in the underdog's mid-film success against the overwhelming aggressor being tempered by failure at the last battle and a fatal blow to the lasses' love story.<br/><br/>A story of two climaxes?

"MacBH","Null","0","2","14 December 2002"," The greatest history lesson ever ...
","It must be almost a unique event for a whole nation (the Scots) to learn the details of the life of their 'National Hero' by way of a Hollywood movie. After seeing Braveheart they swiftly realised that, while they didn't know how much of what they had just seen in the movie was true, they sure as hell now knew how little they had known before about this period in Scotland's history ... and they set about filling in the blanks. Thus a publishing boom in books about Wallace and the Wars of Independence was set in motion.<br/><br/>What made the 'history lesson' so powerful was that it was delivered via the medium of such an emotionally engaging movie. It was a great story that screenwriter Randall Wallace took up, and Mel Gibson just knew that this had to be the script to get him his Oscar, so he put everything into the directing and acting. Most of the cast and crew involved felt that they were working on a 'special' project, and it shows in terms of the performances and most other aspects of the production. Although the soundtrack recording has sold very well, James Horner's score didn't get the recognition it deserved at the time ... it should have got an Oscar too. Braveheart was loved by audiences world-wide, with many people going to see it again and again in the cinema. In addition to the 5 Oscars, it won numerous other awards, including the Empire Magazine's UK readers' poll for best movie of 1995. Back in Scotland it proved influential at a time of political change, as Scotland voted to restore a measure of self-government, after 300 years of rule from London. Braveheart helped make history, and in recognition of the way the movie was in-tune with the national conciousness, the BBC TV transmission of the opening of the new Scottish Parliament in July 1999 used the Braveheart theme over the opening and closing credits. Braveheart isn't just a movie, it is a phenomenon. You haven't really lived until you've seen it ..."

","Kevin Costner must go nuts watching Braveheart, thinking, ""Hey I make a stinking' historical movie like this and people kill it."" Right you are Sir. In fact, it's really only the amazing screen power of Mel Gibson that makes this movie so damn good. Hollywood has shown us that sparing no expense in making a historical epic is by no means any guarantee of a quality effort. A Costner, or equally fishlike lead could probably have sunk this film as well. But Mel does a super job of keeping stuffy old history light, quite enjoyable and even inspirational. You have to know this is an outrageous mutation of the facts. To suggest that a Scottish outlaw sired the entire line of British monarchy is the sort of insult with which all former dominions seek to slap the broken empire. But please don't for a minute think it possible. People in such high places didn't fool around in those days, and take such chances. I don't care how googie in love they may have been. Isabella would have been roasted on the palace spit, once folks got a gander at the child's appearance. The truth is that, the fruit of this supposed union, Edward III bore a striking resemblance to Edward I. Historians think it probable that the child was therefore the issue of his own grandfather. Why these things bother me so much, I can't tell you. I'm not even British. I don't have a problem with an undersized Australian portraying a 7-foot Scot. Wallace's sword they say weighs more than Mel Gibson after a big meal. They still have it if you don't believe me. And I guess the events, transpired so long ago that it's excusable to cloud them and finagle history if the end result is a torrid love scene that de-tops a French hottie. Not. It bugs me that in films of this genre, Britain and America to a lesser extent, must suffer these slings and arrows as a sort of penance for world domination. There are simply far too many cretins who will only ever know their history by either going to the cinema or by squeezing butt pimples in front of their own television. Filmmakers I'm afraid bear a responsibility to educate these poor souls by not so smearing fact with conjecture. Or at least, informing them that in spite of the wicked cool accents and smart costumes, what they are viewing didn't really happen. I Do like this movie but at the same time, I'm afraid I will never be able to take it any more seriously than another historical send up by a different man named Mel.

Upon reflection, I realized that, contrasted to Wallace's war with the English, Bruce's war is with himself. His struggle embodies a universal theme that everyone can identify with - namely, do I follow my heart or do I follow my head? Who hasn't, at some point in their life, wrestled with this? In Bruce's case, he must choose between giving in to his passion and joining Wallace's crusade, or being coldly pragmatic and following the ""realpolitik"" advice of his father.<br/><br/>The scenes where Angus MacFadyen shows Bruce wrestling with his conscience and letting his turmoil surface are quite powerful and provide a more compelling and deeper emotional layer to the film."

","In a mediocre year for the movies, this was one of the few highlights. A true epic, it tells the tale of William Wallace, one of Scotland's true heroic figures, in his battle for freedom from the English.<br/><br/>Being a Hollywood production, it really plays fast and loose with actual historical events and many Scots probably find this an embarrassment, considering how important a figure Wallace really was. Gibson, while doing his best, never really convinces, and it's left to the supporting cast to provide the real character moments, most notably Angus McFayden as Rob the Bruce. The film contains some extremely well crafted battle scenes, and is quite violent throughout, and if you can forgive the historical inadequacies, it is a truly moving picture.<br/><br/>This managed to win several Oscars, including the big two (director and best picture), and its clear why this was such a popular choice. Gibson weaves a truly exciting  tale of hatred and betrayal, bringing back the somewhat forgotten figure of William Wallace, one of Scotland's truly historic leaders. The cinematography and music are wonderful and while the mood is sometimes very dark, especially during the battles, (well, this was filmed during the winter months), Scotland (and Ireland) do look quite marvellous.<br/><br/>Recently (June 99) this was re-released in a commemorative box-set in conjunction with the opening of Scotland's first parliament in 300 years and sold extremely well. It's obvious why, because Braveheart is a true epic, that if you can forgive the historically inaccurate plot, is one of the best movies of the 90's. A lot of people will feel a great sense of pride and hatred during this movie, but ultimately it manages to be entertaining, rather than a history lesson. If anything, this movie probably made a lot more Scots aware of Wallace, and many may have taken the effort to read up on the history to find the truth regarding this inspiring figure. Remember that this is a Hollywood movie, and should be treated as entertainment, not as a history lesson. Go to the library if you want the real truth.<br/><br/>9/10."

She married Edward II after Wallace had been killed, but in the movie she is married to Edward while he lives.  She is shown in the movie to mediate between the Scots and Edward I, but she actually was a mediator between Edward II and the Barons.  She was a remarkable woman!  Her real life would make quite a movie.  She put her son on the throne in place of her husband and then he eventually put her in prison for most of her life.  She lived to be 66 which was quite old for those times. The battle scenes in this movie are very well done.  The acting is excellent.

","PART 1:<br/><br/>Scotland is a much smaller nation than England in geographical size as well as infrastructure, so i don't know what point you are trying to prove that the English won most of the battles !! I have studied all the battles you mentioned where the English won ( even after Bannockburn) and NONE of them ensured English rule over Scotland !! They knew that if they tried to occupy Scotland an odd 5 million William Wallaces would be produced  to ""fight and die"" for their nation. Let me point out the relevances of the English battle victories you mentioned and how they won them..<br/><br/>Dunbar 1296 - Edward II could'nt take it that Scots would'nt fight for him against France so he INVADED WITH A HUGE ARMY- first massacaring the entire 17,000 population of Berwick-upon-Tweed (including women and Children), and then secondly went upto Dubar and heavily defeated the DEFENDING SCOTS were - none of the survivors were spared. Still proud to be English ?<br/><br/>Halidon Hill 1333 (after Bannockburn)- John Balliol was kicked out of Scotland - and he went to England to get Edward III's help, Guess what ? The Evil English (under Edward III and John Baliol) attacked Scotland, and defeated the DEFENDING SCOTTISH ARMY BY FIRING ARROWS AT THEM FROM A DISTANCE FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL !! 4,000 scots died on the battle field cos of the English's cowardly tactics ! The survivors of the battle (just like Dunbar 1296) were EXECUTED ! John Balliol took control of Scotland (as puppet of Edward III), but the Scots soon drove him out again FOREVER !<br/><br/>Flodden 1513 - The English attacked France (Scotland's ally), and like any TRUE ALLY Scotland offered to attack England from the North in order to cause a diversion. The army of 30,000 Scots were poorly equipped compared to the 20,000 English soldiers it faced at Flodden, The fact that our King was inexperienced on the battle field he made a tactical blunder and we lost the battle - 10,000 Scots were killed. Proud to be English ?<br/><br/>Dunbar 1650 - Charles II wanted to be king of a UNITED BRITAIN, and he exploited the scots to fight for him against Oliver Cromwell. The English attacked Scotland and heavily defeated the poorly equipped Scots. Most of the prisoners died as BADLY treated prisoners - the survivors were sent to the Carribean !! Proud to be English ?<br/><br/>Culloden Moor 1746 - Bonnie Prince Charlie wanted to restore the Jacobite Catholic Stuart line to the throne of Britain. At this battle, it was Bonne Prince Charlie's 5,000 half-starved, exhausted Jacobite Highlanders against 10,000 well-drilled BRITISH ( NOT ENGLISH ) ARMY ( of which 5,000 were Jacobite-hating Scots !). The Britsh Army obviously won the battle but what they did after the battle was UNFORGIVABLE. They massacred the wounded Highlanders where they lay on the battle field - shooting them or bayonetting them to death or crushing thier bones. If you think killing wounded troops is bad enough - then hear some more...they went round all the Highland estates suspected of supporting the Jacobite cause, massacring men,women,old men, old women and children . The Lords of Jacobite-supporting clans were sent to London where they were PUBLICLY EXECUTED FOR THE PLEASURE OF PUBLIC !!<br/><br/>Now going to the main point...England could not conquer Scotland - it went bankrupt during the 1550's when it TRIED TO again..therefore its very clear that Scotland joined into the UK ONLY for financial benefit and peace -NOT BECAUSE THE ENGLISH WON MOST OF THE BATTLES AND CONQUERED SCOTLAND !!<br/><br/>I don't understand why you are proud of the English military victories over Scotland - they never conquered Scotland and thier victories were either due to their size or due to superior weapons (being a richer country). And also they were very cruel to the Scottish prisoners - NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF MR.Gunter Gimp !! Remember the line from Braveheart -  "" They may take our lives but they'll never take our FREEEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOOOOM "".<br/><br/>By the way I am not Scottish by blood - only by birth..but I do have some English ancestry..hehehe ! And I actually been living  in London for most of my life !"

I say this not only being Scotch-Irish (and hearing for generations about our hatred for the English) because I myself have no beef with the modern day English.  But this story, although perhaps inaccurate at times, is supposed to represent the overall spirit of the 1000-year old Celtic fight for their own identity.  To get caught up on all the details is missing the point. Mel Gibson did a gorgeous job making this film.  Not only portraying the people correctly (a time when life was short, hard and dirty) and the people's love for their homeland (the cinematography was gorgeous).  So although I am an American, this film still strikes a personal note with me, and reading the comments from people today in England speak that way sends a chill through my heart.

","Braveheart is entertaining but Mel Gibson makes a ""my character good, bad guys evil"" movie.

It's not so much the historical inaccuracies that bother me but rather the portrayal of the main character William Wallace.  There does not seem to be any depth to his character.  I'm sure the real William Wallace was a much more complex figure than he's made out to be in the movie. An absolutely brilliant actor to portray a flawed hero is Peter O'Toole as Lawrence of Arabia.

","Powerful, sweeping epic of freedom and oppression from actor/director Mel Gibson. In the late 13th century, Scotland is unjustly ruled by the tyranny of a cruel and ruthless English king (McGoohan). Gibson is a fierce and relentlessly passionate warrior who unites his countrymen and fights with all his heart and soul to try and gain freedom from the corruption and lawlessness of English rule, resulting in a series of big, grand, not to mention extremely bloody and brutal battle scenes. Not for the squeamish the film is long and extremely violent, but the dramatic aspect of the story is powerful and riveting, the battle scenes gripping and breathtaking, and Gibson's moving performance (with the aid of a superb supporting cast), is simply remarkable.

","I've just enjoyed watching this film on TV again.  Not up to the standard of films like El Cid (1961), Cyrano de Bergerac (1990) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962), but definitely worth watching, with great battle scenes, good jokes and a solid 'story'.<br/><br/>Is it history?  No.  Does that matter?  I think so.  No historical or biographical film can ever be accurate in every detail - you can only fit so many characters and events into 3 hours.  But to claim to be historical, as Braveheart does (see the end credits), a film must get the broad sweep right.  If you want to make a film about a real character like William Wallace then you have to stay closer to the facts.  If you want to make a fictional patriotic epic, then you make up a character and place him in a historical context - like Ivanhoe.<br/><br/>I guess my real worry is that many people expand their limited understanding of history through watching films.  I've spoken to people who now 'know' that American sailors helped win WWII by capturing an Enigma machine from a German submarine.<br/><br/>And one last note.  The character of Isabella of France would be worth a movie all on her own.  She married Edward II.  Had to vie for his attention with Piers Gaveston.  Had 4 children.  Was sent to France to negotiate with her brother Charles IV.  Refused to return.  Hooked up with another French noble.  Invaded England.  Installed her son as Edward III.  Ran the country for a few years while he came of age.  Had her husband murdered and several rivals executed.  Fell out with her son.  Negotiated a huge allowance, and lived very comfortably before retiring to a convent.  And people say real history isn't interesting enough."

","There is nothing in terms of epic filming that Braveheart does not deliver. It has all the important elements of a story rolled into one, and delivers them with scenes that make us care about the characters we see. The movie has passion, loyalty, betrayal, love, anger, patriotism and revenge, among many other traits, and each combines beautifully into the other. Gibson's performance is well worthy of higher acclaim, and proves his acting ability as well as his dedication to tell a good story with stirring scenes of notable quality, and superb direction. The story needed time and effort to be turned into a watchable movie, but there is never a dull moment for someone who wants to see a well made, well acted film. Each character has individualism equal to none, from the amusing, fiery Stephen, to Longshanks....who comes across as being a genuinely evil character. The sweeping score from Horner gives extra life to the majestic hills of Scotland and takes the viewer back, as though they are really there. The battle of Stirling Bridge is probably the finest in movie history for realism, and although Ridley Scott tried hard to match it in Gladiator, he fell well short of Gibson's mark. We care enough for Wallace to be sad as the movie closes, but his heroism wins the viewers over, and seeing his compatriates fight on at Bannockburn is a sign of the passion he had on his friends. If you have time alone to watch an epic, I advise you to watch this one.....you may be suprised at the emotions you go through yourself as the film develops!"

THERE'S A THIN BORDER BETWEEN POETICAL AND PATHETIC IN THIS KIND OF MOVIES AND ""BRAVEHEART"" DOESN'T GET OVER IT. That's one of the reasons why I'm talking about a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>Moreover I have to point out Mel Gibson's performance as actor first of all but also as director as well. It seems like he was born to play this role, a really great performance! He gives William Wallace strength and the wright measure at the same time. He leads the tension of the drama very well through his persuading way to follow and face the course of the events. Even the other characters in general are good and between them I appreciated Augus Mac Fadyen in the role of ROBERT BRUCE because he supports brilliantly Gibson: his character is nothing but the same kind of men Wallace is because scene by scene his belief in the value of freedom grows gradually, over his inner fear.<br/><br/>At last, a special quote goes to the final, the very end, I mean.

One of them stated that in Scotland, beside the William Wallace statue, there is another statue of Mel Gibson and people are leaving flowers on it because he made the movie and made Wallace famous again, I think that's their point. I disagree with that because it's not hard making a movie when you have millions of dollars.  Also, the other stated that Gibson, the director, was asked by a Scotsman why he didn't film the Battle of Stirling Bridge actually on the rebuilt bridge, Gibson said that the bridge would get in the way.  The Scotsman said, ""That's what the English found too.""  Why doesn't Gibson talk about Braveheart on any of his interviews and is, in my opinion, ashamed of it?  I think that's one of the points.

Not much was written about William Wallace from historians etc so Mel Gibson had to invent a lot of stuff which he did very well.

","Braveheart, when it came out, was exactly what movie goers everywhere had been waiting for. It came at the peak of the 90s, when all the truly great films of the decade (Silence Of The Lambs, Schindler's List, and The Shawshank Redemption) had been done and there wasn't much left to look forward to. Then Mel Gibson decided to do this historical war epic and was able to revitalize the hopes of ""the great epic"" genre in our time.<br/><br/>
I have to admit that I was skeptical at first of this film, mostly because it was directed by an aging star-actor and because it dealt with a historical subject and genre that is usually plagued by cheasy storylines and manipulation of characters. But I have to say that Mel Gibson pulled it off beautifully, despite the fact that it seemed more like his tribute film to himself where he would let the camera make love to him in almost every sequence. Inadvertently, he most likely put together a film that is rarely seen in cinema today. One with a genuine story that is easy to take in, emotionally charged once you let it in, and just beautiful to look at. There is a lot of heart in this film. In the story, in the characters, and in the cinematography. <br/><br/>Anyway you look at it, Braveheart is a film that stands out as a real winner, more than almost any other film in the 90s. And while it did borrow much from the filmic styles of the past, it might as well have done so as a symbol of what modern movies should be like. And what is more important is the fact that the story did not overexaggerate the ""greatness"" of its characters as much as most historically films do (i.e. Gandhi, The Hurricane). Instead, it gave the character of William Wallace a sense of realism, a sense that he was human too, which really made his goals seem more important to the benefit of not only his people but to the concept of humanity itself.<br/><br/>Braveheart doesn't have much complexity or any level of symbolic meaning to it. It's very simple and straight to the point. But it is done very artfully, both objectively and subjectively, as can be seen on the screen. Something like films used to be in the days when cinema was great as an art. Braveheart shows that movies can still achieve this goal of getting film done right. And all for the best, as Braveheart will definitely be remembered amongst those better films of our generation, and even amongst the better films of all time."

I first saw Braveheart when it came out in theatres in 1995, when I was thirteen years old.  From that time to this day, I have watched it countless times. Maybe it is the heart-pounding medieval war scenes.  Maybe it was the emotional bond between Wallace and the love of his life, Murron. Maybe it was the strong sense of revenge that was felt throughout the entire three hours, or the sensational views of Scotland and recreations of some of history's forgotten battles, or the display of ancient lifestyles, or Gibson's outstanding directing, or a combination of all these factors. It's funny to think that in 1995, Braveheart and Babe were in the same category for Best Picture."
"Alan Smithie","Null","0","2","19 April 2001"," An epic film about an epic story
","To begin with, perhaps the only thing that prevents the viewer from fully accepting this film at face value is the almost magical aura and mystique surrounding the Scottish hero. That apart, very films will ever come close to depicting the true anguish, pain, hatred and triumph that Mel Gibson portrays with such accuracy. Throughout the film, there is always a subplot under way, be it the plot to assassinate Wallace, the leper Scottish King or that of the Crowned Prince being homosexual, which only helps heighten the drama and tension. The battles are enormous, wonderfully staged and so realistically shown. And to top it all, there is the tyrannical king and the scheming queen-to-be, fighting against each other to establish what they think is right. The fact that this as a true story, makes one wonder what courage and strength of character William Wallace must've possessed. And to also, imagine the fact that this one man, led to freedom of Scotland after wanting to seek vengeance when the 'law of the land' caused his wife  to be killed, inspiring stuff, this all is. 'Gladiator' is very similar to 'Braveheart' in a lot of aspects and since both movies explore the triumph of the human spirit over a evil and oppressive rule, it makes the movie that much more grand. Perhaps, one word embodies the spirit of this awesome movie to the fullest: 'Freedom'... 'Braveheart', arguably, is one of the best period dramas ever made, and definitely one of the best cast, written, and choreographed films. The music is quite stirring, and the cinematography comes close to capturing the vast beauty of the locales. All in all, for me, this film is a 10 out of 10."

The movie just moved me.<br/><br/>The way Mel Gibson portrays his character, William Wallace, is just so perfect. I couldn't think of anyone else who could have portrayed the character that well.

Personally, I could really give a rats(bleep) if the film is accurate or not. To me that is not what film is all about. I have always believed the art of film was to take the audience to a new place, a new world unknown to us. I think ""Braveheart"" did a beautiful job of portraying this. So I'm fine with the fact that it is not accurate. Plus, very little is known of William Wallace anyways.<br/><br/>Another complaint is the fact that the englishman are portrayed as evil me with no heart. I think that is alright because the movie is done from the POV of a Scottsman. To the Scotts the Englishman are evil, heartless men.<br/><br/>This film is my number 2 favorite film of all time.

","An interesting epic which deserves its Oscars, but nevertheless a couple of things really annoyed me:<br/><br/>1) On many levels 'Braveheart' is a ripoff of 'Lion of the desert' (Anthony Quinn, Rod Steiger) - another war epic that deals with the libyan resistance against the Italian fascist regime. Here are some examples:<br/><br/>(minor spoilers)<br/><br/>-In both movies the star was an uncompromizable patroit, who knew how to outsmart the opponent, either by using guerilla tactics or on the battlefield.<br/><br/>-In both movies the invaders needed ""time"" to get their forces organized. (Some of the lines used are the exact same)<br/><br/>-In both movies the main character faced an unfair trial at the end of the movie<br/><br/>-Both movies ended with the execution of the main character<br/><br/>2) Too many historical inaccurate details<br/><br/>This really was a problem for me watching the movie. How can the audience tell what was real or not? 'Based on a true story' should have been 'Based on a poem by a blind man'.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I like Braveheart as much as the next guy, but maybe it is a bit overrated.

","Braveheart will be watched a thousand years from now because it exploits the power that film as a medium possesses. It does this in the two ways that are most unique and powerful to film: Visually and emotionally. Emotionally, it brings us firsthand into the human experience. Braveheart gives us a sampling of all of the most powerful human emotions most of us experience over a lifetime: love, fighting for what we believe in, family, loss, betrayal, sacrifice, and revenge to name just a few. It takes a lifetime of emotions and feeds them to us in a few hours. It also shows how very two sided man can be. Wallace, (Mel Gibson), is both caring and loving, while at the same time being capable of horrifically killing and maiming his fellow man... a ""murdering savage"", (a line from the film, I think.) In addition to all of this, it is set to beautiful surroundings, and the battle scenes make great use of cinematic techniques. Notice there is no weird film special effects, such as we are seeing overused in too many modern films.. (traffic, etc). No digital ""soft looking"" effects.... Just great plain old filmmaking."

","Normally, I see a movie once in a theater with very few exceptions.  If it's really good I'll rent or buy the video/DVD when it's available. However, somehow I ended up going to see Braveheart three times in the theater. The first time I saw it I was blown away by the power of the film.  However, it amazed me that on the second and even third viewings of the film, I was even MORE impressed with the film than I was at first.  That's very rare in my experience.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so effective are the numerous elements that work so great together.  The scriptwriting of Wallace and surprisingly good direction of Gibson were paced perfectly.  It's not everyday I can watch a 3-hour movie and not even once look at my watch.  The cinematography was beautiful.  Last but not least is the score of James Horner.  This is no doubt James Horner's best score (and even one of the few where he avoided obvious plagarism of other scores).  Whether it's orchestral, use of the Celtic instruments, or synthesizer, he gets inside of the fabric of the film to really become the heartbeat of the drama.  He is also careful to stay within the film, until you get to the climatic points of the movie where the music is allowed to soar, and he does so with brilliance.<br/><br/>Ironic that Horner lost the oscar to an aggressively overhyped Il Postino score... and then 3 years later wins the Oscar for similar, yet (in my opinion)inappropriate music in his own overhyped score of Titanic.  But it figures.  I once heard composer Elmer Bernstein say that he never expected to win his only Oscar for Thoroughly Modern Millie, but on numerous other occasions (e.g. To Kill a Mockingbird)he thought he had a better chance of winning.<br/><br/>One last aside, I knew somebody once who was acquainted with Randall Wallace (the writer).  Supposedly he shopped this script to several directors, and couldn't get any takers.  Then on a whim, he called Mel Gibson, who very generously offered to meet him for a meal and read the script.  The rest is history.  It just goes to show that if you're an aspiring artist in any field, don't give up."
"b1nd0x","Null","0","1","30 December 1998"," William Wallace is in many ways embodies the existentialist ideal
","""Every man dies; not every man truly lives.""  These words could just have easily been spoken by Sartre, or Camus.  Wallace is, like Ch√É¬© Guevara (notably praised by Sartre), a martyr.  He dies so that his country can be free.  Through his life his actions justify his existence.  Existentialism is at heart, I think, an effective use of free will.  While, according to this doctrine, we are not granted existence simply for being born, we are given free will.  It is the exercise of this free will which will or will not justify our existence.  Existentialism deals with your ideas, not so much what they are, but instead what you do about them.  Wallace's passion and zeal cause him to sacrifice his life for his beliefs.  He fought against nearly impossible odds, and, in many ways, lost (he did die painfully, he was betrayed, etc.)  But it is not that he fought against impossible odds, but that he _fought_.  In a world filled with complacency, Braveheart romanticizes action and thus courts the hero inside us all."

First of all I feel that it isn't that bad but it's no #3 Casablanca either.  I watch certain movies for certain things.  Casablanca and #6 Citizen Kane rely on how good their screenplays are because they don't have any spectacle.  Gladiator is being judged on its story, that is like judging Casablanca for its spectacle, it wouldn't be that good.  Gladiator relies on its spectacle and Casablanca relies on it's story but when a movie combines one of the greatest screenplays ever written with the best spectacle ever you get the best movie ever BRAVEHEART.  It has some great performances especially by Mel Gibson. This movie also has some of the best cinematography, editing, costumes, and art direction ever.  Plus the best, the BEST, score ever.  I would watch the movie just to listen to the music it is absolutly beautiful.  Randall Wallace wrote one of the best scripts ever and Mel directed it wonderfully. It also has some of the most famous scenes in movie history such as the speech before the battle of Stirling, the battle of Stirling, and the famous ending were he shouts FREEDOM.  This is a very rare movie, it's even romantic and has some funny parts, it combines a Casablanca like script and Gladiator spectacle, although without Braveheart, Gladiator probably would never had been made.  This is a MUST see for any movie fan, you haven't seen a movie till you have seen Braveheart.  This is one of the 6 movies that I have ever given my highest rating were I am so impressed I give it another star.

The acting was also superb, not only from the main leads, but also from supporting cast (most notably Brendan Gleeson as the fearless Hamish).

For a historical reenactment, I suggest that you look elsewhere, for Braveheart is not one of those films, but for a romance/action flick without any other value, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. It can be slow and even dragging at times, being that it was originally over 2 1/2 hrs long, but the almost realistic battle scenes do make up for it.<br/><br/>The one thing I didn't like was the one-dimensional characters; setting Wallace as ultimately good and Longshanks as ultimately villainous, etc. Sometimes during the film, Gibson's performance reminds me of a mechanical war-machine, rather than a human who can grow weary of fighting til the untimely end. It doesn't really give any dignity to the English royalty; making them out to be a bunch of spineless cowards, who would rather send their ladies to deal with their enemies, rather than facing them mono-e-mono. The story doesn't really explain why the queen's as fascinated with Wallace as she winds up being; it's almost like she's desperate for some well you know, after being married to a homosexual husband for so long, and dives in at the first moment. Oh and speaking thereof, since Longshanks' son is getting married, wouldn't he have seen the relationship between him and his in-the-closet lover severed before the marriage, instead of letting it go on, until suddenly he gets irritated with him, and flings him out the Castle's window? I think it would only be moral, but then again, what do I know?<br/><br/>Anyhow, in the long run, for entertainment, it's really pretty good.

I think it lies in the honor and integrity portrayed by William Wallace. Here is a guy fighting on just one thing - principle. And what's more is that he is willing to die for it without any compromise. It's a movie about sacrifice, commitment, patriotism, loyalty and faithfulness to a cause bigger than yourself. And that message resonated. By the end of the movie you personally respect and admire this character, and that emotional commitment only makes the movie more compelling.<br/><br/>That being said, the battle scenes are astounding. Literally thousands of people on the field...The strategy employed in the movie is interesting, the different alliances that develop further the plot and keep the movie from becoming dull. And, of course, Longshanks, the King, is convincingly portrayed as a cold, ruthless tyrant you want to hate.<br/><br/>A 9 outof 10."

","What can one say about a film such as this?  Either you've seen it and you realize the beauty contained within it, or you've been deprived.  I can't imagine anyone being the same after seeing this film.  Utterly exquisite. From the beginning, the plot is totally compelling yet entirely original: Mel Gibson goes crazy after someone messes with his woman.  Never before has Hollywood dared to gamble like this; yet the outcome speaks for itself. This movie cleaned house at the Academy Awards, I believe it took home Best Picture, Best Director, Best Costumes, Best Fight Scene, Best Kiss, Best Musical Score, and Best Animal Training. The movie's three hour running time was hardly noticeable, and the violence was captured in a very discreet fashion.  For instance, when that one guy gets his head crushed with a big hammer-looking thing, you hardly can hear his screams after the first fifteen seconds or so.  Excellent discretion. Mel Gibson definitely won himself a fan for life with this movie.  I can't wait until The Patriot comes out (set during one of those old wars where they used cannons, someone messes with Mel Gibson's family, and he goes crazy.)  I guess I'll just have to keep watching my Lethal Weapon videos until then.  (You know, those movies where they mess with Mel Gibson's family, and he goes crazy?)  Keep up the good work, Mel."

","I didn't care very much about this movie, but the one thing I cared about was the disgusting and stupid notion the movie had to present the message that when a man is interested in other men he is a sissy weakling. They always talk in this movie about freedom etc, and then comes this. Can it get more stupid?? Why didn't they present a fighter or something like this, the standard masculine type of men presented in this movie, and showed that he is same-gender liking. Don't waste your time on this movie, it's a fake and it's a big lie."

","There's a lot to love about Braveheart: an engaging, sweeping story, amazing battle scenes, a host of fantastic supporting performances and an achingly beautiful soundtrack that should have definitely won the Best Score Oscar.<br/><br/>
However, there's one reason why I'd never ever call this movie a classic, and for me, the problem lies with Mel Gibson. I'm not saying his performance is weak or inefficient: Gibson's Wallace is a passionate leader as well as a masterful swordsman. But, through the entire long run of the movie, I could never shake off the feeling that the man on the screen wasn't a medieval Scotsman, but a 20th century actor wearing a rather silly-looking wig. In short, I simply didn't believe in the main character, I could never believe that it was William Wallace up there on the big screen. I realised it even more distinctly after I've seen 'Gladiator' with Russell Crowe, now that, to me, was a 100% credible performance in a historical epic. And since I could never believe in Wallace, I couldn't particularly care about the character and what was happening to him. I wasn't moved or saddened during the execution scene: to me it was simply a grisly affair that stroke no emotional chords whatsoever. Because of that, I would give Braveheart 7.5 out of 10, but I'd give it full 10 if only the main character felt more real and credible to me."

","It baffled me, at first, to discover that there were actually people who didn't like this film. How could anyone resist being swept away by this story? Well, I realize now, you can't make everyone happy, because there will always be people who are determined not to let you make them happy.<br/><br/>When ""Braveheart"" hit the theaters in 1995, it was inevitable that Scots and Irish would love it, and the English would hate it. English reviews of this film were hysterically shrill. Much was made of the ""historical inaccuracies,"" but what did they expect--a $70 million documentary? Besides, the historical records of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce are so sparse and uncertain, historians and filmmakers alike are free to take great liberties in reconstructing the story just about any way they see fit. The indignation that the English feel when watching this film is probably similar to what the Scottish, Irish and Welsh feel when they study history and realize that the saga of their people has been nothing but a centuries-long struggle against English oppression. The U.S. senate has issued official apologies to blacks, Indians, Hawaiians and even the Japanese. A similar gesture from the Queen or the House of Lords might allay a lot of bad feelings.<br/><br/>In America the film was accorded the same treatment as any other independent film. It received a lot of smug reviews about ""cute guys in kilts"" and was soundly beaten at the box office by the insipid ""Independence Day."" Most reviewers are industry toadies who consider it a breach of professional protocol to say anything nice about an Indie. Anyhow, ""Braveheart"" won a half-a-dozen Academy Awards, while ""Independence Day"" was forgotten as soon as the advertising campaign ended.<br/><br/>There is also the bias against a Hollywood stud-muffin having the audacity to direct and star in his own film. What right does Mr. Lethal Weapon have trying to establish himself as a serious artist? But the fact is--as many people have said before--Gibson was the perfect man to direct this film. How would ""Braveheart"" have turned out in the hands of, say, Scorceses or Spielberg? (As a really funny mental exercise, try and imagine Tarantino doing this film. ""I'm gonna get medieval on your arse!"")<br/><br/>And then there were the feminists who denounced the film for being Testosteronally Challenged.<br/><br/>One remarkable thing about ""Braveheart"" is how little dialogue there is in this 3-hour film. The screenplay available on the Net is only 13 pages long! To tell a fairly complex tale in so few words is just good writing by Randall Wallace. But all some people can talk about is how unrealistic Wallace's portrayal of his namesake is. But that's the whole idea: ""Braveheart"" isn't realistic; it's idealistic.<br/><br/>And what's wrong with that?"

","When Mel Gibson announced that he was to make Braveheart, a drama based on the life of the Scots hero William Wallace, the movie world scratched their head in disbelief.<br/><br/>Was this the same Mel Gibson who, up to that point, had directed The Man Without A Face and little else? The same actor who made a string of hit and miss Lethal Weapon movies?<br/><br/>Admittedly, he gave a fine turn in Hamlet (1990) but the thought of him in a kilt with a Scottish accent left many of us wondering if he was setting himself up for a huge fall.<br/><br/>But Mel is no fool.<br/><br/>With a polished script by Randal Wallace, he donned a mullet wig - looking suspiciously like the scalp of one hit wonder Billy Ray Cyrus - and proved the critics wrong by delivering one of the greatest historical epics ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>You want impressive battle scenes? Braveheart has them in abundance - the recreated battle of Stirling Bridge was recently in the top 100 of classic movie scenes according to one Sunday broadsheet poll. <br/><br/>What about a wealth of acting talent? How does Patrick McGoohan, Bond babe Sophie Marceau and the late Ian Bannen sound? A rousing soundtrack? Titanic's James Horner takes a bow with his stirring orchestral work.<br/><br/>In case your history is a little rusty, here's the lowdown: William Wallace (Gibson) was a hero who fought for Scotland's freedom in the late 13th century, intent on defeating the forces of King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan), the British monarch who had declared himself king of Scotland upon the former ruler's death.<br/><br/>Much of the early film concentrates on Wallace's love for Murron (Catherine McCormack). That creates a likeable hero whose eventual loss gives him motive for the carnage that ensues. <br/><br/>As Scotland's noble folk clash over land and riches, William Wallace stands for the individual, and earns much kudos for being ready to die for what he believes in.<br/><br/>While Gibson supplies his usual dose of charisma by the cartload, an aged Patrick McGoohan, best known from The Prisoner, is barely recognisable under a white beard. <br/><br/>His Edward the Longshanks is one of the greatest screen villains in history; intelligent, equally as charming as Wallace and more ruthless than a dozen Bond villains. <br/><br/>Pity the poor fool who crosses him - or even makes a passing comment - as they soon manage to find the fastest route from the top of his castle to the courtyard floor.<br/><br/>Sophie Marceau, the French actress from The World is Not Enough, plays Princess Isabelle, while Blighty's own Catherine McCormack is attractive and credible as Wallace's beloved Murron.<br/><br/>Braveheart is littered with fine points and Hollywood wasn't too slow in recognising Gibson's achievements, awarding him and his crew five Oscars.<br/><br/>The movie's success left box office tills ringing around the world and it wasn't long before the $72million budget was justified with a $202million worldwide gross. <br/><br/>Braveheart inspired a host of imitators in the five years since its release, including a robotic version of the battle scene in last summer's The Phantom Menace and a hilarious take off in South Park, with Chef standing in as the blue-faced hero.<br/><br/>Amid the blood and carnage here, star spotters should keep an eye out for Alun Armstrong - seen recently in the Yorkshire Ripper drama, This is Personal; ex-Coronation Street bad guy Steven Billington (Greg Kelly) as the ill-fated Phillip and Peter Mullan from acclaimed Ken Loach drama, My Name is Joe.<br/><br/>It's a long film so you'll need plenty of cushions and the humble old telly just can't compete with those glorious landscapes. But with that taken as red, forget about what's missing from the movie and revel in that dialogue.<br/><br/>If you can only see one scene, make sure it's the moment with William Wallace riding back and forth in front of his troops waxing lyrical in an attempt to inspire his forces.<br/><br/>Watch, listen and feel the hairs rise on the back of your neck as he makes his plea: `Ay, fight and you may die, run and you'll live. At least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom.'"
